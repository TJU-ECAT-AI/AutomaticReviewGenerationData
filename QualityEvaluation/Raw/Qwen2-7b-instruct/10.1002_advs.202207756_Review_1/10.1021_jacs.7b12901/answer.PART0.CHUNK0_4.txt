[1] "The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are manifold. One major challenge lies in the inherent complexity of the Ga species present in the catalyst, which can exist in various forms such as Ga(III), Ga(IV), or Ga(V) states."
[2] "In situ or operando characterization techniques play a crucial role in addressing these challenges by providing real-time information about the catalyst's structure and reactivity under actual reaction conditions."
[3] "These techniques allow researchers to monitor the dynamic changes in the catalyst's composition and activity, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."
