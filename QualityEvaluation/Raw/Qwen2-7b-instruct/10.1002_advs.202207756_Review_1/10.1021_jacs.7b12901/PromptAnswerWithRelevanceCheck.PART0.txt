Answer: The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are related to the dynamic nature of gallium species and their interactions with the ZSM-5 framework. In situ or operando characterization techniques are crucial for overcoming these challenges as they allow real-time monitoring of the catalyst's behavior during PDH reactions. These techniques provide insights into the structure-activity relationships by revealing how the Ga species change over time and under varying reaction conditions. This understanding is essential for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the efficiency of PDH processes.
