          The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve the complexity and dynamic nature of gallium (Ga) species present within the catalyst, the complexity of the Ga species present in the catalyst, and the complexity of the Ga species present within the catalyst structure. In situ or operando characterization techniques are instrumental in addressing these challenges by offering real-time insights into the catalyst's structure and reactivity during PDH reactions, thereby advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.
