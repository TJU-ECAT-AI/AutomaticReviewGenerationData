[1] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]."
[2] "However, we directly observed the formation of gallium hydrides by DRIFT measurements."
[3] "Moreover, DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO gave insight into coordina- tively unsaturated gallium species."
[4] "Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent."
[5] "The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydro- gen."
