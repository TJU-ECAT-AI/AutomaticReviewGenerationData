[1] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]."
[2] "However, we directly observed the formation of gallium hydrides by DRIFT measurements."
[3] "Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent."
[4] "The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include understanding the dynamic nature of Ga species within the catalyst matrix and their interactions with the PDH process. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the structural and chemical changes of Ga species during the PDH process. Specifically, these techniques enable researchers to monitor the formation, transformation, and distribution of Ga species, which is crucial for optimizing the catalyst performance and understanding the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.
