[1] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]."
[2] "However, we directly observed the formation of gallium hydrides by DRIFT measurements."
[3] "Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent."
[4] "The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydrogen."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve understanding the detailed chemistry of gallium within the zeolite structure. Operando characterization techniques, such as in situ DRIFT spectroscopy, play a crucial role in overcoming these challenges. By directly observing the formation of gallium hydrides and identifying the coordination states of gallium species, these techniques allow for a more precise understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中镓的物种化状态的主要挑战涉及理解Zeolite结构内的镓化学性质。原位表征技术，如原位DRIFT光谱法，在克服这些挑战方面发挥着关键作用。通过直接观察镓氢化物的形成并识别镓物种的配位状态，这些技术允许对Ga/ZSM-5催化剂下PDH条件下的结构活性关系有更精确的理解。
