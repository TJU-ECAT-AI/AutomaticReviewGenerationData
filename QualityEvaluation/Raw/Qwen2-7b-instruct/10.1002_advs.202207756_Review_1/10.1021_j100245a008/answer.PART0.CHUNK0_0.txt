<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses the existence of an "H-bonded" association between adsorbed oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) molecules and hydroxyl (-OH) groups on a silica surface. It also suggests that a similar hydrogen bonding competitive complexation process regulates the effectiveness of fluorocarbons. Furthermore, the impact of hydrogen bond donors on the glass transition temperature of linear alcohols is noted through observed effects.

文献讨论了吸附氧（O2）和氮（N2）分子与硅酸盐表面上的羟基（-OH）团之间的“氢键结合”关联。它还提出了一种类似的氢键竞争络合过程调节氟碳化合物的有效性。此外，通过观察效果，指出了氢键供体对线性醇的玻璃转变温度的影响。
