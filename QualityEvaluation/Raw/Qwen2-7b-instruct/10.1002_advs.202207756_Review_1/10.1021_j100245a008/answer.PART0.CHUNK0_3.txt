The document discusses the presence of an "H-bonded" association between adsorbed O2 and N2 with the -OH groups of a silica surface. It also mentions the control of potency in fluorocarbons through a comparable hydrogen bond (HBB) competitive complexation process. Additionally, it highlights the effects of hydrogen bond donors on the glass transition temperature of linear alcohols. These findings contribute to the understanding of structure-activity relationships in catalytic systems, particularly in the context of anesthetics and PDH conditions.

文献讨论了吸附于二氧化硅表面的O2和N2与-OH基团之间的“氢键化”相互作用。它还提到了通过类似的氢键（HBB）竞争性络合过程控制氟碳化合物的活性。此外，它强调了氢键供体对线性醇的玻璃转变温度的影响。这些发现有助于理解催化体系的结构-活性关系，特别是在麻醉剂和PDH条件下。
