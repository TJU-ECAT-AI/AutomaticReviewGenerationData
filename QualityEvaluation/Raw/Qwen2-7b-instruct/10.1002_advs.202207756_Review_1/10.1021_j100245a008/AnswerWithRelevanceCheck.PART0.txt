          The literature discusses the existence of an "H-bonded" association between adsorbed oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) molecules with hydroxyl (-OH) groups on a silica surface, suggesting a comparable hydrogen bonding (HBB) competitive complexation process that regulates the potency of fluorocarbons. Additionally, it notes the effects of hydrogen bond donors on the glass transition temperature of linear alcohols.
