[2] "However, Ga speciation under reaction condi- tions remains controversial."
[3] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[4] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve the complexity and heterogeneity of the Ga species that can form upon reduction, especially in relation to the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite and the Ga/Al ratio of the catalyst. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy, contribute significantly to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the dynamic processes occurring within the catalyst during the PDH reaction. By monitoring the changes in the infrared spectra of the catalyst under reaction conditions, researchers can identify the formation, consumption, and transformation of various Ga species, including Ga hydrides and Ga+H+ pairs. This approach enables a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, offering crucial information on how the composition and properties of the catalyst influence its performance in PDH reactions.
