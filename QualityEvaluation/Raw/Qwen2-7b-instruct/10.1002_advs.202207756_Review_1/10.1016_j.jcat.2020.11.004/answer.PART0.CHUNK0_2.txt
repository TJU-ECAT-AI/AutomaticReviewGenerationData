[1] "However, Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."
[2] "A number of Ga species, such as Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga (OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, have been proposed to form after the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 based on several experimental and computational techniques [911,24,2628]."
[3] "One possible explanation is the formation of Ga oligomers in the zeolite micropores which become more energetically favorable than exchanging with the rest of BAS, as suggested by Bell and coworkers [11]."
[4] "These diverging trends for the Ga hydride formation and the BAS consumption indicate that not all Ga species exchanged with the BAS are capable of forming Ga hydrides upon reduction."
[5] "This provides the first direct experimental evidence that the speciation of exchanged Ga in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 is dependent on the Al density in the zeolite."
[6] "Importantly, the threshold Ga/Al ratio (0.13) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15) at which this transition occurs coincides with the point at which the combined GaHx band area levels off as Ga loading increases."
[7] "This result then verifies that the reactivity of isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair species are quite different."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include the controversy surrounding the nature of Ga species involved, the complexity of the Ga-H bonding network, and the difficulty in distinguishing between various Ga species through conventional characterization techniques. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly by providing real-time insights into the structural changes occurring within the catalyst during the reaction, thereby enabling a more accurate understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. These techniques allow for the observation of the dynamics of Ga species, such as their migration, interaction with acid sites, and formation of hydrides, under actual reaction conditions, thus offering valuable information on the active sites and their reactivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的Ga物种定位存在争议，主要挑战包括区分各种Ga物种的复杂性，以及在常规表征技术下难以确定Ga物种的状态。原位或操作中表征技术通过提供实时信息，在反应过程中催化剂内部结构的变化，有助于更准确地理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的结构-活性关系。这些技术允许观察Ga物种的动力学，如它们的迁移、与酸中心的相互作用和形成氢化物，从而提供有关活性位点及其反应性的有价值信息。
