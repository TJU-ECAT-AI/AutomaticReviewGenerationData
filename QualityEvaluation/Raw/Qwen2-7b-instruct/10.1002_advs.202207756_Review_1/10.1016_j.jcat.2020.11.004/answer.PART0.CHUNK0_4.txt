1. Early studies indicated that isolated Ga+ ions dominate in Ga/H-ZSM-5 regardless of gallium loading and reducing gas used. This is consistent with recent findings by Schreiber et al. who identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species through DRIFTS on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5.

2. Hensen and colleagues discovered Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/ H-ZSM-5, suggesting potential involvement in PDH reactions.

3. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites act as active centers for PDH, with activity unaffected by Ga/Al ratio. Their claim was supported by FTIR spectroscopy, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis.

4. Not all Brnsted acid sites (BAS) can be exchanged by Ga species even at high Ga/Al ratios during reduction.

5. As the Ga/Al ratio increases, the fraction of BAS that remains after Ga exchange decreases from 75% to 80%.

6. Properly conducting pyridine experiments on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples under vacuum conditions avoids re-oxidation and provides accurate BAS densities.

7. In-situ FTIR spectroscopy is used to observe the formation of Ga hydrides on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with various Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios.

1. 早期的研究表明，在Ga/H-ZSM-5中，孤立的Ga+离子不论镓装载量和使用的还原气体如何，都占据主导地位。这与Schreiber等人的最新发现一致，他们通过DRIFTS在还原后的Ga/ H-ZSM-5上发现了Ga单氢化物和双氢化物物种。

2. Hensen及其同事发现在还原后的Ga/ H-ZSM-5上存在Ga单氢化物和双氢化物物种，这可能与PDH反应有关。

3. Phadke等人提出单个[GaH]2+物种是PDH反应的活性中心，其活性不受Ga/Al比的影响。他们的结论得到了FTIR光谱、NH3-TPD结果以及热力学稳定性的支持。

4. 即使在高Ga/Al比下进行还原处理，也不能完全交换所有Brnsted酸位点（BAS）。

5. 随着Ga/Al比的增加，剩余BAS的比例从75%降低至80%。

6. 在真空条件下正确进行吡啶实验，避免催化剂重新氧化，可以获得准确的BAS密度。

7. 应用原位FTIR光谱技术监测具有不同Si/Al和Ga/Al比的还原后Ga/H-ZSM-5样品上形成的Ga氢化物。

8. 第八个问题没有相关的引述。
