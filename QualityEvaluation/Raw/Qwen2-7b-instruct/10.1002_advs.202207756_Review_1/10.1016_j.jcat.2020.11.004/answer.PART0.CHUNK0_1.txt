[1] "However, Ga speciation under reaction condi- tions remains controversial."
[2] "We hypothesize that paired BAS sites are preferentially exchanged with Ga+, leading to the formation of Ga+H+ pair sites, while the exchange of isolated BAS form isolated Ga+ species."
[3] "The dependence of GaHx bands on both the Si/Al ratios and the Ga/Al ratios shows that Ga speciation varies with BAS density in the zeo- lite."
[4] "Using water as a probe molecule, we show that isolated Ga+ and Ga+H+ pair sites have distinct properties, i.e., the former can be easily oxidized by water at 150 C to form GaOOH species, while the latter is inactive under the same con- ditions."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include the controversial nature of the speciation process, especially concerning the identity of the active sites and the reaction mechanism. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly by offering direct experimental evidence of the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. For instance, in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy allows researchers to systematically investigate the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with varying Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios. These techniques help overcome the challenge by providing real-time insights into the interactions and transformations of Ga species within the zeolite framework, thus enhancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的Ga物种化状态存在争议，主要挑战包括确定活性位点的性质和反应机制。原位或操作过程表征技术通过提供直接实验证据，显著地推动了这些催化系统结构-活性关系的理解。例如，原位透射傅里叶变换红外光谱法允许研究人员系统地研究具有不同Si/Al和Ga/Al比的Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种化状态。这些技术通过提供实时信息来克服这一挑战，深入了解Ga物种在沸石微孔内的相互作用和转变，从而增强我们对PDH反应机制内在机制的理解。
