2 Ga-Containing Zeolites in PDH elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structureactivity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C). Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating a Ga salt, for example, Ga(NO3)3, on the H-ZSM-5 support, followed by calcination in the air. At this point, Ga in the as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is typically at its highest oxidation state, that is, +3. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are then reduced in an H2 atmosphere at the reaction temperature before the feed is introduced. Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH.
Understanding Ga speciation on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is central to mechanistic understanding because the reaction pathway depends on the structure of the active site. PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally. Computational modeling plays a pivotal role in mapping out reaction pathways, and the reliability of the predicted pathways depends on the assumed catalytic structures.

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the high operating temperatures that lead to the short-lived nature of reaction intermediates, making them difficult to detect experimentally. Additionally, the catalyst preparation process involves impregnating a Ga salt on the H-ZSM-5 support and subsequent calcination, resulting in Ga species at their highest oxidation state (+3) in the as-synthesized catalyst. To overcome these challenges, in situ or operando characterization techniques are crucial. These techniques allow for the determination of Ga speciation during the reduction process, providing insights into the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的Ga物种化是理解结构活性关系的前提。然而，这远非易事。PDH产生氢气，因此催化剂在还原环境中操作（通常高于500°C）。Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂通过将Ga盐（如Ga(NO3)3）浸渍在H-ZSM-5支持上并随后在空气中煅烧制备。在此阶段，合成的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的Ga通常处于最高氧化状态，即+3。然后，在引入进料之前，在反应温度下用H2气氛对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂进行还原。因此，仅通过原位或操作中进行的表征或至少是在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5上进行的表征才能提供有关PDH过程中催化剂上Ga物种的信息。理解在PDH条件下还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5上的Ga物种化对于机制理解至关重要，因为反应路径取决于活性位点的结构。PDH在Ga/H-ZSM-5上发生在高于500°C的高温下，因此反应中间体寿命短，难以实验检测。计算模型在绘制反应路径方面发挥着关键作用，预测路径的可靠性取决于假设的催化结构。
