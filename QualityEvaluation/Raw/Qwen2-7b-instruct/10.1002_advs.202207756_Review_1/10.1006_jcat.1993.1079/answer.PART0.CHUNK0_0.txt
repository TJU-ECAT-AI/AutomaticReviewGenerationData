Specifically, they promote the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and thus inhibit undesired cracking reactions.
Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels.
These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5.
Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.
This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites.

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the dynamic nature of Ga species, which undergo reduction and oxidation depending on the reaction conditions. In-situ or operando characterization techniques are essential because they allow for real-time monitoring of the chemical state of Ga, providing insights into its role and activity during PDH reactions. Without such techniques, conclusions about the nature of the catalytic sites might be misleading due to the transient and reversible states of Ga species.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的特性主要面临的挑战包括Ga物种的动态性质，它们根据反应条件经历还原和氧化。原位或操作过程中的表征技术至关重要，因为它们可以实时监测Ga的化学状态，提供关于其作用和活动期间PDH反应的见解。没有这样的技术，关于催化位点性质的结论可能会误导性地得出，因为Ga物种的状态是瞬变且可逆的。
