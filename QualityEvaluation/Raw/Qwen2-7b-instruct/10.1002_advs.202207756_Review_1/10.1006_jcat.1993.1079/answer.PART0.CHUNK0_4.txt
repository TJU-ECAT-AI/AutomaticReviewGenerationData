[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
[2] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
[3] "Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."

The primary challenge in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions is understanding the dynamic changes in the chemical state of gallium. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information on the chemical form of Ga species during the PDH process. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems, which might be misleading when solely relying on pre- and post-reaction characterization methods.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，解释Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中镓物种的性质的主要挑战是如何理解镓元素在化学状态上的动态变化。原位或操作方法的表征技术有助于克服这些挑战，通过提供PDH过程中镓物种化学形式的实时信息，从而更准确地评估这些催化体系的结构-活性关系。这可能与仅依赖前反应和后反应表征方法得出的结论有所不同。
