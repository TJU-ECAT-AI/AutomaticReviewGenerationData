The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the dynamic changes in Ga species and their oxidation states, which occur during the catalytic process. In situ or operando characterization techniques are crucial in overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information about the chemical state of Ga, which cannot be accurately deduced solely from pre- and post-reaction characterization methods. This approach enables a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，确定Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的挑战主要在于Ga物种及其氧化状态在催化过程中发生的动态变化。原位或操作方法是克服这些挑战的关键，因为它能够提供实时信息，关于Ga的化学状态，这不能仅通过前反应和后反应表征方法准确推断出来。这种方法可以更深入地理解这些催化体系的结构-活性关系。
