Specifically, they promote the recombinative desorption of H-adatoms as H2 and thus inhibit undesired cracking reactions.
Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels.
These hydride species are driven to release molecular hydrogen by the high surface hydrogen fugacities that develop during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5.
Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions.
This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites.

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the dynamic nature of Ga species which reduce at lower temperatures, forming highly dispersed monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels. These species are driven to release molecular hydrogen due to high surface hydrogen fugacities during PDH on H-ZSM5. The reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 at room temperature in flowing H2, indicating that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions. In-situ techniques are crucial for understanding the chemical form of catalytic sites, as the exclusive use of pre- and post-reaction characterization can lead to misleading conclusions about the nature of the catalytic sites.

在丙烷脱氢化（PDH）条件下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的解析主要挑战包括：在较低温度下，Ga物种会发生还原，形成高度分散的单体氢化物物种，与沸石通道中的基本氧原子配位。这些物种由于PDH过程中H-ZSM5表面氢分压的提高而被驱动释放分子氢。当样品冷却至室温并在流动H2中时，还原的Ga物种会重新氧化为Ga+3，这表明只有在反应条件下才存在活性的Ga形式。原位技术对于理解催化位点的化学形式至关重要，因为仅使用反应前后的表征可能会导致关于催化位点性质的误导性结论。
