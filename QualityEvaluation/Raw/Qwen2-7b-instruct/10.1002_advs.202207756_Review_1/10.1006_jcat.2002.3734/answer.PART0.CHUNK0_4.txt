[1] "The interaction of H2 with Ga/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and GaPd/SiO2 catalysts has been investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron and transmission infrared spectroscopies (XPS and FTIR)."
[2] "The precur- sors, calcined in dry air at 673 K, yield PdO and Ga2O3."
[3] "Upon ex- posure to hydrogen reduction at 423 K, the fraction of reduced gal- lium ions (Gaδ+ cations, δ < 2) was 16% on Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2,whereas no Ga3+ was reduced over Ga/SiO2 materials."
[4] "The impact of hydrogen activation in the hydrogenation of carbon oxides over these gallium-containing catalysts was not discussed in the mentioned works, probably because Ga is not as good a hydrogenation catalyst as the noble metals are and, actually, is not a widely employed catalytic element."
[5] "The intensity of the band at 3000 cm1 increased with the total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on unpromoted Pd/SiO2."
[6] "As for the other cata- lysts, it can be readily inferred that the only requisite for its development is the presence of gallium, because the band intensity is proportional to the Ga weight loading."
[7] "We assumed that this band is involved in the development or evolution of the main infrared signal at 2020 cm1, discussed in the following paragraphs."
[8] "The origin of the 2020-cm1 band was attributed to galliumhydrogen bond formation and was assigned to the stretching mode of Gaδ+H, ν(GaH)."
