[1] "For example, there has been steadily growing interest in the investigation of the nature of the active sites on ZSM-5 zeolites modified with gallium, because aromatization of light alkanes can be accomplished by these catalysts (15)."
[2] "More recently, deep effects on the catalytic properties for achieving highly effective conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable compounds using composite catalysts which incorporate gallium oxide(s) and precious metals have been reported (1113)."
[3] "The impact of hydrogen activation in the hydrogenation of carbon oxides over these gallium-containing catalysts was not discussed in the mentioned works, probably because Ga is not as good a hydrogenation catalyst as the noble metals are and, actually, is not a widely employed catalytic element (1113)."
[4] "In this context, it is imperative to balance the knowledge of the chemistry of all the elemental components of a catalytic material, starting from molecular activation processes."
[5] "The interaction of H2 with Ga/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and GaPd/SiO2 catalysts has been investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron and transmission infrared spectroscopies (XPS and FTIR)."
[6] "The presence of these two Ga 3d lines, from now on defined as the high- and low-binding-energy components (HBE and LBE, respectively) of the Ga 3d signal, was consistently observed in all the gallium-containing catalysts that had been reduced at least once at 723 K."
[7] "The percentage of reduced Pd and Ga, defined as [Pd0/(Pd0 + Pd2+)] × 100 and [Gaδ+/(Gaδ+ + Ga3+)] × 100, respectively, are reported in Table 2."
[8] "The intensity of the band at 3000 cm1 increased with the total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on unpromoted Pd/SiO2."
[9] "This band could be reliably measured against the background above approximately 500 K (2027 cm1)."
[10] "The band at 3670 cm1 was assigned to the OH stretching mode in GaOH or SiO(H)Ga, in agreement with other reported values (4042)."
[11] "The intensity of this band grew up until 660 K and then leveled off at higher temperatures (2015 cm1)."
[12] "The band position shifted from 2026 to 2015 cm1 as the gallium loading went from 2.6 to 9.2 wt%."
[13] "The ν(GaH) mode for gallanes lies between 2050 and 1800 cm1."
[14] "To our knowledge, these authors reported the first and onlyevidencebyadirectmethodofgalliumhydrogenbond formation on a material surface, which we corroborate on the surface of our catalysts."
[15] "This finding has implications for the design of new catalysts that could efficiently convert CO2 to valuable products."
