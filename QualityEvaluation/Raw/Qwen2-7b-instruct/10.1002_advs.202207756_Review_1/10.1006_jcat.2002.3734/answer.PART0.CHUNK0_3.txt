[1] "The interaction of H2 with Ga/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and GaPd/SiO2 catalysts has been investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron and transmission infrared spectroscopies (XPS and FTIR)."
[2] "The precur- sors, calcined in dry air at 673 K, yield PdO and Ga2O3."
[3] "Upon ex- posure to hydrogen reduction at 423 K, the fraction of reduced gal- lium ions (Gaδ+ cations, δ < 2) was 16% on Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2,whereas no Ga3+ was reduced over Ga/SiO2 materials."
[4] "The effects of the high-temperature reduction treatments over the supported gallium oxide appear fairly well in the XPS spectra: So, two shoulders for the Ga 3d core-level signal, which are partially overlapped with the O 2s photo- electron peak, can be already individualized upon reducing the PdGa40 precursor at 573 K (Fig. 1)."
[5] "Other alternatives that might account for the appearance of the LBE band in our reduced GaPd/SiO2 materials are the formation of metallic gallium and/or PdGa alloy, which cannot be ruled out completely for at least three reasons:"
[6] "Quantification of the extent of Pd and Ga reduction was done after deconvoluting the Pd 3d and Ga 3d sig- nals. The percentages of reduced Pd and Ga, defined as [Pd0/(Pd0 + Pd2+)] × 100 and [Gaδ+/(Gaδ+ + Ga3+)] × 100,respectively, are reported in Table 2."
[7] "As for Si 2p photoelectron line, the O 2s peak was typical of silicon oxide (BE = 25.0 eV, FWHM = 4.2 eV) (20)."
[8] "The intensity of the band at 3000 cm1 increased with the total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on unpromoted Pd/SiO2."
[9] "Once at 723 K, it was possible to observe only a band at 3670 cm1 in the gallium-containing catalysts (Fig. 3)."
[10] "Figure 4 shows the formation of an infrared band at ap- proximately 2020 cm1 on prereduced GaPd/SiO2 with the highest total gallium content (PdGa80), upon heating the catalyst under flowing hydrogen."
[11] "Three aspects of all spectra we judge to be critical to the unambiguous iden- tification of this assignment. The first one is related to the wavenumber position of this band when compared to molecular model systems, the second one to the relation- ship between the content of Gaδ+ species and the intensity of the ν(GaH) band, and the last to the wavenumber posi- tion of the peaks when performing HD isotopic exchange experiments, as follows:"
