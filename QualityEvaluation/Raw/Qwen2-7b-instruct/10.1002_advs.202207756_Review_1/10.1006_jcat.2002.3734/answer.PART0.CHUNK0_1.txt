[1] "For example, there has been steadily growing interest in the investigation of the nature of the active sites on ZSM-5 zeolites modified with gallium, because aromatization of light alkanes can be accomplished by these catalysts (15)."
[2] "In like manner, although it is well-known that zinc oxide is able to activate dissociatively the hydrogen molecule (1416), this point has not been further emphasized or considered in studies of methanol synthesis on the traditional Cu/ZnO catalysts, as it has been in the case of propane dehydrocyclization on Ga/HZMS-5 (710)."
[3] "As for Si 2p photoelectron line, the O 2s peak was typical of silicon oxide (BE = 25.0 eV, FWHM = 4.2 eV) (20)."
[4] "We can then consider that the contribution from gallium oxides to this signal was negligible."
[5] "The intensity of the band at 3000 cm1 increased with the total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on unpromoted Pd/SiO2."
[6] "The band at 3670 cm1 was assigned to the OH stretching mode in GaOH or SiO(H)Ga, in agreement with other reported values (4042)."
[7] "The band position shifted from 2026 to 2015 cm1 as the gallium loading went from 2.6 to 9.2 wt%."
[8] "To our knowledge, these authors reported the first and only direct method of gallium hydrogen bond formation on a material surface, which we corroborate on the surface of our catalysts."

1. There has been a growing interest in studying the active sites of ZSM-5 zeolites modified with gallium due to their ability to aromatize light alkanes. 

2. Zinc oxide, known for activating dissociative hydrogen molecule, has not been extensively considered in methanol synthesis studies on traditional Cu/ZnO catalysts, unlike in propane dehydrocyclization on Ga/HZMS-5.

3. The O 2s peak in the Si 2p photoelectron line was characteristic of silicon oxide, indicating negligible contribution from gallium oxides.

4. The band at 3000 cm1 was absent on unpromoted Pd/SiO2 catalysts, indicating its relation to gallium loading.

5. The band at 3670 cm1 was identified as the OH stretching mode in GaOH or SiO(H)Ga, consistent with reported values.

6. The position of the band at 2020 cm1 shifted from 2026 to 2015 cm1 as the gallium loading increased.

7. The 2020 cm1 band was attributed to gallium hydrogen bond formation, corroborating findings on material surfaces.

1. 对于改性的ZSM-5沸石中镓的活性位点的研究兴趣正在增长，因为这些催化剂可以实现轻烷烃的异构化。

2. 锌氧化物由于能够激活离解氢分子而广为人知，但在传统Cu/ZnO催化剂上的甲醇合成研究中，这一点没有被进一步强调或考虑，这与Ga/HZMS-5上丙烷脱氢环化的情况不同。

3. Si 2p光电子线中的O 2s峰是硅氧化物的特征，表明从镓氧化物的贡献很小。

4. 在未促进的Pd/SiO2催化剂上，3000 cm1的带缺失，表明其与镓负载有关。

5. 3670 cm1的带被识别为GaOH或SiO(H)Ga的OH伸展模式，与已报道的价值一致。

6. 随着镓负载的增加，位于2020 cm1的带的位置从2026移动到2015 cm1。

7. 2020 cm1的带被归因于镓氢键形成，在材料表面上证实了这一发现。
