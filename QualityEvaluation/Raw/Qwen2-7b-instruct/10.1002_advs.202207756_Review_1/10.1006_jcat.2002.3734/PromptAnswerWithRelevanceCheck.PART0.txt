[1] "For example, there has been steadily growing interest in the investigation of the nature of the active sites on ZSM-5 zeolites modified with gallium, because aromatization of light alkanes can be accomplished by these catalysts (15)."
[2] "More recently, deep effects on the catalytic properties for achieving highly effective conversion of carbon dioxide to valuable compounds using composite catalysts which incorporate gallium oxide(s) and precious metals have been reported (1113)."
[3] "The impact of hydrogen activation in the hydrogenation of carbon oxides over these gallium-containing catalysts was not discussed in the mentioned works, probably because Ga is not as good a hydrogenation catalyst as the noble metals are and, actually, is not a widely employed catalytic element (1113)."
[4] "In this context, it is imperative to balance the knowledge of the chemistry of all the elemental components of a catalytic material, starting from molecular activation processes."
[5] "The interaction of H2 with Ga/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and GaPd/SiO2 catalysts has been investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron and transmission infrared spectroscopies (XPS and FTIR)."
[6] "The presence of these two Ga 3d lines, from now on defined as the high- and low-binding-energy components (HBE and LBE, respectively) of the Ga 3d signal, was consistently observed in all the gallium-containing catalysts that had been reduced at least once at 723 K."
[7] "The percentage of reduced Pd and Ga, defined as [Pd0/(Pd0 + Pd2+)] × 100 and [Gaδ+/(Gaδ+ + Ga3+)] × 100, respectively, are reported in Table 2."
[8] "The intensity of the band at 3000 cm1 increased with the total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on unpromoted Pd/SiO2."
[9] "This band could be reliably measured against the background above approximately 500 K (2027 cm1)."
[10] "The band at 3670 cm1 was assigned to the OH stretching mode in GaOH or SiO(H)Ga, in agreement with other reported values (4042)."
[11] "The intensity of this band grew up until 660 K and then leveled off at higher temperatures (2015 cm1)."
[12] "The band position shifted from 2026 to 2015 cm1 as the gallium loading went from 2.6 to 9.2 wt%."
[13] "The ν(GaH) mode for gallanes lies between 2050 and 1800 cm1."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complexity of identifying and quantifying various gallium species, particularly gallium(III) and gallium(IV) states, which can exist in multiple oxidation states under PDH conditions. These challenges are exacerbated by the potential for gallium to form complexes with other elements such as oxygen, leading to the formation of gallium oxides or gallane-like structures. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contribute significantly to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information on the speciation and reactivity of gallium species on the catalyst surface. By monitoring the changes in gallium signals during PDH, researchers can gain insights into the structure-activity relationships of gallium in these catalytic systems. The development of advanced analytical methods allows for a more detailed understanding of the gallium behavior, including the formation of gallium-hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，通过原位或操作过程表征技术，如X射线光电子谱（XPS）和透射红外光谱（FTIR），可以显著解决在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中确定和量化Ga物种的主要挑战。这些挑战包括复杂地识别和量化各种Ga物种，尤其是可能以多种氧化态存在的Ga(III)和Ga(IV)状态。在PDH条件下，Ga与氧等其他元素形成复合物的可能性，导致形成Ga氧化物或类似Ga烷的结构，进一步加剧了这一挑战。通过提供实时信息，原位或操作过程表征技术允许研究人员深入了解催化系统中Ga行为的结构-活性关系。通过在PDH过程中监测Ga信号的变化，可以获得关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH过程中的行为的详细理解，包括Ga-H键的形成，这对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的催化性能至关重要。

[4] "The effects of the high-temperature reduction treatments over the supported gallium oxide appear fairly well in the XPS spectra: So, two shoulders for the Ga 3d core-level signal, which are partially overlapped with the O 2s photo- electron peak, can be already individualized upon reducing the PdGa40 precursor at 573 K (Fig. 1)."
[5] "Other alternatives that might account for the appearance of the LBE band in our reduced GaPd/SiO2 materials are the formation of metallic gallium and/or PdGa alloy, which cannot be ruled out completely for at least three reasons:"
[6] "Quantification of the extent of Pd and Ga reduction was done after deconvoluting the Pd 3d and Ga 3d sig- nals. The percentages of reduced Pd and Ga, defined as [Pd0/(Pd0 + Pd2+)] × 100 and [Gaδ+/(Gaδ+ + Ga3+)] × 100,respectively, are reported in Table 2."
