The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complexity of identifying and quantifying various gallium species, particularly gallium(III) and gallium(IV) states, which can exist in multiple oxidation states under PDH conditions. These challenges are exacerbated by the potential for gallium to form complexes with other elements such as oxygen, leading to the formation of gallium oxides or gallane-like structures. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contribute significantly to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information on the speciation and reactivity of gallium species on the catalyst surface. By monitoring the changes in gallium signals during PDH, researchers can gain insights into the structure-activity relationships of gallium in these catalytic systems. The development of advanced analytical methods allows for a more detailed understanding of the gallium behavior, including the formation of gallium-hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，通过原位或操作过程表征技术，如X射线光电子谱（XPS）和透射红外光谱（FTIR），可以显著解决在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中确定和量化Ga物种的主要挑战。这些挑战包括复杂地识别和量化各种Ga物种，尤其是可能以多种氧化态存在的Ga(III)和Ga(IV)状态。在PDH条件下，Ga与氧等其他元素形成复合物的可能性，导致形成Ga氧化物或类似Ga烷的结构，进一步加剧了这一挑战。通过提供实时信息，原位或操作过程表征技术允许研究人员深入了解催化系统中Ga行为的结构-活性关系。通过在PDH过程中监测Ga信号的变化，可以获得关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH过程中的行为的详细理解，包括Ga-H键的形成，这对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的催化性能至关重要。
