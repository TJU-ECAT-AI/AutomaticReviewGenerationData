[1] "Acids 3a3f were isolated as yellow crystalline substances. They showed in the IR spectra absorption bands in the regions 31243290 (NH), 17031723 (C=O, acid), 16621678 (AdC=O), and 1583 1638 cm1 C4=O, C=C, C=N)."
[2] "Unlike structurally related compounds [13, 2026], no β-ketohydrazone tautomers of 3a3f were detected."
[3] "Isomer B (2556%) was characterized by singlets due to vinylic proton at δ 6.43 7.03 ppm, N=CH proton at δ 7.728.15 ppm, and NH proton at δ 14.7715.58 ppm."
[4] "The proposed synthetic route to furan-2(3H)-ones 4a4f is of preparative significance, and it ensures high yield of the products."
[5] "(3E)-3-{[(2Z)-2-(Adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethyli- dene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(het- aryl)furan-2(3H)-ones 4a4f as orange crystalline sub- stances."

This study focused on synthesizing 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids through the reaction of 1-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-[(triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)hydrazinylidene]ethanone with 4-aryl(hetaryl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acids. The products were then subjected to cyclization, leading to the formation of 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]-hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones. These compounds were further transformed into 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]-hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones via chemical transformations of 3-hydrazinylidene-(imino)furan-2(3H)-ones. The synthesis of these compounds provided a preparative route with high yield, demonstrating their potential as biologically active substances due to the introduction of a pharmacophoric adamantyl fragment into their structure.

本研究主要关注通过将1-(3-R-亚丁烷-1-基)-2-[(三苯基-λ5-磷酰基)腙基二烯基]乙酮与4-芳基(杂芳基)-2,4-二氧丁酸酯反应合成2-{2-[2-(3-R-亚丁烷-1-基)-2-氧代乙基二烯基]腙基}-4-芳基(杂芳基)-4-氧代丁-2-酸。产物随后经过环化，产生3-{[2-(3-R-亚丁烷-1-基)-2-氧代乙基二烯基]-腙基}-5-芳基(杂芳基)呋喃-2(3H)-酮。这些化合物进一步通过3-腙基-（亚胺）-呋喃-2(3H)-酮的化学转化形成了3-{[2-(3-R-亚丁烷-1-基)-2-氧代乙基二烯基]-腙基}-5-芳基(杂芳基)呋喃-2(3H)-酮。这些化合物的合成提供了一条制备性路径，具有高产率，显示其作为生物活性物质的潜力，这是由于在它们的结构中引入了药效团亚丁烷基片段。

The IR spectra contained absorption bands due to stretching vibrations of the C2=O carbonyl group in the furan ring (17901857 cm1), adamantoyl carbonyl (16721692 cm1), and C=C and C=N bonds (15841631 cm1). In the 1H NMR spectra of 4a4f,adamantyl protons appeared as a multiplet at δ 1.69
2.39 ppm, the 4-H proton in the furan ring resonated as a singlet at δ 6.827.20 ppm, aromatic proton signals were located at δ 6.607.99 ppm, and the CH=N proton gave a singlet at δ 7.918.15 ppm.

Answer: The IR spectra of the synthesized compounds contained specific absorption bands indicative of their functional groups, such as the C2=O carbonyl group in the furan ring, the adamantoyl carbonyl group, and C=C and C=N bonds. The 1H NMR spectra revealed the presence of adamantyl protons as a multiplet, the 4-H proton in the furan ring as a singlet, and various aromatic proton signals along with the CH=N proton singlets.
