The IR spectra contained absorption bands due to stretching vibrations of the C2=O carbonyl group in the furan ring (17901857 cm1), adamantoyl carbonyl (16721692 cm1), and C=C and C=N bonds (15841631 cm1). In the 1H NMR spectra of 4a4f,adamantyl protons appeared as a multiplet at δ 1.69
2.39 ppm, the 4-H proton in the furan ring resonated as a singlet at δ 6.827.20 ppm, aromatic proton signals were located at δ 6.607.99 ppm, and the CH=N proton gave a singlet at δ 7.918.15 ppm.

Answer: The IR spectra of the synthesized compounds contained specific absorption bands indicative of their functional groups, such as the C2=O carbonyl group in the furan ring, the adamantoyl carbonyl group, and C=C and C=N bonds. The 1H NMR spectra revealed the presence of adamantyl protons as a multiplet, the 4-H proton in the furan ring as a singlet, and various aromatic proton signals along with the CH=N proton singlets.
