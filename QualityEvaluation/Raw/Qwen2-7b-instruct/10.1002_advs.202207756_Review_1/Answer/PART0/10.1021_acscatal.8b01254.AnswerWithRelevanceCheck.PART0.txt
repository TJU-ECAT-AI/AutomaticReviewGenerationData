          The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions involve the difficulty in accurately identifying and quantifying gallium ions within the catalyst structure. In situ or operando characterization techniques are crucial because they enable real-time monitoring of the catalyst during the reaction, allowing for the identification of Ga species and their changes over time. These methods contribute to overcoming challenges by providing insights into the dynamic behavior of gallium, which is essential for understanding its role in the catalytic activity and the structure-activity relationship within the catalytic system.
