        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jacs.7b12901\], emphasizing the complexity and dynamic nature of gallium (Ga) species within Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions as the primary challenge. This is underscored by the pivotal role of in situ or operando characterization techniques in addressing these challenges, as highlighted in references \[10.1021/jacs.7b12901\] and \[10.1021/acscatal.8b01254\]. These techniques offer real-time insights into the catalyst's structure and reactivity during PDH reactions, significantly advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.
