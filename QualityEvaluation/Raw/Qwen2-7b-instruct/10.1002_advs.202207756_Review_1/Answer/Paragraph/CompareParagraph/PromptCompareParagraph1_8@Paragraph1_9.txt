Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jacs.7b12901\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.8b01254\] and \[10.1021/j100245a008\]. Challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are manifold, primarily due to the complexity and dynamic nature of gallium (Ga) species present within the catalyst structure. These challenges encompass the difficulty in accurately identifying and quantifying gallium ions, the rapid exchange of Ga species with the surrounding environment, and the complexity of identifying stable Ga forms within the zeolite matrix. In situ or operando characterization techniques play a pivotal role in overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the catalyst's structure and reactivity during PDH reactions. These methods are instrumental in advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

            The role of in situ or operando characterization techniques in elucidating Ga speciation is significant. They enable the real-time monitoring of catalyst behavior during PDH reactions, facilitating the identification of Ga species and their changes over time. This is essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of gallium, which directly impacts its role in catalytic activity and the structure-activity relationship within the catalytic system. By leveraging these techniques, researchers can gain deeper insights into the complex interactions within Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, leading to improved catalyst design and optimization.

            The integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of more sophisticated in situ or operando characterization techniques that can provide even more detailed information about the dynamics of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Additionally, there is a need for interdisciplinary collaborations that integrate computational chemistry, materials science, and catalysis to better predict and understand the structure-activity relationships in these systems. This could lead to the discovery of novel catalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity for PDH reactions, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient chemical processes.

2 Ga-Containing Zeolites in PDH
Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structure&ndash;activity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 °C). Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating a Ga salt, for example, Ga(NO3)3, on the H-ZSM-5 support, followed by calcination in the air. At this point, Ga in the as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is typically at its highest oxidation state, that is, +3. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are then reduced in an H2 atmosphere at the reaction temperature before the feed is introduced. Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH. The patent and academic literature in the 1970s and 1980s focused largely on the activity and product distribution,[105-107] rather than the structure of the active center, which was likely due to the lack of in situ characterization with sufficient structural detail or spectral resolution.
2.1 Ga Speciation on Reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5
Understanding Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is central to mechanistic understanding because the reaction pathway depends on the structure of the active site. PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500°C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally. Computational modeling plays a pivotal role in mapping out reaction pathways, and the reliability of the predicted pathways depends on the assumed catalytic structures. Investigations of Ga speciation on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 can be roughly divided into two periods. Earlier studies generally assumed that all intraporous Ga species in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 resided in a similar coordination environment, or different coordination environments did not impact PDH activity on the Ga species. Subsequent reports suggested that a few different Ga species, with distinct structures and PDH reactivities, were present in Ga/H-ZSM-5. In particular, the density of framework Al pairs in the zeolite framework is a key variable in determining the concentration of the most active Ga species in PDH. The following section addresses these two periods.
2.1.1 Ga Speciation on Reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 without Considering Al Distribution in Zeolite
Literature discussion of Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is fraught with conflicting claims, as conclusions are drawn based on results obtained with different characterization techniques. This is in part due to the fact that several key assumptions made in the data analysis in early studies were challenged by more recent experimental or computational evidence. Below, we discuss key information regarding the Ga speciation obtained from a number of techniques separately, before presenting an up-to-date understanding based on all existing evidence.
X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions. Meitzner et al. first employed in situ Ga K edge XAS to investigate the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.[99] As synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by impregnation and calcination. Four standard samples were employed in the interpretation of the spectra collected on Ga/H-ZSM-5:
Ga metal;
framework Ga-ZSM-5, in which Ga isomorphously substituted Si in the zeolite framework in the tetrahedral coordination configuration;
Ga(NO3)3 in which Ga is in the octahedral coordination environment;
fully reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 by H2 at 507 °C (attributed to GaHx).
Spectral assignments were made based on the distinct Ga K edge energies for these species, though later results showed that the edge energy could not be treated as diagnostic information regarding the Ga species at different oxidation states (see below).[119] The XAS spectra of all standard samples and their Ga K edge energy (E) and ΔE (referenced to the first inflection point in the edge region, Figure 3a and Table 2). During the treatment of the catalyst in H2 at 507 °C, the Ga K edge decreased in energy (Figure 3b&ndash;e), suggesting the reduction of Ga species in the as-synthesized sample. The decrease of Ga K edge energy shifts of Ga/H-ZSM-5 during the reduction was confirmed by several research groups.[77, 100, 108, 119, 120] This transition was attributed to the conversion of Ga3+ species to GaHx by Meitzner et al.[99] The amount of H2 consumed during the reduction of the as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 was consistent with the reduction of Ga(III) to Ga(I). Interestingly, the Ga K edge of the reduced sample increased as the reduced sample was cooling down to room temperature in H2, a trend attributed to the oxidation of GaHx to Ga3+ species in an extraframework tetrahedral coordination environment (Figure 3b&ndash;e). The oxidizing agent responsible for the oxidation of GaHx was speculated to be protons.[99]
Sample Edge energy [eV] ΔE [eV]
Ga metal 10 367.1 0
GaHx in H-ZSM-5 10 368.0 0.9
a)Tetrahedral Ga3+ 10 372.7 5.6
b)Octahedral Ga3+ 10 373.3 6.2
a) from framework Ga-ZSM-5;
b) from Ga(NO3)3.
The interpretation of Ga K edge energy shift has evolved as new experimental evidence is accumulated. Hensen and co-workers attributed this observation to the reduction of Ga3+ to Ga+,[108] a conclusion supported by Faro's and Lercher's investigations.[77, 120] The assignment of the reduced Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 to Ga+ and GaHx was often made based on similar XAS results, reflecting distinct mechanistic hypotheses by different researchers. In an important work, Hock and co-workers compared the X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra of a series of model organometallic Ga compounds with well-defined structures and concluded XANE spectra could not provide diagnostic information regarding the oxidation state of Ga.[119] The identity and number of ligands coordinating with Ga could give rise to changes in the XANE spectra similar to those expected of changes in the oxidation state of Ga. Thus, the shift of Ga K edge energy to lower energy upon exposure to H2 or propane could be attributed to several causes, that is, conversion of Ga3+ to i) Ga+, 2) GaHx, and 3) Ga3+ coordinated with alkyl groups. Bell and co-workers attributed the ≈4.6 eV decrease in the Ga K edge energy upon switching from O2 to H2 atmosphere of Ga/H-ZSM-5 at or above 500 °C to the transformation of [Ga(OH)2]+−H+ to [GaH]2+.[100] Thus, edge shifts in XAS alone cannot unambiguously determine the oxidation state of Ga during the PDH.
In situ XAS investigations provided crucial information regarding how Ga species migrate into the zeolite pore upon reduction. Ga exists mostly in the form of Ga2O3 on the external surface of H-ZSM-5 in as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5, evidenced by the equal distribution of Ga in the tetrahedral and the octahedral coordination environments.[99] Ga species are mobilized upon reduction or coordination with H or alkyl groups at high temperatures (>500 °C), before entering into the zeolite pore. Oxidation of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 leads to the formation of mostly tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, suggesting that they are located in the zeolite pore rather than in the form of Ga2O3 crystallites.[99] Reduction of intraporous Ga3+ species is more facile than those in Ga2O3 on the surface of zeolite because no Ga migration is needed.
In Situ FTIR Spectroscopy
The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates. Hensen and co-workers[109, 121] applied diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to the reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 and reported the first definitive spectral evidence of Ga hydrides on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. Upon reduction at 500 °C, the intensity of BAS OH groups at 3610 cm−1 decreased gradually with time, because of the replacement of BAS OH groups by Ga species. The decrease of the BAS band at 3610 cm−1 during hydrogen treatment of Ga/H-ZSM-5 at 500 °C over time, combined with the knowledge that Ga species enter into the zeolite pore during reduction, is compelling evidence that cationic Ga species replaced protons as the charge balancing species after entering the zeolite pore. A 1:1 correlation between the amount of Ga entering the zeolite pore and that of BAS consumed was later obtained with quantitative in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy with pyridine as the probe molecule on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples.[110] Exposure of reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 to H2 at a temperature above 300 °C led to the formation of bands at 2041 and 2059 cm−1 (Figure 4a) in the Ga hydride spectral region (1900&ndash;2100 cm−1)[122]. The Ga hydride band intensity decreases at temperatures above 300 °C, and higher temperatures led to near-complete Ga hydride decomposition, with the peak at 2059 cm−1 disappearing first (Figure 4b). The band at 2041 cm−1 was assigned to the Ga dihydride ([GaH2]+), while the 2059 cm−1 band was attributed to the Ga-H mode in [Ga3+(OH−)(H−)],[109, 121] typically referred to as Ga monohydride in the later literature.
It should be noted that these assignments to specific Ga hydride species were largely speculative, but were widely cited. The proposed [GaH2]+ species contains two equivalent H so that if Ga/H-ZSM-5 is reduced in an H2/D2 mixture, a binomial mixture of [GaH2]+, [GaHD]+, [GaD2]+ would be expected. When H2/D2 mixtures with different compositions were employed as the reducing atmosphere in a recent study, only Ga-H and Ga-D modes were observed (Figure 4c,d). The absence of a distinct band for [GaHD]+ calls the existence of such a species into question (Figure 4e). It is likely that both the 2041 and 2059 cm−1 bands correspond to a Ga monohydride species located in slightly different environments in the zeolite pore (we will return to this point later).
