[1] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [3-11], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet, with proposals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [3-6] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [8-11] receiving most attention."
[2] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."
[3] "In order to prepare better-defined Ga species in medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and HMOR [21]."
[4] "Activation was carried out by reduction with molecular hydrogen because this results in better-defined species compared to an oxidative pretreatment [21]."
[5] "We will also address the oxidation of the zeolite-occluded gallium alkyl species."
[6] "Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve the wide variety of possible gallium structures, such as bulk Ga2O3 aggregates, small gallium oxide aggregates, and reduced Ga species, which complicate understanding their roles in PDH mechanisms. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute by providing detailed insights into the dynamic behavior of gallium species under reaction conditions, allowing for the preparation of better-defined gallium species within the zeolite structure. This helps in resolving the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems by studying the effects of gallium speciation on PDH performance, particularly through the use of in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES).

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的挑战包括广泛的可能Ga结构，如块状Ga2O3聚集体、小尺寸的Ga氧化物聚集体以及还原态的Ga物种，这使得了解其在PDH机制中的作用变得复杂。原位或操作态表征技术通过提供反应条件下的详细信息，有助于制备在沸石结构内更好定义的Ga物种。这有助于解决这些催化体系的结构活性关系，特别是通过使用原位X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）研究Ga物种对PDH性能的影响。
