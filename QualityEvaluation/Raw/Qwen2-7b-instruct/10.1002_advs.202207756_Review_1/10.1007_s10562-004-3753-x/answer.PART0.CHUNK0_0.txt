[1] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [3-11], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet, with proposals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [3,6] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [8-11] receiving most attention."
[2] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."
[3] "In order to prepare better-defined Ga species in medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and HMOR [21]."
[4] "Acti- vation was carried out by reduction with molecular hydrogen because this results in better-defined species compared to an oxidative pretreatment [21]."
[5] "Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve the wide variety of possible gallium structures within the zeolite, including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates, small gallium oxide aggregates, reduced Ga species, and cationic Ga species. These structures make it difficult to determine the exact role of gallium in PDH mechanisms. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing detailed information on the structure and reactivity of gallium species under conditions relevant to catalysis. This allows for a more precise understanding of the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, which is crucial for optimizing their performance in PDH processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种的精确表征面临的首要挑战涉及zeolite中可能的镓结构的广泛多样性，包括bulk Ga2O3团簇、小型镓氧化物团簇、还原型镓物种和氧化或还原型镓离子。这些结构使确定PDH机制中镓的作用变得困难。原位或操作过程表征技术通过提供有关催化材料在与催化条件相关的情况下的结构和活性的详细信息，有助于克服这些挑战。这允许对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的结构-活性关系有更精确的理解，这对于优化PDH过程的性能至关重要。
