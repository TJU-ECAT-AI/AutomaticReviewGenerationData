The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the highly dispersed nature of the active gallium species, which is only present under reaction (reductive) conditions. This makes it difficult to determine the role of gallium species in the reactions. X-ray absorption techniques, though useful for detecting dispersed and isolated species, have traditionally been limited to qualitative analysis. In this paper, the authors aim to overcome these challenges by correlating quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction. They find a linear correlation between the gallium second sphere coordination number and the Ga3+ content of partially reduced catalysts, suggesting that more condensed oxidic gallium species are converted to binuclear species during the early stages of reduction. This finding implies that the charged gallium species are more easily reduced than the neutral ones, which contributes to our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的Ga物种的主要挑战包括活性Ga物种的高度分散性，它仅在反应（还原）条件下存在。这使得确定这些反应中Ga物种的作用变得困难。虽然X射线吸收技术对于检测分散和孤立物种非常有用，并且已经在文献中用于研究此类系统，但其数据分析通常局限于对XANES（边缘位移与镓原子氧化态之间的定性相关）和EXAFS光谱（关于Ga物种分散的定性结论）的质性解释。在这篇论文中，作者们试图通过关联在不同还原状态下的原位XANES和EXAFS结果来克服这些挑战，以获取在丙烷芳构化条件下的还原Ga物种结构的数据。他们发现，部分还原催化剂中Ga第二壳层配位数与Ga3+含量之间存在线性关系，推断出完全氧化催化剂中更凝聚的氧化性Ga物种在早期还原阶段被转化为双核物种。这一发现表明，带电的Ga物种比中性的更容易还原，这有助于我们理解这些催化系统的结构-活性关系。
