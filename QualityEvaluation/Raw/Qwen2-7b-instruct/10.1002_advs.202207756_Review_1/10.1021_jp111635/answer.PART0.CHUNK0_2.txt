[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."
[2] "However, the data analysis has been generally limited to qualitative interpretation of the XANES (qualitative correlations between edge shifts and oxidation state of gallium atoms) and EXAFS spectra (qualitative conclusions about the dispersion of gallium species)."
[3] "It was found that isolated oxidic gallium species exist in the catalysts, along with condensed species, but their proportion decreases with increasing Ga/Al ratio."
[4] "Gallium incorporation, besides decreasing the density of Brnsted acid sites as compared to the pure zeolites, caused the appearance of strong Lewis acid sites, capable of retaining adsorbed pyridine up to 673 K."
[5] "In this paper, we attempt to correlate quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction, in order to obtain data on the structure of reduced gallium species under propane aromatization conditions."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the high dispersion and reactivity of the active gallium species, which are only present under reaction (reductive) conditions. The nature of the active species remains unclear due to the limitations of the data analysis, which has been predominantly qualitative, focusing on correlations between the edge shifts of XANES and the oxidation state of gallium atoms, as well as qualitative conclusions about the dispersion of gallium species based on EXAFS spectra. The presence of both isolated oxidic gallium species and condensed species in the catalysts is noted, with the proportion of the former decreasing with increasing Ga/Al ratio. Gallium incorporation enhances the density of Lewis acid sites, capable of retaining adsorbed pyridine up to high temperatures, while reducing the density of Brnsted acid sites. This paper aims to correlate quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction, to gain insights into the structure of reduced gallium species under PDH conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的镓物种进行阐明的主要挑战包括活性镓物种的高度分散性以及仅在反应（还原）条件下存在的特性。由于数据分析的局限性，主要为定性分析，侧重于XANES边缘位移与镓原子氧化态之间的相关性和EXAFS谱中镓物种分布的定性结论，因此活性物种的性质仍然不清楚。观察到催化剂中存在孤立的氧化镓物种和凝聚物种，随着Ga/Al比率的增加，前者所占比例减少。镓的掺杂增加了具有保留吸附吡啶能力至高温度的强Lewis酸位点的密度，同时减少了Brnsted酸位点的密度。本文旨在通过在不同还原状态下的原位XANES和EXAFS结果的相关性，获得PDH条件下的还原镓物种结构的信息。
