[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."
[2] "However, the data analysis has been generally limited to qualitative interpretation of the XANES (qualitative correlations between edge shifts and oxidation state of gallium atoms) and EXAFS spectra (qualitative conclusions about the dispersion of gallium species)."
[3] "In this paper, we attempt to correlate quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction, in order to obtain data on the structure of reduced gallium species under propane aromatization conditions."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the high dispersion and transient nature of the active gallium species, which is only present under reaction conditions. This makes it difficult to determine the exact structure and oxidation state of gallium species. Additionally, the analysis of gallium species has typically been qualitative, focusing on correlations between shifts in the XANES spectra and the oxidation state of gallium atoms, as well as qualitative conclusions about the dispersion of gallium species from EXAFS spectra. In situ X-ray absorption techniques, such as XANES and EXAFS, offer a means to overcome these challenges by providing quantitative data on the structure and state of gallium species under PDH conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，确定Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的作用面临的主要挑战包括活性Ga物种的高度分散性和仅在反应条件下存在的特性。这使得难以确定Ga物种的确切结构和氧化状态。此外，对Ga物种的分析通常局限于定性，关注于XANES谱中边缘位移与Ga原子氧化态之间的相关性以及从EXAFS谱得出关于Ga物种分布的定性结论。原位X射线吸收技术，如XANES和EXAFS，提供了克服这些挑战的方法，通过提供在PDH条件下的Ga物种结构和状态的定量数据。
