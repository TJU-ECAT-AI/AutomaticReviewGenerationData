[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."
[2] "In situ gallium K edge XAFS spectroscopy experiments were performed with GaZSM5 catalysts containing two different gallium loadings (2 and 4%) under hydrogen or propane in the 703823K temperature range."
[3] "The results showed that the reduction proceeds from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom."
[4] "In a previous publication (14) we established quantitative correlations between dispersion, acidity, and reducibility of the oxide form of GaZSM5 catalysts of varying composition (zeolite silica-to-alumina ratio and gallium loading) and their propane aromatization activity."
[5] "It is apparent that the DebyeWaller factors found here for the first gallium coordination sphere are almost twice those obtained before for the catalysts in oxidized form at room temperature."
[6] "From Tables 2 and 3 it is seen that first sphere GaO distances were considerably larger with the partially reduced catalysts at high temperature than with the catalysts in oxide form at room temperature."
[7] "A good linear dependence was found between coordination number and gallium oxidation state, in the case of the first coordination sphere, as shown in Figure 5."
[8] "Experiments described in ref 14."
[9] "Recent work has computed the energetics of carbon monoxide adsorption on Lewis acid sites associated with oxidic gallium clusters of different structures and numbers of gallium atoms."
[10] "It is also seen that the increase in Lewis acidity due to the increase in gallium content is nearly twice the decrease in Brnsted acidity, but considerably smaller than the estimated amount of tetranuclear species produced."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the highly dispersed nature of the active gallium species, which is only present under reaction (reductive) conditions. In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as in situ gallium K edge XAFS spectroscopy, contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information on the structure of the gallium species under PDH conditions. This allows for the establishment of quantitative correlations between the dispersion, acidity, and reducibility of the oxide form of GaZSM5 catalysts and their propane aromatization activity. The data analysis from these techniques helps in understanding the nature and behavior of the gallium species, particularly the reduction process from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom. The linear correlations found between the gallium coordination number and the degree of reduction also aid in elucidating the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，解析Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的Ga物种的主要挑战是活性Ga物种的高分散性，它仅在反应（还原）条件下存在。原位或操作过程表征技术，如原位Ga K边缘XAFS光谱，通过提供实时信息来克服这些挑战，这些信息是在PDH条件下对Ga物种结构的了解。这允许建立氧化态形式的GaZSM5催化剂的分布、酸性和可还原性与丙烷异构化活性之间的定量相关性。这些技术的数据分析有助于理解Ga物种的性质，特别是从Ga3+双核物种向单个氧原子配合的孤立Ga+离子的还原过程。发现的Ga配位数和还原度之间的线性关系也有助于阐明这些催化体系的结构-活性关系。
