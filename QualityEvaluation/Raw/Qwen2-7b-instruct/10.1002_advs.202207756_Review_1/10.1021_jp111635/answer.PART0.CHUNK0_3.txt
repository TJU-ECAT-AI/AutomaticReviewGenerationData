[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."
[2] "However, the data analysis has been generally limited to qualitative interpretation of the XANES (qualitative correlations between edge shifts and oxidation state of gallium atoms) and EXAFS spectra (qualitative conclusions about the dispersion of gallium species)."
[3] "In this paper, we attempt to correlate quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction, in order to obtain data on the structure of reduced gallium species under propane aromatization conditions."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the high dispersion and transient nature of the active gallium species, which are only present under reaction conditions. Traditionally, data analysis has focused on qualitative interpretations of XANES and EXAFS spectra, lacking quantitative insights into the structure of gallium species. This study aims to overcome these limitations by correlating quantitative XANES and EXAFS data to understand the nature of reduced gallium species during PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，解释Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的Ga物种的主要挑战是活性Ga物种的高度分散性和瞬态性质，它们仅在反应条件下存在。传统上，数据分析集中在对XANES和EXAFS谱的定性解释上，缺乏有关还原Ga物种结构的定量见解。这项研究旨在通过将定量XANES和EXAFS数据相关起来，克服这些限制，以了解PDH反应期间还原Ga物种的性质。
