Effect of Hydration on the Local Symmetry around Aluminum in ZSM-5 Zeolltes Studied 
by Aluminum-27 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

The effect of hydration and dehydration on the electric field gradient at the 27Al 
nucleus in ZSM-5 zeolites 
is investigated by magic angle spinning NMR at three different magnetic field strengths. The experiments 
show that dehydration 
causes an increase o
f
 the nAl NMR line width due to an increased quadrupole interaction. 
The dehydration therefore causes a redistribution of electric charges and/or a conformation change of the 
aluminum-oxygen tetrahedra. The latter possibility seems to be most important since the effect is cation 
dependent, as 
shown by results on Na-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5. Similar effects have been observed for faujasite 
H-Y and amorphous Si02/A1203. 
Introduction 
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates composed of 
silicon-oxygen and aluminum-oxygen tetrahedra. The 
negative charge of the aluminum-oxygen tetrahedra is 
neutralized by cations like Na+ or H+. AU zeolites display 
catalytic activity but especially 
the class of zeolites denoted 
by ZSM-5 has received much interest recently due to its 
unique catalytic properties.' 
Magic angle spinning proton NMR of H-ZSM-5 showed 
that at low water content two resonances are present, ar- 
ising from water molecules chemisorbed at the Bronsted 
acidic site (Si-OH-Al) and from water molecules adsorbed 
at silanol groups, the terminating Si-OH groups at the 
surface of the crystallites.2 
It is believed that water 
molecules adsorbed at the Bronsted sites form clusters with 
the acidic proton: H+(H20), 
where n is of the order of 2.3 
Hydration and dehydration of H-ZSM-5 therefore is ex- 
pected to slightly alter the position of the H+ 
proton and 
consequently change the conformation of and the charge 
distribution around the aluminum-oxygen tetrahedron. 
Aluminum 
has a nuclear spin 5/2 and therefore a nuclear 
quadrupole moment which can interact with an electric 
field gradient at the site of the nucleus caused by sur- 
rounding ions. For a perfect tetrahedral surrounding of

aluminum by four oxygens, the electric field gradient is 
zero. Any distortion of this tetrahedron, however, should 
cause a field gradient at aluminum and consequently a 
quadrupole interaction of the aluminum nuclear spin. 
In this letter we report results from magic angle spinning 
NMR of aluminum in Na-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 which 
show unambiguously that hydration and dehydration af- 
fect the conformation 
of the duminum-oxygen tetrahedra. 
Similar experiments on amorphous Si02/A1203 
and fau- 
jasite H-Y show the same phenomenon, except that for 
aluminum in octahedral sites, present in amorphous 
Si02/A1203, 
hydration or dehydration has no detectable 
effect on the field gradient at the aluminum nucleus. 
Experimental Section 
The Na-ZSM-5 (Si/Al ratio 40) and H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al 
ratio 15) were donated by DSM, Geleen; faujasite H-Y 
(Si/Al ratio 2.5) and the amorphous Si02/A1203 
(HA HFV, 
Si/A1 ratio 2.4) are commercial samples from Union 
Carbide and AKZO Nederland, respectively. Dehydration 
of the samples was achieved by vacuum drying ( 
torr) 
at temperatures between 200 and 400 "C ("shallow-bed" 
treatment). To prevent rehydration, spinners are filled 
under an anhydrous nitrogen gas atmosphere in a glovebox. 
'H NMR measurements2b revealed that rehydration 
through the spinner walls during the experiment is neg- 
ligible. Hydration was performed at room temperature by 
exposing the material in a closed system to a small con- 
tainer with water. 
The magic angle spinning aluminum NMR experiments 
were carried out by straightforward 9O0-pulse 
excitation 
in three different spectrometers: a Bruker CXP 300 (YM

was used, a cylindrical Delrin spinner supported by two

to be sufficient. 
Magic Angle Spinning NMR 
of a Quadrupolar 
Nucleus 
Aluminum nuclear spins in an aluminosilicate are sub- 
jected to three anisotropic inteactions: dipolar interactions 
with neighboring nuclei like lH and %i, interaction of the 
nuclear quadrupole moment with electric field gradients, 
and the anisotropic chemical shift interaction. Of these 
three interactions the quadrupole interaction will prove 
to be the most important for our experiments. A discus- 
sion of the effect of magic angle spinning on the NMR 
spectra of quadrupolar nuclei can be found at several 
places in the literat~re.~ 
Here we want to mention only 
the outcome of these theories. 
For half-integer nuclear spins like 27Al, 
the anisotropic 
quadrupole interaction causes a severe line broadening in 
solid-state NMR spectra, except for the m = 'I2 
- 
m = 
-1/2 transition if the quadrupole interaction is small com- 
pared to the Zeeman interaction of the nuclear spin. It 
is easy to show that for this 'I2 
- 
-lI2 transition the 
quadrupole interaction contributes only in second- and 
higher-order perturbation theory.6 In practice, therefore, 
only this transition is observed in solid samples, showing 
a characteristic powder pattern depending on the value of 
the asymmetry parameter 7; magic angle spinning reduces 
but does not eliminate the width of this powder pattern. 
A formula for the frequency of the 'I2 
- 
-'I2 
transition 
under fast magic angle spinning conditions has been de- 
rived by Kundla et al.5b 
and can be rewritten as

Equation 1 
shows in addition that the width of powder 
pattern decreases with magnetic field. Therefore, when 
in an experimental situation it is found that the line width 
of a line decreases with field, then this points to the ex- 
istence of quadrupole broadening. This is in contrast to 
a broadening due to a distribution of chemical shifts, a 
common source of line broadening in magic angle spinning 
NMR, which increases with field. 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 2 shows 27Al 
spectra of H-ZSM-5 at three dif- 
ferent frequencies for the hydrated and dehydrated form. 
For the hydrated samples the line width first decreases 
from 550 Hz at 78.2 MHz to 400 Hz at 46.9 MHz and then 
remains constant at 15.6 MHz. The initial decrease of this 
line width with field shows that for the hydrated samples 
quadrupole broadening is certainly not the most important 
factor determining the line width at 78.2 MHz. As the

chemical shift anisotropy is eliminated by magic angle 
spinning, the initial decrease of the line width has to be 
due to the fact that the line width is caused by a distri- 
bution of 27Al 
chemical shifts. Only at the lowest fields, 
where the chemical shift distribution in frequency units 
is small, does the quadrupole broadening become impor- 
tant. At frequencies below 15 MHz the line width is ex- 
pected to increase again. 
For the dehydrated samples, however, the situation is 
very different. Figure 2 shows that the line width increases 
from 1100 Hz at 78.2 MHz to 1700 Hz at 46.9 MHz to 
undetectably broad at 15.6 MHz. Dehydration clearly 
makes the nAl line broader, by a factor 2 at 78.2 MHz, by 
a factor 4 at 46.9 MHz, and by a much larger factor at 15.6 
MHz. The field dependence of the line width shows that 
quadrupole interaction is the dominant factor determining 
the line width in the dehydrated samples. Clearly, dehy- 
dration causes a strong increase of the quadrupole inter- 
action. 
By comparing the experimental line shapes to the the- 
oretical shapes of Figure 1, one can conclude that the 
resulting electric field gradient at aluminum is highly 
asymmetric (no separate quadrupole pairs are observed). 
At this point we should mention that proton decoupling 
during acquisition of the Al 
free induction decay does not 
affect the A
1
 NMR line width, not in the hydrated case 
nor in the dehydrated situation. Dipolar interaction be- 
tween protons and A
l
 apparently is so weak that it can be 
eliminated by magic angle spinning alone. 
Figure 3 displays nAl spectra of Na-ZSM-5 as 
a function 
of the water content. These spectra show not only a line 
at 53 ppm but in addition lines at 65, 5, and -1 ppm 
(relative to Al(H,0)63+). The aluminum coordination can 
be determined on the basis of these chemical shift data8 
The line at 53 ppm of four-coordinated A

 is attributed 
to A

 in the ZSM-5 lattice. The narrow line at -1 ppm 
originates from six-coordinated 
Al, presumably Al(H20)63+ 
in the pores. The broader lies 
at 65 and 5 ppm, from four- 
and six-coordinated 
aluminum, must be due to an 
impurity 
or lattice defeds. Because of the resemblance of these lines 
with spectra of A12039 this might be an aluminum oxide 
impurity. X-ray analysis of this sample, however, did not 
reveal any impurity, presumably because the disordered 
regions are very small. Recently the existence of Al-rich

diffraction, is also reported by Hughes et al.1° 
When the sample is dried at 250 "C, the tetrahedral Al 
line at 53 ppm collapses; hydration for a variable length 
of time makes this line slowly appear again. In the de- 
hydrated sample, evidently, the quadrupole interaction 
becomes so strong that the tetrahedral A1 line of the 
genuine ZSM-5 aluminum becomes too broad to be de- 
tectable, even at 78.2 MHz. Apparently, the increase of 
quadrupole interaction on dehydration is much stronger 
for Na-ZSM-5 than for H-ZSM-5. Dehydration of the 
Na-ZSM-5 sample has no effect on the broad lines at 5 
and 65 ppm; the narrow line at -1 ppm disappears and 
does not come back at hydration. 
The same experiments 
were carried out on faujasite H-Y 
and amorphous SiOz/A1203. 
For faujasite H-Y the situ- 
ation is just the reverse of that for ZSM-5: the A

 line 
width of the hydrated sample increases on going to the 
lower frequency (750 Hz at 78.2 MHz, 1350 Hz at 46.9 
MHz). Apparently, even in the hydrated form there is 
already a considerable broadening due to quadrupole in- 
teraction, showing the existence of distorted tetrahedra. 
This distortion may be inherent to the structure which is 
different from H-ZSM-5, and possibly due to the presence 
of aluminum in higher coordination 
spheres (faujasite H-Y 
has a Si-A1 ratio of 2.5!). On dehydration the faujasite 
H-Y A1 line width at 78.2 MHz increases to 1800 Hz,

Only the peak at - 
52 ppm from tetrahedrally surrounded 
aluminum broadens on dehydration, indicating that strong 
chemisorption of water takes place only at the tetrahedral 
sites, not at octahedrally coordinated aluminum. 
As a conclusion of this work we can then state that in 
both Na-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-5 dehydration causes a low- 
ering of local symmetry around aluminum as evidenced 
by the increase in quadrupole interaction of aluminum. 
This increase is cation dependent. Similar effects are 
observed in faujasite H-Y and amorphous Si02/A1203. 
On 
the crucial question of what precisely causes this lowering 
of local symmetry, we can at this moment only speculate. 
As mentioned in the Introduction it is believed that in

hydrated material the cation forms a cluster with water 
molecules. On dehydration the cation presumably comes 
nearer to aluminum. This causes a change in the distri- 
bution of charges around aluminum and possibly a dis- 
tortion of the aluminum-oxygen tetrahedra. Both effects, 
the change in charge distribution and distortion of the 
tetrahedron, can give rise to an increase electric field 
gradient at the aluminum nucleus. However, from the 
observation that the increase in quadrupole interaction on 
dehydration is stronger for Na-ZSM-5 than for H-ZSM-5, 
we tend to believe that the distortion of the tetrahedra is 
more important for the increased electric field gradient 
than the redistribution of charges, although of course the 
latter effect may induce the local distortions. 
In the case of dehydrated H-ZSM-5 it is often indicated 
that the H+ 
ion exists in a Al-O-H+ band. For a perfect 
tetrahedron with an Al-0 distance of 1.59 A and an 0-H 
distance of 1 A, the dipolar interaction between Al and H 
would give rise to a broadening of the Al NMFt line of 2300 
Hz. Such a broadening, however, is not observed, sug- 
gesting either that the Al-H+ distance is much larger or 
that the H+ ion is mobile. 
Finally, we want to comment on the statement made 
earlier in this paragraph that in hydrated H-ZSM-5 the 
nAl line width is caused by a distribution of nAl chemical 
shifts. Preliminary 27Al 
spin-lattice relaxation (T,) 
ex- 
periments clearly reveal several species with distinct T1 
values and distinct chemical shift. Further investigations 
are needed to establish the origin of these different 27Al 
sites which together form the line shapes discussed in this 
paper.

Exponential Fluorescence Decay from Single Rovibratlonal Levels of S1 Acetaldehyde 
Marcus Noble and Edward K. C. Lee' 
Department of Chemistry, Unlverslty of Califomla, Itvhe, Callfornla 92717 (Received: Ju& 19, 1983) 
Single rotational level S1 
emission has been observed for jet-cooled acetaldehyde and a-monodeuterated 
acetaldehyde. All the levels studied (up to Evib = 1760 cm-') yielded single exponential decays, the vibronic 
origin being the longest-lived levels (CHSCHO, 220 ns; 
CHSCDO, 1.52 
ps). The data are correlated with previous 
room temperature studies. 
Introduction 
Acetaldehyde is a molecule of atmospheric significance' 
as well as a possible model for the photochemical and 
kinetic behavior of larger aldehydes.2 Because it is a 
seven-atom molecule with 15 vibrational degrees of free- 
dom and small rotational constants (A" = 1.8870, B" = 
0.3387, C"= 0.3033 cm-')? the room temperature electronic 
spectrum is too congested to obtain detailed rovibrational 
information. In spite of this congestion, the weak nature 
of the S1 
+ 
So 
transition, and the less than unity quantum 
yield for fluorescence, several attempts have been made 
to study its S1 dynamics by absorption and emission 
spectroscopic  measurement^.^*^,^ 
A recently reported experiment by Speiser et al. is the 
closest to a single vibrational level collision-free 
study! 
In 
this experiment an unnarrowed frequency doubled dye 
laser (fwhm > 1 cm-') was used to excite low-pressure (2 
25 mtorr) acetaldehyde vapor at 320 nm. This wavelength 
was arbitrarily chosen to lie below the predissociative 
threshold (131 
250 ~ m - ' ) . ~

this overall behavior to the process of rapid reversible 
intersystem crossing followed by internal conversion. This 
is a model which has been introduced and used to explain 
the same behavior in a-dicarbonyls by Kommandeur and 
co-workers.8 
As 
part of our overall studies into the dynamics of small 
molecules in electronically 
excited states, we have observed 
the laser-induced fluorescence decay from single rovibra- 
tional levels of S1 acetaldehyde and a-monodeuterated 
acetaldehyde. The assignment of these levels was known 
from our acetaldehyde (CH,CDO) rovibronic analysis of 
the ?r* + 
n transition of acetaldehyde and its deuterated 
derivative~.~J~ 
The fluorescence lifetimes of these levels 
show interesting mode specificity and energy dependence 
which will be reported in detail elsewhere.'O We report
