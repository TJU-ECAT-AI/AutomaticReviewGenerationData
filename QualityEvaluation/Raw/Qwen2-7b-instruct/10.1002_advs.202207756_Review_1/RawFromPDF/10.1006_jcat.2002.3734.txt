The interaction of H2 with Ga/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and Ga–Pd/SiO2
catalysts has been investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron and
transmission infrared spectroscopies (XPS and FTIR). The precur-
sors, calcined in dry air at 673 K, yield PdO and Ga2O3. Upon ex-
posure to hydrogen reduction at 423 K, the fraction of reduced gal-
lium ions (Gaδ+ cations, δ < 2) was 16% on Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2,
whereas no Ga3+ was reduced over Ga/SiO2 materials. It is sug-
gested that this promotional reduction effect of the noble metal
over gallium(III) is accomplished through hydrogen spillover from
metallic palladium, early reduced at 423 K. Higher reduction tem-
peratures (723 K) lead to highly dispersed metallic palladium
crystallites on the catalysts surface, and to the reduction of about
23–28% of the total gallium content in both the Ga/SiO2 and the Ga–
Pd/SiO2 materials. Above 473 K and under hydrogen ﬂow, a band
at 2020 cm−1 developed over all these reduced gallium-containing
catalysts, which was assigned to Gaδ+–H bond stretching. A linear
relationship was found between the intensity of this infrared signal
and the total gallium or Gaδ+ loading over the catalysts, at 723 K
and 760 Torr of ﬂowing H2. We propose that gallium–hydrogen
bond formation can be achieved on Ga/SiO2 by heterolytic hydro-
gen dissociation on the Gaδ+ cations, which are stabilized on the
silica surface, to yield additional GaO–H bonds. In the Ga–Pd/SiO2
catalysts the process is further aided by the metal particles. The
Gaδ+–H species were unstable below 450 K and/or decomposed un-
der evacuation but could be immediately regenerated after restoring
H2 pressure. The impact of the formation of this gallium–hydrogen
bond over the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to oxygenated com-
pounds is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The catalytic properties of gallium have received re-
newed attention from the mid-1980s. For example, there
has been steadily growing interest in the investigation of
the nature of the active sites on ZSM-5 zeolites modiﬁed
with gallium, because aromatization of light alkanes can be

accomplished by these catalysts (1–5). Discussions of re-
search teams go from the role of Ga atoms or GaOx oxides
in the lattice on the depression of the protonic acidity of the
zeolite to the formation of active forms of reduced gallium,
such as Ga(I) or GaHx monomeric species (6–10).
More recently, deep effects on the catalytic properties
for achieving highly effective conversion of carbon dioxide
to valuable compounds using composite catalysts which in-
corporate gallium oxide(s) and precious metals have been
reported (11–13). Inui concluded that the reduced state of
those catalysts that showed optimum catalytic properties
could be controlled by a combination of direct and inverse
hydrogen spillover from the noble metal and gallium sites,
respectively (11). The development of an active Pd/Ga2O3
catalysts for the synthesis of methanol from CO2 hy-
drogenation, able to compete with the classical Cu/ZnO
formulation, was ﬁrst reported by Fujitani et al. (12). Later
on, Bonivardi et al. showed that gallium addition to Pd/
SiO2 catalysts produced a dramatic enhancement of the
catalytic performance to give oxygenated compounds from
the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (13): Going from pure
Pd/SiO2 to Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2, with a variable Ga-to-Pd
atomic ratio, the initial activity to methanol improved from
1.7 × 10−3 to 4.5 × 10−1 s−1 at 523 K and 3 MPa (CO2/H2).
Under the same reaction conditions, the initial selectivity to
methanol went up to 62% for one of the gallium-promoted
catalysts, compared to 17% over clean palladium/silica.
Based on preliminary results of temperature-programmed
reduction, these last authors proposed that palladium crys-
tallites interacting with reduced gallium species could ac-
count for the unusual catalytic performance of the Ga–Pd/
SiO2 system. A mechanism involving intermediates from
adsorbed CO2 rather than CO, similar to those sustained
for Cu/ZnO, was suggested since only traces of methanol
were synthesized from CO/H2 mixtures.
The impact of hydrogen activation in the hydrogenation
of carbon oxides over these gallium-containing catalysts
was not discussed in the mentioned works, probably
because Ga is not as good a hydrogenation catalyst as the
noble metals are and, actually, is not a widely employed
catalytic element (11–13). In like manner, although it is

well-known that zinc oxide is able to activate dissociatively
the hydrogen molecule (14–16), this point has not been
further emphasized or considered in studies of methanol
synthesis on the traditional Cu/ZnO catalysts, as it has been
in the case of propane dehydrocyclization on Ga/H–ZMS-5
(7–10).
In this context, it is imperative to balance the knowl-
edge of the chemistry of all the elemental components of a
catalytic material, starting from molecular activation pro-
cesses. Thus, the aim of this work is to furnish evidence of
the chemistry of gallium species under reducing conditions
in the hope that it will help in understanding the reaction
pathways to oxygenated compounds from CO2 and H2. For
this purpose, we report here our results on hydrogen inter-
action with Ga/SiO2 and Ga–Pd/SiO2 materials, followed
by XPS and FTIR spectroscopies.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalysts
Davison Grade 59 silica gel (W. R. Grace) was previ-
ously crushed and sieved through an 80-mesh Tyler screen.
Next, the silica was puriﬁed, calcined in air at 773 K for
12 h, and characterized before being used as support for
the catalysts, as described in (17) (average particle diam-
eter = 52 µm; speciﬁc surface = 301 m2/g; average pore
diameter = 16 nm).
Catalysts with 2 wt% Pd loading were obtained via ion
exchange of palladium acetate (Sigma, 99.97%), at pH 11
in NH4OH(aq), onto the support. The exchanged material
was washed at the same pH, and the supported tetrammine
palladium complex was decomposed to diammine palla-
dium on silica by drying at 423 K for 2 h under ﬂowing
air (200 cm3/min), in a glass reactor (18). Then, different
amounts of Ga(NO3)3 · xH2O (Strem Chemicals, 99.99%
Ga), in aqueous solution, were added by incipient wetness
impregnation to the [Pd(NH3)2]2+/SiO2 at 3 Torr of N2
(1 Torr = 133.3 Pa) and ambient temperature, in a rotary
evaporator. Subsequently, the solids were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and water was removed by sublimation at 3 Torr
of N2 to give dry precursors. The resulting precursors were
then calcined in ﬂowing air (200 cm3/min) by heating from
298 to 673 K (2 h) at 2 K/min, to obtain palladium and gal-
lium oxides on the SiO2 surface (calcined catalysts). Last,
portions of each calcined catalyst were reduced in a 5%
H2/Ar mixture (200 cm3/min), heating from 298 to 723 K
(2 h) at 2 K/min, to obtain the prereduced catalysts. Be-
fore removing these reduced catalysts from the glass reac-
tor, they were passivated at 298 K by ﬂowing O2/Ar mix-
tures (200 cm3/min) with increasing O2 content, from 0.1 to
5% v/v. Blank samples of gallium/silica and palladium/silica
were also prepared following the same procedure.
Table 1 summarizes the catalysts’ codes and the main
features of the reduced samples used in this work. The

speciﬁc surface area of the catalysts was measured by the
BET method (N2), in a Micromeritics Acusorb 2000 appa-
ratus. The fraction of exposed metallic palladium was deter-
mined by chemisorption of carbon monoxide pulses. Non-
chemisorbed CO was hydrogenated to methane, which was
then detected by a ﬂame ionization detector, as described
in (19). A JEOL 100 CX electron microscope operating in
the bright-ﬁeld mode was used to perform TEM character-
ization. X-ray diffraction spectrometry was employed over
a selected set of the catalysts, using a Rich–Seifert JSO-
Debyeﬂex 2002 diffractometer equipped with a Ni-ﬁltered
Cu Kα radiation source.
XPS Apparatus and Procedures
Samples of either precursors or prereduced catalysts
were ground and placed on a metallic sample holder. The
samples were treated in situ in a pretreatment chamber. The
precursors were ﬁrst calcined at 673 K in 400 Torr of static
O2 for 30 min and were sequentially reduced in situ at 423,
573, and 723 K in 400 Torr of static H2, for 30 min each time.
The prereduced catalysts were re-reduced in situ at 523 K,
under the same ﬁnal conditions. After each treatment, the
samples were degassed and directly transferred without ex-
posure to air to an attached XPS analysis chamber. A VG
Escalab 200R X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a Mg
Kα1,2 source (incident energy of 1253.6 eV) and a hemi-
spherical electron analyzer was used. The residual pressure
in the ion-pumped analysis chamber was maintained below
3 × 10−9 Torr during data acquisition. C 1s, O 1s, O 2s, Ga
3d, Si 2p, Pd 3d, Ga 3d, and Ga LMM signals were recorded.
The electron-binding-energy scale was calibrated by as-
signing 532.6 eV to the O 1s peak. The binding energies
reported here are accurate to ±0.1 eV, with the exception

of the energy values for Pd 3d and Ga LMM signals, which
are within a ±0.3 eV error owing to their lower signal-to-
noise ratios.
The acquired spectra were processed with Microcal
Origin® 4.1 and the XPSPEAK® 4.0 programs, as fol-
lows: A smoothing of the peaks was achieved using FFT,
then a Shirley background was subtracted, and a Gaussian–
Lorentzian sum function was used for ﬁtting. XPS rela-
tive surface composition was calculated from photoelectron
peak areas after deconvolution.
FT-IR Studies
Catalysts samples were pressed into wafers of 10 mg/cm2
at 5 ton/cm2. Previously, it was veriﬁed that the speciﬁc
surface area of the catalysts is not decreased by this treat-
ment. These self-supported wafers were placed in turn
into a Pyrex cell with water-cooled NaCl windows, which
was attached to a conventional high vacuum system (base
pressure = 10−6 Torr), equipped with a manifold for gas
ﬂow. All catalysts pretreatments and IR measurements
(transmission mode) were performed in situ at 760 Torr,
except during evacuation.
Samples of the prereduced catalyst were heated form
298 to 723 K under O2 ﬂow (100 cm3/min, 5 K/min) and
promptly cooled to 343 K under vacuum. Next, H2 was ad-
mitted into the cell (100 cm3/min) and the temperature was
increased to 723 K (5 K/min). After 30 min at this last con-
dition the cell was evacuated for 20 min at 723 K. Then,
the temperature was gradually decreased under vacuum to
allow for reference IR spectra of the “clean wafers” to be
taken, for reference background subtraction. It is impor-
tant to emphasize that the prereduced catalysts had to be
ﬁrst oxidized under ﬂowing oxygen to remove any remain-
ing bands in the 3000- to 2800-cm−1 region. These spurious
bands usually appear as a consequence of adventitious oil
coming from the process of wafer preparation and they are
attributed to the C–H stretching modes of CHx groups.
A selected set of prereduced samples was ﬁrst cleaned
as described before and then gradually reduced from 298
to 723 K under ﬂowing H2 (100 cm3/min, 5 K/min). After
15 min at this last condition a mixture of H2/D2 = 1/1 v/v
(100 cm3/min) was admitted into the IR cell for 15 min and,
ﬁnally, the gas ﬂow was switched to pure D2 for another
15 min (100 cm3/min). Reference spectra were taken after
20 min of evacuation at 723 K.
Finally, a sample of the calcined PdGa80 catalyst was
treated in ﬂowing H2 (100 cm3/min) after evacuating the
cell for 15 min, as follows: (i) heating from 298 to 723 K
(5 K/min); (ii) cooling, immediately, to 343 K (3 K/min);
(iii) heating from 343 to 723 K (5 K/min); (iv) evacuating to
the base pressure, for 20 min, at 723 K; and, ﬁnally, (v) cool-
ing to room temperature. Again, IR spectra of the clean
wafer were taken under this last cooling process for back-
ground subtraction.
A shimadzu 8210 FT-IR spectrometer with a DLATGS
detector was used to collect the transmission spectra at
4-cm−1 resolution (100 scans). The Microcal Origin® 4.1
software (with Peak ﬁtting module) was employed to cor-
rect the background spectra at each temperature and to
measure peak areas and/or intensities.
Gases
AGA ultrahigh-purity grade H2 (99.999%) and Ar
(99.999%), research grade O2 (99.999%), and high-purity
N2 (99.998%) were further puriﬁed prior to use. Hydrogen,
argon, and nitrogen were passed through molecular sieve
traps (3-A Fisher) and MnO/Al2O3 cartridges to remove
water and oxygen impurities. Oxygen was passed through a
molecular sieve trap (3-A Fisher) and Ascarite® to remove
water and carbon dioxide, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of the Hydrogen Reduction on Pd
and Ga Oxidation States
Table 2 summarizes the binding energy (BE) and kinetic
energy (KE) values of the most relevant palladium and gal-
lium signals, as a function of sample composition, for the
treatments described under Experimental. As an example,
the smoothened XPS spectra of Si 2p, Pd 3d, O 2s, and Ga
3d core levels and the Ga LMM Auger signal are illustrated
in Fig. 1 for the PdGa40 precursor reduced in situ at 523 K.
For silicon, the Si 2p peak for all the samples and after
each treatment was, within the experimental error, char-
acteristic of SiO2 (BE ∼
= 103.1 eV, FWHM ∼
= 2.4 eV) (20).
Palladium 3d5/2 BE values for our catalysts calcined at
673 K were assigned to palladium(II) cations according
to reference data (20, 22). It is well-known that metallic
palladium binding energy values consistently larger than
that of the bulk metal are obtained when metal crystallites
smaller than approximately 4 nm are deposited on the sur-
face of an insulator (22–25). Thus, Pd 3d5/2 peak positions
for the catalysts reduced at T ≥573 K, BE = 335.8–336.4 eV,
correspond to ultradispersed, reduced palladium particles.
A mixture of Pd0 and Pd2+ was obtained over the clean
or gallium-promoted Pd/SiO2 at the lowest reduction tem-
perature (423 K), at variance with our hydrogen-ﬂowing
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results, which
indicated the complete reduction of Pd at 423 K (13). This
disagreement might be due to an insufﬁcient H2 supply in
the XPS pretreatment chamber and/or to a difference (esti-
mated in about 50 K) between the measured temperatures
of the catalysts sample under both diverse reduction treat-
ments, as it is well-known that supported palladium oxide
readily reduces at 393 K (26).
It is important to recall, now, that the average diameter of
the palladium metal particles measured by TEM was almost

c A prereduced catalyst sample was used for this experiment: A sample of the precursor was calcined ex situ in ﬂowing air at 673 K (2 h), prereduced

identical for the whole set of the prereduced catalysts, in
contrast with the decrease of the exposed metal fraction
(FE) in the preparations where the gallium content was
progressively increased (see Table 1). Concurrently with
the TEM measurements, no trend was detected either for
anychemicalshiftofthePd3dsignalaccompanyingahigher
loading of the promoter on the Pd/silica catalyst. Thus, an
impact over the Pd chemical shift owing to the coverage of
the palladium crystallites by gallium species cannot be seen
by XPS. As a consequence, the reported Pd 3d5/2 BE values
for Pd0 in Table 2 should be consider indistinguishable.
The effects of the high-temperature reduction treatments
over the supported gallium oxide appear fairly well in the
XPS spectra: So, two shoulders for the Ga 3d core-level
signal, which are partially overlapped with the O 2s photo-
electron peak, can be already individualized upon reducing
the PdGa40 precursor at 573 K (Fig. 1). More explicitly, the
deconvoluted peaks of the O 2s and Ga 3d photoelectron
lines for the Ga80 and PdGa80 precursors reduced at 723 K
are shown on the rough XPS spectra in Fig. 2.
The most important feature to be emphasized is that the
presence of these two Ga 3d lines, from now on deﬁned as
the high- and low-binding-energy components (HBE and
LBE, respectively) of the Ga 3d signal, was consistently
observed in all the gallium-containing catalysts that had
been reduced at least once at 723 K.
It is clear that the calcination pretreatment of the cata-
lyst precursors at 673 K produced only gallium(III) oxide
on the silica, since bulk gallium nitrate thermally decom-
poses to Ga2O3 above 523 K (27). Hence, the high-energy
peak (HBE) located at approximately 20.8 eV is assigned to
supported Ga3+ species on the calcined materials, whether
Ga/SiO2 or Ga–Pd/SiO2 (see Table 2).
After reduction in hydrogen at 723 K a new Ga 3d signal
appeared at lower energy (LBE) at 19.6 eV for Ga/SiO2.
Separated TPR experiments indicated that incomplete re-
duction of Ga3+ on supported gallium on SiO2 took place
under similar conditions (13). Indeed, hydrogen-reduced
bulk Ga2O3 and mechanical mixtures or impregnated
ZSM-5 zeolite with Ga2O3 have yielded conclusive evi-
dence of the partial reduction of gallium(III) species to
probably Ga1+ cations (28–30). Upon reduction, the low-
energy Ga 3d peak was also present on the gallium-
promoted palladium catalysts, but it became visible at
earlier temperatures, from 423 K onward, coincidentally
with our previous TPR experiments. This last result is in
256

complete agreement with the suggested Pt promotion ef-
fect on the reduction of gallium(III) in Pt–Ga2O3/ZSM-5
by Shpiro et al. (29).
Other alternatives that might account for the appearance
of the LBE band in our reduced Ga–Pd/SiO2 materials are
the formation of metallic gallium and/or Pd–Ga alloy, which
cannot be ruled out completely for at least three reasons:
(i) the chemical shift from Ga1+ (Ga2O) to Ga0 (metallic
gallium) is only 0.3 eV, (ii) alloy formation could induce
an additional chemical shift, and (iii) partial overlapping of
the Ga 3d signal with O 2s peak introduces supplementary
errors in the measurements of peak positions.
Although XPS detection of small amounts of this pre-
sumed alloy would be very difﬁcult, there are two points
that allow us to believe that gallium(III) species were not
totally reduced to metallic gallium. First, because it is hard
to think of a reduction from Ga3+ to Ga0 at temperatures
as low as 423 K in the Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts, as this process
needs much higher temperatures (27) and, second, because
the LBE signal have the same position for Ga/SiO2 and for
Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2 catalysts.
It is then logical to conclude that the Ga 3d LBE compo-
nent of all our catalytic systems corresponds to Gaδ+ species
(δ < 2) originated from supported Ga2Ox (x < 2), probably
Ga1+ or gallium suboxide, Ga2O.
It is interesting that the Ga 3d BE reference values for
bulk gallium compounds, given in Table 2, are slightly lower
than those for supported gallium species, but the opposite
is true for KE Ga LMM signal. Although size effects in
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have not been reported

for metal oxide particles, it has been proved that the de-
veloping of a TiO2–SiO2 interface produces an up- and
downshiftintheTi2pXPSpeakandtheTiAugerparameter
(α′ = BETi 2p + KETi LMV) (31–36), respectively. In our ma-
terials, regardless of the composition and treatment of the
samples, average chemical shift (
BE) and Auger parame-
ter shift (
α′) for gallium, of +0.3 and −1.0 eV, respectively
(mainly produced by oxidized gallium, even under reducing
conditions), with respect to bulk Ga2O3, can be calculated
from Table 2.
The values of these shifts indicate changes in the extra-
atomic relaxation energy rather than a variation of the ini-
tial state, when supporting gallium oxide (37, 38). In princi-
ple, differences in relaxation could be produced by crystal
size and/or support effects. In our case, it is reasonable to
expect that gallium species are mostly dispersed over the
support, as a consequence of the impregnation and drying
procedures used to prepare the samples (see next section).
Furthermore, the occurrence of slightly higher BE values
and lower Auger parameters for gallium oxides deposited
over an insulator, compared to those for bulk gallium ox-
ides, are consistent. It is possible to think, too, that at least
a part of the gallium species are interacting via intimate
contact with the support.
As for Si 2p photoelectron line, the O 2s peak was typical
of silicon oxide (BE ∼
= 25.0 eV, FWHM ∼
= 4.2 eV) (20). We
can then consider that the contribution from gallium oxides
to this signal was negligible.
Quantiﬁcation of the extent of Pd and Ga reduction
was done after deconvoluting the Pd 3d and Ga 3d sig-
nals. The percentages of reduced Pd and Ga, deﬁned as
[Pd0/(Pd0 + Pd2+)] × 100 and [Gaδ+/(Gaδ+ + Ga3+)] × 100,
respectively, are reported in Table 2.
As expected, palladium(II) was fully reduced to metallic
palladium upon heating either the calcined catalyst precur-
sors or the prereduced Pd/SiO2 or Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts in
400 Torr of H2 at 723 K, but the former materials (i.e., the
calcined precursors) showed only partial reduction of the
noble metal upon exposure to lower reduction tempera-
tures. In fact, as was highlighted earlier, supported palla-
dium oxide on silica can be completely transformed into
ﬁnely dispersed metal particles under ﬂowing hydrogen at
temperatures as low as 423 K (13, 26). Again, an estimated
difference of roughly 50 K between the real temperature of
the catalysts pellets and the temperature measured by the
thermocouple inside the XPS pretreatment chamber might
well account for the apparent partial reduction of palladium
in the precursors at this low-temperature reduction condi-
tion. Yet, the very close percentages of reduced palladium
on PdGa00 (72%) and PdGa80 (66%) allow us to conclude
that the presence of gallium had negligible effects over Pd
reduction.
This was not quite true for the case of gallium. Dis-
persed gallium sesquioxide on silica was partially reduced
to Ga2Ox to different percentages depending on the reduc-
tion temperature and/or whether palladium was present
or not. For PdGa80 a fraction of the gallium total (16%)
was already reduced to Gaδ+ at 423 K, while for Ga80 no
gallium (δ+) species could be detected by XPS under this
low-temperature reduction condition. The increase of the
temperature to 723 K allowed further Ga2Ox formation on
both the Ga/SiO2 and Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts, but the per-
centage of reduced gallium (Gaδ+) was never higher than
about a third of the total, using either precursors or the
prereduced catalysts (span, 23–31%; Table 2).
An explanation of this promoting effect of palladium
on the reduction of gallium(III) oxide could arise by tak-
ing into account hydrogen spillover. Palladium oxide starts
reducing on silica at very low temperatures, lower than
373 K (26). The tiny metal crystallites that are formed in
this ﬁrst step are able to dissociate hydrogen molecules.
Chemisorbed hydrogen atoms on Pd0 spill over and re-
duce the closer Ga3+ cations at or above 423 K. However,
this process needs further heating on the calcined Ga/SiO2,
since hydrogen activation of Ga2Ox takes place at higher
temperatures, as is discussed below.
Concerning the aggregation state of the active compo-
nents of our catalysts, XRD experiments over prereduced
catalysts of the highest gallium loading (Ga80 and PdGa80)
conﬁrmed the absence of palladium, gallium–palladium al-
loy, or gallium oxides particles bigger than 4 nm. Nishi et al.

peaks for gallium loading higher than 4.8 wt%, whereas
amorphous gallium oxide prevailed for lower gallium con-
tents (39). Hence, by no means do our XRD results con-
tradict the data of Nishi and coworkers, since more drastic
drying and calcination conditions were used in their ex-
periments. We conclude, then, that ﬁnely dispersed mixed
gallium oxides and/or metallic palladium are spread over
the silica support on each of our reduced catalysts.
Gallium–Hydrogen Bond Formation as Detected
by IR Spectroscopy
After exposing the prereduced gallium and gallium–
palladium-containing catalysts to ﬂowing hydrogen at
343 K, a low-intensity, broad IR bond at 3000 cm−1 together
with an overlapped band corresponding to the ν(OH) band
of interacting silanol groups via hydrogen bonding over the
catalysts, at approximately 3550 cm−1, were immediately
formed. The source of these hydroxyl bands is mainly as-
cribed to water formation, from the reduction of palladium
and gallium oxides which were produced during the clean-
ing process (oxidation step).
The intensity of the band at 3000 cm−1 increased with the
total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on
unpromoted Pd/SiO2. Due to its proximity to the hydroxyl
stretching bands, it was assigned to the stretching mode of
interacting hydroxyl groups on the surface of gallium oxide
particles.
Those ν(OH) bands, and the δ(OH) band at 1630 cm−1,
disappeared simultaneously after heating in hydrogen, as
water was removed from the surface of the materials. Once
at 723 K, it was possible to observe only a band at 3670 cm−1
in the gallium-containing catalysts (Fig. 3). Still, it was dif-

ﬁcult to follow its evolution at temperatures lower than
700 K, due to its superposition with Si–OH bands. The band
at 3670 cm−1 was assigned to the O–H stretching mode in
Ga–OH or Si–O(H)–Ga, in agreement with other reported
values (40–42). We assumed that this band is involved in
the development or evolution of the main infrared signal at
2020 cm−1, discussed in the following paragraphs.
Figure 4 shows the formation of an infrared band at ap-
proximately 2020 cm−1 on prereduced Ga–Pd/SiO2 with
the highest total gallium content (PdGa80), upon heating
the catalyst under ﬂowing hydrogen. This band could be
reliably measured against the background above approxi-
mately 500 K (2027 cm−1). Its intensity grew up until 660 K
and then leveled off at higher temperatures (2015 cm−1).
A comparison of the intensity of this band with total gal-
lium loading on Ga/SiO2 and Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts at 723 K
under hydrogen is shown in Fig. 5. This ﬁgure discloses that
Pd/SiO2 is unable to form the surface species or bond re-
sponsible for the band at 2020 cm−1. As for the other cata-
lysts, it can be readily inferred that the only requisite for its
development is the presence of gallium, because the band
intensity is proportional to the Ga weight loading. Irrespec-
tiveofthepalladiumcontent,thebandpositionshiftedfrom
2026 to 2015 cm−1 as the gallium loading went from 2.6 to

however, it was extremely relevant to pay close attention to
GALLIUM–HYDROGEN BOND FORMATION

this spectral region, which was accomplished by means of
designated experiments, using H2, D2, and their mixtures,
as discussed next.
The origin of the 2020-cm−1 band was attributed to
gallium–hydrogen bond formation and was assigned to the
stretching mode of Gaδ+–H, ν(Ga–H). Three aspects of all
spectra we judge to be critical to the unambiguous iden-
tiﬁcation of this assignment. The ﬁrst one is related to
the wavenumber position of this band when compared to
molecular model systems, the second one to the relation-
ship between the content of Gaδ+ species and the intensity
of the ν(Ga–H) band, and the last to the wavenumber posi-
tion of the peaks when performing H–D isotopic exchange
experiments, as follows:
(i) The infrared spectra of pure and nonpure gallanes
show different Ga–H bands, e.g., stretching, bending,
torsion, and combination modes. Of those modes, only
one stretching mode arises at wavenumbers higher than
1300 cm−1, i.e., in our transparent region of infrared spec-
tra, and this mode belongs, in particular, to a terminal Ga–
H bond, ν(Ga–Hterminal) or, hereafter, ν(Ga–H) (43–50).
Table 3 summarizes the infrared band positions for this last
mode in model systems. It shows that the ν(Ga–H) mode for
gallanes lies between 2050 and 1800 cm−1. Then, if Gaδ+–H
is formed by reacting Ga2Ox with hydrogen in our cata-
lysts, no more than one band would be expected to show up
at a wavenumber higher than 1800 cm−1 in our diagnostic
region, as it is found.
Meriaudeau and Primet attributed their IR signal at
2020cm−1 toGa–Hspeciesoverpartiallyreducedα-Ga2O3,
which is identical to our result regarding this infrared peak
(40). To our knowledge, these authors reported the ﬁrst and
onlyevidencebyadirectmethodofgallium–hydrogenbond
formation on a material surface, which we corroborate on
the surface of our catalysts.
(ii) The evolutions of the 2020-cm−1 peak intensity for all
our prereduced catalysts versus temperature increase are
displayed in Fig. 6. This band developed gradually while
the temperature was raised, over both the Ga/SiO2 and
the Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Then the band height ﬂattened,
from 660 K onward, keeping its maximum intensity value.
This ﬁnal intensity value (T > 653 K) increased with total
gallium content in either the gallium or gallium–palladium-
containing catalysts.
Figure 7 condenses this last ﬁnding and shows that the
2020-cm−1 peak intensity is directly proportional to the to-
tal gallium content (lower scale). Moreover, since the Gaδ+
fraction is almost the same when using different total gal-
lium loading (see Table 2), these intensity values, as also
shown in Fig. 7, have a linear relationship with the Gaδ+
loading, too (upper scale).
Similar behavior was observed for the O–H band at
3670 cm−1, although the quantiﬁcation had more random

at 723 K are summarized in Fig. 8. After switching from
H2 to the H2/D2 equimolar mixture, a decrease in the in-

band at 1450 cm−1 shows up in the gallium-containing sam-
ples (Ga80 and PdGa80) and, under pure D2, only the
1450-cm−1 peak appears on these catalysts. The experi-
mental value for the ratio between these wavenumbers is
1.39, which is the expected one for the ν(Ga–H) versus the
ν(Ga–D) modes, i.e., 1.40. Similarly, the wavenumber ratio
observed between the O–H and O–D bands at 3670 and
2709 cm−1, respectively, was close to the theoretical value:
1.35 (experimental) vs 1.37 (theoretical). Therefore, these
results prove unambiguosly that the 2020-cm−1 signal cor-
responds to a hydrogen-containing species.
Asmentionedabove,the2027-cm−1 infraredpeakshifted
downward to about −12 cm−1 when going from a low to a
high loading of gallium, i.e., lower energy is required for the
Ga–H bond vibration upon increasing the concentration of
surface Gaδ+–H species over gallium or gallium–palladium
catalysts (see Figs. 4 and 5).
We rule out the hypothesis of formation of surface GaHx
species (x > 1) which can cause this shift. If such multiple-
hydrogenated species were formed, we would have ex-
pected that the observed change in wavenumber would
not depend on gallium loading but rather on the amount
of these new species produced upon increasing the reduc-
tion temperature. Also, for GaH2 species two stretching
modes, symmetric and antisymmetric, are predicted. In-
teraction among Gaδ+–H adspecies as the gallium loading
(or the amount of this species) goes up is a more feasible

interpretation of the gradual small change of the wavenum-
ber position for the ν(Ga–H) mode (static shift?) (51).
Now, the most controversial point seems to be the ther-
mal stability of said Gaδ+–H species. On the one side,
Meriaudeau and Primet (40) have postulated that the
gallium–hydrogen bond formation mostly occurs by het-
erolyticcleavageofthehydrogenmolecule,atleastat573K,
to yield Gay+–H (y < 3) and OH species: After heating
precalcined α-Ga2O3 under 105 Torr of H2 at 573 K, the
2020- and 3640-cm−1 bands appeared. The use of deu-
terium helped them to prove the assignments (40). Sub-
sequently, Meriaudeau and Primet claimed that outgassing
the sample at increasing temperatures from 323 K produced
the decrease in these bands, which ﬁnally disappeared at
750 K. Owing to insufﬁcient experimental details in their
work (e.g., temperature of spectra acquisition and back-
ground subtraction, evacuation time, presumptive impu-
rities in the samples that originated other high-frequency
peaks at 3740 cm−1), a direct comparison with our results
is difﬁcult. In particular, the duration of evacuation could
be a crucial aspect. As Fig. 9 illustrates, upon outgassing
our Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts at 723 K (10−5 Torr), the 2020-
and 3670-cm−1 peaks disappeared after 15 min. The same
result was obtained over Ga/SiO2 at 653 K. Meriaudeau
and Primet observed similar behavior for bulk α-Ga2O3,
but only at about 750 K (40). At lower temperatures, both
infrared signals remained in their experiment, probably
due to a fast scanning temperature under evacuation used
by these authors. Also, it is possible to expect a differ-
ent thermal stability for Gaδ+–H on the surface of a bulk
Ga2O3 matrix compared to the silica-supported gallium
oxide.
Nevertheless, it is more interesting to note the immediate
redevelopment of the ν(Ga–H) and ν(O–H) bands after hy-
drogen ﬂow restoration into the IR cell at 723 K (see Fig. 9).
This result proves the reversibility of the reaction of Gaδ+–
H bond formation. Moreover, the spectra did not differ
signiﬁcantly when the background subtraction of either the
calcined or the prereduced sample was performed. There-
fore, the gallium–hydrogen signal is undoubtedly removed
after 15 min of evacuation. In other words, the Gaδ+–H
bond breaks (or Gaδ+–H species decomposes) under evac-
uation at temperatures higher than 653 K.
On the other side, Meitzner et al., studied the chemi-
cal state of gallium on a Ga/H–ZSM-5 catalyst by in situ
X-ray absorption spectroscopy during the conversion of
alkanes to aromatics (10). Under H2, they proposed that
Ga3+ cations were reduced to Gaδ+ (with δ between 0 and
1) at 780 K, suggesting the existence of gallium hydride
monomeric species (GaHx) coordinated to one or more
basic framework oxygen within the zeolite channels. After
cooling to room temperature, they found that those gallium
species decomposed and suggested that this was the result
of gallium oxidation to Ga3+, probably by protons located
at bridging hydroxyl and silanol groups, formed during the
reduction step.
We believe that this might well be our case. Figure 10
shows the ν(Ga–H) band formation/decomposition over
a sample of calcined PdGa80 catalyst. In the ﬁrst step,
the onset for Ga–H formation was approximately 523 K,
although we know that gallium (3+) is partially re-
duced to gallium (δ+) at temperatures lower than 450 K

when palladium is present (see XPS section). The in-
tensity of this band increased up to 723 K. The second
and third steps, cooling and heating the already reduced
sample under hydrogen, exhibited an onset of the in-
tensity of the Gaδ+–H stretching mode at approximately
473 K, i.e., at identical onset temperature and band de-
velopment as those over prereduced samples, shown in
Fig. 6.
An additional XPS experiment was made, introducing an
outgassedsampleoftheprereducedandpassivatedPdGa80
catalyst, without further treatment, into the UHV chamber.
The experiment showed that 20% of total gallium was in the
reduced state (i.e., about 30% less than the in situ reduced
precursor), indicating that our passivation treatment is able
to keep most of the Gaδ+ (δ < 2) under this low-oxidation
state. This result was also conﬁrmed in a separated TPR
experiment over Ga80, which means that Gaδ+ species are
stabilized probably by the support. The ﬁnding seems to
be congruent with the stability of Ga1+ against oxidation
in air up to ∼773 K, as reported in Ga+–β′′–alumina and
GaZr2(PO4)3 by Wilkinson (52).
All together, these results may be rationalized by consid-
ering the following. Some authors have indicated, based on
spectroscopic evidence, that gallium suboxide (Ga2O) mi-
gration could explain the transfer of gallium from the outer
into the channel system of zeolite matrices [e.g., in H–ZSM-
5 (28–30) and faujasite zeolites (41)], upon hydrogen reduc-
tion. Truly, the sublimation temperature of bulk gallium
suboxide (Ga2O) is higher than 773 K (27, 53) but, on the
other hand, it can be argued that the Tammann temperature
of said suboxide is 603 K (29). Hence, our IR results using
the calcined Ga–Pd/SiO2 precursor suggest that during a
ﬁrst exposure to hydrogen, not only does Ga2O3 reduce to
Ga2O, next to Pd particles, but also the suboxide migrates to
silica surface sites where Gaδ+ species could be stabilized by
oxygen atoms of the support and could form Ga–H bonds
(see Fig. 10, step 1). Once these reduced gallium cations
are produced, they do not go back to their initial sites, mak-
ing possible the evolution of Gaδ+–H species at lower tem-
peratures upon H2 exposure, and thus resembling the pre-
reduced Ga/SiO2 or Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts. Therefore, the
ν(Ga–H) IR signal in steps 2 and 3 of Fig. 10 exhibits the
same evolution as in Fig. 6. For this to happen the hydro-
genmoleculeisheterolyticallycleavedtogiveSiO · · · Ga–H
(2020 cm−1) and SiO · · · Ga–OH (3670 cm−1). This reaction
is reversible, whether under evacuation or by just lower-
ing the temperature. Reacting in this way, reduced gallium
cations would disproportionate, changing their formal av-
erage oxidation state.
Finally, we conclude that our method of preparation
of the gallium-promoted Pd/SiO2 catalysts, including the
prereduction and passivation treatments, is able to pro-
duce materials which are stable under air exposure and
manipulation.
Role of Ga–H Formation over the Hydrogenation
Catalytic Properties of Gallium
Two extra FTIR experiments were made, by increas-
ing the temperature from 298 to 723 K at 3 K/min, un-
der a ﬂow of 100 cm3/min of pure CO2 or a H2/CO2 mix-
ture (H2 : CO2 = 3 : 1) at 760 Torr fed into the infrared cell
containing a sample of prereduced Ga40 catalyst cleaned
in situ by reoxidization and reduction, as described un-
der Experimental. Using pure CO2, neither carbonates
nor hydrogenated carbon species were detected by in-
frared spectroscopy within the temperature window, unlike
the case of calcium-promoted Pd/SiO2 (54). The usage of
the reacting H2/CO2 mixture changed the picture dramati-
cally, though. Already at 423 K bidentated formate species
[νas(OCO) = 1598 cm−1] were formed, and its amount went
up to 600 K, paralleling the increase in intensity of the
Ga–H stretching signal (Fig. 11). Above this last tem-
perature the amount of surface formates decreased, giv-
ing rise to metoxi species [νas(CH3O) = 2956 cm−1 and
νs(CH3O) = 2858 cm−1], while the amount of Ga–H bonds
was kept almost unchanged. Thus, it is possible to posit that
carbon dioxide hydrogenation takes place via H2 dissocia-
tion by reduced gallium oxide (Ga2Ox), forming Gaδ+–H
species which are able to hydrogenate CO2, stepwise, to
formate and metoxi species.

results could readily explain the observed activity of
Ga/SiO2 to methanol and dimethyl ether from CO2/H2 at
553 K under high-pressure conditions (3 MPa) (13). Nev-
ertheless, it is not straightforward to correlate just gallium–
hydrogen bond development with methanol formation
on gallium–palladium/silica catalysts, which are ∼500-fold
moreactiveinthissynthesisunderpseudo-steady-statecon-
dition. Further infrared experiments showing the beneﬁcial
effect of gallium over palladium in carbon dioxide hydro-
genation to methanol on these promoted catalysts will be
reported shortly (56).
CONCLUSIONS
Apalladiumpromotioneffectwasfoundonthereduction
of silica-supported gallium(III) oxide. After the calcination
of dried Ga(NO3)3/SiO2 to Ga2O3/SiO2, some Ga3+ cations
were reduced to Gaδ+ (δ < 2) upon heating in hydrogen at
723 K. However, a much lower temperature (<523 K) was
required when both palladium and gallium were present on
the support. This promotional effect is ascribed to spillover
of atomic hydrogen from metallic palladium to close Ga3+
cations, as hydrogen activation by gallium oxide occurs at
higher temperatures.
The most important band observed in the infrared spec-
tra was located at 2020 cm−1. This band appeared on both
Ga/SiO2 and Ga–Pd/SiO2 catalysts and was assigned to
the stretching mode of Gaδ+–H bond. A linear relation-
ship between the intensity of this band and the content
of reduced gallium was found. We suggest that the Gaδ+
cations, stabilized by coordination to oxygen atoms of the
silica, are able to form gallium–hydrogen bonds over the
surface of our supported catalysts, probably by heterolyt-
ical cleavage of the H2 molecule to yield Ga–H and Ga–
OH bonds simultaneously. Regardless of whether the ma-
terials contain palladium or not, the extent of gallium–
hydrogen bond formation on prereduced catalysts in con-
tact with H2 starts at approximately 473 K and increases
steadily until a plateau is reached over 653 K. The Gaδ+–
H species are unstable below 450 K; they can be decom-
posed under evacuation at temperatures higher than 653 K
but may be rapidly regenerated upon replenishing the H2
atmosphere.
We believe that the hydrogenation–dehydrogenation ca-
pability of gallium-supported catalysts is closely related to
the hydrogen dissociation unraveled by the Ga–H bond
formation/decomposition that can be observed by FTIR.
The behavior of these Gaδ+–H species demands that we
carry out the catalytic reactions close to or inside their
thermal stability region, to ensure their rapid formation/
decomposition. Hence, the hydrogenation of carbon oxides
to surface species can take place on Ga/SiO2 only if Gaδ+–H
species are formed, i.e., above 450 K. Higher temperatures
allow this reaction to proceed to more hydrogenated inter-
mediates which eventually desorb from the surface, as in
the case of methanol synthesis.
