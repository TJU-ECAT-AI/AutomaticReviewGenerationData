The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 Or the borosilicate.
It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes.
The selectivity to aromatics as high as 72% was obtained over Ga-ZSM-5.
The main aromatic products are benzene, toluene and xylenes.
The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons was almost constant at 30% over 573 K.
The formation of one aromatic molecule must result in the formation of three paraffin molecules.
The fact that zinc cations are effective for the dehydrogenation of olefins was further supported by the reaction of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate.

1. The introduction of Ga or Zn cations significantly increases the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons during the conversion of alkanes and alkenes over ZSM-5 zeolites or borosilicates. These metals act as dehydrogenation catalysts, producing allylic species from olefins. The highest selectivity for aromatics reaches 72% over Ga-ZSM-5.

2. The main products derived from propene conversion are benzene, toluene, and xylenes.

3. At 573 K, the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons remains stable at around 30%.

4. The formation of one aromatic compound leads to the production of three paraffin molecules.

5. Zinc cations demonstrate effectiveness in the dehydrogenation of olefins, as evidenced by the conversion of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate.

1. 添加Ga或Zn离子可以显著提高ZSM-5沸石或硼硅酸盐中烷烃和烯烃转换过程中的芳烃产率。这些金属作为脱氢催化剂，从烯烃产生亚甲基物种。在Ga-ZSM-5上的最高选择性可达72%。

2. 丙烯转化的主要产物是苯、甲苯和二甲苯。

3. 在573 K时，芳香烃的产率保持稳定，约为30%。

4. 形成一个芳香化合物导致生成三个烷烃分子。

5. 钴离子在硼硅酸盐上转化丁-1-烯显示出有效的脱氢作用。
