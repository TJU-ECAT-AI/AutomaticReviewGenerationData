[1] "The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 Or the borosilicate."
[2] "Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
[3] "Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
[4] "It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
[5] "The fact that zinc cations are effective for the dehydrogenation of olefins was further supported by the reaction of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include understanding the precise location and state of Ga within the catalyst, its interactions with the surrounding environment, and how these factors influence PDH activity and selectivity. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the catalyst's properties during the PDH process. These methods allow researchers to monitor changes in the catalyst's structure, acidity, and active sites, thereby facilitating the exploration of structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. By doing so, these techniques enable a deeper understanding of how Ga speciation affects PDH performance and product distribution, leading to optimized catalyst design and operation conditions.
