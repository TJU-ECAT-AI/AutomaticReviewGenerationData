"Over H-, Ga- and Zn-ZSM-5 and the corresponding borosilicates has been studied."
"It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
"The present authors [9] studied the reaction of propane over Zn-ZSM-5 and con- cluded that zinc cations act as an acceptor of hydride from propane molecules."
"Here again,the first aromatic products observed were mainly xylenes,indicating that the aromatics are formed from two C4-moieties."

The primary challenge in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions is the lack of direct insight into the specific roles and interactions of Ga within the catalyst structure. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time information on the catalyst's state during PDH. These techniques allow researchers to observe changes in the catalyst's surface properties, phase composition, and electronic structure, which are crucial for understanding the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. By monitoring these changes, scientists can correlate the catalyst's performance with its internal structure, leading to a deeper understanding of the PDH mechanism and optimizing the catalyst design for enhanced efficiency and selectivity.
