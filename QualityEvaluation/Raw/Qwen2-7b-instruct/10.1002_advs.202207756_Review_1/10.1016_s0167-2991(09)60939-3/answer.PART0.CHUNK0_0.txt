"Over ZSM-5, the interconversion of olefins proceeds much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons."
"Over borosilicates, the rate of the olefin interconversion proceeds much more slowly, and the main aromatic products from propene and I-butene are benzene and xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at higher reaction temperatures."
"It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species from olefins in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes."
"The yield of aromatics is greatly enhanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 or the borosilicate."

The primary challenge in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involves understanding the precise role and location of Ga within the catalyst structure. In situ or operando characterization techniques are crucial because they allow researchers to observe the catalyst's properties and transformations during the reaction without interrupting the process. These methods contribute to overcoming the challenge by providing real-time data on the catalyst's surface chemistry, which is essential for understanding its structure-activity relationships. By using such techniques, scientists can correlate the catalyst's performance with its internal structure, leading to a better understanding of how Ga affects PDH efficiency and product distribution. This understanding can guide the development of more active and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
