[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over traditional methods in the production of propylene."
[2] "One of the main challenges faced by conventional production methods is the availability of suitable feedstocks, which often require significant preprocessing or are limited in supply."
[3] "PDH technology specifically addresses these issues by utilizing propane as its primary feedstock, which is widely available and requires minimal preparation."
[4] "In terms of process efficiency, PDH demonstrates higher energy utilization rates compared to traditional catalytic cracking methods, leading to lower operational costs."
[5] "Regarding product selectivity, PDH shows improved conversion yields, producing a higher proportion of propylene with reduced byproduct formation, thus enhancing overall economic viability."
