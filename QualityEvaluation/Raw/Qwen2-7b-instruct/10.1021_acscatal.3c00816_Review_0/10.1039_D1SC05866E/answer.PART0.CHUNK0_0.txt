[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."
[3] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework In(i) in chabazite zeolites has been investigated to understand the effect of the support on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[5] "Indium on silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with a range of In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios, have been investigated."
[6] "It is found that In2O3 is formed on the external surface of the zeolite crystal after the addition of In(NO3)3 to H-CHA by incipient wetness impregnation and calcination."
[7] "Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA)."
[8] "The reduced indium is different from the indium species observed on samples of 10In/SiO2, 10In/Al2O3 (i.e., 10 wt% indium) and bulk In2O3, in which In2O3 was reduced to In(0)."
[9] "In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."
[10] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The growing global demand for propylene, along with the low cost of propane derived from shale gas, has renewed interest in PDH. Conventional methods, such as the Catofin process using a chromium oxide/aluminum oxide catalyst and the Oleflex process using a supported platinum-tin catalyst, suffer from high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation, as well as environmental concerns. PDH offers a more efficient and cost-effective alternative.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by providing a direct route to propylene from propane, without the need for additional conversion steps. It utilizes a wide range of catalyst materials, including gallium, zinc, cobalt, iron, vanadium, zirconium, and nanocarbon, to achieve high propylene yields and selectivity. In particular, the use of indium in zeolite chabazite (CHA) zeolites has been shown to offer improved stability and higher propylene selectivity, making it a highly promising approach for propylene production.

3. The stability and selectivity of the indium-based catalysts, especially those in zeolite chabazite (In-CHA), are attributed to the formation of extra-framework indium (In+) species upon reduction. This configuration prevents the deep reduction of indium oxide (In2O3) to indium (In(0)), ensuring the stability of the catalyst and improving the selectivity of propylene production. The indium species in CHA zeolites are involved in a catalytic cycle that proceeds through oxidative addition, β-H elimination, and reductive elimination, leading to the formation of propylene with high selectivity and minimal formation of coke.

4. The use of a high silicon-to-aluminum (Si/Al) ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH, as it reduces the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple indium (In+) cations. This results in a more stable and selective catalyst, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as cracking.

1. PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。全球对丙烯的需求增长以及从页岩气中获取低成本丙烷的现状，重新激发了对PDH的兴趣。传统的工艺，如使用铬氧化物/铝氧化物催化剂的Catofin过程和使用支持型铂锡催化剂的Oleflex过程，存在高成本和催化剂快速失活的问题，以及潜在的环境影响。PDH提供了一种更高效、成本效益更高的替代方案。

2. PDH技术通过提供直接从丙烷到丙烯的途径，解决了这些挑战，无需额外的转换步骤。它利用各种催化剂材料，包括镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆和纳米碳，以实现高丙烯产率和选择性。特别是，在CHA沸石中使用铟的催化剂显示出改进的稳定性和更高选择性的丙烯生产潜力，使其成为丙烯生产的有前途的方法。

3. 铟基催化剂的稳定性和选择性，尤其是那些在CHA沸石（In-CHA）中的催化剂，归因于还原后形成的额外框架铟（In+）物种。这种配置防止了铟氧化物（In2O3）的深度还原至铟（In(0)），确保了催化剂的稳定性并提高了丙烯生产的高选择性。CHA沸石中的铟物种参与催化循环，通过氧化加成、β-H消除和还原消除，导致高选择性地形成丙烯，并且最小化焦炭的生成。

4. 在CHA沸石中使用高硅/铝（Si/Al）比是有益的PDH，因为它减少了CHA笼中多个铟（In+）离子的数量。这导致了更稳定的催化剂，促进丙烷脱氢为丙烯的同时，减少不希望的副反应，如裂解。
