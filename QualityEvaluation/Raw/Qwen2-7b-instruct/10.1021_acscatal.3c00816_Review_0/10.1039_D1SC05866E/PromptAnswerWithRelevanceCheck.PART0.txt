1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The growing global demand for propylene, along with the low cost of propane derived from shale gas, has renewed interest in PDH. Conventional methods, such as the Catofin process using a chromium oxide/aluminum oxide catalyst and the Oleflex process using a supported platinum-tin catalyst, suffer from high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation, as well as environmental concerns. PDH offers a more efficient and cost-effective alternative.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by providing a direct route to propylene from propane, without the need for additional conversion steps. It utilizes a wide range of catalyst materials, including gallium, zinc, cobalt, iron, vanadium, zirconium, and nanocarbon, to achieve high propylene yields and selectivity. In particular, the use of indium in zeolite chabazite (CHA) zeolites has been shown to offer improved stability and higher propylene selectivity, making it a highly promising approach for propylene production.

3. The stability and selectivity of the indium-based catalysts, especially those in zeolite chabazite (In-CHA), are attributed to the formation of extra-framework indium (In+) species upon reduction. This configuration prevents the deep reduction of indium oxide (In2O3) to indium (In(0)), ensuring the stability of the catalyst and improving the selectivity of propylene production. The indium species in CHA zeolites are involved in a catalytic cycle that proceeds through oxidative addition, β-H elimination, and reductive elimination, leading to the formation of propylene with high selectivity and minimal formation of coke.

4. The use of a high silicon-to-aluminum (Si/Al) ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH, as it reduces the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple indium (In+) cations. This results in a more stable and selective catalyst, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as cracking.

1. PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。全球对丙烯的需求增长以及从页岩气中获取低成本丙烷的现状，重新激发了对PDH的兴趣。传统的工艺，如使用铬氧化物/铝氧化物催化剂的Catofin过程和使用支持型铂锡催化剂的Oleflex过程，存在高成本和催化剂快速失活的问题，以及潜在的环境影响。PDH提供了一种更高效、成本效益更高的替代方案。

2. PDH技术通过提供直接从丙烷到丙烯的途径，解决了这些挑战，无需额外的转换步骤。它利用各种催化剂材料，包括镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆和纳米碳，以实现高丙烯产率和选择性。特别是，在CHA沸石中使用铟的催化剂显示出改进的稳定性和更高选择性的丙烯生产潜力，使其成为丙烯生产的有前途的方法。

3. 铟基催化剂的稳定性和选择性，尤其是那些在CHA沸石（In-CHA）中的催化剂，归因于还原后形成的额外框架铟（In+）物种。这种配置防止了铟氧化物（In2O3）的深度还原至铟（In(0)），确保了催化剂的稳定性并提高了丙烯生产的高选择性。CHA沸石中的铟物种参与催化循环，通过氧化加成、β-H消除和还原消除，导致高选择性地形成丙烯，并且最小化焦炭的生成。

4. 在CHA沸石中使用高硅/铝（Si/Al）比是有益的PDH，因为它减少了CHA笼中多个铟（In+）离子的数量。这导致了更稳定的催化剂，促进丙烷脱氢为丙烯的同时，减少不希望的副反应，如裂解。

[4] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;33,34 however, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[5] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."
[7] "Isolated In+ sites in the CHA zeolite favor dehydrogenation over cracking under all the conditions investigated."
[8] "For In-CHA, the C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels (Fig. 11a)."
[9] "The dehydrogenation selectivity over In-CHA is much higher than the selectivity observed over In/SiO2, In/Al2O3 and bulk In2O3."

1. The growing global demand for propylene and the low cost of propane derived from shale gas have revitalized interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology directly converts propane into propylene, addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on crude oil, PDH can utilize abundant natural gas resources, particularly from shale formations. This not only diversifies feedstock sources but also potentially reduces reliance on volatile crude oil markets. 

2. Conventional PDH technologies, such as the Catofin and Oleflex processes, face significant drawbacks, including high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation. These issues limit the economic viability and scalability of these technologies. In contrast, PDH using zeolite-based catalysts, like Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts, shows promise for overcoming these limitations.

3. The use of indium (In) as a catalyst in PDH processes is particularly intriguing due to its ability to enhance stability and selectivity for propylene production. Indium on various supports, such as silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with specific ratios of In/Al and Si/Al, enables efficient conversion of propane to propylene. The formation of indium oxide (In2O3) on the external surface of the zeolite crystal and its subsequent reduction to indium ions (In+) in the CHA zeolite structure highlights the unique properties of indium in PDH catalysts. 

4. The ability of indium to maintain its +1 oxidation state as isolated species in extra-framework positions within the CHA zeolite provides enhanced stability and selectivity for propylene production. This is in contrast to indium species on silica, alumina, and bulk In2O3, which tend to reduce to the 0 oxidation state (In(0)). The CHA zeolite stabilizes indium in a highly reactive form, facilitating its role in the PDH reaction.

5. The use of indium in PDH catalysts leads to improved stability and propylene selectivity, with a high yield of propylene (85%) and lower yields of byproducts like methane and ethylene. This is attributed to a low activation energy for C3H8 dehydrogenation (94.3 kJ/mol) and a higher activation energy for C3H8 cracking (206 kJ/mol) in the In-CHA catalyst. This selectivity makes PDH using indium catalysts particularly advantageous for propylene production.

1. 随着全球对丙烯需求的增长和来自页岩气的廉价丙烷成本，对丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的兴趣得以复苏。PDH技术，如使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用支持的PtSn催化剂的Oleflex工艺，存在高成本和铂快速失活以及Cr可能产生的环境影响等缺点。相比之下，PDH技术直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与依赖于不稳定原油市场的传统方法不同，PDH可以利用丰富的天然气资源，尤其是页岩形成的资源。这不仅多样化了原料来源，而且可能减少了对原油市场的依赖。

2. 传统的PDH技术，如Catofin和Oleflex工艺，面临高昂成本和催化剂快速失效的问题，这些限制了这些技术的经济性和可扩展性。相比之下，基于沸石的催化剂，如Ga-、Zn-、Co-、Fe-、V-、Zr基材料和纳米碳催化剂，显示出在丙烯生产中克服这些局限性的潜力。

3. 使用铟（In）作为PDH过程中的催化剂特别引人注目，因为它能够增强稳定性和丙烯产率。铟在不同的支持物上，如二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石查贝兹石（CHA），具有特定的In/Al和Si/Al比，可以有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。在沸石晶体外部形成氧化铟（In2O3）并在氢气气氛中还原到铟离子（In+）在CHA沸石结构中的特性表明了铟在PDH催化剂中的独特性质。

4. 在CHA沸石中稳定铟为+1氧化态作为额外框架位置的孤立物种提供了增强的稳定性和选择性，以促进丙烯生产。与在二氧化硅、氧化铝和批量In2O3上的铟物种倾向于减少到0氧化态（In(0)）的情况相比。CHA沸石稳定了铟的活性形式，从而促进了PDH反应。

5. 使用铟的PDH催化剂带来了改进的稳定性和丙烯选择性，丙烯产量高达85%，而甲烷和乙烷等副产品的产量较低。这归因于C3H8脱氢的低激活能（94.3 kJ/mol）和C3H8裂解的高激活能（206 kJ/mol）。因此，使用铟催化剂的PDH尤其有利于丙烯生产。
