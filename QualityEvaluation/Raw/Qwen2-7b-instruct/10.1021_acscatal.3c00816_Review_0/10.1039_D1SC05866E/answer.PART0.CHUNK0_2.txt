[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."
[3] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
[4] "Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "Indium on silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with a range of In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios, have been investigated to understand the effect of the support on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[6] "It is found that In2O3 is formed on the external surface of the zeolite crystal after the addition of In(NO3)3 to H-CHA by incipient wetness impregnation and calcination."
[7] "Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA)."
[8] "A stoichiometric ratio of 1.5 of formed H2O to consumed H2 during H2 pulsed reduction experiments confirms the indium oxidation state of +1."
[9] "The reduced indium is different from the indium species observed on samples of 10In/SiO2, 10In/Al2O3 (i.e., 10 wt% indium) and bulk In2O3, in which In2O3 was reduced to In(0), as determined from the X-ray diffraction patterns of the product, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles, pulse reactor investigations and in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy."
[10] "Isolated In+ cations in the CHA zeolite can be oxidized with O2 to form indium oxide species and can be reduced again with H2 quantitatively."
[11] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

1. The growing global demand for propylene and the low cost of propane derived from shale gas have revitalized interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology directly converts propane into propylene, addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on crude oil, PDH can utilize abundant natural gas resources, particularly from shale formations. This not only diversifies feedstock sources but also potentially reduces reliance on volatile crude oil markets. 

2. Conventional PDH technologies, such as the Catofin and Oleflex processes, face significant drawbacks, including high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation. These issues limit the economic viability and scalability of these technologies. In contrast, PDH using zeolite-based catalysts, like Ga-, Zn-, Co-, Fe-, V-, Zr-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts, shows promise for overcoming these limitations.

3. The use of indium (In) as a catalyst in PDH processes is particularly intriguing due to its ability to enhance stability and selectivity for propylene production. Indium on various supports, such as silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with specific ratios of In/Al and Si/Al, enables efficient conversion of propane to propylene. The formation of indium oxide (In2O3) on the external surface of the zeolite crystal and its subsequent reduction to indium ions (In+) in the CHA zeolite structure highlights the unique properties of indium in PDH catalysts. 

4. The ability of indium to maintain its +1 oxidation state as isolated species in extra-framework positions within the CHA zeolite provides enhanced stability and selectivity for propylene production. This is in contrast to indium species on silica, alumina, and bulk In2O3, which tend to reduce to the 0 oxidation state (In(0)). The CHA zeolite stabilizes indium in a highly reactive form, facilitating its role in the PDH reaction.

5. The use of indium in PDH catalysts leads to improved stability and propylene selectivity, with a high yield of propylene (85%) and lower yields of byproducts like methane and ethylene. This is attributed to a low activation energy for C3H8 dehydrogenation (94.3 kJ/mol) and a higher activation energy for C3H8 cracking (206 kJ/mol) in the In-CHA catalyst. This selectivity makes PDH using indium catalysts particularly advantageous for propylene production.

1. 随着全球对丙烯需求的增长和来自页岩气的廉价丙烷成本，对丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的兴趣得以复苏。PDH技术，如使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用支持的PtSn催化剂的Oleflex工艺，存在高成本和铂快速失活以及Cr可能产生的环境影响等缺点。相比之下，PDH技术直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与依赖于不稳定原油市场的传统方法不同，PDH可以利用丰富的天然气资源，尤其是页岩形成的资源。这不仅多样化了原料来源，而且可能减少了对原油市场的依赖。

2. 传统的PDH技术，如Catofin和Oleflex工艺，面临高昂成本和催化剂快速失效的问题，这些限制了这些技术的经济性和可扩展性。相比之下，基于沸石的催化剂，如Ga-、Zn-、Co-、Fe-、V-、Zr基材料和纳米碳催化剂，显示出在丙烯生产中克服这些局限性的潜力。

3. 使用铟（In）作为PDH过程中的催化剂特别引人注目，因为它能够增强稳定性和丙烯产率。铟在不同的支持物上，如二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石查贝兹石（CHA），具有特定的In/Al和Si/Al比，可以有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。在沸石晶体外部形成氧化铟（In2O3）并在氢气气氛中还原到铟离子（In+）在CHA沸石结构中的特性表明了铟在PDH催化剂中的独特性质。

4. 在CHA沸石中稳定铟为+1氧化态作为额外框架位置的孤立物种提供了增强的稳定性和选择性，以促进丙烯生产。与在二氧化硅、氧化铝和批量In2O3上的铟物种倾向于减少到0氧化态（In(0)）的情况相比。CHA沸石稳定了铟的活性形式，从而促进了PDH反应。

5. 使用铟的PDH催化剂带来了改进的稳定性和丙烯选择性，丙烯产量高达85%，而甲烷和乙烷等副产品的产量较低。这归因于C3H8脱氢的低激活能（94.3 kJ/mol）和C3H8裂解的高激活能（206 kJ/mol）。因此，使用铟催化剂的PDH尤其有利于丙烯生产。
