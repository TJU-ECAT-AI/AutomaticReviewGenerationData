[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."

[4] "Propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework In(i) in chabazite zeolites shows quantitative and reproducible redox cycles by sequentially exposing the sample to sets of O2 and H2 pulses producing first mixtures of InO+ and (In(OH)2)+ and then In+ upon reduction."

1. The rising global demand for propylene and the affordable price of propane sourced from shale gas have reignited interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology. PDH faces challenges in conventional methods such as high costs and rapid catalyst deactivation in processes involving platinum, along with environmental concerns due to chromium usage. 

2. Various catalysts, including gallium, zinc, cobalt, iron, vanadium, zirconium-based materials, and nanocarbon catalysts, have been explored for PDH. 

3. Propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework indium (In(i)) in chabazite zeolites exhibits a reversible redox cycle through exposure to alternating oxygen and hydrogen pulses, forming mixtures of InO+ and (In(OH)2)+, followed by In+ upon reduction. 

4. Indium (In)-containing chabazite zeolites display a similar reversible redox cycle through sequential oxygen and hydrogen pulses, leading to the formation of InO+ and (In(OH)2)+, followed by In+ upon reduction.

5. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation appears to involve oxidative addition, beta-H elimination, and reductive elimination of a hypothetical dihydride indium intermediate, based on reaction rate orders with respect to propane and hydrogen at low conversion levels.

6. There are parallels between the observed chemical reactions of In+ in chabazite zeolite and the chemistry of In+ organometallic complexes.

1. 随着全球对丙烯需求的增长和从页岩气中获得的丙烷成本低廉，人们对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应产生了新的兴趣。传统的生产方法面临高成本、铂催化剂快速失效以及铬可能带来的环境影响等问题。

2. 多种催化剂，包括镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆基材料和纳米碳催化剂，已被探索用于PDH。

3. 在额外框架位置含铟（In(i)）的查巴兹石沸石中进行的丙烷脱氢表现出通过交替氧气和氢脉冲的可逆氧化还原循环，形成InO+和（In(OH)2）+混合物，随后在还原时形成In+。

4. 含有In的查巴兹石沸石显示了类似通过交替氧和氢脉冲的可逆氧化还原循环，导致形成InO+和（In(OH)2）+，然后在还原时形成In+。

5. 丙烷脱氢的机制似乎涉及氧化插入、β-H消除和假设的二氢化铟中间体的还原消除，基于在低转化率下丙烷和氢的反应速率顺序。

6. 查巴兹石沸石中观察到的In+化学反应与In+有机金属化合物的化学反应之间存在明显的相似性。
