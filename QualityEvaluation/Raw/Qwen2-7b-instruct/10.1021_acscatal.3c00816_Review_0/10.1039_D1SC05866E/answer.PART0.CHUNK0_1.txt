[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
[3] "Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well: among them, Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;33,34 however, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[5] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."
[7] "Isolated In+ sites in the CHA zeolite favor dehydrogenation over cracking under all the conditions investigated."
[8] "For In-CHA, the C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels (Fig. 11a)."
[9] "The dehydrogenation selectivity over In-CHA is much higher than the selectivity observed over In/SiO2, In/Al2O3 and bulk In2O3."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes readily available propane from shale gas, offering a more sustainable and abundant feedstock compared to traditional methods that rely on crude oil.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to be highly efficient, minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. The technology allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, leading to higher yields and reduced costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH catalysts, particularly those featuring indium (In) on zeolite chabazite (CHA) support, exhibit superior stability and selectivity. The CHA zeolite stabilizes In in the +1 oxidation state as isolated species in extra-framework positions, enabling high propylene selectivity (up to 85%) and minimal cracking to methane and ethylene.

4. **Environmental Impact**: By avoiding the use of hazardous metals like chromium (Cr) typically involved in conventional processes, PDH technologies offer a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative. This reduces the risk of environmental pollution and enhances sustainability.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The use of abundant and inexpensive propane as a feedstock, combined with advanced catalysts, makes PDH processes economically viable and competitive in the global market.

6. **Versatility**: PDH technologies can be adapted to various scales and integrated into existing industrial infrastructures, providing flexibility and scalability to meet diverse market demands.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising and transformative method for propylene production, addressing key challenges in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and environmental impact.
