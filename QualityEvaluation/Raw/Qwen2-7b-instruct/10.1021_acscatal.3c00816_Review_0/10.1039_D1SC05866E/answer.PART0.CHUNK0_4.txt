[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."
[3] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework In(i) in chabazite zeolites has been investigated to understand the effect of the support on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[5] "Indium on silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with a range of In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios, have been studied."
[6] "It is found that In2O3 is formed on the external surface of the zeolite crystal after the addition of In(NO3)3 to H-CHA by incipient wetness impregnation and calcination."
[7] "Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA)."
[8] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3."
[9] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered promising because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The rising global demand for propylene and the low cost of propane from shale gas have renewed interest in PDH. Conventional methods using catalysts like chromium oxide or platinum-silver often suffer from high costs, rapid catalyst deactivation, and environmental concerns.

2. PDH technologies, particularly those utilizing chromium oxide/aluminum oxide (Catofin) and supported platinum-silver (Oleflex), face issues like high Pt costs and Cr's environmental impact. Alternatives like gallium, zinc, cobalt, iron, vanadium, zirconium, and nanocarbon catalysts have also been explored.

3. Indium (In) has been studied for PDH over zeolite chabazite (CHA) with various In/Al and Si/Al ratios. The formation of indium oxide (In2O3) on the external surface of the zeolite crystal is followed by indium displacement from Brnsted acid sites (BASs) during reduction, leading to the formation of extra-framework In+ species.

4. Catalysts containing indium on silica, alumina, and zeolite chabazite show improved stability and propylene selectivity (85%) compared to indium oxide, indium on silica, and indium on alumina.

5. A high silicon-to-aluminum ratio in CHA zeolite is advantageous for PDH, as it reduces the number of cages containing multiple In+ cations, enhancing stability and selectivity.

6. Small-pore zeolite-stabilized metal cation sites can potentially create stable and selective catalysts for PDH and other alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的问题而备受关注。全球对丙烯的日益增长的需求以及从页岩气中获取廉价丙烷已重新激发了人们对PDH的兴趣。传统的催化剂，如铬氧化物或铂银，经常面临高成本、催化剂快速失效和环境问题。

2. PDH技术，特别是使用铬氧化物/铝氧化物（Catofin）和支持型铂银（Oleflex）的方法，面临着Pt成本高和Cr的环境影响等问题。镓、锌、钴、铁、钒、锆和纳米碳催化剂等替代品也已被探索。

3. 对于CHA（甲烷酸）中含不同In/Al和Si/Al比的Indium进行了研究。在添加In(NO3)3到H-CHA并通过浸渍湿法和煅烧后，外部表面形成Indium2O3。在H2气体下（550°C）进行还原时，Indium从Brnsted酸位点（BASs）置换质子，形成额外框架Indium+物种。

4. 含有Indium的硅、铝和CHA催化剂显示了与In2O3、10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3相比更好的稳定性以及丙烷选择性（85%）。

5. CHA中的高硅-铝比对于PDH是有利的，因为它减少了包含多个In+离子笼的数量，从而提高了稳定性和选择性。

6. 小孔径的Zeolite稳定金属离子位点可能能够创建稳定且选择性的催化剂用于PDH和其他烷烃脱氢反应。
