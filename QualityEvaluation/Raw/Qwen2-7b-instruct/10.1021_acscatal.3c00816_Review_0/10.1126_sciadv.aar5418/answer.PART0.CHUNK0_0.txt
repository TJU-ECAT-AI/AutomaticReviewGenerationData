PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it offers improved feedstock flexibility, enhanced process efficiency, and superior product selectivity compared to conventional methods. It addresses challenges by increasing feedstock availability through the use of various sources like naphtha, natural gas liquids, and bio-based feedstocks. PDH also achieves higher energy efficiency with optimized reaction conditions and catalyst systems, which reduces operational costs and environmental impact. Additionally, PDH provides better control over the distribution of propylene and byproducts, resulting in higher yields of the desired propylene product.
