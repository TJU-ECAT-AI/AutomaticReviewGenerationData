Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. It addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in distinct ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and widely available globally. This makes it less susceptible to supply chain disruptions compared to methods relying on more localized or scarce feedstocks.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers higher energy efficiency than traditional methods, such as steam cracking, which often require significant amounts of heat and energy input. This results in lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact.

3. Product selectivity: The PDH process is designed to yield high purity propylene with minimal byproducts. This enhances the economic viability and marketability of the propylene produced, as pure propylene commands a premium price in the chemical industry.

答案：丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面因其与传统方法相比的几个关键优势脱颖而出，有效地解决了原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性等方面的问题：

1. 原料可用性：PDH 技术使用广泛且全球充足的丙烷作为原料。这使其不像依赖于局部或稀缺原料的方法那样容易受到供应链中断的影响。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的蒸汽裂解等方法相比，PDH 提供更高的能效。这些传统方法往往需要大量的热量和能量输入，从而导致运营成本降低和环境影响减少。

3. 产品选择性：PDH 过程旨在产生高纯度的丙烯，副产品极少。这增强了所生产的丙烯的经济可行性和市场竞争力，因为纯净的丙烯在化工行业具有更高的价格。
