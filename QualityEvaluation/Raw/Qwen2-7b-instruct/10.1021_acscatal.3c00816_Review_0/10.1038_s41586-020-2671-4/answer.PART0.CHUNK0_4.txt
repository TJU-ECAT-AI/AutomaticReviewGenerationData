<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3.</p>
<p>This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution.</p>
<p>The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7.</p>
<p>The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface.</p>
<p>To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.</p>
<p>We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15.</p>
<p>Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y.</p>
<p>Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite.</p>
<p>Systematic exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with La.</p>
<p>The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods).</p>
<p>However, the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles that exhibited long catalytic lifetime critically depended on the zeolite synthesis procedures, even when the obtained zeolites were all siliceous and had similar mesoporosity.</p>
<p>In accordance with our hypothesis, the REEs incorporated in this zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as shown in a video taken by AR-HAADF-STEM (see Supplementary Video 1).</p>
<p>The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: The sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution makes PDH a promising method for propylene production. It allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources, which can replace or supplement traditional feedstocks.

2. Process Efficiency: Conventional PDH processes using PtSn bimetallic catalysts on porous alumina have limitations, such as rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition. The introduction of Sn to form an alloy with Pt aims to dilute the Pt surface and break up coke-generating ensembles. However, this still leads to deactivation issues.

3. Product Selectivity: The search for highly active and durable PDH catalysts has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure. Incorporating rare-earth elements (REEs) like La and Y into the mesoporous zeolite improves the Pt catalyst dispersion and increases the catalytic lifetime by more than tenfold. The REEs form alloy nanoparticles with Pt, leading to enhanced PDH activity, selectivity, and durability.

4. Catalytic Performance: The incorporation of REEs in the form of atomically dispersed single species with high chemical potential allows for easier conversion to metallic REEs and facilitates the formation of PtREE intermetallic nanoparticles. This results in a distinct hydrogen sorption behavior and a significant enhancement in all aspects of PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的优势包括解决与原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性相关的问题。PDH在以下方面解决了这些挑战：

1. 原料可用性：从页岩气革命带来的大量丙烷资源中，PDH成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法。它利用丰富的丙烷资源，可以替代或补充传统原料。

2. 过程效率：传统的使用PtSn双金属催化剂在多孔氧化铝上的PDH过程存在局限性，如由于焦炭沉积导致催化剂快速失效。通过引入Sn与Pt形成合金以稀释Pt表面并打碎焦炭生成的团簇来试图解决问题，但仍然存在失效问题。

3. 产品选择性：对高度活性和耐用PDH催化剂的搜索集中在使用具有微/介孔结构的硅基MFI沸石上。将镧（La）和钇（Y）等稀土元素（REEs）引入介孔沸石中，改善了Pt催化剂的分散性，并通过十倍以上的催化寿命显著提高。REEs与Pt形成纳米粒子合金，导致PDH活性、选择性和耐用性增强。

4. 催化性能：通过将REEs作为高化学潜力的原子分散单物种形式引入，使得更容易转化为金属REEs并促进PtREE互金属纳米颗粒的形成。这导致PDH催化性能的所有方面都得到了显著增强，包括活性、选择性和耐用性。
