<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production.</p>
<p>This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution.</p>
<p>The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>However, coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.</p>
<p>We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite.</p>
<p>Systematic exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with La.</p>
<p>Formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability.</p>
<p>The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, the Pt3La intermetallic nanoparticles supported on the degallated zeolite (denoted as PtLa/mz-deGa) showed a high initial propane conversion of 40% (close to the equilibrium conversion) and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining 8% conversion even after 30 days of reaction.</p>
<p>The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The present mesoporous zeolite as a support would allow the discovery of not only REE-based alloy catalysts, but also other transition metal-based alloy catalysts with various compositions and structures, opening up new opportunities for catalytic applications.</p>

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: The rise in propane supply from the shale gas revolution has significantly enhanced the availability of propane as a feedstock for PDH, making it a viable alternative to traditional oil-based feedstocks.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Conventional PDH processes using PtSn bimetallic catalysts on porous alumina have faced issues with coke deposition, leading to rapid deactivation and loss of propylene selectivity. The new PDH catalysts developed using a siliceous MFI zeolite with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure improve catalyst dispersion and stability, enhancing process efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The introduction of rare earth elements (REEs) such as La and Y in the catalyst formulation leads to the formation of intermetallic compounds, which significantly boosts the catalytic lifetime and selectivity for propylene production. This ensures high initial propane conversion and maintains this conversion over extended periods, thus improving product selectivity.

4. **Catalyst Durability**: The use of zeolite as a support and the incorporation of REEs enable the creation of catalysts that are highly durable. The Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles exhibit exceptional catalytic lifetime, allowing for continuous operation without significant deactivation over long periods.

5. **Catalyst Development**: The ability to utilize silanol nests in the zeolite to facilitate the formation of atomistic REE alloys opens up new opportunities for developing PDH catalysts with various compositions and structures, potentially leading to further improvements in catalyst performance and efficiency.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more efficient, selective, and durable method for propylene production, addressing key challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。它通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：从页岩气革命中丙烷供应的大幅增加，使得PDH成为一种可行的替代传统石油基原料的方法。

2. **工艺效率**：使用富含微孔和介孔结构的硅酸盐MFI分子筛作为支持体的传统PDH过程，由于焦炭沉积导致催化剂快速失效和丙烯选择性下降。通过引入以微孔和介孔结构为支撑的新型催化剂，可以提高催化剂的分散性和稳定性，从而增强工艺效率。

3. **产品选择性**：在催化剂配方中加入诸如镧（La）和钇（Y）等稀土元素（REE），导致形成互金属化合物，显著提高了催化寿命和丙烯生产的选择性。这确保了高初始丙烷转化率，并在长时间运行后保持这一转化率，从而提高了产品的选择性。

4. **催化剂耐久性**：使用分子筛作为支撑体并结合REE的使用，能够创造出高度耐用的催化剂。以镧（La）和钇（Y）为基础的铂3La和铂3Y纳米颗粒显示出极高的催化寿命，允许长时间连续运行而无需显著的活性衰减。

5. **催化剂开发**：利用分子筛中的硅醇巢来促进原子级REE合金的形成，为开发具有各种组成和结构的PDH催化剂开辟了新的可能性，可能进一步提高催化剂性能和效率。

综上所述，PDH技术提供了一种更高效、选择性更强且耐久性更高的丙烯生产方法，解决了关键挑战，包括原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性。
