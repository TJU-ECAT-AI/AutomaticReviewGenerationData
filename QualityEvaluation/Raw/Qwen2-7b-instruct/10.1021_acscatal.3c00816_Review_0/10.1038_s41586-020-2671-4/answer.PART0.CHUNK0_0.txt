<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production.</p>
<p>This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution.</p>
<p>The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.</p>
<p>We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles.</p>
<p>Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y.</p>
<p>Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite.</p>
<p>Systematic exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with La.</p>
<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The increasing global demand for propylene makes PDH particularly attractive because it can utilize abundant propane feedstocks efficiently, producing propylene with high selectivity.

2. Conventional PDH processes have used PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for several decades. However, these catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition on the Pt surface, which reduces both catalytic activity and selectivity to propylene.

3. The incorporation of rare-earth elements (REEs) like La and Y into the catalyst system improves the PDH process. These elements enhance the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles and interact strongly with Pt, stabilizing the latter in smaller sizes. The addition of REEs unexpectedly increases the catalytic lifetime by more than tenfold, enabling more durable PDH catalysts.

4. By using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a support, the researchers aimed to develop a more effective PDH catalyst. This zeolite provides both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores, improving the overall performance of the catalyst.

5. The alloying of Pt with REEs like La and Y, facilitated by the zeolite's silanol nests, creates intermetallic compounds that exhibit enhanced stability, activity, and selectivity in PDH reactions. These alloys are more resistant to coke formation and maintain high catalytic performance over prolonged periods.

6. The same preparation strategy that incorporates Pt with REEs can produce Pt alloy catalysts that contain a significantly larger amount of the second metal. These alloys, such as PtCo, demonstrate high catalytic activity and selectivity in preferential oxidation reactions, further highlighting the versatility and effectiveness of these materials in PDH applications.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产中最具有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性等方面的问题。全球对丙烯需求的增长使得PDH特别有吸引力，因为它能够高效地利用充裕的丙烷原料，并且以高选择性产生丙烯。

2. 传统的PDH过程已经使用钯锡双金属催化剂支持在多孔氧化铝上长达几十年。然而，这些催化剂由于铂表面沉积焦炭导致快速失效，这降低了催化活性和丙烯选择性。

3. 将稀土元素（REEs）如镧和钇引入催化剂系统可以改善PDH过程。这些元素增强了铂纳米颗粒的分散，并与铂强烈相互作用，稳定后者在较小的尺寸。添加REEs出乎意料地将催化寿命增加了十倍以上，使PDH催化剂更加耐用。

4. 通过使用具有微/介孔结构的硅酸盐MFI沸石作为支持物，研究人员旨在开发更有效的PDH催化剂。这种沸石提供易于反应物和产物扩散以及金属纳米颗粒在介孔内的高分散性，从而提高催化剂的整体性能。

5. 通过沸石的硅醇巢促进铂与REEs如镧和钇形成合金，创造出稳定性、活性和选择性增强的PDH反应的合金。这些合金对焦炭形成有更强的抵抗力，并能在长时间内保持高催化性能。

6. 使用相同的制备策略将铂与REEs结合，可以生成包含大量第二金属的铂合金催化剂。这些合金，如铂钴，显示出在富含氢的流体中进行选择性氧化反应时的高催化活性和选择性，进一步强调了这些材料在PDH应用中的多样性和有效性。
