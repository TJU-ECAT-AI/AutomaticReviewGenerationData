<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production.</p>
<p>This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution.</p>
<p>The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles.</p>
<p>Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support.</p>
<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>

<p>The catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y.</p>
<p>Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite.</p>
<p>Systematic exploration allowed us to increase the catalytic lifetime 700-fold by ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with La.</p>
<p>The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources, particularly those from the shale gas revolution. This ensures a steady supply of raw materials for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: The use of advanced catalysts, such as those supported on mesoporous zeolites, enhances the efficiency of the PDH process. These catalysts enable the formation of intermetallic compounds, which are highly active and selective, leading to improved yields and minimized byproduct formation.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology improves product selectivity by optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst design. This results in a higher proportion of propylene in the final product, which is crucial for industries that rely on propylene as a primary feedstock for downstream processes.

4. **Durability and Longevity**: The introduction of rare earth elements (REEs) such as lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) into the catalyst system significantly increases the catalytic lifetime. This reduces the need for frequent catalyst regeneration, which is a costly and labor-intensive process in traditional PDH methods.

5. **Versatility in Catalyst Design**: The ability to create bimetallic and intermetallic compounds allows for the optimization of catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, the Pt-Co alloy catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen, showcasing the versatility of PDH technology in addressing complex chemical transformations.

6. **Environmental Benefits**: By improving process efficiency and selectivity, PDH technology can contribute to reduced energy consumption and emissions. This aligns with global efforts to enhance sustainability in the petrochemical industry.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods through enhanced feedstock utilization, improved process efficiency, optimized product selectivity, increased catalyst longevity, and environmental benefits, making it a highly promising method for propylene production in the context of growing global demand.
