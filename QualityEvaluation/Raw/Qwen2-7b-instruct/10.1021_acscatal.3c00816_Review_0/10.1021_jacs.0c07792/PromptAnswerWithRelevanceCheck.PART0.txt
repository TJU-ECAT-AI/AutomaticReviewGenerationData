<quotes>
[1] "The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods are manifold. Firstly, PDH offers a more sustainable approach to propylene production as it utilizes propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock derived from natural gas, which is considered more environmentally friendly than traditional oil-based feedstocks."
[2] "PDH also addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH reduces the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with refining crude oil to produce propylene."
[3] "Furthermore, PDH technology ensures higher product selectivity, leading to a more efficient conversion rate and potentially lower costs compared to traditional methods that often require additional purification steps to isolate propylene from other hydrocarbons."
[4] "The use of a coking-resistant iron catalyst in ethane dehydrogenation, achieved through siliceous zeolite modulation, significantly improves the overall process efficiency and product quality in PDH technology. This advancement ensures that the catalyst maintains its activity over extended periods, reducing the need for frequent regeneration or replacement."
