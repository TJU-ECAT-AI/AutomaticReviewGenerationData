[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein."
[2] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."
[4] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge."
[5] "Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be efficient in CH activation for hydrocarbons."
[6] "It has been reported that the oxygen-deficient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accomplish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the CH bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates."
[7] "The isotopic labelling kinetics of Co+-catalyzed CH and CC activation of C3H8 show a remarkable dependence on the electronic state of Co+ cation adducts."
[8] "The activation of CH and CC bonds and H2/CH4 elimination favored the Co+ with the exited-state rather than with the ground-state."
[9] "The optimal catalytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst."
[10] "Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions."
[11] "This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on the Co sites."
[12] "Therefore, exposure of stabilized and active surface Co sites with a single state still remain as a key challenge for facilitating both catalytic selectivity and stability in Co-catalyzed PDH reaction."
[13] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."
[14] "For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites."
[15] "The one-step hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyzing the PDH reaction."
[16] "The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. These include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically:

1. Feedstock Availability: Conventional methods often rely on scarce resources for propylene production, whereas PDH utilizes abundant propane, which is widely available in shale-gas deposits. This makes PDH more sustainable and economically viable compared to traditional methods.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH offers higher efficiency in propylene production. The direct conversion of propane to propylene through dehydrogenation can potentially reduce the number of steps and energy consumption compared to traditional methods that might involve additional processing stages.

3. Product Selectivity: The PDH process aims to achieve high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts. The literature highlights the development of catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene with high yields, such as the CoAl2O3HT catalyst mentioned, achieving an optimal performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates a significant improvement in product selectivity over conventional methods.

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional propylene production methods by providing access to abundant feedstocks, enhancing process efficiency, and achieving high product selectivity. The utilization of abundant propane, the reduction in processing steps, and the development of catalysts with high selectivity towards propylene make PDH a promising solution for propylene production in the face of growing global demand.
