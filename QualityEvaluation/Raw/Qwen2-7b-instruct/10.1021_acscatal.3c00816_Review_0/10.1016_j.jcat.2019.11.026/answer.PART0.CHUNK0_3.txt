[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein."
[2] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."
[3] "Co-based catalysts are promising alternatives to replace Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in view of the catalytic activity for CH bond activation, low cost, and low toxicity."
[4] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge."
[6] "The formation of the shaped boehmite (γ-AlO(OH)) precursor with the aid of urea is regard as the key to control the sheet-like morphology of the resultant catalysts."
[7] "We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction."
[8] "The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst."
[9] "It has been reported that the oxygen-deficient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accomplish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the CH bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates."
[10] "This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction."
[11] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction."
[12] "Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition in the PDH reaction."
[13] "The optimal catalytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst."
[14] "Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions."
[15] "Therefore, exposure of stabilized and active surface Co sites with a single state still remain as a key challenge for facilitating both catalytic selectivity and stability in Co-catalyzed PDH reaction."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. The primary advantages of PDH technology include:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane resources, which are widely available, especially from shale-gas deposits. This contrasts with conventional methods that might rely on scarce or expensive feedstocks.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers a streamlined process for propylene production, potentially reducing energy consumption and operational costs compared to traditional methods. The direct conversion of propane to propylene without intermediate steps minimizes potential losses and waste generation.

3. Product selectivity: PDH enables the selective production of propylene, a critical feedstock for various chemical industries. By optimizing the reaction conditions and catalysts, PDH can achieve high propylene yields and purity, enhancing the economic viability of downstream processes.

4. Cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness: The development of cost-effective and environmentally benign catalysts, such as cobalt-based catalysts, is crucial for the successful implementation of PDH technology. These catalysts offer a lower cost alternative to precious metals like platinum and chromium, reducing both capital and operating expenses while minimizing environmental impact.

5. Adaptability: PDH processes can be tailored to accommodate different feedstock qualities and reaction conditions, offering flexibility in industrial applications. This adaptability ensures that PDH technology can be effectively deployed across various geographic regions and resource conditions.

6. Enhanced safety: Compared to conventional methods that might involve higher risks associated with toxic materials and complex reactions, PDH utilizes more benign catalysts and operates under safer conditions, reducing the potential for accidents and health hazards.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, product selectivity, cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and safety, making it a promising approach for propylene production in the face of increasing global demand.
