[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein."
[2] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."
[4] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge."
[5] "Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be efficient in CH activation for hydrocarbons."
[6] "It has been reported that the oxygen-deficient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accomplish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the CH bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates."
[7] "The isotopic labelling kinetics of Co+-catalyzed CH and CC activation of C3H8 show a remarkable dependence on the electronic state of Co+ cation adducts."
[8] "The optimal catalytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst."
[9] "Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side reactions."
[10] "Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability."
[11] "The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support."
[12] "This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction."
[13] "We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Key advantages include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant propane feedstocks, which are readily available in large quantities, especially from shale-gas deposits. This makes PDH a viable alternative to traditional oil-based sources for propylene production, offering a more sustainable and economically advantageous route.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes, particularly those utilizing cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts such as cobalt-based catalysts, offer higher efficiency compared to traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. These catalysts, especially those that are stabilized by γ-Al2O3 sheets, demonstrate high intrinsic activity and stability, leading to selective propylene production and reduced side reactions.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of advanced catalyst designs, such as those featuring isolated Co2+ sites, enhances propylene selectivity by optimizing the catalytic pathways for dehydrogenation. This results in higher yields of propylene with minimal formation of byproducts like coke, which can significantly improve the overall economic viability and environmental impact of the PDH process.

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address critical challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By utilizing abundant propane feedstocks, PDH processes offer a sustainable and economically advantageous route compared to traditional methods. Advanced catalyst designs, such as those featuring isolated Co2+ sites stabilized by γ-Al2O3 sheets, enhance propylene selectivity and efficiency, leading to higher yields of propylene with reduced side reactions, thus optimizing the overall economic and environmental outcomes of the PDH process.
