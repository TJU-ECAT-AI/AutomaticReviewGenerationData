In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH leverages abundant propane reserves, particularly those found in shale-gas deposits. This contrasts with conventional methods that might require more limited resources, enhancing sustainability and economic viability.

2. Process Efficiency: By utilizing a more efficient catalyst, such as those incorporating Co-based materials, PDH processes can operate at higher space velocities, reducing the required reactor volume and potentially lowering capital costs.

3. Product Selectivity: The use of advanced catalyst designs, such as the sheet-shaped CoAl2O3 catalysts described, can enhance propylene selectivity, leading to higher yields of the desired product and minimizing byproduct formation, which is crucial for optimizing the economic return and environmental impact of the process.

4. Cost-effectiveness and Environmental Friendliness: The development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, like those based on Ga-, Zn-, or Sn-based candidates, aims to reduce the reliance on expensive and toxic metals like Pt and Cr. This not only decreases operational costs but also mitigates environmental concerns associated with the use of heavy metals.

5. Catalyst Stability and Activity: The Co-based catalysts, when stabilized by γ-Al2O3 sheets, demonstrate high intrinsic activity and stability, which is critical for maintaining consistent performance over time and reducing the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

6. Enhanced Productivity: The specific interaction between Co and Al2O3 supports, along with the tailored structure of the catalysts, leads to improved catalytic performance, enabling higher throughput and efficiency in PDH processes.

These advancements in PDH technology offer a promising solution to meet the escalating demand for propylene while addressing the limitations of traditional production methods, making it a key approach in modern petrochemical industry practices.

考虑到丙烯日益增长的全球需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下几个方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料供应：PDH利用了来自页岩气储备的丰富丙烷资源。与依赖更有限资源的传统方法相比，这不仅提高了可持续性，还提升了经济可行性。

2. 工艺效率：通过使用更高效的催化剂，如基于钴的材料，PDH过程可以在更高的空速下运行，减少所需反应器体积，从而可能降低资本成本。

3. 产品选择性：采用先进催化剂设计，如所描述的片状CoAl2O3催化剂，可以增强丙烯选择性，提高目标产品的产出率，并最大限度地减少副产物形成，这对于优化过程的经济效益和环境影响至关重要。

4. 成本效益和环保性：开发低成本且环保的催化剂，如基于镓、锌或锡的候选者，旨在减少对昂贵且有毒金属如铂和铬的依赖。这不仅降低了运营成本，而且减轻了使用重金属带来的环境问题。

5. 催化剂稳定性和活性：当Co基催化剂被γ-Al2O3片层稳定时，它们表现出高内在活性和稳定性，这对保持长期性能至关重要，减少了频繁更换或再生催化剂的需求。

6. 提高生产力：Co和Al2O3支持之间特定的相互作用以及催化剂结构的定制，导致催化性能的改进，使PDH过程能够实现更高的通量和效率。

这些PDH技术的进步提供了满足不断增长的丙烯需求并解决传统生产方法限制的有前景的解决方案，使之成为现代石油化工行业实践的关键途径。
