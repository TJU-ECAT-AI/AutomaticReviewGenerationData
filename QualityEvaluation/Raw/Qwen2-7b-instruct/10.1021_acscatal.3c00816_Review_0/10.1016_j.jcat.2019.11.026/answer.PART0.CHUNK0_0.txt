[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein."
[2] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."
[3] "Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be efficient in CH activation for hydrocarbons."
[4] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "The optimal catalytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst."
[6] "This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on the Co sites."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The key advantages include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes readily available propane from shale-gas deposits, which is more accessible compared to the specific sources required for conventional methods.
   
2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to enhance the conversion of propane to propylene with high selectivity, reducing the amount of unwanted byproducts. The use of Co-based catalysts, especially when stabilized by γ-Al2O3 sheets, improves the intrinsic activity and stability, leading to higher yields and selectivities.

3. **Product Selectivity**: By stabilizing tetrahedral Co2+ species on the γ-Al2O3 matrix, the catalyst facilitates propylene desorption, inhibits coke formation, and frees active Co sites, thus enhancing the selectivity towards propylene over other byproducts. This results in higher propylene yield and purity, making PDH a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional processes that rely on Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

These advancements in PDH technology, particularly through the optimization of Co-based catalysts on γ-Al2O3 sheets, contribute to addressing the challenges posed by the limitations of traditional methods, such as the high cost and toxicity issues associated with Pt and Cr catalysts.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面解决了传统生产方法面临的问题。主要优势包括：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH技术利用来自页岩气储备的易得丙烷，这比传统方法所需的特定原料来源更为可行。

2. **过程效率**：PDH工艺设计旨在提高丙烷到丙烯的转化率，并具有高选择性，减少了副产品的产生。通过在γ-Al2O3片状材料上稳定四面体Co2+物种的钴基催化剂，可以提高内在活性和稳定性，从而获得更高的产率和选择性。

3. **产品选择性**：通过在γ-Al2O3表面上稳定Co2+物种，催化剂促进丙烯的释放，抑制焦炭形成，并释放活性Co位点，从而增强丙烯相对于其他副产品的选择性。这导致更高产率和纯度的丙烯，使得PDH成为与依赖铂和铬催化剂的传统方法相比更高效和环境友好的替代方案。

这些PDH技术的进步，特别是在γ-Al2O3片状材料上的钴基催化剂优化，有助于解决传统方法面临的挑战，如铂和铬催化剂的成本高昂和毒性问题。
