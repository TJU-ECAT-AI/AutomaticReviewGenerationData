In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The key advantages include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes readily available propane from shale-gas deposits, which is more accessible compared to the specific sources required for conventional methods.
   
2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to enhance the conversion of propane to propylene with high selectivity, reducing the amount of unwanted byproducts. The use of Co-based catalysts, especially when stabilized by γ-Al2O3 sheets, improves the intrinsic activity and stability, leading to higher yields and selectivities.

3. **Product Selectivity**: By stabilizing tetrahedral Co2+ species on the γ-Al2O3 matrix, the catalyst facilitates propylene desorption, inhibits coke formation, and frees active Co sites, thus enhancing the selectivity towards propylene over other byproducts. This results in higher propylene yield and purity, making PDH a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional processes that rely on Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

These advancements in PDH technology, particularly through the optimization of Co-based catalysts on γ-Al2O3 sheets, contribute to addressing the challenges posed by the limitations of traditional methods, such as the high cost and toxicity issues associated with Pt and Cr catalysts.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. These include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically:

1. Feedstock Availability: Conventional methods often rely on scarce resources for propylene production, whereas PDH utilizes abundant propane, which is widely available in shale-gas deposits. This makes PDH more sustainable and economically viable compared to traditional methods.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH offers higher efficiency in propylene production. The direct conversion of propane to propylene through dehydrogenation can potentially reduce the number of steps and energy consumption compared to traditional methods that might involve additional processing stages.

3. Product Selectivity: The PDH process aims to achieve high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts. The literature highlights the development of catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene with high yields, such as the CoAl2O3HT catalyst mentioned, achieving an optimal performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield on a 5 wt% Co/Al2O3 catalyst. This indicates a significant improvement in product selectivity over conventional methods.
