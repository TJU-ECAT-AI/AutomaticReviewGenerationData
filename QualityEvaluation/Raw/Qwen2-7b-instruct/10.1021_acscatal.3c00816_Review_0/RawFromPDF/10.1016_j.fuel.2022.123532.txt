Abstract
Similar to Sn-based catalysts, Pb, located at the same main group (Ⅳ A), also exhibits a high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation when supported on silica. This study proves that both the highly dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species play the key role in propane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the reasons for its rapid deactivation have been analyzed, which are possibly due to both the reduction of PbO species and the sintering of Pb and PbO species during the reaction. The dehydrogenation activity can be recovered to some extent through the regeneration of the spent catalyst in oxidative atmosphere, while the loss of Pb species and incomplete redispersion of the agglomerated Pb species results in irreversible deactivation.

1. Introduction
In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance. However, the high cost of Pt- based catalysts and the unavoidable toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts are not enough to satisfy its evolving demand. Accordingly, there is a growing desire for cheap and environment-friendly catalysts. Therefore, developing an alternative to these two commercial catalysts has been stimulated in both industry and academia nowadays

In the past few years, C, the fourth group nonmetallic element, has been proved to possess catalytic activity for both non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Among them, the active carbon samples not only include the artificially synthesized carbon materials
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
, but also involve the coke formed during the dehydrogenation reaction
[9]
,
[10]
. As one of the fourth group metallic element, Sn species have also been proved to exhibit surprisingly high dehydrogenation activity and propene selectivity in our previous work, which break the common sense that Sn species are merely the effective promoter of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
[11]
,
[12]
. Metallic Sn species
[11]
and Sn2+ species
[13]
,
[14]
have both been regarded to be responsible for dehydrogenation. Even though the coke deposition and the loss of Sn species due to its low melting point lead to catalyst deactivation, incorporating the Sn species into zeolite framework (such as hexagonal mesoporous silica and Beta zeolite)
[12]
,
[15]
and improving the dispersion of isolated Sn2+ species
[14]
can efficiently inhibit the reduction and agglomeration of Sn oxides, and further result in a better stability even after oxidation regeneration. In addition, the dehydrogenation behavior of Sn/SiO2 catalyst is even comparable to that of PtSn catalyst. These above-mentioned findings provide us with new insights into research and development of alkane dehydrogenation catalyst. We wonder whether or not the other elements located in the fourth group of periodic table can catalyze propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, we explored the potential of Pb/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propene in this study.
2. Experimental
A series of Pb/SiO2 catalysts with different Pb loadings were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method with corresponding amounts of lead acetate solution. Then, these samples were dried at 140 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. Here, the as-prepared samples are donated as xPb/SiO2, where x is the loading content of Pb by weight. The prepared catalyst calcined under N2 atmosphere is marked as 15Pb/SiO2-N2. In addition, 15Pb/SiO2-MO, 15Pb/SiO2-M, 5Pb/SiO2-M catalysts and 15Pb/HMS catalyst were also prepared in this study. The preparation details are given in the

.
The phase composition of Pb/SiO2 catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The reduction behaviors and the metal-support interactions of Pb/SiO2 catalysts were measured by temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were obtained by a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrophotometer. Herein, the background was recorded over KBr and the samples also diluted by KBr with a ratio of sample to KBr of 1/100. The pyrolysis of Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O was investigated by thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis using BEIGUANGHONGYUAN WCT-1D detector. The UV–Vis spectra were recorded by a Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrophotometer. The JEM 2010 high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) was applied to analyze the morphology of the materials.
Catalytic tests were carried out in a fixed bed micro-reactor (12 mm inner diameter) under atmospheric pressure at 600 °C. About 2.0 g catalyst was loaded in the reactor and the catalysts were heated to reaction temperature in a N2 flow (30 mL· min−1), and then propane was feed into the reactor at a flow rate of 1 mL· min−1 with a N2 dilution (32 mL· min−1). The composition of gaseous products was off-lined analyzed using a Fuli GC9720Plus gas chromatograph and the amount of coke deposited on the spent catalyst was measured by 1HW(T) HF infrared absorption C/S instrument. The calculation details are given in the

3. Results and discussion
In this work, Pb/SiO2 catalysts with different loadings were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using lead acetate trihydrate as the precursor. The XRD patterns (
Fig. S1
) only display the diffraction peaks of SiO2 and no peaks assigned to the Pb species, indicative of a high dispersion of Pb species or a low content of Pb species. The UV–Vis spectra (
Fig. S2
) demonstrate that the absorption peak attributed to PbO nanoparticles can be detected over all Pb/SiO2 catalysts
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. There is a redshift of these peaks from 225 to 234 nm with an increase in Pb loadings, accordingly the band gap energy (measured by the Tauc equation
[19]
) shifts from 4.56 eV to 4.37 eV, which are larger than the ordinary values of α-PbO (1.92 eV) and β-PbO (2.67 eV)
[20]
,
[21]
. In addition to no appearance of absorption peak assigned to the bulk PbO species, the UV–Vis spectra reveal that the Pb species of Pb/SiO2 catalysts may be highly dispersed on the SiO2 surface. To further confirm the high dispersion of Pb species, FTIR spectra of Pb/SiO2 catalysts with different Pb loadings were recorded (
Fig. S3
). Compared with bare SiO2, only the intensities of the peaks at 970 and 468 cm−1 are gradually enhanced with increasing Pb loadings, which can be interpreted by the appearance of the stretching vibration of Si-O-Pb and Pb-O, respectively
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
. It is worthy noting that no peak around 686 cm−1 attributed to the vibration of Pb-O-Pb can be observed
[23]
. These phenomena suggest a high dispersion of the Pb species on the Pb/SiO2 catalysts even with high Pb loadings, which is consistent with the results of the XRD and UV–Vis.
To testify whether the absence of the diffraction peaks of Pb species in the XRD patterns of Pb/SiO2 catalysts is caused by the loss of Pb species during the preparation process, the decomposition of Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Referring to previous studies
[25]
,
[26]
, the decomposition of Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O can be devided into three stages (Ⅰ: Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O → Pb(CH3COO)2, Ⅱ: Pb(CH3COO)2 → Pb(CH3COO)2·PbO → Pb(CH3COO)2·2PbO, III: Pb(CH3COO)2·2PbO → PbO) on the basis of TG and DTA curves. The result indicates that Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O can decompose to PbO ultimately. As shown in
Fig. S4
, the percent of the weight loss is 38.2 wt% of the original weight of Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, lower than the calculated value (41.1 wt%), which means that no loss of Pb species occurs during the calcination process. To further verify the valence states of Pb species on fresh Pb/SiO2 catalysts, the XPS spectrum of Pb 4f for the fresh 15Pb/SiO2 was recorded. Only two doublet peaks at 139.6 and 144.5 eV corresponding to Pb 4f5/2 and 4f7/2, which are assigned to PbO species
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
, can be observed in the XPS spectrum of Pb 4f (
Fig. S5
), indicating that the Pb species on the surface of fresh 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst are existed in the form of PbO. Besides, this conclusion can also be drawn by the result of XRF analysis, for example, the content of PbO of fresh 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst is 16.01 wt%. According to the above discussion, we can propose that the highly dispersed PbO species can be obtained in this study by incipient wetness impregnation method.
Inspiringly, as demonstrated in
Fig. 1
, the supported Pb/SiO2 catalysts can catalyze propane dehydrogenation to propene. It also reveals that Pb loading plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation performance. With increasing Pb loading, the initial propane conversion increases up to a maximum at 15 wt% loading, beyond that, it gradually reduces. Among them, the ascent stage may be induced by the rise of the content of active sites, while the latter descent stage suggests the excessive Pb loading can inhibit its catalytic activity. Notably, the increased Pb loading is detrimental to propene selectivity, especially for 20Pb/SiO2 and 25Pb/SiO2 catalysts, which exhibit relatively poor propene selectivity in the initial stage of the reaction. The content of lattice oxygen increases with PbO content, and the excessive lattice oxygen is harmful to the propene selectivity. Furthermore, the increased acid content (
Fig. S6
) and enhanced agglomeration of Pb species on the surface of 25Pb/SiO2 catalysts (
Fig. S7
) can also account for the decreased propene selectivity of Pb/SiO2 catalysts with high Pb loadings
[30]
,
[31]
. These phenomena prove that the dehydrogenation performance of Pb/SiO2 catalyst can be optimized by introducing moderate amount of Pb loading. Furthermore, as the reaction time prolonged, a rapid deactivation can be observed, especially when Pb loadings are in the range of 5 wt% to 15 wt%.

To further investigate the active sites of Pb/SiO2 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, a series of characterization of the catalyst and in-depth analysis of its activity were carried out. The XRD patterns of the spent catalysts (
Fig. S8
) display that not only the diffraction peaks (31.2、36.3、52.2、62.1、65.3°) assigned to the metallic Pb species can be detected, but also a diffraction peak at 29.1° ascribed to PbO species can also be observed even at 1 wt% loading
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
. The appearance of metallic Pb species means the PbO can be reduced to metallic Pb species during the dehydrogenation reaction. This also can be verified by the H2-TPR profiles (
Fig. S9
), in which the H2 consumption peak below 600 °C is caused by the reduction of the highly dispersed PbO species, while the other in the range of 600 to 900 °C results from the reduction of the bulk PbO species
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
. Besides, compared with the fresh Pb/SiO2 catalysts, the appearance of PbO species (
Fig. S8
) directly proves the sintering of the highly dispersed PbO species. To further investigate the reduction of PbO species, H2-TPR under the condition of dehydrogenation reaction was also carried out (
Fig. S10
). Compared with the H2-TPR profile of 15Pb/SiO2 shown in
Fig. S9
, the low-temperature peak (below 600 °C) remains unchanged, while the high-temperature peak in the range of 600 to 900 °C cannot be observed by reducing it at 600 °C for a long time. This observation suggests that the highly dispersed PbO species can be reduced, while the agglomerated PbO species formed during both reduction process and dehydrogenation reaction are difficult to be reduced. Accordingly, it can account for the appearance of PbO species on spent Pb/SiO2 catalyst (
Fig. S8
). Taking the dehydrogenation performance of Pb/SiO2 catalysts (
Fig. 1
) into consideration, the dehydrogenation activity of agglomerated PbO species is relatively poor and even can be ignored.
To verify whether the highly dispersed PbO species or the metallic Pb species or both are the active phase for propane dehydrogenation, Pb/SiO2-MO and Pb/SiO2-M catalysts were prepared by mechanical mixing method using PbO and metallic Pb as the precursors, respectively. XRD patterns (
Fig. S11
) illustrate that only the PbO species can be detected over 15Pb/SiO2-MO, and only the metallic Pb species can be detected on 15Pb/SiO2-M and 5Pb/SiO2 catalysts, respectively. Their dehydrogenation performances were compared and the results are plotted in
Fig. S12
. Both the PbO species and metallic Pb species can play a role in propane dehydrogenation. Whereas, the dehydrogenation activity of 15Pb/SiO2-MO catalyst is higher than that of 15Pb/SiO2-M catalyst, suggesting that the dehydrogenation activity of PbO species is higher than that of metallic species. This also demonstrates that the reduction of PbO to metallic Pb during reaction may be one of the reasons for the decrease in dehydrogenation performance. Notably, the deactivation occur on both 15Pb/SiO2-MO and 15Pb/SiO2-M catalysts with time on stream, and deactivation rate of the former is faster than that of the latter. As for 15Pb/SiO2-M catalyst, the agglomeration and loss of Pb species due to their low melting point may be the main reason for its deactivation. According to Sherrer equation, the particle size of metallic Pb on15Pb/SiO2-M and 5Pb/SiO2-M catalysts are about 65 nm and 41 nm, respectively. As expected, their dehydrogenation performance exhibit opposite patterns. Furthermore, the 15Pb/SiO2-N2 catalyst was also prepared using Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O as the precursor and calcined under N2 atmosphere. According to the XRD result (
Fig. S13
), Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O species are successfully decomposed into metallic Pb species. The particle size of metallic Pb on15Pb/SiO2-N2 catalyst (about 30 nm) is lower than that of 15Pb/SiO2-M catalysts, as expected, the dehydrogenation activity of the former is higher than that of the latter (
Fig. S14
). While for the 15Pb/SiO2-MO catalyst, the reasons for the catalyst deactivation also involves the reduction of PbO species.
The dehydrogenation performance of 15Pb/SiO2 after different pretreatments were also investigated. The formation rate of propene (FRP, mmol·
· h−1) at the beginning of the reaction is illustrated in
Fig. 2
and the detailed catalytic behaviors with time on stream are shown in
Figs. S15-
17. It can be clearly seen that pretreating Pb/SiO2 catalysts with N2 exhibits a slight effect on its dehydrogenation performance, while the catalytic activity of the catalyst pretreated with H2 was distinctly suppressed. Furthermore, 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst pretreated under H2 atmosphere displays the similar XRD patterns (
Fig. S18
) with these of the spent 15Pb/SiO2. At the same time, if the reaction time of the propane dehydrogenation over the untreated 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst was regarded as the pretreatment time under pure propane atmosphere, there is a similar pattern of the catalytic behavior over the catalyst treated with propane and H2 separately, except for a more serious deactivation effect for the latter (
Fig. S19
). The result reveals that the reduction of Pb/SiO2 catalyst is detrimental to its catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. It can also be confirmed by the fact that the catalytic behavior of PbO species on the 15Pb/SiO2-MO catalyst is higher than that of metallic Pb species on the 15Pb/SiO2-M catalyst (
Fig. S12
). The reduction of PbO species to metallic Pb species may make both the sintering and loss of metallic Pb species easier since the metallic Pb species exist in a molten state under reaction condition due to their low melting point (327.5 °C), thus leading to a poor catalyst stability. In addition, if the reduced catalyst was treated with air at 650 °C for a period of time, its dehydrogenation performance can be clearly enhanced.
Fig. S18
shows that the diffraction peaks of both PbO species and metallic Pb species disappear, while the XRF result reveals that the Pb content is 14.59 wt%. Therefore, the disappearance of the diffraction peaks of Pb species is not caused by the loss of Pb species. Accordingly, the agglomerated Pb species can probably be redispersed under oxidative atmosphere. Besides, only two doublet peaks at about 139.6 and 144.4 eV corresponded to PbO species can be detected in the XPS spectrum of Pb 4f for the regenerated 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst (
Fig. S20
), indicative of the conversion of metallic Pb to PbO species during the regeneration process

Dehydrogenation performance of 15Pb/SiO2 catalysts with with different pretreatment conditions (A: without pretreatment; B: pretreated under H2 at 600 °C for 0.08 h; C: pretreated under H2 at 600 °C for 0.25 h; D: pretreated under N2 at 600 °C for 0.5 h; E: pretreated under N2 at 600 °C for 0.5 h; F: pretreated under H2 at 600 °C for 0.5 h and then pretreated under air at 650 °C for 1 h. reaction condition: 600 °C, 2.0 g catalyst, a flow of propane (1 mL∙ min−1) diluted by nitrogen (32 mL∙ min−1)).
Based on the foregoing discussion, the dehydrogenation activity of the spent catalyst can be enhanced by treated under oxidative atmosphere. Here, the spent catalyst was regenerated under air at 650 °C for 1 h and the results are plotted in
Fig. 3
. During the dehydrogenation reaction, coke also deposited on the surface of Pb/SiO2 catalysts. As shown in
Fig. S21
, the coke yields have a close relationship with FRP values of Pb/SiO2 catalysts, thus making an effect on deactivation parameter (kd). However, the incompletely recovered dehydrogenation activity means that the coke deposition is not the main reason for the catalyst deactivation. Taking the changes in both dehydrogenation behaviors and Pb species with time on stream into consideration, the reduction of PbO species to metallic Pb species may be one of the reasons for catalyst deactivation. It can be confirmed by the results (
Fig. S12
) that the dehydrogenation activity of 15Pb/SiO2-M catalyst is inferior to that of 15Pb/SiO2-MO catalyst. However, a rapid catalyst deactivation can be observed on both 15Pb/SiO2-MO and 15Pb/SiO2-M catalysts, which indicates that the reduction of Pb species during the reaction is not the only reason for the deactivation. According to the XRD patterns of deactivated catalyst, the agglomeration of PbO species and metallic Pb species can be observed. Moreover, after regenerating under oxidative atmosphere, except for the elimination of the deposited coke species, the XPS spectrum of Pb 4f for the regenerated 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst also proved that metallic Pb species were succesfully converted into PbO species. Besides, and large Pb particles can also be redispersed to some extent. To visualize the dispersion of Pb species on the catalyst surface, the TEM characterization was conduced. As shown in
Fig. 4
, almost no Pb particles can be detected on fresh 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst, implying that Pb species on the catalyst is highly dispersed. However, Pb particles with 2.61 nm of mean width can be observed on spent 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst, indicative of the agglomeration of Pb species during reaction. As expected, the agglomerated Pb species almost disappear after regeneration under oxidative atmosphere. Given the fact that no obvious loss of Pb species is observed, we can draw a conclusion that redispersion of Pb species can be achieved by regeneration under oxidative atmosphere. As a result, the dehyrogenation activity is partially recovered. Therefore, it is verified that the agglomeration of Pb species is another reason for catalyst deactivation. From this perspective, the irreversible deactivation may be attributed to the incomplete redispersion of Pb species, particularly these agglomerated PbO species formed during the reduction and reaction processes. Furthermore, similar to Sn-based catalyst, there is a loss in the Pb species during the reaction. According to the XRF results, the content of Pb species of the spent catalyst after 4th reaction-regeneration cycle decreases from 14.93 wt% to 14.16 wt% compared with the fresh catalyst, namely a 5.2% loss. The loss of Pb species is probably the other reason for the irreversible deactivation.

According to the results mentioned above, a simple reaction route of propane dehydrogenation over Pb/SiO2 was proposed. As shown in
Fig. 5
, PbO species are highly dispersed on the fresh catalyst surface. When propane is introduced, the highly dispersed Pb2+ can catalyze propane dehydrogenation to propene and H2, exhibiting a highly catalytic activity. Unfortunately, some Pb2+ species were reduced during reaction, leading to the formation of metallic Pb species. On the one hand, the catalytic behavior of metallic Pb species is inferior to that of the highly dispersed PbO species. On the other hand, the formed metallic Pb species agglomerate togather to form large Pb particles due to its low melting point, and even induce the agglomeration of PbO species. As a result, there is a loss in the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation with time on stream. When the spent catalyst is regenerated under oxidative atmosphere, the large PbO particles agglomerated during both the reduction process and the reaction, exhibit a high level of mobility and can be redispersed. However, the incomplete redispersion and the inevitable loss of Pb species can result in the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.

To improve catalyst stability, Pb-containing HMS sample was synthesized. Only diffraction peak of the carrier can be detected in the XRD pattern of the fresh 15Pb/HMS (
Fig. S22
), which indicates that Pb species are highly dispersed on the carrier or even incorporated into the lattice of the carrier. As expected, the stability of 15Pb/HMS catalyst was much better compared with that of 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst (
Fig. S23
) and the deactivation parameter of 15Pb/HMS catalyst accordingly decreased from 1.42 h−1 (for 1 h, 15Pb/SiO2 catalyst) to 0.42 h−1 (for 2 h).
4. Conclusions
In summary, Pb/SiO2 catalyst was demonstrated to exhibit highly catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, and both the well dispersed Pb2+ species and metallic Pb species are regarded as the active phase. This finding provides us with new insights into the research and development of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, that the metallic elements located in the fourth group of periodic table can catalyze propane dehydrogenation. Both the reduction of PbO species and the agglomeration of Pb and PbO species lead to the catalyst deactivation. Regenerating the spent catalyst under oxidative atmosphere can recover its catalytic activity partially, while the incomplete redispersion and the loss of Pb species result in the irreversible deactivation.
