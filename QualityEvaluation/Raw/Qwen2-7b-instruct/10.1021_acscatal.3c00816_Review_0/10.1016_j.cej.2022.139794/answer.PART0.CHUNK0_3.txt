In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and stable process. Unlike traditional methods, PDH utilizes Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials, which not only ensure high efficiency but also overcome the limitations posed by the endothermic process, high reaction temperatures, and harsh conditions that affect propene selectivity and catalyst stability. By employing PDH, the industry can meet the increasing demand for propylene production more effectively.

Indium species play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and propene selectivity of PDH catalysts, thereby reducing coke formation. This improvement in selectivity ensures a higher yield of propylene, which is essential for various industrial applications. Additionally, the inclusion of potassium (K+) in the zeolite carrier significantly boosts the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. This not only extends the operational lifespan of the catalyst but also ensures its reliability in industrial settings.

The combination of these factors makes the catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In clusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 particularly promising for practical industrial applications. It demonstrates an outstanding performance in PDH, achieving a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene. The catalyst also exhibits an extremely high propylene productivity (20.33 mol) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.75 h^-1. Importantly, the catalyst maintains its activity and stability even after 48 hours of continuous operation, showcasing its exceptional durability and efficiency in industrial processes.

面对全球聚丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为生产聚丙烯最具前景的方法。首先，PDH技术通过提供更高效和稳定的工艺流程，解决了传统方法面临的挑战。与传统方法不同，PDH采用铂或Cr2O3基材料，不仅确保了高效率，而且克服了热力学过程、高温和苛刻条件对丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性的影响。通过采用PDH，行业能够更有效地满足聚丙烯生产的增长需求。

铟元素在提高PDH催化剂的催化活性和丙烯选择性中发挥着关键作用，从而减少了焦炭形成。这一提高的选择性确保了丙烯的更高产量，这对于各种工业应用至关重要。此外，将钾（K+）引入沸石载体显著增强了催化剂的活性和稳定性。这不仅延长了催化剂的使用寿命，而且确保了其在工业环境中的可靠性。

这些因素相结合，使封装在硅铝酸盐-1中的钾促进的铂-铟簇催化剂特别有希望应用于工业应用。它在PDH中表现出卓越的性能，实现了43.73%的丙烷转化率和97.14%的丙烯选择性。催化剂在连续运行48小时后仍保持其活性和稳定性，展示了其在工业过程中的卓越耐用性和效率。
