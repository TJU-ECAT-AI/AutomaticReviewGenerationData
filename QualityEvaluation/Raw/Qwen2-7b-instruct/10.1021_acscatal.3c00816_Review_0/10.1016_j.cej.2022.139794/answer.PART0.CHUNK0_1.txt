<p>Propylene is one of the most significant building blocks for the synthesis of polyethers, unsaturated resins, propene glycol, polyurethane and polyols [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5]. Among the production processes of propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered to be a potential on-purpose method to meet the increasing demand for propene production. The Pt-based catalysts with efficient CH activation ability are more eco-friendly than CrOx-based catalysts [6], which have been widely applied for industrial PDH processes.</p>
<p>However, owing to an endothermic process, high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions create a grand challenge for propene selectivity and the stability of catalysts [7]. The Pt-based catalysts tend to sinter and are inevitably deactivated due to carbon deposition at such a high temperature. Meanwhile, large ensembles of Pt species are active in structure-sensitive side reactions, including catalytic cracking and deep dehydrogenation [8].</p>
<p>Alloying active metal Pt with metal additives has been a conventional approach to enhance the catalytic performance and prolong the catalyst lifetime. Common metal additives, including Ga [9], Sn [10],[11], Zn [12],[13], In [14], Cu [15],[16], Ge [17], have been applied to dilute large Pt ensembles in order to prevent side reactions and improve propene selectivity.</p>
<p>Developing catalysts with high stability under harsh conditions is of a great challenge but necessary. Zeolites, with ordered pore structures, high surface area and high thermal stability, are suitable to be carriers for anchoring clusters [18],[19]. Conventional impregnation methods for supporting metal species on zeolites usually produce large size particles with poor dispersion.</p>
<p>Recently, encapsulating subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites has been considered an effective method to inhibit sintering and enhance the stability of the catalysts. Corma et al. encapsulated subnanometric Pt and Pt-Sn clusters in the channel of S-1 with a highly stable ability for PDH [20].</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods are as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and easily accessible worldwide, making it a viable alternative to traditional methods that often rely on more expensive or less available resources.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient process for propene production by directly converting propane to propene through dehydrogenation, bypassing intermediate steps that are required in conventional methods, thus potentially reducing energy consumption and cost.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH catalysts, particularly those with Pt-based compositions, demonstrate high selectivity for propene production, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon deposits or deep dehydrogenated products. This selective nature ensures a higher yield of propene, aligning with market demands for pure propene.

4. **Stability and Lifespan**: The use of metal additives, such as indium (In), alongside Pt in zeolite-supported catalysts, enhances the stability of the catalysts under harsh industrial conditions. This results in prolonged operational lifetimes, reducing maintenance costs and downtime associated with catalyst regeneration or replacement.

5. **Environmental Friendliness**: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes are considered more eco-friendly than chromium-based alternatives, offering a sustainable solution for propene production that minimizes environmental impact.

6. **Versatility and Adaptability**: PDH technology can be adapted to various scales and integrated into existing industrial infrastructures, facilitating its adoption across different sectors and geographical locations.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional propylene production methods by providing a more efficient, selective, stable, and environmentally friendly pathway for propene synthesis, utilizing readily available propane feedstocks.
