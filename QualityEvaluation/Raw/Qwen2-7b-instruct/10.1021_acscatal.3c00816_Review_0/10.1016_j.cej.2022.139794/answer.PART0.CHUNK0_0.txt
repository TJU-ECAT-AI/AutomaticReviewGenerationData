<p>Propylene is one of the most significant building blocks for the synthesis of polyethers, unsaturated resins, propene glycol, polyurethane and polyols [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5]. Among the production processes of propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered to be a potential on-purpose method to meet the increasing demand for propene production. The Pt-based catalysts with efficient CH activation ability are more eco-friendly than CrOx-based catalysts [6], which have been widely applied for industrial PDH processes. However, owing to an endothermic process, high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions create a grand challenge for propene selectivity and the stability of catalysts [7]. The Pt-based catalysts tend to sinter and are inevitably deactivated due to carbon deposition at such a high temperature. Meanwhile, large ensembles of Pt species are active in structure-sensitive side reactions, including catalytic cracking and deep dehydrogenation [8]. Alloying active metal Pt with metal additives has been a conventional approach to enhance the catalytic performance and prolong the catalyst lifetime. Common metal additives, including Ga [9], Sn [10],[11], Zn [12],[13], In [14], Cu [15],[16], Ge [17], have been applied to dilute large Pt ensembles in order to prevent side reactions and improve propene selectivity. The introduction of metal additives results in the electronic transfer from additives to Pt, and an increase in the electron density of Pt promotes propylene desorption.</p>
<p>The catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolite works as an efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. The catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene and an extremely high propylene productivity of 20.33mol with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.75h1. No obvious deactivation occurs after 48h on stream, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1. The introduction of indium species greatly improves the propene selectivity and restricts the coke formation. The introduction of K+ into S-1 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and the stability of the catalyst. The catalyst with excellent activity and stability is potential for industrial application.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology allows for efficient and selective production of propylene, a critical building block for numerous downstream chemical products. Secondly, by using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials, PDH processes are more environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods. Thirdly, PDH processes can operate at higher temperatures, enabling greater energy efficiency and higher propene yields. However, challenges such as high temperatures leading to catalyst sintering and carbon deposition have historically hindered PDH technology's widespread adoption. To overcome these issues, the use of metal additives, particularly indium (In), alongside Pt, has been explored. Indium addition modifies the electronic structure of Pt, enhancing its catalytic properties and propene selectivity while reducing the likelihood of side reactions and coke formation. Additionally, incorporating potassium (K+) into the zeolite carrier improves the stability of the catalyst by restricting the movement of Pt species, thereby mitigating sintering at high temperatures. The combination of these strategies results in a highly active and stable catalyst that achieves a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene and a high propylene productivity rate, making it a promising candidate for industrial-scale propylene production.
