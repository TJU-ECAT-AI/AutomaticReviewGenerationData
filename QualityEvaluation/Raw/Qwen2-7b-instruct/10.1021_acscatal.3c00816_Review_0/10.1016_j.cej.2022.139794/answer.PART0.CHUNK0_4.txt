In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages. Firstly, PDH is considered the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that may rely on chromium oxide catalysts which are less environmentally friendly, Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more eco-friendly. This makes PDH particularly attractive for industrial applications seeking sustainable processes. The Pt-based catalysts used in PDH exhibit efficient CH activation, contributing to their effectiveness in propylene production. Additionally, PDH technology demonstrates remarkable stability; after 48 hours of continuous operation, the catalyst shows no obvious deactivation, resulting in an impressively low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1. The introduction of indium species into the catalyst further enhances its performance by improving propene selectivity and mitigating coke formation. This makes the PDH process not only efficient but also capable of producing high-quality propene with minimal waste. The use of a potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic cluster encapsulated in silicalite-1 zeolite as a catalyst represents a significant advancement in PDH technology. It achieves an impressive conversion rate of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity for propene, and boasts an exceptionally high propylene productivity of 20.33 mol with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.75h1. This demonstrates the potential of the PDH technology for industrial application, offering both high efficiency and sustainability.
