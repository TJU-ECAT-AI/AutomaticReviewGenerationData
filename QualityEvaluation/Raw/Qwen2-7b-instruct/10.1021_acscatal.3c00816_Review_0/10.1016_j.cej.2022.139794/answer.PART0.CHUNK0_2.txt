1. PDH technology using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. It specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
2. The Pt-based catalysts in PDH processes are more environmentally friendly compared to CrOx-based catalysts, which have been widely used in industrial processes.
3. The catalyst prepared with potassium-promoted Pt-In clusters encapsulated in silicalite-1 shows exceptional performance in PDH, with a propane conversion of 43.73% and a high propene selectivity of 97.14%.
4. Indium species significantly enhance the catalytic activity and PDH selectivity, while restricting the formation of coke.
5. The catalyst has a remarkable stability, with no obvious deactivation observed after 48 hours of operation, leading to an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1.
6. The confinement of zeolites and the modification of indium in the catalyst system contribute to its outstanding performance, making it promising for practical industrial applications.
