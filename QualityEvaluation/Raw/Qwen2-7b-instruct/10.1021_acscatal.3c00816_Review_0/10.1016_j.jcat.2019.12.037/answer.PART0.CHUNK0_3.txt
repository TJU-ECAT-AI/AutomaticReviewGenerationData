<p>The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] .</p>
<p>Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5 [11] .</p>
<p>However, the specific active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH is still unresolved.</p>
<p>The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al. [10] .</p>
<p>Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene [12] and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination.</p>
<p>Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction [13] , which could not be reduced during the reaction procedure at 550 C.</p>
<p>Sun et al. similarly reported that the surface Co spinel derived from tetracoordinated Co(II) on Al2O3 support under reaction conditions accounted for catalyzing the PDH reaction at a low Co loading [14] , and large Co3O4 crystallites formed at high Co loadings were easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of cracking reactions.</p>
<p>Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co [15] .</p>
<p>Tetrahedral Co2+ ions are widely recognized to be the active phases in spite of the varied coordination environments.</p>
<p>Metalsupported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] .</p>
<p>Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction [3] .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] .</p>
<p>Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene.</p>
<p>Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] .</p>
<p>Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene.</p>
<p>The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species.</p>
<p>To expose more active sites, metal catalysts are generally downsized into nanoparticulate form and stabilized onto certain substrates.</p>
<p>Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts [17] ,[18] .</p>
<p>Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] .</p>
<p>We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.</p>
<p>After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments likely contained single cobalt species, as detected by a series of techniques of XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping.</p>
<p>By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed.</p>
<p>A sequence of CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction.</p>
<p>However, the higher reduction temperature and longer reduction time lead to lower catalytic activity or higher deactivation rate, possibly because massive Co particles are formed and can easily migrate and aggregate.</p>
<p>The XRD patterns of CoSiBeta catalysts with different Co loadings are presented in Fig. 7 a.</p>
<p>All CoSiBeta catalysts show the typical BEA structures of Beta zeolite.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst has propylene productivity similar to that of Re0.5CoSiBeta600, while the induction period of the former is longer and more considerable.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment.</p>
<p>Combined with activity test results, the large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta.</p>

<p>Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts.</p>

<p>The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, as shown in Fig. 11 b, much higher than those obtained in previous reports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%.</p>
<p>It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment.</p>

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is significant in the chemical industry as it upgrades low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods such as high price, environmental impact, and fast deactivation of catalysts. The earth abundance of cobalt offers a promising avenue for sustainable PDH processes, though its specific active phase in PDH remains unresolved. Tetrahedral cobalt(II) ions are recognized as active sites, and metallic cobalt particles are known to be responsible for cracking and carbon deposition. The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is crucial, as supports like SiO2 and Al2O3 hinder the formation of defined surface-active species. Beta zeolite, with its high surface area and adjustable inner environment, serves as an effective support for metal catalysts. Dealuminization of Beta zeolite enhances its structural and acidic properties, benefiting catalytic reactions. The study presents a cobalt catalyst supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, which achieves high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, matching that of precious metal catalysts. The presence of confined cobalt oxide (CoOx) species, which can be reduced to metallic cobalt during the reaction, explains the similar catalytic performance of the catalysts with and without prereduction. The metallic cobalt particles are likely responsible for high propylene selectivity, possibly by enhancing propylene desorption. This work introduces a green, low-priced, and highly active PDH catalyst, offering new insights into the active cobalt phase for PDH reactions.
