<p>The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] .</p>
<p>Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5 [11] .</p>
<p>However, the specific active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH is still unresolved.</p>
<p>The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al. [10] .</p>
<p>Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene [12] and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination.</p>
<p>Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction [13] , which could not be reduced during the reaction procedure at 550 C.</p>
<p>Sun et al. similarly reported that the surface Co spinel derived from tetracoordinated Co(II) on Al2O3 support under reaction conditions accounted for catalyzing the PDH reaction at a low Co loading [14] , and large Co3O4 crystallites formed at high Co loadings were easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of cracking reactions.</p>
<p>Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co [15] .</p>
<p>Tetrahedral Co2+ ions are widely recognized to be the active phases in spite of the varied coordination environments.</p>
<p>Metalsupported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] .</p>

<p>Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts [17] ,[18] .</p>
<p>Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] .</p>
<p>We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.</p>
<p>After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments likely contained single cobalt species, as detected by a series of techniques of XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping.</p>
<p>By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed.</p>
<p>A sequence of CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction.</p>

<p>The XRD patterns of CoSiBeta catalysts with different Co loadings are presented in Fig. 7 a.</p>
<p>All CoSiBeta catalysts show the typical BEA structures of Beta zeolite.</p>

1. 直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）到丙烯在化学工业中具有重要意义，因为它将廉价的丙烷转化为有价值的丙烯。这种方法解决了传统生产方法所面临的高成本、环境影响和快速催化剂降解等问题。由于其丰富性，钴为PDH过程提供了可持续的选择。然而，在PDH中钴的具体活性相仍然不确定。四面体钴(II)离子被认为是潜在的活性位点，而金属钴颗粒与裂解反应和碳沉积有关。钴物种的分布和还原行为是关键因素，因为像二氧化硅和氧化铝这样的通用支持物难以形成定义明确的表面活性位点。具有高表面积和可调内部环境的贝塔沸石通常用作金属催化剂的支持物。去铝化贝塔沸石改善了其结构和酸性性质，使其适合催化反应。研究描述了一种由去铝化贝塔（SiBeta）沸石支撑的钴催化剂，它表现出高丙烷转化率和极高的丙烯选择性，超过了贵金属催化剂。被限制在SiBeta沸石中的钴氧化物（CoOx）物种，可以在反应过程中被还原为金属钴，解释了催化剂在有或无预还原处理时具有相似的催化性能。金属钴颗粒被认为是导致高丙烯选择性的原因，可能通过增强丙烯脱附来实现。这项工作提供了绿色、经济且高度活性的PDH催化剂的发展，为PDH反应中的活性钴相提供了新的见解。
