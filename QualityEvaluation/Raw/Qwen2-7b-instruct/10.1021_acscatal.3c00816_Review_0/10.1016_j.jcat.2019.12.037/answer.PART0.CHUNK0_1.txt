1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. It specifically addresses issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes low-priced and abundant propane as feedstock, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective approach compared to traditional methods that often rely on scarce resources. It aims to enhance process efficiency by optimizing reaction conditions and catalysts, thereby achieving higher propylene yields. Furthermore, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, producing propylene with minimal byproducts or unwanted compounds, making it an environmentally friendly and economically viable solution for propylene production.

2. The direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is of paramount importance in the chemical industry as it facilitates the upgrading of low-priced and abundant propane into valuable propylene. This process transforms inexpensive feedstock into a higher-value product, contributing to the overall economic and environmental sustainability of the industry.

3. Various transition metals, excluding those with drawbacks associated with CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been explored for the PDH reaction. However, their performance in terms of catalytic activity and propylene selectivity has been subpar, necessitating the development of more effective catalysts that can overcome these limitations.

4. The design of a green and economically feasible PDH catalyst with high reactivity and excellent propylene selectivity remains a pressing challenge in the chemical industry. Achieving these qualities would significantly advance the technology, enabling more efficient and sustainable production processes.

5. Cobalt (Co) is a promising candidate for PDH catalysts due to its abundance and potential catalytic activity. Research in this area not only offers a sustainable and nonprecious alternative for propylene production but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the active phase of cobalt catalysts in the PDH reaction.

6. This study introduces a green and highly effective nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst for PDH, providing new insights into the active cobalt phase involved in the reaction. The findings contribute to the development of catalysts with enhanced performance, paving the way for more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production methods.
