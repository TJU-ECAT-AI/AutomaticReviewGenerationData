<quotes>

• "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."
• "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation."
• "Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH."
• "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods include:

1. **Cost-effectiveness**: PDH technology provides a green and nonprecious alternative for producing propylene, reducing reliance on expensive catalysts like CrOx and Pt, which are prone to high costs and environmental issues.

2. **Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, offering high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, which surpasses the performance of conventional methods.

3. **Feasibility with abundant feedstock**: PDH allows for the use of low-priced and abundant propane as a feedstock, making the production of propylene more economically viable and sustainable.

4. **Environmental benefits**: By employing more environmentally friendly catalysts and processes, PDH technology contributes to reducing pollution and enhancing sustainability in propylene production.

5. **New insights into catalyst design**: The development of PDH catalysts, particularly those featuring cobalt, provides novel insights into the active phases involved in the PDH reaction, paving the way for advanced catalyst design with enhanced performance.
