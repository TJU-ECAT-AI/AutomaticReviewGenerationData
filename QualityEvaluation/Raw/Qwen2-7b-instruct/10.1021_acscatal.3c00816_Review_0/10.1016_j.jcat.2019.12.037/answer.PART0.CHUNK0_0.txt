<p>The demand for propylene is increasing globally due to its wide applications in petrochemical industries. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is considered the most promising method for propylene production as it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional methods, PDH technology specifically addresses the following challenges:</p>
<p>1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane as feedstock, which is cheaper and more readily available than the fossil fuels traditionally used in other propylene production processes.</p>
<p>2. Process efficiency: PDH offers a more energy-efficient process as it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps or additional purification processes, reducing energy consumption and cost.</p>
<p>3. Product selectivity: PDH catalysts, especially those developed in this study, exhibit high propylene selectivity and low by-product formation, ensuring that the majority of the converted propane is converted into propylene, maximizing the yield of the desired product.</p>
