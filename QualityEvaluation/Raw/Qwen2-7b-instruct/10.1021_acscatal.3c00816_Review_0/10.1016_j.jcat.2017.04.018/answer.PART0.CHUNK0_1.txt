[1] "Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues."
[2] "The dehydrogenation performance of Sn-based catalyst is even comparable to that of the industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts. That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst."
[3] "However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species."
[4] "To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably."
[5] "Herein, the facilely synthesized hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) has been selected, given its appropriate physical and chemical properties."
[6] "The thick walls (2.0-3.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively."
[7] "Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and easily accessible. Secondly, in terms of process efficiency, PDH bypasses the need for complex intermediate steps, such as cracking and separation, which are required in conventional methods. This results in a streamlined production process that reduces energy consumption and costs. Lastly, PDH enhances product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene directly from propane, minimizing the formation of byproducts and improving the economic viability of the process.

To improve the stability of Sn-based catalysts used in PDH, researchers have turned to hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS). HMS provides an ideal support for anchoring and incorporating Sn species more stably. Its thick walls and short channel length ensure good thermal stability and fast diffusion of products. Additionally, HMS's weak acidity helps in the prompt desorption of olefins, reducing the likelihood of secondary reactions and further enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

考虑到对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在几个关键方面优于传统生产方法。首先，PDH技术通过利用大量且易于获取的丙烷解决了原料供应问题。其次，在过程效率方面，PDH省去了传统方法中复杂的中间步骤，如裂化和分离，从而形成了一条更简洁的生产流程，减少了能源消耗和成本。最后，PDH提高了产品的选择性，直接从丙烷中生产高纯度的丙烯，最大限度地减少了副产品的生成，提高了过程的经济可行性。

为了提高用于PDH的Sn基催化剂的稳定性，研究人员转向了六方介孔二氧化硅（HMS）。HMS为锚定并稳定地整合Sn物种提供了理想的支撑。其厚壁和短通道长度确保了良好的热稳定性和产品快速扩散。此外，HMS的弱酸性有助于快速脱除烯烃，减少了非期望的二次反应的发生，进一步提高了PDH过程的效率和选择性。
