[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species."
[5] "To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably."
[6] "Moreover, its weak acidity [19] facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses several critical challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges typically include limited feedstock availability, inefficiencies in the production process, and poor product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: Propane, the primary feedstock for PDH, is abundant and readily available globally, making it a more accessible resource compared to some of the less common feedstocks used in conventional propylene production processes.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH technology is known for its high efficiency, especially when it comes to converting propane into propylene. The cited study demonstrates that Sn-HMS catalysts exhibit impressive propane conversion rates, reaching up to 40% over 170 hours, even after multiple oxidative regenerations. This indicates a high level of efficiency and durability, which is crucial for industrial-scale operations.

3. Product Selectivity: The PDH process facilitated by Sn-HMS catalysts shows a preference for producing propylene rather than other unwanted byproducts, thus enhancing product selectivity. This selective conversion is particularly important for maintaining high-quality propylene output, which is essential for various applications in industries such as petrochemicals, plastics, and synthetic fibers.

4. Stability and Durability: The use of Sn-HMS as a catalyst improves stability over time, mitigating the issue of irreversible deactivation seen in other catalysts. This is achieved through a strong bond that inhibits the reduction of Sn species to low-melting-point metallic forms, which could otherwise lead to catalyst degradation. Additionally, the mesoporous structure of the HMS substrate helps stabilize the Sn species, further contributing to the catalyst's longevity.

5. Enhanced Reaction Route: The proposed reaction route for propane dehydrogenation over Sn-HMS catalysts highlights the specific mechanisms involved in the conversion process, providing insights into optimizing the conditions for maximum propylene yield and minimizing secondary reactions.

Overall, PDH technology, particularly when utilizing Sn-HMS catalysts, offers a robust solution to the challenges associated with propylene production, making it a highly promising approach in the global petrochemical industry.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其在解决传统生产方法面临的关键挑战方面的优势而成为最有可能的丙烯生产方法。这些挑战通常包括有限的原料可用性、生产过程效率低下以及产品选择性差。PDH技术通过以下方式特别解决了这些问题：

1. 原料可用性：作为PDH的主要原料，丙烷在全球范围内丰富且易于获得，相比之下，传统丙烯生产过程中使用的某些较不常见的原料可能更难以获取。

2. 生产过程效率：PDH技术以其高效率著称，尤其是在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面。引用的研究表明，Sn-HMS催化剂的丙烷转化率高达40%，甚至在经过三次氧化再生后仍能持续170小时。这表明其具有高度的效率和耐用性，对于工业规模的操作至关重要。

3. 产品选择性：使用Sn-HMS作为催化剂的PDH过程显示出对丙烯的偏好，而不是其他可能产生的副产品，从而提高了产品选择性。这种特定的转化选择对于维持高质量的丙烯输出尤为重要，这对于石化、塑料和合成纤维等行业至关重要。

4. 稳定性和持久性：使用Sn-HMS作为催化剂提高了稳定性，减少了其他催化剂中观察到的不可逆失活问题。这得益于抑制Sn物种减少为低熔点金属形式的强大结合，否则可能导致催化剂降解。此外，HMS基质的介孔结构有助于稳定Sn物种，进一步延长了催化剂的寿命。

5. 加速反应途径：在Sn-HMS催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢反应的提议途径揭示了转化过程中的具体机制，提供了优化条件以实现最大丙烯产量并最小化副反应的见解。

总的来说，PDH技术，尤其是利用Sn-HMS催化剂，提供了一种应对丙烯生产挑战的可靠解决方案，使其成为全球石化行业极具前景的方法。
