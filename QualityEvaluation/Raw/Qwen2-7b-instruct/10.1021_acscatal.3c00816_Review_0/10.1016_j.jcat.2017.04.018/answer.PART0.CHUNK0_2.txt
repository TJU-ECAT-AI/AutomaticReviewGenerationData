[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "However, the catalyst suffers irreversible deactivation during a 70 h run, which is primarily attributed to the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point (around 503 K) Sn species."
[5] "To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably."
[6] "In this work, a series of Sn-containing HMS samples with SnO2 content of 2, 5 and 10 wt%, has been synthesized and reduced in H2 flow prior to reaction."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the document, include its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, a critical feedstock for numerous industries. This technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on scarce and expensive feedstocks, whereas PDH utilizes abundant propane. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a streamlined pathway compared to complex multi-step processes used in traditional methods. Additionally, PDH provides superior product selectivity, producing high-quality propylene with fewer unwanted byproducts. This makes PDH a promising method for propylene production, offering economic and environmental benefits.
