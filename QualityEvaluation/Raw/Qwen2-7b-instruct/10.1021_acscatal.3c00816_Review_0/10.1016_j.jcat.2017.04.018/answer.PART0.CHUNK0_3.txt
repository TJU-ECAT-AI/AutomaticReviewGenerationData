[1] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."
[3] "The improved stability of Sn-HMS catalyst is probably resulted from the inhibition of Sn reduction to low-melting-point metallic Sn species due to a strong bond, as well as the stabilization of the Sn species induced by the mesoporous structure of HMS substrate."
[4] "Since 1960s, an abundance of research has been focused on the promoting effects of Sn in Pt-based catalyst."
[5] "That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. These advantages include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically, PDH technology:

1. Enhances feedstock flexibility, as it can directly convert abundant propane into propylene without the need for expensive or scarce feedstocks used in conventional methods.
2. Improves process efficiency by offering a more streamlined production pathway compared to methods that require multiple steps or the use of toxic materials.
3. Increases product selectivity, as PDH catalysts, such as those containing tin (Sn), have demonstrated the ability to selectively produce propylene with high yields, surpassing the performance of traditional chromium (Cr)-based and platinum (Pt)-based catalysts in terms of both conversion rates and stability over time.
4. Ensures catalyst stability, which is crucial for industrial applications. The use of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) as a carrier for Sn species helps in inhibiting the migration and partial removal of low-melting-point Sn species, thus maintaining catalyst activity over prolonged periods of operation.

These advancements in PDH technology, particularly through the development of Sn-based catalysts anchored in HMS, represent a significant step forward in the production of propylene, offering a more sustainable, efficient, and economically viable solution compared to conventional methods.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了多项关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法。这些优势包括在传统生产方法中解决的挑战，涉及原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。具体而言，PDH技术：

1. 提高了原料灵活性，可以直接将丰富的丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需使用传统方法中昂贵或稀缺的原料。
2. 提高了过程效率，提供了一个比需要多个步骤或使用有毒材料的传统方法更为精简的生产路径。
3. 增加了产品选择性，由于Sn基催化剂（特别是包含锡的催化剂）能够高度选择性地产生丙烯，具有高产率，并且其性能超过传统的铬（Cr）基和铂（Pt）基催化剂，在长时间运行期间保持稳定性和活性。
4. 确保了催化剂稳定性，这对于工业应用至关重要。将Sn物种锚定在六方介孔二氧化硅（HMS）载体上有助于抑制低熔点Sn物种的迁移和部分移除，从而在长期运行期间维持催化剂活性。

PDH技术的发展，尤其是通过Sn基催化剂在HMS载体上的应用，代表了丙烯生产领域的一大进步，提供了一种更可持续、更高效、更具经济性的解决方案，相比传统方法而言。
