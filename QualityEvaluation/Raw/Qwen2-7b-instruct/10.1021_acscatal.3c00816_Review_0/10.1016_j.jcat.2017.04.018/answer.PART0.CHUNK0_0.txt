<p>The dehydrogenation performance of Sn-based catalyst is even comparable to that of the industrially relevant Cr and Pt-based catalysts. That is, Sn alone can act as the active component for dehydrogenation, instead of only a promoter for Pt-based catalyst.</p>
<p>To improve the catalyst stability, an appropriate support with high surface area should be chosen to anchoring and incorporating the Sn species more stably.</p>
<p>The thick walls (2.03.0 nm) and short channel length of HMS guarantee good thermal stability up to 1073 K and fast diffusion of products, respectively.</p>
<p>Moreover, its weak acidity facilitates prompt desorption of olefins, thereby reducing the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene with high selectivity. This addresses the challenge of conventional production methods, which often suffer from low conversion rates, poor product selectivity, and the use of expensive or toxic catalysts like chromium (Cr) or platinum (Pt).

2. PDH technology specifically tackles these challenges by offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative. It utilizes Sn alone as the active component for dehydrogenation, eliminating the need for expensive Pt-based catalysts. Additionally, the selection of a suitable support like hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) enhances the stability of the Sn catalyst through strong interaction and anchoring of the Sn species, thus improving the catalyst's longevity and efficiency.

1. 直接脱氢化（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯并具有高选择性。这解决了传统生产方法面临的一些挑战，如转化率低、产品选择性差以及使用昂贵或有毒催化剂（如铬Cr或铂Pt）。

2. PDH技术通过利用仅使用锡（Sn）作为脱氢活性成分，提供了一种成本效益高且环境友好的替代方案，从而解决了这些挑战。它利用Sn作为脱氢的活性成分，而无需昂贵的Pt基催化剂。此外，通过选择适当的支撑物，如六方介孔硅（HMS），可以增强Sn催化剂的稳定性，通过强相互作用和锚定Sn物种来提高催化剂的耐久性和效率。
