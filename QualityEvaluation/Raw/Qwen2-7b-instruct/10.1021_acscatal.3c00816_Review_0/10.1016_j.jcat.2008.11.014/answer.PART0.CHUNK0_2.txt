The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study

Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function.

Based on the characterization results and catalytic performance of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3, it can be concluded that the catalytic activity of Cr species strongly depends on the nature of the support on which they have been stabilized.

Conclusions • At 1 wt% Cr, SBA-15 contains merely isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination whereas γ-Al2O3 contains, besides isolated sites, a fraction of oligomers (including dimers). • At 5 wt% Cr, besides a fraction of monomers, crystalline α-Cr2O3 particles are mainly formed on SBA-15 while, remarkably such crystals are not formed rather oligomers with different degrees of nuclearity are mainly formed on γ-Al2O3. • In situ XANES studies evidence that isolated Cr(VI) species in coordination are immediately reduced to Cr(III) and their coordination number increased (>4) upon interaction with C3H8, the latter is also evidenced by in situ EXAFS. • The intrinsic catalytic activity of Cr species (isolated or oligomers) depends on the support (SBA-15 or Al2O3) where they have been stabilized as evidenced by the catalytic results. • In xCrSBA-15, isolated Cr(III) species with coordination number greater than four are more active, selective and stable than Cr sites on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3. In contrast, oligomeric Cr species are more active and selective than isolated Cr species stabilized on xCrAl2O3 for DHP. However, the former species are less stable against regeneration than the latter as evidenced from the second DHP run and in situ XANES.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without the need for cracking processes that are commonly used in conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing a direct pathway for propylene production, potentially reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and improving the yield of propylene from propane.

2. The key advantages of PDH technology include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By directly converting propane into propylene, PDH technology reduces the need for extensive refining processes, thereby enhancing process efficiency. It also offers improved product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene. Additionally, PDH technology can potentially mitigate issues related to feedstock availability by utilizing a more abundant and widely distributed feedstock, propane, as opposed to the more limited and costly sources required for traditional cracking processes.
