<p>The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This study focuses on understanding the nature and distribution of chromium species in chromium catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). It compares catalysts supported on silica-based SBA-15 and alumina (γ-Al2O3) with varying chromium contents to elucidate the role of these species in the catalytic process. The catalysts are characterized using a suite of techniques including nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDXS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). The study reveals that the nature of chromium species is dependent on the support material and chromium loading, impacting the catalytic activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

这项研究专注于理解铬催化剂中用于丙烷脱氢的活性铬物种的性质和分布。它将比较在不同硅酸盐基SBA-15和氧化铝（γ-Al2O3）支持上具有不同铬含量的催化剂，以阐明这些物种在催化过程中的作用。使用包括氮物理吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、紫外拉曼光谱、扫描透射电子显微镜-能量色散X射线光谱（STEM-EDXS）和X射线吸收光谱（XANES和EXAFS）等技术对催化剂进行表征。研究表明，铬物种的性质依赖于支持材料和支持负载，影响丙烷脱氢的催化活性和选择性。

In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species. To this end, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 supports were employed. On high surface area mesoporous SBA-15, it was expected that highly dispersed and completely accessible isolated Cr species can be created. The large pores and the weak acidity of SBA-15 should facilitate adequate transport of gaseous reactants and products to and from the active Cr species. This in turn should lead to better catalytic performance and stability than the regular catalysts.

在本工作中，制备了一系列含有不同Cr含量（0.510 wt%）的Cr催化剂，目的是在催化剂中创建明确的Cr位点分布，并由此推导出每个特定Cr物种的催化功能。为此，使用了SBA-15和γ-Al2O3作为支持体。在高比表面积的介孔SBA-15上，预期可以生成高度分散且完全可接近的孤立Cr物种。SBA-15的大孔径和弱酸性应该能够促进气体反应物和产物与活性Cr物种之间的有效传输。这反过来应该导致比常规催化剂更好的催化性能和稳定性。

The catalytic performance of the catalysts was studied to comprehend the relationship between the structure of Cr species as evidenced by different characterization techniques and the DHP activity. It should be mentioned that the catalytic data of 10CrSBA-15 and 10CrAl2O3, which are similar to 5 wt% Cr catalysts with respect to the nature and distribution of Cr species as evidenced by characterization results, are not presented due to technical problems in the TEOM setup.

催化剂的催化性能被研究以理解不同的表征技术下Cr物种结构与DHP活性之间的关系。值得注意的是，由于TEOM设置中的技术问题，没有呈现10CrSBA-15和10CrAl2O3的催化数据，这两者的性质和Cr物种分布与5 wt%Cr催化剂相似，根据表征结果证据。

Based on the characterization results and catalytic performance of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3, it can be concluded that the catalytic activity of Cr species strongly depends on the nature of the support on which they have been stabilized. Accordingly, Cr species stabilized on SBA-15 as isolated sites in coordination are remarkably more active than their counter parts supported on Al2O3 and on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3 particles present on SBA-15. Differently, oligomeric Cr species anchored on Al2O3 are more active than isolated Cr species present on the same support. However, such a comparison of Cr species (isolated vs oligomers) supported on SBA-15 is not possible in this study due to the lack of CrSBA-15 that contains mainly oligomers like in 5CrAl2O3.

基于xCrSBA-15和xCrAl2O3的表征结果和催化性能，可以得出结论，稳定在载体上的Cr物种的催化活性强烈依赖于载体的性质。相应地，在SBA-15上作为配位孤立位点稳定的Cr物种比在Al2O3上或SBA-15表面存在的结晶Cr2O3粒子上的同类物种更为活跃。相反，在Al2O3上锚定的寡聚Cr物种比在相同载体上存在的孤立Cr物种更为活跃。然而，在本研究中无法对SBA-15上支持的Cr物种（孤立与寡聚）进行此类比较，因为缺少主要包含像5CrAl2O3中那样寡聚物的CrSBA-15。
