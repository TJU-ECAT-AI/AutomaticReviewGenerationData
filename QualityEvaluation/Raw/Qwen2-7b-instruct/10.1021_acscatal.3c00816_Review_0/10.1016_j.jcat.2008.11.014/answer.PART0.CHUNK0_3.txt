[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past [1], [2] due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [3], [4], [5]."
[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene [6], [7]."
[3] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K [8]."
[4] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."
[5] "Therefore, considerable research has been done to gain a deep fundamental knowledge on the structurereactivity relationships of Cr catalysts in dehydrogenation of alkanes by various characterization techniques [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] and to improve catalytic performance."
[6] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was also extensively studied to overcome the challenges associated with DHP however without much success in terms of commercial viability [19]."
[7] "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species."
[8] "This in turn should lead to better catalytic performance and stability than the regular catalysts [20]."
[9] "The behavior of Cr species during DHP was monitored by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) which is a powerful tool to investigate the oxidation and coordination state of Cr species, however under suitable experimental conditions [36]."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers a more direct route to produce propylene from propane, potentially overcoming the limitations of conventional cracking methods (like Fluid Catalytic Cracking, FCC) which face shortages in propylene supply. It allows for a more efficient use of propane as a feedstock, enhancing feedstock availability. The process aims to optimize catalytic performance through detailed knowledge gained from various characterization techniques, leading to improved efficiency. Compared to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), PDH has shown more promise for commercial viability. By preparing a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content, researchers aim to achieve a well-defined distribution of Cr species, enhancing the catalytic performance and stability of the catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is utilized to monitor the behavior of Cr species during the dehydrogenation process, providing insights into their oxidation and coordination states under suitable experimental conditions.
