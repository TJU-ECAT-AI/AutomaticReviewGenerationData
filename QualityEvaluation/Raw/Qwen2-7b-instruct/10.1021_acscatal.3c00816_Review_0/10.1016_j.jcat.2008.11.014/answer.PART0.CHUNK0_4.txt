[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past [1], [2] due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC) [3], [4], [5]."
[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene [6], [7]."
[3] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K [8]."
[4] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."
[5] "Therefore, considerable research has been done to gain a deep fundamental knowledge on the structurereactivity relationships of Cr catalysts in dehydrogenation of alkanes by various characterization techniques [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] and to improve catalytic performance."
[6] "As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]."
[7] "A variety of Cr species (isolated, dimers, trimers, polymeric species with different nuclearity and large Cr2O3 clusters) with different oxidation and coordination states and with different redox properties coexist in the same catalyst."
[8] "Thus, these materials have recently got attention to understand their better catalytic performance either in ODHP or in DHP as compared to other catalysts [15], [16], [20]."
[9] "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species."
[10] "To this end, SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 supports were employed."
[11] "On high surface area mesoporous SBA-15, it was expected that highly dispersed and completely accessible isolated Cr species can be created."
[12] "This in turn should lead to better catalytic performance and stability than the regular catalysts [20]."
[13] "The behavior of Cr species during DHP was monitored by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) which is a powerful tool to investigate the oxidation and coordination state of Cr species, however under suitable experimental conditions [36]."
[14] "The correlation of steady-state activity data and characterization results derived from ex situ and in situ spectroscopic studies enabled us to gain new insights into the nature of active Cr species involved in DHP."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production are its ability to address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology directly converts propane to propylene, bypassing the need for conventional crackers like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which can struggle with feedstock availability and yield lower product selectivity. PDH offers a more efficient and stable process, enhancing the overall productivity and quality of propylene production.

In terms of feedstock availability, PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is widely accessible and abundant. This ensures a steady supply for propylene production, reducing dependency on potentially scarce resources.

Regarding process efficiency, PDH operates with a high degree of selectivity, meaning it efficiently converts propane into propylene with minimal byproducts. This results in a more streamlined and cost-effective process compared to traditional methods.

Product selectivity is another major advantage, as PDH yields a high proportion of propylene in the output, minimizing waste and improving the economic viability of the production process.

The use of chromium (Cr) catalysts in PDH processes is pivotal, as they enable the conversion of propane to propylene. The nature and distribution of Cr species on the catalyst support significantly impact the performance of the PDH process, affecting factors like selectivity, activity, and stability. Through careful control of Cr content and support type, researchers aim to optimize the catalytic activity and efficiency of PDH processes, leading to improved propylene production outcomes.

In summary, PDH technology offers a promising approach to propylene production due to its enhanced feedstock flexibility, improved process efficiency, and superior product selectivity. The use of optimized Cr catalysts plays a crucial role in achieving these benefits, making PDH a compelling solution in the petrochemical industry.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的关键优势在于它能够解决与原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性相关的问题。PDH技术直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，跳过了传统裂化器（如FCC）可能面临的原料供应不足和产物选择性较低的挑战。PDH提供了更高效的工艺，提高了整体生产力和产品质量。

从原料供应的角度看，PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这是一种广泛获取且充足的资源，确保了丙烯生产的稳定供应，减少了对可能稀缺资源的依赖。

在工艺效率方面，PDH具有较高的选择性，意味着它能高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时产生较少的副产品。这相比传统方法，带来了更加精炼且成本效益更高的工艺流程。

产品选择性是另一个重大优势，因为PDH产出的丙烯比例较高，在输出中减少浪费，提高了生产过程的经济性。

铬（Cr）催化剂在PDH过程中至关重要，它们能够使丙烷转化为丙烯。催化剂上Cr物种的性质和分布显著影响PDH过程性能，影响因素包括选择性、活性和稳定性。通过精细控制Cr含量和支持类型，研究人员旨在优化PDH过程中的催化活性和效率，从而实现更好的丙烯生产结果。

简而言之，PDH技术凭借其增强的原料灵活性、提高的工艺效率和优越的产品选择性，为丙烯生产提供了有前景的解决方案。优化的Cr催化剂在实现这些利益中发挥着关键作用，使PDH成为石化工业中的有力解决方案。
