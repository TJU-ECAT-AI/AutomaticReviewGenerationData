[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is advantageous due to its ability to produce propylene directly on a large scale and offer fundamental insights into C-H activation, making it a promising method for propylene production. It addresses the challenges of conventional methods by providing efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective catalysts that do not rely on precious metals.
2. In the context of PDH, achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability while maintaining cost-efficiency and environmental friendliness without using noble metals is crucial.
3. Ultrasmall zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (24 nm) were prepared as part of a novel approach for high-temperature applications.
4. This approach involves encapsulating the nanoparticles within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer, which is grown in situ on a Silicalite-1 support from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8.
5. The NC layer serves to regulate the size of the ZnO nanoparticles and significantly prevent their loss at high temperatures.
6. At 600°C, the designed catalysts achieved a propene selectivity of approximately 90% after nearly 6 hours of operation, demonstrating their effectiveness in PDH.
