[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "The designed catalysts exhibited high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in PDH."
[7] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the literature, include its potential for direct large-scale production of propylene and its ability to facilitate fundamental analysis of C-H activation. This technology specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution that avoids the use of non-noble metals. The use of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles encapsulated within a nitrogen-doped carbon layer on a Silicalite-1 support enables high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability, achieving a propene selectivity of around 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours of operation.
