[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."
[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."
[3] "Here, we describe an approach for the preparation of supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles (24 nm, ZnO NPs) for high-temperature applications."
[4] "The approach consists of encapsulation of NPs into a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 on a Silicalite-1 support."
[5] "The NC layer was established to control the size of ZnO NPs and to hinder their loss to a large extent at high temperatures."
[6] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include the ability to produce propylene directly on a large scale and conduct fundamental research on C-H activation. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability in catalysts without relying on non-noble metals, which are typically expensive and less environmentally friendly.

2. This study presents a method for preparing ultrasmall zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (24 nm) suitable for high-temperature applications. The nanoparticles are encapsulated within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer, which is grown in situ on a Silicalite-1 support from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8. This NC layer controls the size of the ZnO nanoparticles and significantly reduces their loss at high temperatures.

3. The designed catalysts exhibit remarkable performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propene selectivity of approximately 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours of operation.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢(PDH)技术的主要优势在于能够实现大规模的丙烯直接生产，并且可以进行C-H键活性的基础研究。与传统生产工艺相比，该技术通过提供高活性、高选择性和在线稳定性，以及无需使用贵金属催化剂（这些催化剂通常昂贵且对环境不友好）来解决挑战。

2. 本研究提出了一种制备适用于高温应用的超小锌氧化物(ZnO)纳米颗粒的方法（直径为24nm）。这些纳米颗粒被包覆在硅铝酸盐-8原位生长的氮掺杂碳（NC）层中，该层位于硅铝酸盐-1支持材料上。这一NC层控制了ZnO纳米颗粒的大小，并在高温下显著减少了它们的损失。

3. 设计的催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能，在600°C时实现了约44.4%丙烷转化率下的丙烯选择性高达90%，并且在连续运行近6小时后仍然保持稳定。
