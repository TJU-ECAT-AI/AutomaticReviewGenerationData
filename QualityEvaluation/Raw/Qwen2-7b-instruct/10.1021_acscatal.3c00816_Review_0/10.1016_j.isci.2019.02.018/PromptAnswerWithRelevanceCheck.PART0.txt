The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as described in the literature, include its ability to directly produce propene on a large scale, which addresses the challenges of conventional production methods. Conventional methods often struggle with issues such as limited feedstock availability, low process efficiency, and poor product selectivity. PDH technology overcomes these limitations by enabling efficient and selective conversion of propane to propene, thereby offering a promising solution for propylene production.

Specifically, PDH technology utilizes supported ultrasmall ZnO nanoparticles encapsulated within a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer on a Silicalite-1 support. This design ensures high activity, selectivity, and stability at high temperatures, crucial for industrial applications. The encapsulated ZnO nanoparticles, with controlled sizes of approximately 24 nanometers, are protected by the NC layer, reducing the risk of sintering and volatilization at high temperatures. As a result, the catalysts demonstrate excellent performance in PDH reactions, achieving a propene selectivity of around 90% at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours of operation.

文献中描述的丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势包括能够直接大规模生产丙烯，这解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。传统方法经常面临原料供应有限、过程效率低和产品选择性差的问题。PDH技术通过高效选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而提供了一种有前景的丙烯生产解决方案，克服了这些局限性。

具体而言，PDH技术利用封装在沸石咪唑酯框架-8上生长的氮掺杂碳（NC）层上的硅铝酸盐-1支持的超小型ZnO纳米粒子。这种设计确保了高温应用下的高活性、选择性和稳定性。封装的ZnO纳米粒子，大小约为24纳米，由NC层保护，减少了高温下颗粒聚集和挥发的风险。因此，催化剂在PDH反应中的表现优异，在600°C下操作近6小时后，实现了约90%的丙烯选择性，丙烷转化率为44.4%。
