"Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas."
"PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion."
"However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity."
"Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition."
"Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions."
"Oxychlorination is usually adopted to re-disperse the sintered Pt particles while which causes severe equipment corrosion."
"Thus, anti-sintering Pt based catalyst that is stable during cyclic coke combustion and no need of oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions."
"In this work, we report the preparation of highly stable and active PDH catalysts by integrating the stabilization capability of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals on Pt."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene under high temperatures, which addresses the challenge of conventional methods that often suffer from low propylene selectivity and the formation of unwanted byproducts like cracking and hydro-cracking. PDH allows for the utilization of abundant propane feedstock derived from shale gas exploration. However, high temperatures used in PDH can lead to coke formation, which can deactivate the catalyst and requires frequent regenerations, often involving oxychlorination that causes severe equipment corrosion. To overcome these issues, anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts have been developed that remain stable during cyclic coke combustion processes without needing oxychlorination regeneration, ensuring continuous and efficient propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够在高温下高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了传统方法中丙烯选择性低和形成不希望的副产品如裂解和氢化裂解的挑战。PDH允许利用从页岩气勘探得到的丰富丙烷原料。然而，PDH所用的高温会导致焦炭形成，这会使催化剂失活，并需要频繁再生，通常涉及会导致严重设备腐蚀的氧氯化过程。为了克服这些问题，已经开发出能在循环焦炭燃烧过程中保持稳定的抗结块铂基催化剂，无需进行氧氯化再生，确保连续且高效的丙烯生产。
