[1] "Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas [1] ,[2] ,[3] ."
[2] "PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion [4] ."
[3] "However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity [3] ."
[4] "Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition [5] ."
[5] "Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions [6] ,[7] ."
[6] "Oxychlorination is usually adopted to re-disperse the sintered Pt particles while which causes severe equipment corrosion [8] ."
[7] "Thus, anti-sintering Pt based catalyst that is stable during cyclic coke combustion and no need of oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions [5] ."
[8] "Extensive efforts on optimizing support materials and modulating electronic property of Pt have been performed to improve the catalysts stability and propylene selectivity."
[9] "In this work, we report the preparation of highly stable and active PDH catalysts by integrating the stabilization capability of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals on Pt."
[10] "We demonstrated that the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst indeed exhibited excellent regeneration stability during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations albeit the propylene selectivity was inferior."
[11] "With addition of Cu, Ag and Au, the stable yields of propylene are all improved with the propylene selectivity in an order of Pt-Cu>Pt-Ag>Pt>Pt-Au."
[12] "Meanwhile, the regeneration stability is further enhanced after group IB metals modification, especially for Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 sample."

Propylene direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in three main aspects:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH leverages the abundance of propane from shale gas exploration, providing a plentiful feedstock source for propylene production.

2. Process Efficiency: High reaction temperatures enable efficient conversion of propane to propylene. However, this is balanced by the careful management of other reactions to minimize cracking, hydro-cracking, and coking, which can lead to lower propylene selectivity.

3. Product Selectivity: Supported platinum catalysts demonstrate high activity in PDH reactions. Nonetheless, they are susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition, necessitating frequent regeneration. This process often involves oxychlorination, which can cause severe equipment corrosion.

To overcome these issues, PDH technology aims to develop anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts that remain stable during cyclic coke combustion, eliminating the need for oxychlorination regeneration. This is achieved through the integration of MgAl2O4 for stabilization and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals (Cu, Ag, Au) on Pt. These modifications enhance the catalyst's stability and propylene selectivity, particularly in the case of Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4, which offers both high activity and superior regeneration stability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产最具有前景的方法。它在三个方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH 利用来自页岩气勘探的丰富丙烷作为原料，提供了丙烯生产的充足原料来源。

2. 过程效率：高温使丙烷高效转化为丙烯。然而，这需要仔细管理其他反应，以最小化裂解、氢化裂解和焦化，这些反应可能导致丙烯选择性降低。

3. 产品选择性：支持的铂催化剂在PDH反应中表现出高活性。然而，它们容易因焦炭沉积而失效，需要频繁再生。这一过程通常涉及氧氯化，这可能导致严重设备腐蚀。

为了克服这些问题，PDH 技术旨在开发能在循环焦炭燃烧过程中保持稳定的抗结块Pt基催化剂，从而消除氧氯化再生的需求。这通过集成MgAl2O4进行稳定化以及对Pt的组IIB金属（铜、银、金）电子调制效果实现。这些修改提高了催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性，尤其是Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4，它不仅提供了高活性，而且具有卓越的再生稳定性。
