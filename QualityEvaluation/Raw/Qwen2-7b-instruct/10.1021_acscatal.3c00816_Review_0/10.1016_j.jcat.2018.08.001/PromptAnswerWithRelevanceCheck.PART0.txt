1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenge of high process efficiency and product selectivity. It tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources derived from shale gas exploration. Unlike conventional methods that may struggle with limited feedstock or produce lower yields of propylene, PDH ensures a high conversion rate while minimizing the formation of undesirable byproducts such as cracking and hydro-cracking. This results in a higher propylene selectivity.

2. PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a high conversion rate of propane to propylene at high temperatures, ensuring efficient use of the abundant propane feedstock. It mitigates the issue of coke deposition, a common problem in conventional processes, by utilizing anti-sintering platinum-based catalysts that remain stable during the cyclical coke combustion process, thus eliminating the need for oxychlorination regeneration that could cause severe equipment corrosion. The introduction of group IB metals like copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) further improves the catalyst's performance, enhancing propylene yield and stability during regeneration cycles, particularly in the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 catalyst.

1.PDH技术以其高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯的能力脱颖而出，解决了高过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。它通过利用从页岩气勘探中获得的丰富丙烷资源，解决了传统方法可能面临的有限原料或丙烯产量较低的问题。与常规方法可能难以有效利用有限原料或产生较低丙烯收率的情况不同，PDH确保了高转化率的同时，最大限度地减少了裂解、氢化裂解等副产品的形成，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。

2.PDH技术通过使用抗结焦的铂基催化剂来解决传统生产方法面临的问题，这些催化剂在丙烷脱氢和焦炭燃烧循环过程中保持稳定，从而消除了需要氯氧再生的需要，该过程可能会导致严重设备腐蚀。通过引入铜（Cu）、银（Ag）和金（Au）这类第一组IB金属，进一步改善了催化剂的性能，增强了再生周期中的丙烯产率和稳定性，特别是在Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4催化剂的情况下。

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene under high temperatures, which addresses the challenge of conventional methods that often suffer from low propylene selectivity and the formation of unwanted byproducts like cracking and hydro-cracking. PDH allows for the utilization of abundant propane feedstock derived from shale gas exploration. However, high temperatures used in PDH can lead to coke formation, which can deactivate the catalyst and requires frequent regenerations, often involving oxychlorination that causes severe equipment corrosion. To overcome these issues, anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts have been developed that remain stable during cyclic coke combustion processes without needing oxychlorination regeneration, ensuring continuous and efficient propylene production.

Propylene direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in three main aspects:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH leverages the abundance of propane from shale gas exploration, providing a plentiful feedstock source for propylene production.

2. Process Efficiency: High reaction temperatures enable efficient conversion of propane to propylene. However, this is balanced by the careful management of other reactions to minimize cracking, hydro-cracking, and coking, which can lead to lower propylene selectivity.

3. Product Selectivity: Supported platinum catalysts demonstrate high activity in PDH reactions. Nonetheless, they are susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition, necessitating frequent regeneration. This process often involves oxychlorination, which can cause severe equipment corrosion.

To overcome these issues, PDH technology aims to develop anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts that remain stable during cyclic coke combustion, eliminating the need for oxychlorination regeneration. This is achieved through the integration of MgAl2O4 for stabilization and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals (Cu, Ag, Au) on Pt. These modifications enhance the catalyst's stability and propylene selectivity, particularly in the case of Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4, which offers both high activity and superior regeneration stability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产最具有前景的方法。它在三个方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH 利用来自页岩气勘探的丰富丙烷作为原料，提供了丙烯生产的充足原料来源。

2. 过程效率：高温使丙烷高效转化为丙烯。然而，这需要仔细管理其他反应，以最小化裂解、氢化裂解和焦化，这些反应可能导致丙烯选择性降低。

3. 产品选择性：支持的铂催化剂在PDH反应中表现出高活性。然而，它们容易因焦炭沉积而失效，需要频繁再生。这一过程通常涉及氧氯化，这可能导致严重设备腐蚀。

为了克服这些问题，PDH 技术旨在开发能在循环焦炭燃烧过程中保持稳定的抗结块Pt基催化剂，从而消除氧氯化再生的需求。这通过集成MgAl2O4进行稳定化以及对Pt的组IIB金属（铜、银、金）电子调制效果实现。这些修改提高了催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性，尤其是Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4，它不仅提供了高活性，而且具有卓越的再生稳定性。

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. It tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity effectively. PDH utilizes high reaction temperatures (greater than 550°C) to achieve high propane conversion, which is crucial for propylene production. However, these high temperatures can also lead to unwanted side reactions such as cracking, hydro-cracking, and coking, which reduce propylene selectivity. To counteract these drawbacks, PDH employs highly active supported platinum catalysts that are susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition. The frequent regeneration of these catalysts through coke combustion leads to irreversible sintering of Pt species under high-temperature and oxidizing conditions, necessitating alternative methods for re-dispersing the Pt particles. The conventional oxychlorination process, though effective, can cause severe equipment corrosion. Therefore, PDH seeks anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts that maintain stability during cyclic coke combustion and do not require oxychlorination for regeneration, addressing the thermodynamic inevitability of coke deposition during PDH operations.

2. By integrating the stabilization capabilities of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effects of group IB metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) on Pt, researchers have developed highly stable and active PDH catalysts. These catalysts exhibit excellent regeneration stability during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations, despite initially having lower propylene selectivity compared to non-modified Pt catalysts. The addition of Cu, Ag, and Au significantly improves the stable yields of propylene. The propylene selectivity shows an order of Pt-Cu &gt; Pt-Ag &gt; Pt &gt; Pt-Au, indicating that Cu and Ag, when diluted onto the Pt surface, donate electrons to the Pt atoms, resulting in more active sites for propylene production. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 sample, in particular, demonstrates superior C3H6 yield and regeneration stability, possibly due to the formation of intermetallic compounds and limited phase segregation during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration runs.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其在解决丙烯生产过程中的几个关键挑战方面的优势，被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法。它有效解决了原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性等问题。PDH通过使用大于550°C的高反应温度来实现高丙烷转化率，这是丙烯生产的必要条件。然而，这些高温也可能促进不希望的副反应，如裂解、加氢裂解和结焦，从而降低丙烯的选择性。为克服这些缺点，PDH采用了易受焦炭沉积失活的铂基催化剂。频繁的催化剂再生通过焦炭燃烧进行，这在高温氧化条件下导致分散的铂物种不可逆聚集。传统的氧氯化过程虽然有效，但会导致严重的设备腐蚀。因此，PDH寻求在循环焦炭燃烧过程中保持稳定且无需氧氯化再生的铂基催化剂，以应对PDH操作条件下焦炭沉积的热力学不可避免性。

2. 通过整合镁铝氧化物（MgAl2O4）的稳定性增强能力和组ⅠB金属（铜、银和金）对铂的电子调节作用，研究人员开发出了高度稳定且活性极高的PDH催化剂。这些催化剂在循环脱氢-再生操作期间展现出卓越的再生稳定性，尽管其丙烯选择性相较于非修饰铂催化剂时较低。添加铜、银和金显著提高了丙烯的稳定产量。丙烯选择性按照铂-铜＞铂-银＞铂＞铂-金的顺序排列，表明当铜和银稀释到铂表面时，它们会向铂原子捐赠电子，从而形成更活跃的丙烯生成位点。铂-铜/MgAl2O4样品特别表现出优异的C3H6产率和再生稳定性，这可能归因于形成了互溶化合物以及在循环脱氢-再生运行期间有限的相分离。
