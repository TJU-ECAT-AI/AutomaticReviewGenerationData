1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. It tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity effectively. PDH utilizes high reaction temperatures (greater than 550°C) to achieve high propane conversion, which is crucial for propylene production. However, these high temperatures can also lead to unwanted side reactions such as cracking, hydro-cracking, and coking, which reduce propylene selectivity. To counteract these drawbacks, PDH employs highly active supported platinum catalysts that are susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition. The frequent regeneration of these catalysts through coke combustion leads to irreversible sintering of Pt species under high-temperature and oxidizing conditions, necessitating alternative methods for re-dispersing the Pt particles. The conventional oxychlorination process, though effective, can cause severe equipment corrosion. Therefore, PDH seeks anti-sintering Pt-based catalysts that maintain stability during cyclic coke combustion and do not require oxychlorination for regeneration, addressing the thermodynamic inevitability of coke deposition during PDH operations.

2. By integrating the stabilization capabilities of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effects of group IB metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) on Pt, researchers have developed highly stable and active PDH catalysts. These catalysts exhibit excellent regeneration stability during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations, despite initially having lower propylene selectivity compared to non-modified Pt catalysts. The addition of Cu, Ag, and Au significantly improves the stable yields of propylene. The propylene selectivity shows an order of Pt-Cu &gt; Pt-Ag &gt; Pt &gt; Pt-Au, indicating that Cu and Ag, when diluted onto the Pt surface, donate electrons to the Pt atoms, resulting in more active sites for propylene production. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 sample, in particular, demonstrates superior C3H6 yield and regeneration stability, possibly due to the formation of intermetallic compounds and limited phase segregation during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration runs.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其在解决丙烯生产过程中的几个关键挑战方面的优势，被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法。它有效解决了原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性等问题。PDH通过使用大于550°C的高反应温度来实现高丙烷转化率，这是丙烯生产的必要条件。然而，这些高温也可能促进不希望的副反应，如裂解、加氢裂解和结焦，从而降低丙烯的选择性。为克服这些缺点，PDH采用了易受焦炭沉积失活的铂基催化剂。频繁的催化剂再生通过焦炭燃烧进行，这在高温氧化条件下导致分散的铂物种不可逆聚集。传统的氧氯化过程虽然有效，但会导致严重的设备腐蚀。因此，PDH寻求在循环焦炭燃烧过程中保持稳定且无需氧氯化再生的铂基催化剂，以应对PDH操作条件下焦炭沉积的热力学不可避免性。

2. 通过整合镁铝氧化物（MgAl2O4）的稳定性增强能力和组ⅠB金属（铜、银和金）对铂的电子调节作用，研究人员开发出了高度稳定且活性极高的PDH催化剂。这些催化剂在循环脱氢-再生操作期间展现出卓越的再生稳定性，尽管其丙烯选择性相较于非修饰铂催化剂时较低。添加铜、银和金显著提高了丙烯的稳定产量。丙烯选择性按照铂-铜＞铂-银＞铂＞铂-金的顺序排列，表明当铜和银稀释到铂表面时，它们会向铂原子捐赠电子，从而形成更活跃的丙烯生成位点。铂-铜/MgAl2O4样品特别表现出优异的C3H6产率和再生稳定性，这可能归因于形成了互溶化合物以及在循环脱氢-再生运行期间有限的相分离。
