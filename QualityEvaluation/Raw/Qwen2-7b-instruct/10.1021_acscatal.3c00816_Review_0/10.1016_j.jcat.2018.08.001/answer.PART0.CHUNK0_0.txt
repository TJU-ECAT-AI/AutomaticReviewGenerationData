<p>PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion.</p>
<p>However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition.</p>
<p>Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions.</p>
<p>Oxychlorination is usually adopted to re-disperse the sintered Pt particles while which causes severe equipment corrosion.</p>
<p>Anti-sintering Pt based catalyst that is stable during cyclic coke combustion and no need of oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions.</p>
<p>With addition of Cu, Ag and Au, the stable yields of propylene are all improved with the propylene selectivity in an order of Pt-Cu>Pt-Ag>Pt>Pt-Au.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the regeneration stability is further enhanced after group IB metals modification, especially for Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 sample.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenge of high process efficiency and product selectivity. It tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources derived from shale gas exploration. Unlike conventional methods that may struggle with limited feedstock or produce lower yields of propylene, PDH ensures a high conversion rate while minimizing the formation of undesirable byproducts such as cracking and hydro-cracking. This results in a higher propylene selectivity.

2. PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a high conversion rate of propane to propylene at high temperatures, ensuring efficient use of the abundant propane feedstock. It mitigates the issue of coke deposition, a common problem in conventional processes, by utilizing anti-sintering platinum-based catalysts that remain stable during the cyclical coke combustion process, thus eliminating the need for oxychlorination regeneration that could cause severe equipment corrosion. The introduction of group IB metals like copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au) further improves the catalyst's performance, enhancing propylene yield and stability during regeneration cycles, particularly in the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 catalyst.

1.PDH技术以其高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯的能力脱颖而出，解决了高过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。它通过利用从页岩气勘探中获得的丰富丙烷资源，解决了传统方法可能面临的有限原料或丙烯产量较低的问题。与常规方法可能难以有效利用有限原料或产生较低丙烯收率的情况不同，PDH确保了高转化率的同时，最大限度地减少了裂解、氢化裂解等副产品的形成，从而提高了丙烯的选择性。

2.PDH技术通过使用抗结焦的铂基催化剂来解决传统生产方法面临的问题，这些催化剂在丙烷脱氢和焦炭燃烧循环过程中保持稳定，从而消除了需要氯氧再生的需要，该过程可能会导致严重设备腐蚀。通过引入铜（Cu）、银（Ag）和金（Au）这类第一组IB金属，进一步改善了催化剂的性能，增强了再生周期中的丙烯产率和稳定性，特别是在Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4催化剂的情况下。
