<p>PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (&gt;550C) is essential for high propane conversion.</p>
<p>However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition.</p>
<p>Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions.</p>
<p>Oxychlorination is usually adopted to re-disperse the sintered Pt particles while which causes severe equipment corrosion.</p>
<p>Anti-sintering Pt based catalyst that is stable during cyclic coke combustion and no need of oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions.</p>
<p>In this work, we report the preparation of highly stable and active PDH catalysts by integrating the stabilization capability of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals on Pt.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods, including addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The high demand for propylene makes PDH particularly promising since it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for additional processing steps.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the following challenges:
   - **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes readily available propane from natural gas, which is abundant and widely distributed globally.
   - **Process Efficiency**: By operating at high temperatures, PDH achieves efficient conversion of propane to propylene, although it must balance this with the risk of side reactions like cracking and coking.
   - **Product Selectivity**: The use of advanced catalysts, such as Pt/MgAl2O4 modified with group IB metals, enhances propylene selectivity while maintaining stability during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration processes, reducing the need for corrosive oxychlorination treatments.

1.PDH技术在满足丙烯高需求方面具有显著优势，解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的技术特别有前景。

2.PDH技术通过以下方式具体解决以下挑战：
   - **原料供应**：利用来自天然气的丰富且广泛分布的丙烷作为原料。
   - **过程效率**：通过高温操作实现高效的丙烷转化为丙烯，但需要平衡与裂解和结焦等副反应的风险。
   - **产品选择性**：使用如铂/MgAl2O4等催化剂，并添加IB族金属进行电子调制，既能提高丙烯的选择性，又能保持在循环脱氢-再生过程中催化剂的稳定性，减少腐蚀性的氧氯化处理需求。
