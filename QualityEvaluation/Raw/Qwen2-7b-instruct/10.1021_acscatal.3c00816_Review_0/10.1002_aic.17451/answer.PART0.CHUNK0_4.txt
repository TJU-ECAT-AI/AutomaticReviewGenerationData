[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."
[2] "However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."
[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."
[4] "Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."
[5] "However, the as-prepared well-dispersed Co sites tend to aggregate and are reduced to metallic Co (Co0) under high temperature and strongly reducing PDH atmosphere, which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and is unfavorable for catalyst stability."
[6] "The encapsulation of metal species within zeolites (M@zeolite) by ligand-assistance in situ crystallization strategy has been frequently reported, which exhibits various advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions."
[7] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[8] "Additionally, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."
[9] "The catalytic performance of Co catalysts still needs further improvement, and a better understanding of the structure-performance relationship can guide the catalyst optimization."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production are its ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing a relatively abundant feedstock, propane, which reduces dependency on fossil energy sources. It offers a more efficient production process compared to traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking, which often require more energy input and produce more by-products. Moreover, PDH technology improves product selectivity, focusing on the direct production of propylene without generating significant amounts of unwanted by-products. This makes PDH a more sustainable and cost-effective solution for propylene production, particularly as fossil energy consumption increases and concerns about environmental pollution grow.
