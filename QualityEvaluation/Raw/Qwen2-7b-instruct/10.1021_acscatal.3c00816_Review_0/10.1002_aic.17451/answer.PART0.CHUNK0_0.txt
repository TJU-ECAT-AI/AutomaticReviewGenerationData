[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."
[2] "However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."
[3] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[4] "Moreover, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."

1. Conventional propylene production processes, such as naphtha steam cracking, are unable to meet the increasing demand due to the high costs of platinum and chromium(VI) pollution issues.
2. The high cost of platinum and environmental pollution caused by chromium(VI) significantly limit the further development of propylene production technologies.
3. The CoO@S-1 catalyst shows high propylene formation rate because the encapsulated CoO clusters favor propane adsorption and stabilize the detached H* species, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles.
4. The π-binding propylene on CoO clusters prevents over-dehydrogenation reactions, which enhances propylene selectivity and catalytic stability compared to metallic Co surfaces with di-σ binding.

1. 传统的丙烯生产过程，如石脑油蒸汽裂解，无法满足日益增长的需求，主要是因为铂金的成本高和六价铬污染问题。
2. 铂金的成本高昂以及六价铬对环境的严重污染限制了丙烯生产技术的进一步发展。
3. CoO@S-1催化剂表现出较高的丙烯形成速率，因为封装的CoO簇有利于丙烷吸附，并且能更好地稳定从丙烷脱氢产生的H*物种，导致与框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米颗粒相比更低的脱氢障碍。
4. CoO簇上的π键丙烯防止过脱氢反应，这增强了丙烯选择性和催化稳定性，与具有二σ键的金属Co表面相比。
