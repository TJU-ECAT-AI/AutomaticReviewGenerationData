1. Conventional propylene production processes, such as naphtha steam cracking, are unable to meet the increasing demand due to the high costs of platinum and chromium(VI) pollution issues.
2. The high cost of platinum and environmental pollution caused by chromium(VI) significantly limit the further development of propylene production technologies.
3. The CoO@S-1 catalyst shows high propylene formation rate because the encapsulated CoO clusters favor propane adsorption and stabilize the detached H* species, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles.
4. The π-binding propylene on CoO clusters prevents over-dehydrogenation reactions, which enhances propylene selectivity and catalytic stability compared to metallic Co surfaces with di-σ binding.

1. The conventional propylene production methods, particularly naphtha steam cracking, are challenged by the depletion of fossil energy resources, failing to meet the rising demand for propylene.

2. The high expense of platinum (Pt) and the environmental concerns associated with chromium (Cr) VI significantly limit the expansion of these traditional propylene production technologies.

3. The superior propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity of the CoO@S-1 catalyst is attributed to the encapsulated cobalt oxide (CoO) clusters. These clusters enhance propane adsorption and maintain detached hydrogen species more effectively, resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers than conventional Co2+ ions or Co3O4 nanoparticles.

4. The π-binding mechanism of propylene on CoO clusters prevents excessive dehydrogenation reactions compared to the di-σ binding on metallic cobalt, contributing to the enhanced propylene selectivity and catalytic stability of the CoO@S-1 catalyst.

[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."
[2] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."
[3] "It is widely recognized that the single-site (isolated) Co2+ species, acting as the Lewis acidic sites, can effectively catalyze the PDH reaction."
[4] "However, the as-prepared well-dispersed Co sites tend to aggregate and are reduced to metallic Co (Co0) under high temperature and strongly reducing PDH atmosphere, which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and is unfavorable for catalyst stability."
[5] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes a relatively abundant feedstock, propane, and produces fewer by-products compared to traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking. The conventional processes using precious metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) are expensive and pose environmental pollution issues, hindering their further development. PDH, especially with catalysts containing cobalt (Co), offers an economically viable and environmentally friendly alternative. The Co-based catalysts, particularly those encapsulating ultrasmall cobalt oxide clusters within silicalite-1 zeolite, exhibit high PDH activity and stability due to their unique structure. These clusters are effective in propane adsorption, stabilizing detached hydrogen species, and facilitating propylene production through a π-binding mechanism that prevents over-dehydrogenation, ensuring high propylene selectivity. The encapsulation technique also helps in maintaining the stability and activity of the catalysts by preventing sintering and reduction, which are common issues with cobalt-based catalysts under high-temperature PDH atmospheres.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中具有突出优势，主要解决了传统生产工艺在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与使用石脑油蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，PDH利用相对丰富的丙烷原料，并产生较少的副产品。传统工艺使用贵重金属如铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）存在成本高和环境污染问题，限制了其进一步发展。而基于钴（Co）的PDH催化剂提供了经济可行且环保的替代方案。特别是那些在硅铝酸盐-1沸石中封装超小型钴氧化物簇的催化剂，在丙烷吸附、稳定脱氢物种以及通过π键机制促进丙烯生成方面表现出高活性和稳定性，同时防止过脱氢反应，确保高丙烯选择性。封装技术也有助于保持催化剂的稳定性和活性，防止在高温PDH气氛下常见的团聚和还原问题。

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, it offers a solution to the scarcity of fossil energy resources, making it more sustainable. Secondly, it circumvents the high costs associated with using precious metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr(VI)), reducing expenses. Cobalt-based catalysts are considered for PDH due to their efficient carbon-hydrogen activation capability and low cost. However, conventional impregnation methods often fail to ensure the metal precursor enters the zeolite pores effectively, leading to unsatisfactory stability. The introduction of ligand-assistance in situ crystallization for encapsulating metal species within zeolites has been explored to enhance the stability and efficiency of the catalysts. This method allows for the preparation of subnanometric CoO clusters, which have shown promise in oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reactions. In the study described, the researchers successfully prepared subnanometric CoO clusters, isolated framework Co2+, and Co3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The encapsulated CoO clusters were found to exhibit superior catalytic PDH performance compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles, highlighting the benefits of using encapsulated clusters for PDH reactions.

直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它解决了传统生产方法面临的几个挑战。首先，它提供了解决化石能源资源稀缺性的问题，使其更加可持续。其次，它避免了使用铂金（Pt）和六价铬（Cr(VI)）等贵重金属带来的高成本问题，降低了费用。由于其高效的碳-氢活化能力以及低成本，钴基催化剂被考虑用于PDH。然而，传统的浸渍方法往往无法确保金属前体有效地进入沸石孔道，导致稳定性不佳。对于在沸石中封装金属物种的介导辅助原位结晶方法的探索，以增强催化剂的稳定性和效率。该方法允许制备亚纳米级的CoO簇，它们已经在氧化烷基脱氢反应中显示出潜力。在描述的研究中，研究人员成功地准备了亚纳米级的CoO簇、孤立框架Co2+和Co3O4纳米颗粒封装在硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）沸石中。封装的CoO簇被发现具有与框架Co2+阳离子和Co3O4纳米颗粒相比，表现出优越的PDH催化性能，突出了封装簇在PDH反应中的优势。
