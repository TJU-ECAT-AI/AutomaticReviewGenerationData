[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."
[2] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."
[3] "It is widely recognized that the single-site (isolated) Co2+ species, acting as the Lewis acidic sites, can effectively catalyze the PDH reaction."
[4] "However, the as-prepared well-dispersed Co sites tend to aggregate and are reduced to metallic Co (Co0) under high temperature and strongly reducing PDH atmosphere, which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and is unfavorable for catalyst stability."
[5] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[6] "Moreover, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes a relatively abundant feedstock, propane, and produces fewer by-products compared to traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking. The conventional processes using precious metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) are expensive and pose environmental pollution issues, hindering their further development. PDH, especially with catalysts containing cobalt (Co), offers an economically viable and environmentally friendly alternative. The Co-based catalysts, particularly those encapsulating ultrasmall cobalt oxide clusters within silicalite-1 zeolite, exhibit high PDH activity and stability due to their unique structure. These clusters are effective in propane adsorption, stabilizing detached hydrogen species, and facilitating propylene production through a π-binding mechanism that prevents over-dehydrogenation, ensuring high propylene selectivity. The encapsulation technique also helps in maintaining the stability and activity of the catalysts by preventing sintering and reduction, which are common issues with cobalt-based catalysts under high-temperature PDH atmospheres.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中具有突出优势，主要解决了传统生产工艺在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与使用石脑油蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，PDH利用相对丰富的丙烷原料，并产生较少的副产品。传统工艺使用贵重金属如铂（Pt）和铬（Cr）存在成本高和环境污染问题，限制了其进一步发展。而基于钴（Co）的PDH催化剂提供了经济可行且环保的替代方案。特别是那些在硅铝酸盐-1沸石中封装超小型钴氧化物簇的催化剂，在丙烷吸附、稳定脱氢物种以及通过π键机制促进丙烯生成方面表现出高活性和稳定性，同时防止过脱氢反应，确保高丙烯选择性。封装技术也有助于保持催化剂的稳定性和活性，防止在高温PDH气氛下常见的团聚和还原问题。
