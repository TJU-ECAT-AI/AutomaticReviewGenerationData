Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, it offers a solution to the scarcity of fossil energy resources, making it more sustainable. Secondly, it circumvents the high costs associated with using precious metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr(VI)), reducing expenses. Cobalt-based catalysts are considered for PDH due to their efficient carbon-hydrogen activation capability and low cost. However, conventional impregnation methods often fail to ensure the metal precursor enters the zeolite pores effectively, leading to unsatisfactory stability. The introduction of ligand-assistance in situ crystallization for encapsulating metal species within zeolites has been explored to enhance the stability and efficiency of the catalysts. This method allows for the preparation of subnanometric CoO clusters, which have shown promise in oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reactions. In the study described, the researchers successfully prepared subnanometric CoO clusters, isolated framework Co2+, and Co3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The encapsulated CoO clusters were found to exhibit superior catalytic PDH performance compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles, highlighting the benefits of using encapsulated clusters for PDH reactions.

直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它解决了传统生产方法面临的几个挑战。首先，它提供了解决化石能源资源稀缺性的问题，使其更加可持续。其次，它避免了使用铂金（Pt）和六价铬（Cr(VI)）等贵重金属带来的高成本问题，降低了费用。由于其高效的碳-氢活化能力以及低成本，钴基催化剂被考虑用于PDH。然而，传统的浸渍方法往往无法确保金属前体有效地进入沸石孔道，导致稳定性不佳。对于在沸石中封装金属物种的介导辅助原位结晶方法的探索，以增强催化剂的稳定性和效率。该方法允许制备亚纳米级的CoO簇，它们已经在氧化烷基脱氢反应中显示出潜力。在描述的研究中，研究人员成功地准备了亚纳米级的CoO簇、孤立框架Co2+和Co3O4纳米颗粒封装在硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）沸石中。封装的CoO簇被发现具有与框架Co2+阳离子和Co3O4纳米颗粒相比，表现出优越的PDH催化性能，突出了封装簇在PDH反应中的优势。
