[1] "With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."
[2] "However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."
[3] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[4] "Moreover, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."

1. The conventional propylene production methods, particularly naphtha steam cracking, are challenged by the depletion of fossil energy resources, failing to meet the rising demand for propylene.

2. The high expense of platinum (Pt) and the environmental concerns associated with chromium (Cr) VI significantly limit the expansion of these traditional propylene production technologies.

3. The superior propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity of the CoO@S-1 catalyst is attributed to the encapsulated cobalt oxide (CoO) clusters. These clusters enhance propane adsorption and maintain detached hydrogen species more effectively, resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers than conventional Co2+ ions or Co3O4 nanoparticles.

4. The π-binding mechanism of propylene on CoO clusters prevents excessive dehydrogenation reactions compared to the di-σ binding on metallic cobalt, contributing to the enhanced propylene selectivity and catalytic stability of the CoO@S-1 catalyst.

1. 传统的丙烯生产方法，特别是焦炉气裂解，面临着化石能源资源耗尽的问题，无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 高昂的铂（Pt）成本以及六价铬（Cr VI）引发的环境问题极大地限制了这些传统丙烯生产技术的发展。

3. CoO@S-1催化剂的高效丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性归因于封装的钴氧化物（CoO）簇。这些簇提高了丙烷吸附能力，并更有效地保持了脱氢后生成的氢原子，导致与常规Co2+离子或Co3O4纳米粒子相比更低的脱氢壁垒。

4. CoO簇上的π键合机制能够防止丙烯过度脱氢反应，与金属钴上的双σ键合机制相比，这有助于提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。
