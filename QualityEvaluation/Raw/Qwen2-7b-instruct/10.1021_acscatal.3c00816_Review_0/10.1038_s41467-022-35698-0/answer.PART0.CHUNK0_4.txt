1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing a more efficient and environmentally friendly process. It specifically tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, especially considering the growing demand for propylene and the benefits of using shale gas resources. 

2. The key advantages of PDH technology lie in its potential to reduce costs and improve product quality. It offers a more sustainable alternative to traditional methods, particularly those involving precious metals like platinum and chromium, which are expensive and can be toxic.

3. The use of silica-supported metal catalysts, specifically those containing highly dispersed tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)), has shown promise in breaking C-H bonds of alkanes efficiently. These catalysts, when optimized, can potentially enhance the PDH process's reactivity and selectivity for propylene production.

4. The presence of adsorbed water on the silica support plays a crucial role in the formation of these highly dispersed and stable metal sites, which are essential for achieving optimal PDH performance. This understanding provides a simpler and more effective method for designing high-reactivity cobalt-based PDH catalysts.
