Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, a widely available feedstock, which reduces reliance on scarce resources like naphtha or heavy oils. This makes the process more sustainable and economically viable.

2. Process efficiency: PDH technology enables the direct conversion of propane into propylene, bypassing the need for multiple steps typically involved in conventional methods. This simplification leads to increased efficiency and potentially lower energy consumption.

3. Product selectivity: PDH catalysts, particularly those with tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites, exhibit high selectivity for propylene production. They minimize the formation of unwanted byproducts like ethylene and methane, enhancing the purity of the propylene output.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology provides a more sustainable, efficient, and selective route to propylene production compared to traditional methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面具有多个关键优势，能够解决传统方法面临的一些挑战，具体体现在以下几个方面：

1. 原料供应：PDH技术利用广泛可用的丙烷作为原料，减少了对稀缺资源如石脑油或重油的依赖。这使得过程更加可持续和经济可行。

2. 过程效率：与传统方法相比，PDH技术能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了多步转化过程。这种简化提高了效率，并可能降低了能源消耗。

3. 产品选择性：PDH催化剂，特别是那些包含四面体钴(II)位点的催化剂，表现出高选择性，用于丙烯生产。它们最大限度地减少了乙烯和甲烷等副产品的形成，提高了丙烯输出的纯度。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术提供了一种比传统方法更可持续、更高效、选择性更高的丙烯生产途径。
