[1] "With the growing demand for propylene and the explosion of the shale gas revolution17, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has become more commercially attractive18, which exhibits significant environmental and energy implications."
[2] "However, commercial PDH processes using high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have restricted their further developments20,21."
[3] "Recently, the well-defined and highly dispersed sites of Fe22, Ga23, Zn24, Co25 and Y26, obtained via grafting tailored metal precursors within hydroxyl on the silica supports, have shown the capability to break C-H bonds of alkanes."
[4] "Among these catalysts, highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) have gained much interest, due to its superior PDH catalytic potential27,28."
[5] "Specifically, adsorbed water coexists normally with the surface hydroxyl groups of silica support, focuses towards the role of adsorbed water in regulating the generation of highly dispersed and stable metal sites, however, is yet underestimated."
[6] "The present work illustrates new understanding of adsorbed water on silica for inducing the formation of highly dispersed cobalt(II) sites, and provides simple and effective approach to design high reactivity of cobalt-based PDH catalyst."
[7] "A high C3H8 conversion (37%) and C3H6 selectivity (96%) were achieved over the Dir-reduction catalyst."
[8] "It is known that the structure of Co3O4 and metallic Co were most likely led to the cracking of C-C bonds, causing the formation of CH4 and some coke precursors34,55, while highly dispersed Td-Co(II) were supposed to be efficient in C-H activation for hydrocarbons52."
[9] "Regarding the above results, our calculations are consistent with the experimental results of a higher PDH reactivity for the Dir-reduction Co/SBA-15 catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. These include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional production methods often rely on limited resources such as petroleum or natural gas, whereas PDH utilizes abundant shale gas as a feedstock, which is more readily accessible and economically viable.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes have the potential to be more efficient in terms of energy use and yield. High-performance catalysts, like the tetrahedral cobalt(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) synthesized via direct reduction, can enhance the conversion rates of propane to propylene, making the overall process more economically feasible.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of well-defined and highly dispersed metal sites, particularly those of cobalt(II) in tetrahedral configurations, improves the selectivity of the PDH process. These sites are capable of efficiently breaking C-H bonds in alkanes, leading to a higher yield of propylene compared to conventional catalysts that might result in the formation of undesirable byproducts like methane and coke precursors.

PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by leveraging abundant resources, optimizing the reaction conditions through advanced catalyst designs, and enhancing the selectivity of the propylene production, thus offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution for propylene manufacturing.

考虑到全球对丙烯的日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够解决几个关键挑战。这些包括：

1. **原料可用性**：传统的生产方法往往依赖于有限的资源，如石油或天然气，而PDH过程则利用易于获取且经济的页岩气作为原料，这使得整体过程更加经济可行。

2. **工艺效率**：PDH过程在能源使用和产量方面可能更有效。通过直接减少合成的高性能催化剂，如二价四面体钴（II）（Td-cobalt（II））位点，可以提高丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率，从而使整体过程更具经济效益。

3. **产品选择性**：利用定义明确、高度分散的金属位点，尤其是二价四面体钴（II），PDH过程的产物选择性得到改善。这些位点能够高效地断裂烷烃中的C-H键，导致丙烯产量更高，与常规催化剂相比，后者可能导致形成不希望的副产品，如甲烷和焦炭前体。

PDH技术通过利用丰富资源、优化反应条件和提高丙烯生产的产物选择性，具体解决了这些挑战，提供了一种可持续和成本效益高的丙烯制造解决方案。
