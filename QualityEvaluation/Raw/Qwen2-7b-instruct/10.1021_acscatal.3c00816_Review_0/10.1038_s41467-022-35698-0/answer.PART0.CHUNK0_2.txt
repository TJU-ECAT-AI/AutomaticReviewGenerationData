[1] "In the vast majority of catalytic processes, the interaction between support and active metal site is of great importance in determining their catalytic performance."
[2] "However, commercial PDH processes using high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have restricted their further developments."
[3] "Recently, the well-defined and highly dispersed sites of Fe22, Ga23, Zn24, Co25 and Y26, obtained via grafting tailored metal precursors within hydroxyl on the silica supports, have shown the capability to break C-H bonds of alkanes."
[4] "Among these catalysts, highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) have gained much interest, due to its superior PDH catalytic potential."
[5] "The present work illustrates new understanding of adsorbed water on silica for inducing the formation of highly dispersed cobalt(II) sites, and provides simple and effective approach to design high reactivity of cobalt-based PDH catalyst."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on expensive and toxic catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 and Cr/Al2O3, which limit their scalability and environmental impact. PDH, particularly with the use of highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites, offers a more efficient and selective process for breaking C-H bonds in alkanes to produce propylene. This method utilizes silica-supported metal catalysts, where the interaction between support and metal site plays a crucial role in catalytic performance. The incorporation of adsorbed water on the silica surface enhances the formation of these active Co(II) sites, leading to improved PDH reactivity and potentially reducing the need for costly and hazardous catalysts. This approach not only addresses the challenges of conventional methods but also promises a cleaner and more economically viable pathway for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的几个关键优势包括在传统方法中解决的挑战，涉及原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。传统方法通常依赖昂贵且有毒的催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3和Cr/Al2O3，这限制了它们的可扩展性和环境影响。PDH，特别是使用高度分散的四面体Co(II)位点，为打破烷烃中的C-H键以产生丙烯提供了一个更高效和选择性的过程。这种方法利用了基于二氧化硅的金属催化剂，其中支持物与金属位点之间的相互作用对催化性能起着关键作用。在二氧化硅表面上吸附水的存在增强了这些活性Co(II)位点的形成，从而提高了PDH反应性，并可能减少对昂贵和有害催化剂的需求。这种方法不仅解决了传统方法的挑战，还提供了更清洁且经济上更可行的丙烯生产途径。
