[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand."
[2] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts. After adding platinum, the resulting PtZn-zeolites were tested as catalysts in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "A comparison of the propane conversions after 1 and 12 h on-stream clearly reveals that all these catalysts are prone to deactivation. This deactivation is less pronounced at higher zinc loadings."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without undergoing oxidation, thereby addressing several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the following issues:

1. Feedstock availability: Unlike traditional methods that rely on crude oil, PDH utilizes abundant natural gas as a feedstock, ensuring a steady supply and reducing dependency on fluctuating oil markets.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers higher energy efficiency compared to steam cracking, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. It also operates at lower temperatures, decreasing the risk of equipment damage and maintenance needs.

3. Product selectivity: PDH provides a high selectivity for propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as ethylene, benzene, and other unwanted compounds, which are typically produced in significant quantities during conventional processes.

4. Environmental impact: By avoiding the oxidation step, PDH reduces greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants associated with conventional cracking processes, making it a cleaner alternative for propylene production.

5. Economic feasibility: With advancements in catalyst development and process optimization, PDH has become economically viable, offering competitive prices for propylene compared to traditional methods, especially as the cost of natural gas decreases.

6. Flexibility in operation: PDH plants can operate efficiently under a wide range of conditions, providing flexibility in managing fluctuations in demand and feedstock availability.

The systematic investigation of loading zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange aims to enhance the performance of PDH catalysts, focusing on improving their stability, selectivity, and efficiency. This research contributes to the development of more robust and sustainable PDH processes, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity while aligning with the growing demand for propylene.
