[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand."
[2] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
[3] "Aromatization occurred over the 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, whereas propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction over the 12-membered-ring zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y."
[4] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[5] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. "

1. The growing global demand for propylene has led to increasing interest in propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as a promising method for propylene production, primarily due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity that are encountered with conventional production methods.

2. The systematic investigation of the loading of zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange was conducted to explore the potential of PDH technology. 

3. The dehydrogenation of propane occurred predominantly over 12-membered-ring zeolites, while aromatization was the primary reaction over 10-membered-ring zeolites.

4. The zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta demonstrated a stable conversion rate equivalent to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene under specified conditions, indicating its suitability for PDH processes.

5. Zeolites Beta and mordenite, characterized by specific nSi/nAl ratios and zinc contents, achieved the highest and most stable conversion levels in PDH processes, showcasing the effectiveness of these materials in propylene production.
