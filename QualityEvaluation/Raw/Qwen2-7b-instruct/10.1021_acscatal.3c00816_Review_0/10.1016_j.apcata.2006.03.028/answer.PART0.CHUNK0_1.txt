<p>The propane dehydrogenation over PtZn-containing zeolites is a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without the need for oxygen, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. It offers higher process efficiency compared to traditional methods, as it avoids the energy-intensive steps required for steam cracking or the need for hydrogen supplementation, which can be costly and complex.</p>
<p>The method specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike steam cracking, which requires crude oil or natural gas as feedstocks and produces a mixture of products including propylene, propane dehydrogenation offers a cleaner, more direct route to propylene. It also potentially improves product selectivity, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as coke and methane, which can be a significant issue in traditional processes.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of PtZn-containing zeolites as catalysts provides a stable and selective environment for the dehydrogenation reaction, enabling high conversion levels and propylene yields. The catalysts can maintain stable performance over long periods, which is crucial for industrial applications. Moreover, the process can operate under mild conditions, further enhancing its economic feasibility and environmental sustainability.</p>

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯而无需氧气。这解决了原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更高的过程效率，并避免了蒸汽裂解所需的能源密集型步骤或对氢补充的需求，这些可能成本高昂且复杂。使用含PtZn的沸石作为催化剂提供了一个稳定且选择性的环境来进行脱氢反应，从而实现高转化率和丙烯产率。这些催化剂可以长时间保持稳定的性能，而且该过程可以在温和条件下进行，进一步提高其经济可行性和环境可持续性。
