In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without undergoing oxidation, thereby addressing several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the following issues:

1. Feedstock availability: Unlike traditional methods that rely on crude oil, PDH utilizes abundant natural gas as a feedstock, ensuring a steady supply and reducing dependency on fluctuating oil markets.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers higher energy efficiency compared to steam cracking, reducing operational costs and environmental impact. It also operates at lower temperatures, decreasing the risk of equipment damage and maintenance needs.

3. Product selectivity: PDH provides a high selectivity for propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as ethylene, benzene, and other unwanted compounds, which are typically produced in significant quantities during conventional processes.

4. Environmental impact: By avoiding the oxidation step, PDH reduces greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants associated with conventional cracking processes, making it a cleaner alternative for propylene production.

5. Economic feasibility: With advancements in catalyst development and process optimization, PDH has become economically viable, offering competitive prices for propylene compared to traditional methods, especially as the cost of natural gas decreases.

6. Flexibility in operation: PDH plants can operate efficiently under a wide range of conditions, providing flexibility in managing fluctuations in demand and feedstock availability.

The systematic investigation of loading zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange aims to enhance the performance of PDH catalysts, focusing on improving their stability, selectivity, and efficiency. This research contributes to the development of more robust and sustainable PDH processes, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity while aligning with the growing demand for propylene.

[2] "In the last decade, the application of PtSn-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes has been largely reviewed."
[3] "An additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

In response to the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. It addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available worldwide. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on more limited and expensive sources like naphtha or natural gas.

2. Process Efficiency: The PDH process is more energy-efficient than traditional steam cracking, requiring less heat input to convert propane into propylene. This leads to lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH produces propylene selectively without the need for additional separation processes. In contrast, steam cracking yields a mixture of ethylene and propylene, necessitating further processing to isolate propylene, which can be less energy-intensive but more costly.

By employing advanced catalysts, such as those containing bimetallic systems like PtZn, the PDH process can achieve high selectivity for propylene, making it an attractive alternative to conventional production methods.

面对全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中展现出极高的潜力。它以以下几种方式解决了传统生产方法所面临的挑战：

1. 原料供应：PDH使用丙烷作为主要原料，该原料在全球范围内丰富且易于获取。相比之下，传统方法往往依赖于更有限和昂贵的来源，如石脑油或天然气。

2. 过程效率：PDH过程在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面更为节能，需要较少的热量输入。这导致运营成本更低，并减少了环境影响。

3. 产品选择性：PDH过程能够高度选择性地生产丙烯，而无需额外的分离过程。相比之下，蒸汽裂解产生乙烷和丙烯的混合物，需要进一步处理以分离丙烯，这可能既不那么节能，成本也更高。

通过采用先进的催化剂，如PtZn双金属系统，PDH过程可以实现高选择性地生成丙烯，使其成为传统生产方法的替代选择。

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the need for steam cracking, which traditionally relies on heavy hydrocarbons as feedstocks. This makes PDH more versatile, as it can utilize lighter hydrocarbons, including propane, which is more readily available and cost-effective. Moreover, PDH processes are designed for high efficiency, minimizing energy consumption and waste generation, thus enhancing process economics. Additionally, PDH offers better product selectivity, producing propylene with high purity and minimal byproducts, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. The study highlights the use of zeolite-supported catalysts in PDH, which enables high conversion rates and selectivity to propene, especially when optimized for specific zeolite structures and zinc loadings. The catalysts tested in the study showed stable performance for at least 63 hours under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, indicating efficient and reliable operation.
