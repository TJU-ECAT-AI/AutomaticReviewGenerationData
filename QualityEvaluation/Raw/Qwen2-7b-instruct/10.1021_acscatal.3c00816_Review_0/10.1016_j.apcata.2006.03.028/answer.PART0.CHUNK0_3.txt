[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand."
[2] "In the last decade, the application of PtSn-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes has been largely reviewed."
[3] "An additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."
[4] "Moreover, this catalyst showed a very low deactivation rate (0.4% conversion loss per day from Xi-Bu = 41% at 3.5 h on-stream) in the absence of hydrogen."
[5] "Zeolites are particularly attractive host systems for dehydrogenation catalysts, since they may impose shape-selectivity, thus favoring the formation of dehydrogenation over oligomerization products such as coke."
[6] "Nevertheless, zeolites have been rarely studied as supports for the bimetallic PtZn system."
[7] "However, up to now, few reports exist on zinc loading into completely Na- or K-exchanged zeolites."
[8] "In particular, the effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated."

In response to the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. It addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available worldwide. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on more limited and expensive sources like naphtha or natural gas.

2. Process Efficiency: The PDH process is more energy-efficient than traditional steam cracking, requiring less heat input to convert propane into propylene. This leads to lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH produces propylene selectively without the need for additional separation processes. In contrast, steam cracking yields a mixture of ethylene and propylene, necessitating further processing to isolate propylene, which can be less energy-intensive but more costly.

By employing advanced catalysts, such as those containing bimetallic systems like PtZn, the PDH process can achieve high selectivity for propylene, making it an attractive alternative to conventional production methods.

面对全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中展现出极高的潜力。它以以下几种方式解决了传统生产方法所面临的挑战：

1. 原料供应：PDH使用丙烷作为主要原料，该原料在全球范围内丰富且易于获取。相比之下，传统方法往往依赖于更有限和昂贵的来源，如石脑油或天然气。

2. 过程效率：PDH过程在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面更为节能，需要较少的热量输入。这导致运营成本更低，并减少了环境影响。

3. 产品选择性：PDH过程能够高度选择性地生产丙烯，而无需额外的分离过程。相比之下，蒸汽裂解产生乙烷和丙烯的混合物，需要进一步处理以分离丙烯，这可能既不那么节能，成本也更高。

通过采用先进的催化剂，如PtZn双金属系统，PDH过程可以实现高选择性地生成丙烯，使其成为传统生产方法的替代选择。
