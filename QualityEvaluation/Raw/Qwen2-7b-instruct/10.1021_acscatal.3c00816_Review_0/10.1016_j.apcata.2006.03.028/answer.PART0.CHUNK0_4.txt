[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand [1]."
[2] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
[3] "Aromatization occurred over the 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, whereas propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction over the 12-membered-ring zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y."
[4] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[5] "These catalysts exhibited high propane conversions (up to ca. 20%) and propene selectivities (up to ca. 75%) [19]."
[6] "The higher fraction of isolated Zn2+ sites (cf. Section 3.1.1), aromatization of propane can readily occur on PtZn-containing zeolite Y. Like for the zeolite Beta-derived catalysts, the initially formed aromatics may undergo consecutive reactions to coke deposits."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the need for steam cracking, which traditionally relies on heavy hydrocarbons as feedstocks. This makes PDH more versatile, as it can utilize lighter hydrocarbons, including propane, which is more readily available and cost-effective. Moreover, PDH processes are designed for high efficiency, minimizing energy consumption and waste generation, thus enhancing process economics. Additionally, PDH offers better product selectivity, producing propylene with high purity and minimal byproducts, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. The study highlights the use of zeolite-supported catalysts in PDH, which enables high conversion rates and selectivity to propene, especially when optimized for specific zeolite structures and zinc loadings. The catalysts tested in the study showed stable performance for at least 63 hours under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, indicating efficient and reliable operation.
