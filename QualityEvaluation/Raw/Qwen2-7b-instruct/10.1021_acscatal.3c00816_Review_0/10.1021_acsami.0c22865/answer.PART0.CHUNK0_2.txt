The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by offering a more direct and energy-efficient conversion pathway compared to traditional methods. This technology utilizes a catalyst that facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction under controlled conditions, ensuring high yield and selectivity of propylene. Moreover, PDH can potentially utilize a wider range of feedstocks, including unconventional ones, which enhances its flexibility and adaptability in meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
