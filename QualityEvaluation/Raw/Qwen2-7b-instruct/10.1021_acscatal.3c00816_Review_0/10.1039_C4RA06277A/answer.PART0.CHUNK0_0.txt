[1] "Because of growing demand for propylene, much effort has been paid to new propylene production routes. Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it makes low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."
[2] "The deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process.14 Therefore, it is important to develop supported chromia catalysts with high reactivity, selectivity and stability."
[3] "The chromia-alumina catalysts revealed in previous works are mainly prepared by the methods of co-precipitation, incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer self-assembly, atomic layer deposition technique and so on.1,1922 However, to our best knowledge, the utilization of hydrothermal method to synthesize CrOxAl2O3 catalysts for the dehydration of light alkanes has not been revealed."
[4] "The prepared CrOxAl2O3 catalysts were well characterized by numerous state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The XPS and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra confirm that the existence of Cr6+ and Cr3+, and the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio varies with the Cr loadings of xCr/Al2O3 catalysts."
[5] "The propane conversion increase firstly with Cr loading and attain a peak point with 7.5% Cr loading, and then decreases with the further Cr loading in the catalysts. This variation trend is identical to the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in xCr/Al2O3 catalysts, implying that Cr6+ species are important for DHP reaction."
[6] "The synthesized 7.5Cr/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest propane conversion of 62% accompanying with 89% propylene selectivity at 873 K. After regenerated by re-calcinating in air, the original activity of spent catalyst is well recovered."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH converts low-value propane into high-valuable propylene, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. Conventional production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), often rely on crude oil as their primary feedstock, which can be limited in supply. PDH utilizes a readily available resource, propane, which is abundant in many regions.

Secondly, PDH offers higher process efficiency compared to traditional methods. The conversion of propane to propylene in PDH is typically more direct and efficient, reducing the overall energy consumption and potential waste generation.

Lastly, PDH provides better product selectivity. The selectivity refers to the ability of the process to produce a desired product (propylene) over other byproducts. In PDH, the selectivity for propylene is optimized, leading to a higher yield of propylene and potentially lower production costs. This is particularly significant in terms of environmental impact and economic benefits.

Cr-based catalysts are crucial for PDH processes, but they face challenges such as deactivation due to catalytic cracking and coking. Developing supported chromia catalysts with high reactivity, selectivity, and stability is essential for overcoming these challenges. The hydrothermal method, which was not previously utilized for synthesizing CrOxAl2O3 catalysts for the dehydration of light alkanes, offers a promising route to enhance catalyst performance.

The research demonstrates that the CrOxAl2O3 catalysts synthesized via the hydrothermal method exhibit high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. The specific surface area and dispersion of chromia on the surface of γ-Al2O3 contribute to the catalyst's efficiency. The XPS and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra confirm the presence of both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, and the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio varies with the chromium loading in the catalysts. This variation trend aligns with the propane conversion and propylene selectivity, indicating that Cr6+ species play a critical role in the DHP reaction.

The synthesized 7.5Cr/Al2O3 catalyst shows the highest propane conversion of 62% alongside an impressive propylene selectivity of 89% at 873 K. Importantly, after regenerating the spent catalyst by re-calcining in air, the original activity is well recovered, highlighting the catalyst's stability and recyclability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它有几个关键优势。首先，PDH将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，解决了原料可用性的问题。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）往往依赖于有限的原油资源作为主要原料。PDH利用的是大量存在的资源，即丙烷，这在许多地区都是丰富的。

其次，PDH在过程效率上比传统方法更为高效。PDH将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的过程通常更直接、更有效，从而减少了总体能源消耗和潜在的废物产生。

最后，PDH提供了更好的产品选择性。产品选择性指的是过程能够以多大程度生产所需的产品（丙烯），而较少生成其他副产品。在PDH中，对丙烯的选择性得到了优化，导致了更高的丙烯产率和潜在更低的生产成本。这对于环境影响和经济效益都非常重要。

基于铬的催化剂对于PDH过程至关重要，但它们面临挑战，如由于催化裂解和结焦而导致的催化剂失活。开发具有高活性、选择性和稳定性的支持型铬氧化物催化剂对于克服这些挑战是至关重要的。以前没有使用过水热合成法合成CrOxAl2O3催化剂用于轻烷烃的脱水，这种方法为提高催化剂性能提供了有希望的途径。

研究表明，通过水热法合成的铬氧化铝催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高催化活性。γ-Al2O3表面的高表面积和分散的铬氧化物贡献了催化剂的效率。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和漫反射紫外-可见光谱证实了存在Cr6+和Cr3+物种，并且xCr/Al2O3催化剂中的Cr6+/Cr3+比率随铬负载的变化。这种变化趋势与丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性相吻合，表明Cr6+物种在DHP反应中起着关键作用。

合成的7.5Cr/Al2O3催化剂显示出62%的最高丙烷转化率以及89%的丙烯选择性，在873 K下。重要的是，再生后的废弃催化剂通过在空气中再煅烧恢复了原始活性，突出了催化剂的稳定性和可回收性。
