In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH allows for the transformation of low-value propane into high-valuable propylene, which is currently primarily produced through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes. This shift addresses the challenges associated with conventional production methods in several key areas:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is readily available worldwide. This contrasts with steam cracking and FCC, which often require specific types of crude oil or heavy hydrocarbons that may be limited in supply or subject to price volatility.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient route to propylene production. By directly converting propane into propylene, it bypasses the multiple steps involved in steam cracking and FCC, potentially reducing energy consumption and lowering operational costs. Moreover, the use of supported chromia catalysts with optimized reactivity, selectivity, and stability ensures that the PDH process is both effective and sustainable.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The ability to control the catalyst composition and operating conditions in PDH enables the production of high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts. For instance, the 7.5Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, with its optimized Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio, achieves a high propane conversion of 62% while maintaining a high propylene selectivity of 89%. This level of selectivity is crucial for industries that rely on pure propylene as a raw material for downstream products like polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, and acrolein.

4. **Regeneration Potential**: A significant advantage of PDH catalysts, particularly those employing supported chromia, is their ability to be regenerated by re-calcining in air. This means that spent catalysts can be restored to their original activity, reducing the need for frequent catalyst replacement and minimizing waste. This regenerative capability enhances the economic viability and environmental sustainability of the PDH process.

In conclusion, propane direct dehydrogenation technology provides a robust solution to the growing demand for propylene, addressing issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity while offering the potential for catalyst regeneration to maintain operational effectiveness and reduce environmental impact.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中展现出最具前景的方法。这主要是基于以下几点：

1. **原料获取**：PDH通过利用易于获取的丙烷作为主要原料，解决了传统生产方法中可能遇到的原料供应限制和价格波动问题。与蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）过程相比，PDH提供了一种更高效的丙烯生产路径，直接将丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯。

2. **工艺效率**：PDH通过直接转化丙烷到丙烯，减少了蒸汽裂解和FCC过程中涉及的多步骤操作，从而可能降低能耗并降低运营成本。此外，优化铬基催化剂的反应性、选择性和稳定性确保PDH过程既高效又可持续。

3. **产品选择性**：通过控制催化剂组成和操作条件，PDH能够实现高纯度丙烯的生产，同时最大限度地减少副产品的生成。例如，含7.5%铬的铝氧化物催化剂，其优化的Cr6+/Cr3+比率，实现了高达62%的丙烷转化率和89%的丙烯选择性。这种高的选择性对于下游产品如聚丙烯、环氧丙烷、丙烯腈和丙烯酸的生产至关重要。

4. **催化剂再生能力**：PDH催化剂，特别是那些采用支持型铬氧化物的催化剂，具有在空气中再烧结以恢复原始活性的能力。这意味着可以恢复使用过的催化剂的原有活性，减少了频繁更换催化剂的需求，并降低了废物产生。这种再生能力增强了PDH过程的经济可行性和环境可持续性。

综上所述，丙烷直接脱氢技术为满足不断增长的丙烯需求提供了稳健的解决方案，解决了原料获取、工艺效率和产品选择性的问题，同时提供了催化剂再生的可能性，以维持操作有效性并减少环境影响。
