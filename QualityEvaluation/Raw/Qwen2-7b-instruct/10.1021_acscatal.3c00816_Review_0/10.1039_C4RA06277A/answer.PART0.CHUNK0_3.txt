[1] "Because of growing demand for propylene, much effort has been paid to new propylene production routes."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it makes low-value propane to high valuable propylene."
[3] "However, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process."
[4] "Therefore, it is important to develop supported chromia catalysts with high reactivity, selectivity and stability."
[5] "The synthesized 7.5Cr/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest propane conversion of 62% accompanied by 89% propylene selectivity at 873 K."
[6] "After regenerated by re-calcinating in air, the original activity of the spent catalyst is well recovered."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to convert low-value propane into high-valuable propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on expensive and resource-intensive processes such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which can be inefficient and have limited selectivity towards propylene. PDH offers a more direct and potentially cost-effective route to produce propylene from propane, making it a viable alternative. Moreover, the use of supported chromia catalysts in PDH processes can enhance reactivity, selectivity, and stability, reducing the challenges posed by catalyst deactivation due to catalytic cracking and coking. The hydrothermally prepared 7.5Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, for instance, demonstrated high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with the ability to recover its original activity after regeneration, showcasing its potential for industrial application.

由于对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法之一。它能够将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，从而解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。传统的生产方法通常依赖于昂贵且资源密集型的过程，如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC），这些过程可能效率低下，并且丙烯的选择性有限。PDH提供了一种更直接且可能更经济有效的途径来生产丙烯，使其成为一种可行的替代方案。此外，在PDH过程中使用支持铬氧化物催化剂可以增强活性、选择性和稳定性，降低由于催化裂解和结焦导致的催化剂失活的挑战。例如，经过水热合成的7.5Cr/Al2O3催化剂显示出了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，并且在再生后其原始活性得到了恢复，这表明其具有工业应用的潜力。
