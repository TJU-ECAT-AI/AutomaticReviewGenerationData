[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."
[2] "Because of growing demand for propylene, much effort has been paid to new propylene production routes."
[3] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene."
[4] "However, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process."
[5] "Therefore, it is important to develop supported chromia catalysts with high reactivity, selectivity and stability."
[6] "The synthesized 7.5Cr/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest propane conversion of 62% accompanied by 89% propylene selectivity at 873 K."
[7] "After regenerated by re-calcinating in air, the original activity of the spent catalyst is well recovered."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by converting low-value propane into high-value propylene, which is traditionally produced through less sustainable processes such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). This method optimizes the use of feedstocks, enhancing process efficiency, and yields a higher selectivity for propylene production, thereby improving environmental sustainability and economic viability.
