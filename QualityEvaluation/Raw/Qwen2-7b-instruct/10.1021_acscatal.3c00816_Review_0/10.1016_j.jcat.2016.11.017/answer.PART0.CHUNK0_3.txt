[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol."
[2] "The Catofin process uses a Cr-based catalyst in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, while the Oleflex process uses a Pt-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor."
[3] "Both processes inevitably undergo rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane."
[5] "Propane feedstocks can be also applied in propane aromatization processes to produce benzene, toluene, and xylene."
[6] "Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process."
[7] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases."
[8] "They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization."
[9] "However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5."
[10] "During the synthesis of gallosilicate molecular sieves, the trivalent Ga3+ species not incorporated in the framework remain in the zeolite channels as highly dispersed oxide species."
[11] "Extra-framework Ga species can also be formed by degalliation of framework Ga, and the role of these species on PDH has been discussed."
[12] "For instance, Meriaudeau et al. carried out propane dehydrogenation at low conversions (<1%) using HZSM-5 and gallosilicate."
[13] "Hart et al. focused on preparation of selective dehydrogenation catalysts by Ga and in addition to H-ZSM-5 with few or no zeolite protonic sites."
[14] "Ga-modified MFI catalysts have not been widely studied for PDH due to the low propylene selectivities observed at high conversions."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology takes advantage of abundant propane supplies, particularly in North America and the Middle East, providing a sustainable and cost-effective feedstock source.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Unlike traditional methods that may suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation, PDH processes have received renewed interest due to advancements in catalyst design, such as gallosilicate MFI zeolites, which offer enhanced performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of gallosilicate MFI catalysts with specific synthesis methods, incorporating 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS), can lead to catalysts with lower Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity. This results in a higher concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which are crucial for controlling the selectivity of PDH, thus reducing cracking and aromatization products while increasing propylene yield.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more efficient and selective method of propylene production by utilizing abundant propane feedstocks, employing advanced catalysts, and minimizing unwanted side reactions through optimized control of the dehydrogenation process.

针对传统生产方法面临的挑战，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势包括：

1. **原料供应**：PDH 技术利用北美和中东地区丰富的丙烷资源，提供了一个可持续且成本效益高的原料来源。

2. **工艺效率**：与可能因催化剂快速失活而效率降低的传统方法相比，PDH 过程近年来受到关注。通过设计如加硅沸石 MFI 催化剂等，可以实现更高的丙烷转化率和更好的丙烯选择性，提高过程效率。

3. **产品选择性**：使用特定合成方法制备的加硅沸石 MFI 催化剂，通过添加 3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS），可以降低布郎斯酸性并增强李维斯酸性。这导致强李维斯酸位点的高浓度，对于控制 PDH 过程的选择性至关重要，从而减少裂解和芳香化产物，同时增加丙烯产量。

总之，PDH 技术通过利用丰富的丙烷原料、采用先进催化剂以及优化控制脱氢过程以减少不希望的副反应，提供了一种更高效、选择性更高的丙烯生产方法。
