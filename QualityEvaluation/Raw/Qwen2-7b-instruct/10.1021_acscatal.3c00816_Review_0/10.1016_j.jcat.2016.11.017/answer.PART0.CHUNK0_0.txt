[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol."
[2] "The Catofin process uses a Cr-based catalyst in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, while the Oleflex process uses a Pt-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor."
[3] "PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane, and there are renewed efforts aimed at discovering new PDH catalysts or improving the stability, activity, and selectivity of known PDH catalysts."
[4] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases."
[5] "However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5."
[6] "It was proposed that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage."
[7] "Previously, MPS has been used to incorporate metal and metal sulfide clusters such as Pt, Rh, Ag, and CdS in MFI, SOD, GIS and LTA zeolite channels."
[8] "Specifically, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as a functional silane during the gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis."
[9] "We report a detailed structural and catalytic (PDH) characterization of Ga-MFI catalysts prepared by this technique, based upon the hypothesis that the altered mechanisms of Ga incorporation induced by the addition of MPS would lead to a different acid site profiles and catalytic behavior."
[10] "These catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS give higher propylene selectivities and enhanced propane conversion rates at a fixed propylene conversion level."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene under mild conditions. This technology addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant propane feedstocks, which are readily available in many regions, including North America and the Middle East. This makes PDH a viable and flexible option for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes, such as the Catofin and Oleflex methods, employ efficient catalysts (Cr-based and Pt-based, respectively) that enable high conversion rates of propane to propylene. These catalysts are designed to maximize the yield of propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of gallosilicate MFI catalysts with added MPS enhances the selectivity of PDH, leading to higher propylene yields and reduced formation of cracking and aromatization products. This results in a cleaner and more economically attractive propylene output compared to traditional methods.

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods, particularly in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Its ability to utilize abundant propane feedstocks, coupled with the enhanced selectivity and efficiency provided by advanced catalysts like gallosilicate MFI modified with MPS, makes PDH a promising approach for propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它能够在温和条件下高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。这种技术在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH使用的是大量可获得的丙烷原料，特别是在北美和中东等地区。这使得PDH成为一种可行且灵活的丙烯生产方式。

2. **过程效率**：PDH过程（如Catofin和Oleflex方法）采用高效的催化剂（如基于Cr和Pt的催化剂），能够实现丙烷向丙烯的高转化率。这些催化剂设计用于最大化丙烯的产率，同时减少副产品的形成。

3. **产品选择性**：通过添加MPS的改性MFI沸石催化剂，提高了PDH的选择性，导致更高的丙烯产率和较少的裂化和芳构化产品的生成。与传统方法相比，这种方法提供了更清洁且经济上更具吸引力的丙烯输出。

答案：丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面提供了几个关键优势，特别是通过先进的催化剂（如改性MFI沸石）的使用，使PDH成为丙烯生产有前景的方式。
