[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol."
[2] "The production of propylene from catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is carried out commercially by the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] and the Oleflex process from UOP [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ."
[3] "Both processes inevitably undergo rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane, and there are renewed efforts aimed at discovering new PDH catalysts or improving the stability, activity, and selectivity of known PDH catalysts."
[5] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) behavior of gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) is investigated."
[6] "MPS addition to the zeolite synthesis gel results in gallosilicate molecular sieves with reduced Brnsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity, as shown by combined NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), isopropylamine (IPA) TPD and IR analysis of pyridine-loaded catalysts."
[7] "Enhanced PDH performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products are obtained from the catalysts synthesized with MPS."
[8] "The gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS are compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, and the gallosilicate materials have a lower rate of deactivation (>50% lower) but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (Ga-MFI: 75%; Chromia-Alumina: 85%)."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering better feedstock flexibility, enhanced process efficiency, and superior product selectivity. This technology is particularly advantageous due to its ability to utilize abundant propane feedstocks efficiently, reducing dependency on traditional and often scarce oil-based feedstocks. Additionally, PDH processes can offer higher propylene yields with reduced side reactions, leading to higher product purity and quality.

2. The gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized with 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) exhibit several key advantages over conventional catalysts in PDH processes. These catalysts demonstrate enhanced Lewis acidity, which is crucial for controlling the selectivity of PDH. By providing a significant concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, they enable higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity. Moreover, the use of MPS results in catalysts with a lower rate of deactivation, which translates to higher operational efficiency and potentially lower costs over time. Despite having slightly inferior propylene selectivity compared to a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, the gallosilicate MFI materials still offer significant improvements in terms of stability and overall performance.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法，因为它通过提供更好的原料灵活性、增强的工艺效率和更优的产品选择性来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。这种技术特别有优势，因为它能够高效地利用丰富的丙烷原料，减少对传统且往往稀缺的石油基原料的依赖。此外，PDH过程可以提供更高的丙烯产率，并减少副反应，从而提高产品纯度和质量。

2. 通过3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）合成的镓硅分子筛MFI催化剂在PDH过程中表现出几项关键优势。这些催化剂显示出增强的路易斯酸性，这对于控制PDH的选择性至关重要。通过提供大量强路易斯酸位点，它们能够实现更高的丙烷转化率和改进的丙烯选择性。此外，使用MPS的结果是催化剂的降解速率较低，这转化为更高的操作效率和可能的长期成本降低。尽管与基准氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂相比，镓硅MFI材料的丙烯选择性略低，但这些材料仍然在稳定性和总体性能方面提供了显著改进。
