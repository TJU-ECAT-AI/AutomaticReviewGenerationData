[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol."
[2] "The Catofin process uses a Cr-based catalyst in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, while the Oleflex process uses a Pt-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor."
[3] "Both processes inevitably undergo rapid catalyst deactivation."
[4] "PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane."
[5] "The strength of the Brnsted acid sites depends on the types of heteroatoms in the framework, and it is known that bridged framework Ga provides lower acidity than Al."
[6] "It has been suggested that the Lewis acid sites are related to positively charged oxide clusters in zeolite pore structures, normally extra-framework species."
[7] "During the synthesis of gallosilicate molecular sieves, the trivalent Ga3+ species not incorporated in the framework remain in the zeolite channels as highly dispersed oxide species."
[8] "At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization."
[9] "Specifically, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as a functional silane during the gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis."
[10] "We report a detailed structural and catalytic (PDH) characterization of Ga-MFI catalysts prepared by this technique, based upon the hypothesis that the altered mechanisms of Ga incorporation induced by the addition of MPS would lead to a different acid site profiles and catalytic behavior."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods. These include:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH processes have gained renewed interest, particularly in regions with abundant propane supplies, such as North America and the Middle East. This makes PDH a viable option for propylene production where propane is readily available.

2. Process Efficiency: Conventional methods often suffer from rapid catalyst deactivation, which can limit the efficiency of propylene production. PDH offers a more stable and efficient process, potentially leading to higher yields of propylene with less energy consumption.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH processes are designed to optimize the selectivity of propylene production, reducing unwanted byproducts such as cracking and aromatization products. This enhances the purity and quality of the propylene output, making it more suitable for downstream applications.

By utilizing advanced catalysts, such as gallosilicate MFI zeolites with perturbed acidity through the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS), PDH technology can improve both the conversion rate of propane and the selectivity of propylene production. This approach not only enhances the overall efficiency of the PDH process but also contributes to the sustainability of propylene production by minimizing the environmental impact.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它解决了传统生产方法面临的几个挑战：

1. 原料供应：PDH过程在北美和中东等地区获得了新的关注，这些地区的丙烷供应丰富。这使得PDH成为利用易得丙烷进行丙烯生产的一种可行选择。

2. 工艺效率：传统方法往往伴随着催化剂快速失活的问题，从而限制了丙烯生产的效率。PDH提供了一个更加稳定且高效的工艺，可能实现更高的丙烯产量，并减少能源消耗。

3. 产品选择性：PDH过程旨在优化丙烯的选择性生产，减少如裂解和芳构化等副产品的生成。这提高了丙烯输出的纯度和质量，使其更适合下游应用。

通过利用先进的催化剂，如添加了3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）的含镓沸石MFI，PDH技术可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的同时生产。这种方法不仅增强了PDH过程的整体效率，还通过减少环境影响，为丙烯生产贡献了可持续性。
