[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol."
[2] "The Catofin process uses a Cr-based catalyst in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, while the Oleflex process uses a Pt-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor."
[3] "PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane, and there are renewed efforts aimed at discovering new PDH catalysts or improving the stability, activity, and selectivity of known PDH catalysts."
[4] "Propane feedstocks can be also applied in propane aromatization processes to produce benzene, toluene, and xylene."
[5] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases."
[6] "However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5."
[7] "It was proposed that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage."
[8] "We report a detailed structural and catalytic (PDH) characterization of Ga-MFI catalysts prepared by this technique, based upon the hypothesis that the altered mechanisms of Ga incorporation induced by the addition of MPS would lead to a different acid site profiles and catalytic behavior."
[9] "These catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS give higher propylene selectivities and enhanced propane conversion rates at a fixed propylene conversion level."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing readily available propane feedstocks, achieving efficient conversion through optimized catalytic processes, and enhancing product selectivity to produce propylene with minimal cracking and aromatization side reactions. This technology is particularly advantageous in regions with abundant propane supplies, such as North America and the Middle East, allowing for more sustainable and cost-effective propylene production compared to traditional methods.

2. In the context of PDH technology, the introduction of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) in the synthesis of gallosilicate MFI zeolites leads to a modification in the incorporation mechanisms of gallium (Ga). This results in a different distribution of acid sites within the zeolite structure, with a notable enhancement in Lewis acidity. The MPS-added catalysts exhibit improved performance in PDH processes, characterized by higher propane conversion rates and increased propylene selectivity, thus offering a more efficient and selective route to propylene production.
