<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process.</p>
<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>In such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta zeolite shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include limited feedstock availability, inefficient processes, and low product selectivity. PDH specifically tackles these issues by utilizing readily available propane as feedstock, optimizing the production process for efficiency, and enhancing the selectivity of propylene output.

2. The growing global demand for propylene is driven by the extensive use of downstream products derived from propylene, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene. These products are widely consumed across various industries, leading to an increased demand for propylene.

3. Significant efforts have been directed towards the development of eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. This is crucial to ensure sustainable production of propylene while reducing environmental impact and controlling costs.

4. The Sn-Beta zeolite initially demonstrated negligible activity in PDH reactions and primarily served as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent studies have revealed its potential in activating the C-H bond of propane and exhibiting high selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH.

5. The theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites present in the single-site Sn within the zeolitic framework. This finding highlights the role of the Sn species in facilitating the dehydrogenation process and underscores the potential of the Sn-Beta zeolite as a catalyst in PDH.

1. PDH是生产丙烯的一种有前景的方法，能够直接解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。这些挑战包括有限的原料供应、低效的过程以及较低的产品选择性。PDH通过利用可获取的丙烷作为原料，优化生产过程的效率，并提高丙烯输出的选择性，来应对这些问题。

2. 全球对丙烯的需求在过去几十年持续增长，并预计在未来几年继续增长，这主要归因于从丙烯衍生的下游产品（如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸、氧化醇、丙二醇和苯乙烯）的大规模消费。这些产品的广泛使用推动了对丙烯需求的增长。

3. 已投入大量努力研发环保且经济高效的丙烷脱氢催化剂。这在确保可持续的丙烯生产、减少环境影响和控制成本方面至关重要。

4. Sn-Beta沸石最初在PDH反应中表现出微不足道的活性，主要作为Pt成分的辅助和促进剂发挥作用。然而，最近的研究揭示了其激活丙烷中的C-H键的能力，并表现出高选择性、活性和稳定性在PDH中的潜力。

5. 理论计算表明，丙烷脱氢发生在单个Sn物种在沸石框架中的Lewis酸位点上。这一发现强调了Sn物种在促进脱氢过程中的作用，并突显了Sn-Beta沸石作为PDH催化剂的潜力。
