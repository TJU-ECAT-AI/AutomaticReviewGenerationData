<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>The gap between supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly promoted the development of new technologies for the production of propylene.</p>
<p>In fact, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process has been commercialized with the Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP) technologies, which are based on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process.</p>
<p>The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles.</p>
<p>To re-disperse Pt species, this catalyst always requires a frequent regeneration by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds.</p>
<p>The concern about the toxicity of CrO3/Al2O3 to public health largely limits its practical application.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, exposure to Cr(VI) may bring about several diseases.</p>
<p>In such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Utilizing abundant shale gas as a feedstock, PDH provides a reliable source of propylene production since propane is widely available.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to be eco-friendly and cost-efficient, overcoming the drawbacks of conventional methods such as high costs and toxic emissions associated with chromium and platinum catalysts.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH yields high selectivity to propylene, typically above 95%, with the valuable H2 as a by-product, making it an attractive method for propylene production.

The PDH process, which has been commercialized with technologies like Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP), based on catalysts like CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3, has been a focus for developing more sustainable alternatives that are economically viable and environmentally friendly.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的优势主要体现在解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH通过以下方式具体解决了这些挑战：

1. **原料供应**：利用丰富的页岩气作为原料，PDH提供了可靠的丙烯生产来源，因为丙烷广泛可用。

2. **过程效率**：PDH流程旨在实现环保和成本效益，克服了传统方法中与铬和铂催化剂相关的高昂成本和有害排放等缺点。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH的丙烯产率通常高于95%，副产品为有价值的氢气，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有吸引力的方法。

商业化使用的Catofin（Lummus）和Oleflex（UOP）技术基于CrO3/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂，PDH过程特别关注开发更可持续、经济可行且环境友好的替代方案。
