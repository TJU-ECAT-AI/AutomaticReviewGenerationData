<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process.</p>
<p>The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles. To re-disperse Pt species, this catalyst always requires a frequent regeneration by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>
<p>A small amount of Sn doping (Sn/Si = 1/60) enables Beta zeolite to be a good catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. A propane conversion of 27% and propylene selectivity of 75% can be achieved in the Sn-Beta-60 catalyst.</p>
<p>Note that an evident increase of propylene selectivity is observed in Sn-Beta-60 sample, which is due to a decrease of Bronsted acid for cracking reaction.</p>
<p>The catalytic behaviors of these Beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure has a great effect on the catalytic performance of these Sn-Beta samples.</p>
<p>A small amount of Sn doping (Sn/Si = 1/60) enables Beta zeolite to be a good catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>For comparison, SnO2/Al-Beta samples (nSn/nSi ratios of 1/15, 1/30, and 1/60) were synthesized by direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution.</p>
<p>For comparison, SnO2/Al-Beta samples (nSn/nSi ratios of 1/15, 1/30, and 1/60) were synthesized by direct impregnation of Al-Beta with SnCl2 solution.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.</p>
<p>The studies of Na-Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta in propane dehydrogenation undoubtedly confirmed that the Lewis acid rather than Brnsted acid is the active site for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It utilizes readily available propane feedstock, offers a more efficient process, and provides high selectivity to propylene as a valuable downstream product.

2. The key advantages of propane PDH technology include addressing the growing demand for propylene by utilizing abundant propane feedstock, improving process efficiency, and enhancing product selectivity for downstream applications like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene.

3. The challenge faced by conventional propylene production methods, such as high costs and rapid deactivation of precious metals like platinum, are mitigated by the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts, like the Sn-Beta zeolite, which exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.

4. The Sn-Beta zeolite catalyst, through its incorporation of single-site Sn atoms, activates the C-H bond of propane efficiently, leading to high propylene selectivity and activity in the PDH process.

5. The Sn-Beta zeolite catalysts offer improved stability in propane dehydrogenation, enabling long-term operation without significant deactivation, which is crucial for practical applications.

6. The Lewis acid sites in the Sn-Beta zeolite framework are identified as the active sites for dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites are responsible for cracking reactions, leading to better control over the reaction pathway and product selectivity.
