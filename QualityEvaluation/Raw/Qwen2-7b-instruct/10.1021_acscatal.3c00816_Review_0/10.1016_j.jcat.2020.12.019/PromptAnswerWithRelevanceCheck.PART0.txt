1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered a promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include limited feedstock availability, inefficient processes, and low product selectivity. PDH specifically tackles these issues by utilizing readily available propane as feedstock, optimizing the production process for efficiency, and enhancing the selectivity of propylene output.

2. The growing global demand for propylene is driven by the extensive use of downstream products derived from propylene, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene. These products are widely consumed across various industries, leading to an increased demand for propylene.

3. Significant efforts have been directed towards the development of eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. This is crucial to ensure sustainable production of propylene while reducing environmental impact and controlling costs.

4. The Sn-Beta zeolite initially demonstrated negligible activity in PDH reactions and primarily served as a support and promoter for the Pt component. However, recent studies have revealed its potential in activating the C-H bond of propane and exhibiting high selectivity, activity, and stability in PDH.

5. The theoretical calculations suggest that propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites present in the single-site Sn within the zeolitic framework. This finding highlights the role of the Sn species in facilitating the dehydrogenation process and underscores the potential of the Sn-Beta zeolite as a catalyst in PDH.
