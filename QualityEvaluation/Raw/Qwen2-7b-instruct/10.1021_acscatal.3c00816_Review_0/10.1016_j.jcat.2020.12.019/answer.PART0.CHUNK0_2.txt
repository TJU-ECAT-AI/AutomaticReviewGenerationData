<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>The gap between supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly promoted the development of new technologies for the production of propylene.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process.</p>
<p>In fact, the catalytic propane dehydrogenation process has been commercialized with the Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP) technologies, which are based on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p>The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles.</p>
<p>To re-disperse Pt species, this catalyst always requires a frequent regeneration by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds.</p>
<p>The concern about the toxicity of CrO3/Al2O3 to public health largely limits its practical application.</p>
<p>In such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Key advantages include:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH technology utilizes inexpensive propane, which is widely available from abundant shale gas, making it economically viable and less dependent on traditional, often scarce feedstocks.

2. Process Efficiency: Compared to conventional methods that rely on CrO3/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, PDH offers a more eco-friendly and cost-efficient route to propylene production, reducing environmental impact and operational costs.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH processes demonstrate high selectivity in propylene production, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like ethylene, ethane, and methane. This selective production enhances the purity of the propylene output, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring high-purity propylene.

4. Technological Innovation: The focus on developing single-site catalysts with well-defined structures facilitates easier elucidation of reaction pathways, leading to advancements in catalyst design and optimization. This innovation can drive improvements in both efficiency and selectivity, making PDH a more competitive and sustainable option in the propylene production landscape.

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional propylene production methods by offering solutions in feedstock availability, process efficiency, product selectivity, and technological innovation. Its ability to utilize abundant propane feedstock, reduce environmental impact, enhance propylene purity, and drive catalyst optimization makes PDH a promising and sustainable approach for propylene production in response to growing global demand.
