[1] "The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."
[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas."
[4] "The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles."
[5] "The concern about the toxicity of CrO3/Al2O3 to public health largely limits its practical application."
[6] "In such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation."
[7] "Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[8] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[9] "Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework."
[10] "The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites."
[11] "The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure."
[12] "The efficiency of these three Sn-Beta catalysts can be demonstrated from the propylene yield."
[13] "Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications."
[14] "To verify the crucial role of single-site Sn in propane dehydrogenation, the reference catalysts SnO2/Al-Beta were also studied in propane dehydrogenation."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods. It specifically addresses challenges in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The availability of cheap propane from abundant shale gas makes PDH attractive. Conventional methods, such as those relying on expensive metals like platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr), face issues with high costs and rapid deactivation, which limit their practical application. PDH offers an eco-friendly and cost-efficient alternative that can efficiently produce propylene with high selectivity.

2. The key advantages of propane PDH technology include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The widespread availability of propane from abundant shale gas ensures a steady supply of raw material. The process is designed to be cost-effective and environmentally friendly, making it a promising solution for propylene production. High selectivity in the production of propylene is another advantage, leading to a cleaner and more efficient manufacturing process.

3. Propane PDH technology specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The use of abundant shale gas as a feedstock ensures a reliable and inexpensive supply of propane. The technology aims to enhance process efficiency by optimizing conditions for propylene production, leading to lower energy consumption and reduced costs. High selectivity in the production of propylene ensures a high-quality product with minimal byproducts, improving the overall efficiency of the manufacturing process.
