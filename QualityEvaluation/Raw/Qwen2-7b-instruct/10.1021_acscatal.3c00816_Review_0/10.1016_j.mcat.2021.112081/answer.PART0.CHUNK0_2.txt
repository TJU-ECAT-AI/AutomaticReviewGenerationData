In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH utilizes single feed (propane) and produces a single product (propylene), offering flexibility in raw material sourcing and simplifying the production process. The technology leverages unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, providing abundant and affordable raw materials. This addresses the limitations of traditional production methods that rely on naphtha and coal, which struggle to meet the expanding market demand. Moreover, PDH boasts a lower cost compared to conventional processes, enhancing its competitiveness.

Commercial PDH processes, such as Oleflex developed by UOP and Catofin by CB&I Lummus, employ catalysts like Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3. However, challenges remain in enhancing coke resistance and preventing the sintering of active sites under endothermic reaction conditions. Coke buildup affects the number of active sites, impacting catalytic stability, while sintering can lead to structure-sensitive side reactions that decrease propylene selectivity. The pore size of the catalyst plays a crucial role in improving coke resistance. Among the tested samples, the catalyst with a pore size of 8nm (PtSn/SSF#8) demonstrated the best performance, achieving the highest propane conversion of 46.9% and the lowest coke deposition of 16.8 mgC/gcat.

考虑到全球丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH采用单一原料（丙烷）和单一产品（丙烯），在原材料来源的灵活性和简化生产流程方面具有优势。该技术利用非常规天然气资源如页岩气，提供丰富且成本低廉的原材料，解决了传统生产方法依赖石脑油和煤炭的问题，后者难以满足不断扩大的市场需求。此外，与传统工艺相比，PDH的成本更低，增强了其竞争力。

商业化的PDH工艺，如UOP开发的Oleflex和CB&I Lummus持有的Catofin，分别使用Cr/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3作为催化剂。然而，在放热反应条件下，提高焦炭耐受性和防止活性位点聚集仍然是挑战。焦炭积累影响活性位点的数量，影响催化稳定性，而聚集会导致结构敏感的副反应，降低丙烯选择性。催化剂的孔径在改善焦炭耐受性方面起着至关重要的作用。在测试样品中，孔径为8nm（PtSn/SSF#8）的催化剂表现出最佳性能，实现了最高的丙烷转化率46.9%，以及最低的焦炭沉积量16.8 mgC/gcat。
