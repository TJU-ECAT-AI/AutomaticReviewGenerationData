<p>The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively.</p>
<p>The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction.</p>
<p>To prepare platinum-based catalysts with high stability, good activity, resistance to carbon deposition, historians have made a lot of contributions in exploring carriers, additives, preparation methods.</p>
<p>Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability.</p>
<p>The addition of Al into SBA-15 could enhance the strong acid sites of the catalyst and benefit to the activation of CH bonds.</p>
<p>The surface of MgAl2O4 was wrapped with silica to form a core-shell structure, which can introduce appropriate amount of acid centers and reduce the particle size of platinum clusters to improve the overall performance of catalyst.</p>
<p>Adding additive can change the interaction between the active sites and the support, which further affected the dispersion of the active components.</p>
<p>Since the support structure has a significant impact on the catalyst performance, the pore size effect of the support Sn-SBA-15 on propane dehydrogenation would be focused in this work on the basis of our previous work.</p>
<p>Combing with various characterization techniques to investigate the effect of pore size on structure, redox, dispersion of the active sites of PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst and the performance of propane dehydrogenation.</p>

In addressing the challenges of conventional production methods, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out for its ability to efficiently utilize unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, which provides abundant and inexpensive feedstock. This method directly converts propane to propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive cracking processes typically used in traditional methods. PDH offers a single-feed process that produces a single product, propylene, with high selectivity. It also benefits from lower costs compared to traditional methods, as it utilizes a cleaner and more accessible feedstock. The technology's efficiency and selectivity make it a highly promising approach for propylene production, especially considering the growing demand for this critical chemical building block in the petrochemical industry.
