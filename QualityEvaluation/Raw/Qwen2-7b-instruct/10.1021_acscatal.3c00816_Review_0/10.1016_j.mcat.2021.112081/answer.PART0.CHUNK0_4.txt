<p>Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal.</p>
<p>The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost.</p>
<p>The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction.</p>
<p>To prepare platinum-based catalysts with high stability, good activity, resistance to carbon deposition, historians have made a lot of contributions in exploring carriers, additives, preparation methods.</p>
<p>The results showed that the type of carrier had a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>The pore size of catalyst showed its impacts on catalytic deactivation due to the sintering of active phase and coke deposition.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production are its efficient use of a single feedstock (propane), production of a single product (propylene), access to a wide variety of raw materials, and lower costs compared to traditional methods. PDH addresses challenges like coke resistance and the prevention of sintering of active sites, which are common issues in endothermic reactions. The selection of carriers, additives, and preparation methods significantly impacts the stability and activity of the catalysts used in PDH processes. The pore size of the catalysts plays a crucial role in improving coke resistance and reducing deactivation through sintering of active sites and carbon deposition.
