<p>The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively.</p>
<p>Cr-based catalysts are toxic, the use of it would bring negative effect on environment. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher.</p>
<p>The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction.</p>
<p>To prepare platinum-based catalysts with high stability, good activity, resistance to carbon deposition, historians have made a lot of contributions in exploring carriers, additives, preparation methods.</p>
<p>The results showed that the type of carrier had a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability. It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area.</p>
<p>Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability.</p>
<p>Since the support structure has a significant impact on the catalyst performance, the pore size effect of the support Sn-SBA-15 on propane dehydrogenation would be focused in this work on the basis of our previous work, which has indicated the In promoted InPt/SSF had attractive performance on propane dehydrogenation as the In additive improved the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, which consequently led to the improvements in both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several key reasons. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a single feed (propane) and single product (propylene), which simplifies the process compared to traditional methods that often rely on multiple inputs and outputs. This not only reduces complexity but also enhances process efficiency. Secondly, PDH technology leverages the availability of unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, providing an abundant and inexpensive raw material base for propylene production. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability that traditional methods might struggle with, particularly in the context of fluctuating and limited supplies of traditional feedstocks. Lastly, PDH technology exhibits superior product selectivity, producing propylene with minimal byproducts or waste, which improves economic viability and environmental sustainability. This aligns with the modern demand for cleaner, more efficient chemical production processes.

In addressing the challenges of conventional production methods, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out for its ability to efficiently utilize unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, which provides abundant and inexpensive feedstock. This method directly converts propane to propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive cracking processes typically used in traditional methods. PDH offers a single-feed process that produces a single product, propylene, with high selectivity. It also benefits from lower costs compared to traditional methods, as it utilizes a cleaner and more accessible feedstock. The technology's efficiency and selectivity make it a highly promising approach for propylene production, especially considering the growing demand for this critical chemical building block in the petrochemical industry.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH utilizes single feed (propane) and produces a single product (propylene), offering flexibility in raw material sourcing and simplifying the production process. The technology leverages unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, providing abundant and affordable raw materials. This addresses the limitations of traditional production methods that rely on naphtha and coal, which struggle to meet the expanding market demand. Moreover, PDH boasts a lower cost compared to conventional processes, enhancing its competitiveness.

Commercial PDH processes, such as Oleflex developed by UOP and Catofin by CB&I Lummus, employ catalysts like Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3. However, challenges remain in enhancing coke resistance and preventing the sintering of active sites under endothermic reaction conditions. Coke buildup affects the number of active sites, impacting catalytic stability, while sintering can lead to structure-sensitive side reactions that decrease propylene selectivity. The pore size of the catalyst plays a crucial role in improving coke resistance. Among the tested samples, the catalyst with a pore size of 8nm (PtSn/SSF#8) demonstrated the best performance, achieving the highest propane conversion of 46.9% and the lowest coke deposition of 16.8 mgC/gcat.

考虑到全球丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH采用单一原料（丙烷）和单一产品（丙烯），在原材料来源的灵活性和简化生产流程方面具有优势。该技术利用非常规天然气资源如页岩气，提供丰富且成本低廉的原材料，解决了传统生产方法依赖石脑油和煤炭的问题，后者难以满足不断扩大的市场需求。此外，与传统工艺相比，PDH的成本更低，增强了其竞争力。

商业化的PDH工艺，如UOP开发的Oleflex和CB&I Lummus持有的Catofin，分别使用Cr/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3作为催化剂。然而，在放热反应条件下，提高焦炭耐受性和防止活性位点聚集仍然是挑战。焦炭积累影响活性位点的数量，影响催化稳定性，而聚集会导致结构敏感的副反应，降低丙烯选择性。催化剂的孔径在改善焦炭耐受性方面起着至关重要的作用。在测试样品中，孔径为8nm（PtSn/SSF#8）的催化剂表现出最佳性能，实现了最高的丙烷转化率46.9%，以及最低的焦炭沉积量16.8 mgC/gcat。
