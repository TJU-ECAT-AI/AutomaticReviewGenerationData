<p>The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively.</p>
<p>Cr-based catalysts are toxic, the use of it would bring negative effect on environment. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher.</p>
<p>The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction.</p>
<p>To prepare platinum-based catalysts with high stability, good activity, resistance to carbon deposition, historians have made a lot of contributions in exploring carriers, additives, preparation methods.</p>
<p>The results showed that the type of carrier had a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability. It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area.</p>
<p>Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability.</p>
<p>Since the support structure has a significant impact on the catalyst performance, the pore size effect of the support Sn-SBA-15 on propane dehydrogenation would be focused in this work on the basis of our previous work, which has indicated the In promoted InPt/SSF had attractive performance on propane dehydrogenation as the In additive improved the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, which consequently led to the improvements in both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several key reasons. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a single feed (propane) and single product (propylene), which simplifies the process compared to traditional methods that often rely on multiple inputs and outputs. This not only reduces complexity but also enhances process efficiency. Secondly, PDH technology leverages the availability of unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, providing an abundant and inexpensive raw material base for propylene production. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability that traditional methods might struggle with, particularly in the context of fluctuating and limited supplies of traditional feedstocks. Lastly, PDH technology exhibits superior product selectivity, producing propylene with minimal byproducts or waste, which improves economic viability and environmental sustainability. This aligns with the modern demand for cleaner, more efficient chemical production processes.
