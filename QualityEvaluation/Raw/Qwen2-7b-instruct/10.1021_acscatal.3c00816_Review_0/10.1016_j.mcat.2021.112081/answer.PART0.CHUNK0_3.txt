[1] "Taking propylene as an example, it is the basic raw material of the three major synthetic materials, of which the largest amount is used to produce polypropylene."
[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."
[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources."
[4] "The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 are used in the two processes, respectively."
[5] "The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction."
[6] "To prepare platinum-based catalysts with high stability, good activity, resistance to carbon deposition, historians have made a lot of contributions in exploring carriers, additives, preparation methods."
[7] "The results showed that the type of carrier had a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability."
[8] "Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability."
[9] "The addition of Al into SBA-15 could enhance the strong acid sites of the catalyst and benefit to the activation of CH bonds."
[10] "The surface of MgAl2O4 was wrapped with silica to form a core-shell structure, which can introduce appropriate amount of acid centers and reduce the particle size of platinum clusters to improve the overall performance of catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas, which are abundant and inexpensive. Secondly, PDH technology improves process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. Conventional methods typically involve the cracking of naphtha and coal, which are less accessible and often more expensive resources. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane into propylene, bypassing the need for intermediate cracking steps. Additionally, PDH catalysts, particularly those featuring mesoporous materials like SBA-15, demonstrate improved stability, activity, and resistance to carbon deposition and sintering, which enhances the overall performance and economic viability of the PDH process. The use of carriers and additives in PDH catalyst design further optimizes these properties, contributing to the technology's effectiveness in producing propylene efficiently and sustainably.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法。首先，PDH技术通过利用非常规天然气资源如页岩气来解决原料供应问题，这些资源丰富且价格低廉。其次，PDH技术在过程效率和产品选择性方面优于传统生产方法。传统方法通常涉及裂解石脑油和煤炭，这些资源往往更难获取且成本更高。PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，跳过了中间裂解步骤的需求。此外，PDH催化剂，特别是那些采用如SBA-15这类介孔材料的催化剂，表现出改善的稳定性、活性以及对碳沉积和结块的抗性，从而提高了整体性能和经济可行性。PDH催化剂设计中使用载体和添加剂进一步优化了这些特性，有助于提高PDH过程的效率和可持续性。
