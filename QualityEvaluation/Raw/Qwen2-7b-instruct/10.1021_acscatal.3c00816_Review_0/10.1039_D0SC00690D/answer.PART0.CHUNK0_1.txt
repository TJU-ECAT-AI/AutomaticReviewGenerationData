[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."
[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."
[3] "Supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."
[4] "Nevertheless, the structure-performance correlation of VOx-based catalysts is still unclear due to the structural complexity of the supported VOx catalytic system."
[5] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[6] "Previous studies found that the reactivity of PDH is dependent on the bond strength of VOS."
[7] "VO bonds directly catalyze CH activation forming H2 rather than H2O."
[8] "VOx can be readily reduced on ZrO2 because the interaction between VOx and ZrO2 facilitates the reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds."
[9] "However, for the VAl catalyst, only VO and some VOAl bonds can be reduced."
[10] "Thus, more low coordinated V species form in the VZr catalyst during reduction, and these low coordinated V species exhibit a better performance in PDH."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability. Conventional methods often rely on oil, which faces diminishing supplies and price volatility, whereas PDH utilizes abundant and economically accessible shale gas. Secondly, PDH processes are typically more efficient, offering a streamlined route to propylene production. This efficiency is partly due to the use of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which are not only cost-effective but also less toxic compared to platinum-based or chromium oxide-based catalysts used in traditional methods. Lastly, PDH ensures better product selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, thanks to the specific catalytic mechanisms involved in the process. These advantages collectively position PDH as a viable and advantageous solution for propylene production in the current and future industrial landscapes.
