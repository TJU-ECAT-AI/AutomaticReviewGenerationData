[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."
[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."
[3] "Supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."
[4] "Nevertheless, the structure-performance correlation of VOx-based catalysts is still unclear due to the structural complexity of the supported VOx catalytic system."
[5] "It is proposed that the facile reducing nature of VO bonds promotes the formation of lower coordinated V species which accounts for CH activation enhancement."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. These challenges include:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available globally, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional methods that often rely on scarce resources.
2. Process efficiency: PDH processes are highly efficient, converting propane to propylene with minimal waste, unlike conventional methods that may involve additional steps or produce undesirable byproducts.
3. Product selectivity: PDH offers superior product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene with less COx production, compared to conventional oxidation-based methods that can lead to over-oxidation and lower propylene yields.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly appealing for propylene production, providing a cleaner, more cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够解决几个关键挑战而成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法。这些挑战包括：

1. 原料供应：PDH使用丙烷作为主要原料，这种原料全球丰富且易于获取，提供了一种比传统方法依赖稀缺资源更为可持续和高效的选择。
2. 工艺效率：PDH过程非常高效，能以最少的浪费将丙烷转化为丙烯，与常规基于氧化的方法相比，后者可能涉及额外步骤或产生不希望的副产品。
3. 产品选择性：PDH提供了更优的产品选择性，确保更高的丙烯产量，同时产生较少的COx，而传统的氧化基方法可能导致过氧化并降低丙烯产量。

这些优势使PDH技术特别吸引人，为丙烯生产提供了一个更清洁、更经济、更环保的解决方案。
