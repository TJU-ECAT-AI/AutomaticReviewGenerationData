[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."
[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."
[3] "Supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."
[4] "Nevertheless, the structure-performance correlation of VOx-based catalysts is still unclear due to the structural complexity of the supported VOx catalytic system."
[5] "Previous studies have confirmed that several factors could influence the performance of VOx-based catalysts such as polymerization forms of VOx, chemical states of V and the identity of the support."
[6] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[7] "Vis-Raman spectroscopic measurements, which are sensitive to the presence of V2O5, were performed over the catalysts to gain insight into the kind of vanadium species."
[8] "A series of characterization techniques were used to determine the bulk and surface structure of the catalysts (VOx loaded on ZrO2 and Al2O3 are denoted as xVZr and xVAl where x represents the mass percentage of V, metal base)."
[9] "The initial conversion of 1VZr is approximately five times higher than that of 1VAl and pure ZrO2, which shows a significant support effect."
[10] "The initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity based on all products are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b."
[11] "Considering the activity is also influenced by V density, the TOFs of VZr and VAl were also compared based on V density (Fig. 2c and Table S2)."
[12] "Because the surface areas of ZrO2 and Al2O3 are different, when the V loadings of VZr and VAl are identical, they have different V densities."
[13] "This phenomenon is similar to that of the GaOx catalytic system, where the activity is not a consequence of Ga nuclearities, but of the GaOsupport interaction."
[14] "The propane consumption rate versus V loading is shown in Fig. 3."
[15] "Along with catalytic activity being linearly related to the amount of V, which directly proves VOx is responsible for the activity, we suggest VOx rather than Zrcus to be the main active phase."
[16] "The facile reduction nature of VO bonds in the VZr catalyst can be interpreted by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared with Al, which causes the difference of the interaction between VOx and the support."
[17] "Our recent DFT calculations also proved that coordinatively unsaturated VOx was more active in CH activation."
[18] "Since VZr and VAl have different degrees of reduction, we constructed V2O2/m-ZrO2(11) and V2O3/γ-Al2O3(100) models to represent the catalyst structure in a reduced state."
[19] "The first and second step CH activation barriers in VZr is 0.66 eV and 0.85 eV, respectively, while in VAl they are 0.99 eV and 1.26 eV, respectively."
[20] "Based on the experimental and theoretical results, we propose a structure-performance correlation of VZr and VAl catalysts, as shown in Scheme 1."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its unique advantages over conventional production methods. PDH addresses key challenges such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: By utilizing the abundant natural gas resource, particularly shale gas, PDH offers a reliable and cost-effective feedstock for propylene production. This contrasts with traditional methods that might rely on scarce or more expensive sources.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH processes are designed to maximize propylene yield and minimize waste. This is achieved through optimized catalytic systems and reaction conditions that enhance the conversion of propane to propylene efficiently. 

3. Product Selectivity: PDH enables high selectivity towards propylene production, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon oxides. This selective process ensures a cleaner and more sustainable manufacturing route for propylene.

4. Cost and Toxicity: Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, used in PDH, offer competitive performance, low cost, and low toxicity compared to precious metal-based catalysts like platinum and chromium oxides. This economic and environmentally friendly approach makes PDH a preferred choice for industrial-scale production.
