[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."
[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."
[3] "Supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost, and low toxicity."
[4] "Nevertheless, the structureperformance correlation of VOx-based catalysts is still unclear due to the structural complexity of the supported VOx catalytic system."
[5] "Previous studies have confirmed that several factors could influence the performance of VOx-based catalysts such as polymerization forms of VOx, chemical states of V and the identity of the support."
[6] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[7] "The support effect works in an entirely different way in the PDH process because not only active sites but also reaction mechanisms are distinct from those of the ODH process."
[8] "The support identity also influences the behavior of carbon deposition on VOx based catalysts, which inversely affects activity and on-stream stability."
[9] "We discovered that VOx/ZrO2, a well-known catalyst for ODH, has a much more superior PDH performance than commonly used VOx/Al2O3."
[10] "The turnover frequency (TOF) is six times higher by loading VOx on ZrO2 than on Al2O3."
[11] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[12] "In addition, the support identity also influences the behavior of carbon deposition on VOx based catalysts, which inversely affects activity and on-stream stability."
[13] "We propose that the facile reducing nature of VO bonds promotes the formation of lower coordinated V species which accounts for CH activation enhancement."
[14] "It has been proved that pure ZrO2 can also catalyze propane dehydrogenation through coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus)."
[15] "However, the support effect works in an entirely different way in the PDH process because not only active sites but also reaction mechanisms are distinct from those of the ODH process."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering feedstock flexibility. Unlike traditional processes that rely heavily on oil-derived feedstocks, PDH utilizes propane, which is increasingly accessible due to the widespread exploitation of shale gas resources. This makes PDH a more sustainable option.

Secondly, PDH boasts high process efficiency and product selectivity. By bypassing the oxidation step typically required in other propylene production methods, PDH directly converts propane to propylene, significantly enhancing the yield of the desired product. 

Furthermore, PDH utilizes catalysts such as supported vanadium oxide, which offer competitive performance at a lower cost compared to precious metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxides (CrOx). These catalysts are not only economically viable but also environmentally friendly due to their low toxicity.

Lastly, PDH showcases a distinct advantage in terms of catalyst performance and structure-correlation. The use of different supports like zirconia (ZrO2) versus alumina (Al2O3) can profoundly impact the catalytic activity and selectivity of the process. Specifically, zirconia-supported vanadium oxide catalysts exhibit significantly higher turnover frequencies (TOF) and improved reactivity compared to those supported on aluminum oxide, making them highly efficient in propylene production.

This technology not only leverages the abundant availability of propane from shale gas but also optimizes the catalytic process through the strategic use of supports, enhancing both the economic viability and environmental sustainability of propylene production.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其在生产丙烯方面表现出的独特优势而成为最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH通过利用大规模开采的页岩气资源提供的丙烷，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。与依赖石油衍生原料的传统过程不同，PDH提供了灵活性，使其成为更具可持续性的选择。

其次，PDH以其高效的过程和产品选择性脱颖而出。通过跳过其他丙烯生产方法中通常需要的氧化步骤，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，显著提高了目标产品的产出率。

此外，PDH在催化剂性能和结构相关性方面也展现出了独特的优势。通过使用不同的支持物，如氧化锆（ZrO2）与氧化铝（Al2O3），可以极大地影响催化活性和选择性。具体来说，以氧化锆为载体的钒氧化物催化剂的周转频率（TOF）和反应活性比那些以氧化铝为载体的催化剂高得多，这使得它们在丙烯生产中非常有效。

总之，PDH不仅利用了从页岩气中获取的大量丙烷，而且通过战略性地使用支持物优化了催化过程，从而提高了经济性和环境可持续性。
