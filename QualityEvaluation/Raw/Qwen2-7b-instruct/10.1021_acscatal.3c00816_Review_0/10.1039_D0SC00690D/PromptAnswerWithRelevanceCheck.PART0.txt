In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability. Conventional methods often rely on oil, which faces diminishing supplies and price volatility, whereas PDH utilizes abundant and economically accessible shale gas. Secondly, PDH processes are typically more efficient, offering a streamlined route to propylene production. This efficiency is partly due to the use of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which are not only cost-effective but also less toxic compared to platinum-based or chromium oxide-based catalysts used in traditional methods. Lastly, PDH ensures better product selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, thanks to the specific catalytic mechanisms involved in the process. These advantages collectively position PDH as a viable and advantageous solution for propylene production in the current and future industrial landscapes.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene using shale gas as feedstock. Unlike traditional production methods that often rely on expensive or toxic catalysts such as platinum (Pt) and chromium oxides (CrOx), supported vanadium oxide (VOx) offers competitive performance, low cost, and low toxicity. Despite these advantages, the relationship between structure and performance in VOx-based catalysts remains unclear due to the complexity of the supported system in a reduced state. Prior research has identified several factors influencing catalyst performance, including the polymerization forms of VOx, the chemical state of vanadium (V), and the identity of the support material. It is acknowledged that the support can impact reactivity by stabilizing active sites or altering their electron state. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated a significantly higher turnover frequency (TOF) compared to VOx/Al2O3, with the former achieving a sixfold increase in reactivity. This enhancement is attributed to the unique interaction between VOx and ZrO2, facilitating the reduction of vanadium bonds and the formation of more active, lower-coordinated vanadium species. The study also reveals that the support identity affects the behavior of carbon deposition on VOx-based catalysts, inversely impacting activity and operational stability. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst showcased superior performance in PDH, with a remarkable increase in initial propane conversion and a pronounced TOF advantage over the VOx/Al2O3 counterpart. The catalytic activity is found to be strongly dependent on the support, as evidenced by the linear increase in reaction rate with vanadium loading up to 2 wt%. Further, the lower electronegativity of zirconium (Zr) relative to aluminum (Al) is suggested to contribute to the facile reduction of vanadium bonds in the VZr catalyst, leading to enhanced CH activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this observation by confirming that partially reduced VZr with low-coordinated vanadium species exhibits a lower energy barrier for propane dehydrogenation, thus demonstrating a structure-performance correlation that explains the catalyst's superior PDH performance.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它能够利用页岩气作为原料高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。与传统生产方法通常依赖昂贵或有毒的催化剂如铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）不同，支持型钒氧化物（VOx）提供了竞争力的性能、低成本和低毒性。尽管如此，VOx基催化剂的结构与性能之间的关系仍然不清楚，这归因于支持系统在还原状态下的复杂性。先前的研究已经确定了影响催化剂性能的几个因素，包括VOx的聚合形式、V的化学状态和支持材料的身份。人们普遍认为，支持可以影响反应性，通过稳定活性位点或改变活性位点的电子状态。VOx/ZrO2催化剂显示了与VOx/Al2O3相比显著提高的周转频率（TOF），前者实现了TOF值的六倍增加。这种增强归因于VOx和ZrO2之间独特的相互作用，促进了钒键的还原并形成了更活跃的、较低配位的钒物种。研究还揭示了支持身份对基于VOx的催化剂碳沉积行为的影响，反过来影响活性和在线稳定性。VOx/ZrO2催化剂在PDH中的表现优于其VOx/Al2O3同辈，展现了显著的初始丙烷转化率和TOF优势。催化活性发现强烈依赖于支持，如通过增加钒加载量至2 wt%时观察到的线性反应速率提升所证明。进一步，由于锆（Zr）相对于铝（Al）的较低电负性被建议有助于VZr催化剂中钒键的容易还原，从而增强了CH激活。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算也证实了这一点，通过确认部分还原的VZr与低配位的钒物种相比具有更低的丙烷脱氢能垒，从而解释了催化剂的优越PDH性能。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering feedstock flexibility. Unlike traditional processes that rely heavily on oil-derived feedstocks, PDH utilizes propane, which is increasingly accessible due to the widespread exploitation of shale gas resources. This makes PDH a more sustainable option.

Secondly, PDH boasts high process efficiency and product selectivity. By bypassing the oxidation step typically required in other propylene production methods, PDH directly converts propane to propylene, significantly enhancing the yield of the desired product. 

Furthermore, PDH utilizes catalysts such as supported vanadium oxide, which offer competitive performance at a lower cost compared to precious metal-based catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxides (CrOx). These catalysts are not only economically viable but also environmentally friendly due to their low toxicity.

Lastly, PDH showcases a distinct advantage in terms of catalyst performance and structure-correlation. The use of different supports like zirconia (ZrO2) versus alumina (Al2O3) can profoundly impact the catalytic activity and selectivity of the process. Specifically, zirconia-supported vanadium oxide catalysts exhibit significantly higher turnover frequencies (TOF) and improved reactivity compared to those supported on aluminum oxide, making them highly efficient in propylene production.

This technology not only leverages the abundant availability of propane from shale gas but also optimizes the catalytic process through the strategic use of supports, enhancing both the economic viability and environmental sustainability of propylene production.

总之，PDH不仅利用了从页岩气中获取的大量丙烷，而且通过战略性地使用支持物优化了催化过程，从而提高了经济性和环境可持续性。
