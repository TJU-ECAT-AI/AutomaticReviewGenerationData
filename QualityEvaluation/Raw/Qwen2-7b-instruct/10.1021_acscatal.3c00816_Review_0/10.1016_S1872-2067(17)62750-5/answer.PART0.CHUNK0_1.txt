[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene."
[2] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[3] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for large quantities of natural gas feedstock required by traditional steam cracking methods. This makes PDH more flexible and responsive to market demands and less dependent on specific raw materials. Secondly, PDH processes are typically more energy-efficient and produce fewer byproducts, enhancing process efficiency and environmental sustainability. Lastly, PDH improves product selectivity, allowing for higher yields of propylene and minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts like methane and ethane. The superior performance of PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts over PtSnNa/ZSM-5 is attributed to the unique properties of SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevents impregnation of the Pt precursor, leading to a higher concentration of Pt particles on the external surface and reduced carbon deposition. This results in enhanced catalytic activity and stability during the dehydrogenation process. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support in ZSM-5 are lessened due to the weaker acidity of the zeolite, making it easier for Sn to form metallic species, which decreases the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

考虑到对丙烯的快速增长需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，这些优势针对了传统生产方法在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。首先，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了传统蒸汽裂解方法所需大量天然气原料的需求，这使得PDH更具灵活性，能够更好地响应市场需求，并且依赖特定原材料较少。其次，PDH过程通常更节能，产生的副产品更少，从而提高了工艺效率并增强了环境可持续性。最后，PDH提高了产品的选择性，允许更高的丙烯产量，并减少了生产如甲烷和乙烷等副产品的可能性。铂锡钠/苏兹-4催化剂相对于铂锡钠/ZSM-5表现出更优越性能的原因归结于苏兹-4沸石的独特性质，它阻止铂前体的浸润，导致外部表面的铂颗粒浓度更高，并减少了碳沉积。这最终导致了脱氢过程中催化活性和稳定性的增强。ZSM-5中锡氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用被减弱，由于该沸石的酸性较弱，更易于锡形成金属物种，这降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。
