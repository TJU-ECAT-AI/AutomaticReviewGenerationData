[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene."
[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics."
[3] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[4] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
[5] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[6] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges faced by conventional methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the following aspects:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Unlike conventional methods that require access to expensive and limited hydrocarbon resources, PDH utilizes abundant propane feedstocks. This ensures a stable and sustainable supply chain for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH technology offers higher efficiency in propylene production. By converting propane directly to propylene through dehydrogenation, it bypasses intermediate stages that are energy-intensive and resource-consuming, thus optimizing the overall process.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology demonstrates improved product selectivity, reducing the formation of unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane. This leads to higher purity propylene output, which is essential for downstream chemical processes and applications.

4. **Environmental Impact**: With its focus on utilizing renewable propane sources and reducing the formation of harmful by-products, PDH technology contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to propylene production compared to traditional methods.
