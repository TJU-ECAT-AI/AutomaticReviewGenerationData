[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene."
[2] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[3] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
[4] "The new catalyst PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by:

1. **Addressing Feedstock Availability**: Propane is a widely available and abundant feedstock, unlike certain oil fractions traditionally used in propylene production. PDH utilizes propane directly, making the process more flexible and potentially reducing dependence on volatile crude oil markets.

2. **Enhanced Process Efficiency**: By converting propane directly to propylene, PDH bypasses the complex and energy-intensive steps required for cracking heavier hydrocarbons in traditional methods. This simplification leads to higher process efficiencies, lower energy consumption, and potentially lower capital costs.

3. **Optimized Product Selectivity**: PDH selectively converts propane to propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like methane and ethane. This results in a cleaner product stream with a higher concentration of propylene, which is more valuable in petrochemical applications.

4. **Increased Stability and Durability**: The study indicates that the SUZ-4 zeolite-based catalyst (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) is more stable and durable during propane dehydrogenation compared to ZSM-5-based catalysts. This is attributed to the higher dispersion of platinum (Pt) particles on the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite, which reduces deactivation by carbon deposition—a common issue in conventional catalysts. This enhanced stability allows for more consistent and prolonged operation, leading to cost savings through reduced maintenance and downtime.

考虑到对丙烯的快速增长需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在以下方面提供了关键优势，以应对传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **解决原料供应问题**：PDH利用广泛可用且丰富的丙烷作为原料，与传统方法中依赖波动的原油市场的重油相比，这使得过程更加灵活，并可能减少对不稳定原油市场的依赖。

2. **提高工艺效率**：通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，PDH跳过了传统方法中复杂且耗能的步骤，简化了过程，提高了效率，降低了能源消耗和潜在的资本成本。

3. **优化产品选择性**：PDH专门将丙烷转化为丙烯，最大限度地减少了副产品的形成，如甲烷和乙烷。这导致了更清洁的产品流，丙烯含量更高，更适合石化应用。

4. **增强稳定性和耐用性**：研究表明，基于苏兹-4沸石的催化剂（PtSnNa/SUZ-4）在丙烷脱氢过程中比ZSM-5基催化剂更为稳定和耐用。这是由于苏兹-4沸石表面分散的铂（Pt）颗粒较高，减少了由碳沉积导致的催化剂失活，这是传统催化剂常见的问题。这种增强的稳定性允许更一致和延长的操作，从而通过减少维护和停机时间来降低成本。
