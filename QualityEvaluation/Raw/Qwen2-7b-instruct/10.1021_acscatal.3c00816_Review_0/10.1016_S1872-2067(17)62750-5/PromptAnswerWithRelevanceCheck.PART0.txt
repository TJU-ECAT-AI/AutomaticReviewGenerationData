In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for large quantities of natural gas feedstock required by traditional steam cracking methods. This makes PDH more flexible and responsive to market demands and less dependent on specific raw materials. Secondly, PDH processes are typically more energy-efficient and produce fewer byproducts, enhancing process efficiency and environmental sustainability. Lastly, PDH improves product selectivity, allowing for higher yields of propylene and minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts like methane and ethane. The superior performance of PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts over PtSnNa/ZSM-5 is attributed to the unique properties of SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevents impregnation of the Pt precursor, leading to a higher concentration of Pt particles on the external surface and reduced carbon deposition. This results in enhanced catalytic activity and stability during the dehydrogenation process. The interactions between Sn oxides and the support in ZSM-5 are lessened due to the weaker acidity of the zeolite, making it easier for Sn to form metallic species, which decreases the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

考虑到对丙烯的快速增长需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，这些优势针对了传统生产方法在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。首先，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了传统蒸汽裂解方法所需大量天然气原料的需求，这使得PDH更具灵活性，能够更好地响应市场需求，并且依赖特定原材料较少。其次，PDH过程通常更节能，产生的副产品更少，从而提高了工艺效率并增强了环境可持续性。最后，PDH提高了产品的选择性，允许更高的丙烯产量，并减少了生产如甲烷和乙烷等副产品的可能性。铂锡钠/苏兹-4催化剂相对于铂锡钠/ZSM-5表现出更优越性能的原因归结于苏兹-4沸石的独特性质，它阻止铂前体的浸润，导致外部表面的铂颗粒浓度更高，并减少了碳沉积。这最终导致了脱氢过程中催化活性和稳定性的增强。ZSM-5中锡氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用被减弱，由于该沸石的酸性较弱，更易于锡形成金属物种，这降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。

1. Propane dehydrogenation is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The method allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, addressing issues with conventional production methods that often rely on less readily available feedstocks or suffer from lower efficiency and selectivity.
2. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation technology include the utilization of abundant propane feedstock, enhanced process efficiency, and improved product selectivity. This method ensures a steady supply of propylene, a critical chemical used in numerous industries, by converting a readily available resource into a valuable product efficiently.
3. Supported bi-component Pt-Sn catalysts are widely used in various chemical reactions due to their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics. Their application in propane dehydrogenation highlights their versatility and effectiveness in petrochemical processes.
4. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst. The primary reason for this is the better dispersion of platinum (Pt) particles on the surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite, which prevents deactivation by carbon deposition, thereby maintaining higher catalytic activity and stability.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges faced by conventional methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the following aspects:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Unlike conventional methods that require access to expensive and limited hydrocarbon resources, PDH utilizes abundant propane feedstocks. This ensures a stable and sustainable supply chain for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH technology offers higher efficiency in propylene production. By converting propane directly to propylene through dehydrogenation, it bypasses intermediate stages that are energy-intensive and resource-consuming, thus optimizing the overall process.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology demonstrates improved product selectivity, reducing the formation of unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane. This leads to higher purity propylene output, which is essential for downstream chemical processes and applications.

4. **Environmental Impact**: With its focus on utilizing renewable propane sources and reducing the formation of harmful by-products, PDH technology contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to propylene production compared to traditional methods.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by:

1. **Addressing Feedstock Availability**: Propane is a widely available and abundant feedstock, unlike certain oil fractions traditionally used in propylene production. PDH utilizes propane directly, making the process more flexible and potentially reducing dependence on volatile crude oil markets.

2. **Enhanced Process Efficiency**: By converting propane directly to propylene, PDH bypasses the complex and energy-intensive steps required for cracking heavier hydrocarbons in traditional methods. This simplification leads to higher process efficiencies, lower energy consumption, and potentially lower capital costs.

3. **Optimized Product Selectivity**: PDH selectively converts propane to propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like methane and ethane. This results in a cleaner product stream with a higher concentration of propylene, which is more valuable in petrochemical applications.

4. **Increased Stability and Durability**: The study indicates that the SUZ-4 zeolite-based catalyst (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) is more stable and durable during propane dehydrogenation compared to ZSM-5-based catalysts. This is attributed to the higher dispersion of platinum (Pt) particles on the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite, which reduces deactivation by carbon deposition—a common issue in conventional catalysts. This enhanced stability allows for more consistent and prolonged operation, leading to cost savings through reduced maintenance and downtime.
