<p>Propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene.</p>
<p>The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst was found to be superior to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation, at least partly because Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over its external surface and so are not deactivated by carbon deposition.</p>
<p>The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite.</p>
<p>In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation is a crucial petrochemical process due to the increasing demand for propylene.
2. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst demonstrated superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5, mainly because of the dispersion of Pt particles on its external surface, which prevents deactivation by carbon deposition.
3. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite hindered the impregnation of the Pt precursor into the zeolite.
4. The weak acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more of the precursor to enter the zeolite tunnels, resulting in the formation of highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最有前景的方法之一，因为它能够应对传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
2. PtSnNa/SUZ-4 催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出优越性能，部分原因是其表面分散的铂颗粒不易被沉积碳阻塞。
3. SUZ-4沸石中的强酸位点阻碍了铂前体的浸渍进入沸石。
4. ZSM-5沸石中的弱酸位点允许更多的前体进入沸石通道，在煅烧过程中转化为高度分散的铂簇。
