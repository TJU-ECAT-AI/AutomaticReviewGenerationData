The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology offers a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional methods. It allows for the conversion of abundant propane resources into valuable propylene, enhancing feedstock flexibility. Moreover, PDH processes often require less energy input and produce fewer byproducts, improving overall process efficiency. Additionally, the selectivity of PDH technology ensures a higher yield of propylene, optimizing product quality and reducing waste. By utilizing advanced catalysts, such as those explored in this study with lead (Pb) on silica (SiO2), PDH technology can achieve high catalytic activity and propene selectivity, making it a promising approach for propylene production.
