[1] "In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance."
[2] "However, the high cost of Pt- based catalysts and the unavoidable toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts are not enough to satisfy its evolving demand."
[3] "We wonder whether or not the other elements located in the fourth group of periodic table can catalyze propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Therefore, we explored the potential of Pb/SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to propene in this study."
