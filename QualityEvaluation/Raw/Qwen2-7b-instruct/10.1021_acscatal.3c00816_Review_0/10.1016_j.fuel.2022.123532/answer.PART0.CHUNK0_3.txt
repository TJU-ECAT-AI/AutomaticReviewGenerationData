<p>In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance.</p>
<p>However, the high cost of Pt- based catalysts and the unavoidable toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts are not enough to satisfy its evolving demand.</p>
<p>Therefore, developing an alternative to these two commercial catalysts has been stimulated in both industry and academia nowadays.</p>
<p>In the past few years, C, the fourth group nonmetallic element, has been proved to possess catalytic activity for both non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.</p>
<p>Among them, the active carbon samples not only include the artificially synthesized carbon materials, but also involve the coke formed during the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>As one of the fourth group metallic element, Sn species have also been proved to exhibit surprisingly high dehydrogenation activity and propene selectivity in our previous work.</p>
<p>These above-mentioned findings provide us with new insights into research and development of alkane dehydrogenation catalyst.</p>
<p>We wonder whether or not the other elements located in the fourth group of periodic table can catalyze propane dehydrogenation.</p>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology offers a more efficient use of feedstocks, particularly propane, which is abundant and less expensive than the traditional sources used in conventional production methods such as naphtha cracking. Secondly, PDH processes typically yield higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional methods, which often produce a mix of hydrocarbons including ethylene, propylene, and butenes. This higher selectivity translates into greater economic benefits as propylene is a more valuable product. Lastly, PDH processes can be integrated into existing natural gas infrastructure, reducing the need for additional feedstock transportation and processing, which is a significant advantage over methods requiring specific types of crude oil or naphtha.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的优势，被认为是丙烯生产的最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH技术在使用原料方面更为高效，尤其是丙烷，它比传统的原料来源（如石脑油裂解）更加丰富且成本更低。其次，PDH过程通常能提供更高的丙烯选择性，相比传统方法，后者往往产生包括乙烯、丙烯和丁二烯在内的多种烃类混合物。这种更高的选择性意味着经济利益更大，因为丙烯是一种更值钱的产品。最后，PDH过程可以整合到现有的天然气基础设施中，减少了额外原料运输和加工的需求，这是相对于需要特定类型原油或石脑油的方法的一个显著优势。
