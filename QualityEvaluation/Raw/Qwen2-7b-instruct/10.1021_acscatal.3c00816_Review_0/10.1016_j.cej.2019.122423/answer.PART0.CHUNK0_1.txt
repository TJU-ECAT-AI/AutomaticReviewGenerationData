In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes abundant natural gas and shale gas resources, providing a stable and cheap source for light alkanes including propane. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability, unlike conventional methods that may rely on scarce resources or require high-energy processes.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are considered more efficient compared to conventional cracking methods, as they directly convert propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps. This results in a streamlined production process that reduces energy consumption and operational costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology offers improved selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This leads to a higher yield of propylene and a lower cost of production.

4. **Environmental Impact**: By employing green chemistry principles, PDH technologies reduce environmental impact compared to conventional processes. This includes minimizing the release of pollutants and the use of less toxic catalysts, aligning with sustainability goals.

5. **Cost and Toxicity**: Sn-based catalysts, as opposed to noble metal-based catalysts like Pt or Cr, offer a lower cost solution with reduced toxicity. This makes them a viable alternative for commercial PDH processes, enhancing economic feasibility while maintaining high stability and performance.

6. **Industrial Use**: Non-noble metal oxides, particularly Sn-based catalysts, have proven successful in industrial applications, offering a promising alternative to traditional catalysts in the PDH process. This opens up avenues for researchers to explore further advancements in PDH technology.
