<p>Propylene is an important basic petrochemical materials and it could be utilized to make plentiful downstream products such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile and propylene oxide. Currently, propylene is mainly produced as a co-product by steam cracking or catalytic cracking processes at high temperatures [1] . However, the conventional processes consume a large amount of energy and usually appear a gap between demand and supply of propene [2] . The exploration of on-purpose propene technologies has attracted considerable attention. Abundant natural gas and shale gas resources provide a stable and cheap source for light alkanes including propane. The direct transformation of propane has being an efficient way to increase the production of propylene [3] ,[4] ,[5] . The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered to be the promising routes alternative to conventional cracking processes and has being the emerging technology used today.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant natural gas and shale gas resources as a stable and inexpensive source for light alkanes, including propane, offering a more sustainable feedstock option compared to conventional methods that rely on coal or oil, which may be more scarce and costly.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH bypasses the high-temperature cracking processes typically used in conventional methods, reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering operational costs. This makes the PDH process more efficient and environmentally friendly.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH allows for the direct production of propylene from propane, avoiding the production of other byproducts that occur in conventional cracking processes. This results in higher product selectivity and purity of propylene.

4. **Cost and Environmental Impact**: By utilizing a cleaner and more abundant feedstock, PDH reduces the environmental impact and cost associated with conventional propylene production. This includes lower emissions and potentially lower operational expenses.

PDH, therefore, represents a promising method for propylene production that directly addresses the challenges of conventional methods by improving feedstock availability, enhancing process efficiency, increasing product selectivity, and reducing environmental impact.

在面对全球聚丙烯需求增长的情况下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH利用丰富且成本低廉的天然气和页岩气资源作为轻烷烃（包括丙烷）的稳定原料来源，相比传统方法依赖煤炭或石油，可能更为稀缺且昂贵，提供了更可持续的原料选择。

2. **过程效率**：PDH绕过了传统方法中常用的高温裂解过程，减少了能源消耗，并可能降低了运营成本。这使得PDH过程更加高效和环保。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH允许从丙烷直接生产丙烯，避免了传统裂解过程中产生的副产品，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和纯度。

4. **成本和环境影响**：通过利用清洁且更为丰富的原料，PDH减少了与传统丙烯生产相关的环境影响和成本。这包括降低排放量以及可能降低运营费用。

因此，PDH代表了一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，直接解决了传统方法面临的问题，通过提高原料可用性、增强过程效率、增加产品选择性和减少环境影响。
