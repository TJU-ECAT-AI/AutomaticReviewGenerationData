The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant natural gas and shale gas resources, providing a stable and cheap source for light alkanes like propane, which is crucial for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Unlike conventional processes that consume a large amount of energy, PDH is considered an efficient way to increase the production of propylene with less energy consumption. This makes it a more environmentally friendly option.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH produces propylene as a primary product, avoiding the gap between demand and supply typically found in conventional cracking processes. The selectivity of propylene is improved, leading to better product purity and higher yields.

4. **Cost and Environment-Friendly Properties**: Sn-based catalysts, which can act as the active component in PDH, offer a lower cost and environmental friendliness compared to traditional Pt- or Cr-based catalysts. This makes Sn-based catalysts a promising alternative for commercial PDH processes.

5. **Unique Support Advantage**: The DMSNs materials, with their unique central-radial pore structure, provide an excellent platform for synthesizing Sn-containing catalysts with superior catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation, enhancing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective approach to propylene production, making it the most promising method for addressing the challenges posed by conventional production techniques.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Conventional methods rely on steam cracking or catalytic cracking processes, which consume a large amount of energy and often result in a supply-demand imbalance for propene. PDH technology utilizes abundant natural gas and shale gas resources to efficiently convert propane into propylene, making it an effective and emerging alternative. Considering the principles of green chemistry, chromium-based catalysts are increasingly viewed negatively due to their toxicity. While platinum-based catalysts are commonly used and have been extensively studied, they face challenges related to high cost, sintering, and easy coke deposition. Sn-based catalysts, particularly when incorporated into silica, have demonstrated comparable dehydrogenation performance to platinum-based catalysts, especially with excellent stability. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying the electronic and geometric properties of platinum to enhance its catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. Sn-based catalysts are considered a low-cost, environmentally friendly alternative to platinum- or chromium-based catalysts for commercial PDH processes, making them a promising area of research and development.
