The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically tackles these challenges by utilizing abundant natural gas and shale gas resources to provide a stable and inexpensive source for light alkanes like propane. This direct transformation of propane into propylene is an efficient method that increases propylene production. PDH is considered a promising alternative route to conventional cracking processes, offering a more sustainable approach that consumes less energy and reduces the gap between demand and supply of propene. The non-oxidative nature of PDH makes it particularly appealing as an emerging technology in the petrochemical industry.
