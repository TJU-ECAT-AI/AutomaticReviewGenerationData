The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant natural gas and shale gas resources, providing a stable and cheap source for light alkanes like propane, which is crucial for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Unlike conventional processes that consume a large amount of energy, PDH is considered an efficient way to increase the production of propylene with less energy consumption. This makes it a more environmentally friendly option.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH produces propylene as a primary product, avoiding the gap between demand and supply typically found in conventional cracking processes. The selectivity of propylene is improved, leading to better product purity and higher yields.

4. **Cost and Environment-Friendly Properties**: Sn-based catalysts, which can act as the active component in PDH, offer a lower cost and environmental friendliness compared to traditional Pt- or Cr-based catalysts. This makes Sn-based catalysts a promising alternative for commercial PDH processes.

5. **Unique Support Advantage**: The DMSNs materials, with their unique central-radial pore structure, provide an excellent platform for synthesizing Sn-containing catalysts with superior catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation, enhancing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective approach to propylene production, making it the most promising method for addressing the challenges posed by conventional production techniques.
