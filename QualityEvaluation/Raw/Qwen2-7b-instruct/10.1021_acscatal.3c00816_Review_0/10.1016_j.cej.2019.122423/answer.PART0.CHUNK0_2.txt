In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Conventional methods rely on steam cracking or catalytic cracking processes, which consume a large amount of energy and often result in a supply-demand imbalance for propene. PDH technology utilizes abundant natural gas and shale gas resources to efficiently convert propane into propylene, making it an effective and emerging alternative. Considering the principles of green chemistry, chromium-based catalysts are increasingly viewed negatively due to their toxicity. While platinum-based catalysts are commonly used and have been extensively studied, they face challenges related to high cost, sintering, and easy coke deposition. Sn-based catalysts, particularly when incorporated into silica, have demonstrated comparable dehydrogenation performance to platinum-based catalysts, especially with excellent stability. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying the electronic and geometric properties of platinum to enhance its catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. Sn-based catalysts are considered a low-cost, environmentally friendly alternative to platinum- or chromium-based catalysts for commercial PDH processes, making them a promising area of research and development.

考虑到对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。传统的生产方法依赖于蒸汽裂解或催化裂解过程，这些过程消耗大量能源，并经常导致丙烯供需不平衡。PDH技术利用丰富的天然气和页岩气资源有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，使其成为一种有效且新兴的替代方案。考虑到绿色化学的原则，由于其毒性，铬基催化剂正逐渐失去吸引力。虽然铂基催化剂通常被广泛使用并已进行了深入研究，但它们面临着高成本、铂团聚以及易于生成焦炭沉积物的主要挑战。当Sn融入到二氧化硅中时，Sn基催化剂已经显示出与铂基催化剂相当的脱氢性能，尤其是具有卓越的稳定性。Sn作为促进剂，可以修改铂的电子和几何特性，从而增强其在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。Sn基催化剂被视为铂或铬基催化剂的低成本、环保替代品，用于商业PDH过程，这使它们成为研究和发展的一个有前景的领域。
