The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include its potential to address challenges such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity more effectively than conventional methods. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and less expensive compared to traditional oil-based sources. This approach enhances process efficiency through optimized catalytic reactions, leading to higher yields of propylene. Moreover, the technology improves product selectivity, ensuring that the majority of the reaction products are propylene rather than byproducts, thus increasing economic viability and environmental sustainability.
