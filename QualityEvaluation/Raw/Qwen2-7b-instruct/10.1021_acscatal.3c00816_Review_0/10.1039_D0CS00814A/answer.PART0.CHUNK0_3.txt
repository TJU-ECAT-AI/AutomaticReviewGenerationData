[1] "Increasing technologies for propane production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins process."
[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[3] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
[4] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."
[5] "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen."
[6] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to exclusively produce propylene, avoiding the production of hybrid products. This addresses the conventional method's challenge of producing multiple products, which complicates process management and product handling. 

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing a wide range of propane sources, including those from shale gas condensates, which are abundant and inexpensive. This contrasts with conventional methods that rely on more expensive and less readily available feedstocks like naphtha and light diesel.

3. Process efficiency is enhanced in PDH technology by its ability to operate under high temperatures and pressures, which facilitates the endothermic conversion of propane into propylene. This is an improvement over conventional methods, which might require more energy-intensive processes.

4. Product selectivity is optimized in PDH technology by focusing solely on propylene production. This reduces the complexity of the downstream processing required to separate propylene from other olefins produced in conventional methods, making the overall process more efficient and cost-effective.

Answer: PDH technology stands out for its exclusive propylene production capability, utilization of abundant and affordable propane sources, process efficiency under high temperatures and pressures, and optimized product selectivity. These features address the challenges of conventional propylene production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
