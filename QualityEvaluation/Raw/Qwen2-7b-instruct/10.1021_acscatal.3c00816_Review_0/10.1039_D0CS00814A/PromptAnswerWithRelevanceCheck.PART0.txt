Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its inherent advantages in addressing the challenges posed by conventional production methods. The key advantages include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant, cheap, and widely available. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on more expensive and scarce resources like naphtha or natural gas liquids. The use of propane ensures a reliable supply chain and economic feasibility.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient process for propylene production, as it bypasses the complex and energy-intensive refining steps required by conventional methods. This leads to lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology allows for high selectivity in propylene production, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as ethane and methane. This results in a cleaner and more profitable product output compared to traditional methods that may require additional purification steps to isolate propylene.

Specifically, PDH addresses the challenges of conventional methods in the following ways:

- **Feedstock Availability**: By leveraging propane, PDH ensures a consistent and cost-effective feedstock supply, unlike methods that may face fluctuations in the availability of naphtha or natural gas liquids.

- **Process Efficiency**: PDH streamlines the production process, reducing the need for extensive refining and processing stages that are typical in traditional methods. This simplification leads to streamlined operations, lower energy consumption, and potentially higher throughput.

- **Product Selectivity**: Through optimized catalytic systems and process conditions, PDH achieves high selectivity in propylene production. This minimizes the formation of byproducts, ensuring a higher yield of propylene and reducing the need for post-processing to purify the product.

In essence, PDH technology optimizes the production of propylene by offering a more sustainable, efficient, and selective approach compared to conventional methods, thereby meeting the growing global demand for this critical chemical commodity.

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years."
[2] "Increasing technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, and the FischerTropsch-to-olefins process."
[3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[4] "Moreover, with the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful."
