The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its thermodynamic efficiency, offering a potentially more efficient method for propylene production compared to conventional methods. PDH specifically addresses challenges like feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By directly converting propane into propylene without the need for oxygen, PDH avoids the limitations posed by the thermodynamic limitations of direct dehydrogenation routes. ODH, with its favorable thermodynamics, further enhances this efficiency. Developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is crucial for industrial application of ODH reactions.
