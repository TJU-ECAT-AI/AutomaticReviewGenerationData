1. The forecast from Dow Chemical Company predicts that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, exceeding production capacity within that timeframe. PDH technology is seen as the most promising method for propylene production because it exclusively produces propylene without any byproducts.

2. The Catofin process, which utilizes CrOx-based catalysts, is highlighted for its low cost and high catalytic Lewis acid activity, making it an attractive option in propylene production.

3. The complexity of supported nanoparticles and uncertainties in preparation processes have made identifying the exact active sites and mechanisms in Pt-based catalysts for PDH reactions a challenge.

4. Review studies have covered the energy analysis of different PDH technologies and advancements in catalyst preparation methods and development.

5. Counter-current flow technology in the Catofin process optimizes product yield with minimal raw materials, leading to reduced investment and operational costs.

6. There is a high demand for developing alternative catalysts that have lower chromium content or are non-chromium based, aiming to reduce toxicity and environmental impact.

7. The Catofin process involves changing the flow direction of reactive materials and gases to maximize product output and minimize resource usage.
