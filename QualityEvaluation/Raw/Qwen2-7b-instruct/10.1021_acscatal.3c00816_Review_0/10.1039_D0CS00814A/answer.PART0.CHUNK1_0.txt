In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH technology directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and scarce feedstocks like naphtha or natural gas, which conventional production methods often rely on. This approach addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing a more abundant and sustainable resource. Secondly, PDH technology ensures a more efficient use of resources, reducing the dependency on traditional fossil fuels. It achieves a high propylene yield, making the process not only more sustainable but also more economical. Lastly, PDH technology is designed to optimize process efficiency and product selectivity, addressing the limitations of conventional methods in terms of process efficiency and product selectivity.
