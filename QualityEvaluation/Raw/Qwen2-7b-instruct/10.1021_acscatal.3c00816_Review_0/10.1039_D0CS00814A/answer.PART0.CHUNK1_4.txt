In addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out for its ability to efficiently utilize abundant propane resources. By converting propane directly to propylene, PDH processes reduce dependence on scarce and expensive feedstocks such as oil and natural gas. This method offers higher product selectivity, generating a greater proportion of propylene with fewer byproducts, compared to traditional processes. Moreover, PDH technologies are engineered to minimize side reactions and coke formation, ensuring improved process efficiency and product purity. Overall, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production in today's global market.
