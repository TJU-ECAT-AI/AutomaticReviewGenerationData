[1] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices. This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[2] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[3] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[5] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."

Propylene production through propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods rely heavily on naphtha, which is expensive and its supply is diminishing. PDH technology, however, allows for the direct conversion of inexpensive and abundant shale gas liquids, such as ethane, into propylene. This not only mitigates the need for expensive naphtha but also enhances the sustainability of the production process. 

The demand for propylene is growing, particularly from the automotive industry, and the supply is facing constraints due to the high costs associated with naphtha cracking. This has led to a significant increase in the price of butadiene, a key component in the production of synthetic rubber and other materials. In response, investments in new PDH installations have surged globally, indicating the technology's potential to meet the rising demand for propylene.

Furthermore, PDH technology is expected to see a substantial increase in production capacity over the coming years, as dozens of new installations are announced and are already under construction. This growth is anticipated to significantly boost the annual propylene production, which currently stands at approximately 5 million tons, to levels that can meet the increasing global demand.

In addition, the shift towards using shale-based ethane in steam cracking processes in the United States reflects a broader trend towards utilizing cheaper and more abundant feedstocks, which is crucial for the economic viability and sustainability of propylene production. The emphasis on energy independence, facilitated by the abundant natural gas resources in the United States, underscores the strategic importance of PDH technology in securing a reliable and efficient supply of propylene.

丙烯生产通过丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它能够直接解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。这些挑战包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。传统的生产方法依赖昂贵且供应有限的石脑油，而PDH技术允许直接将廉价且丰富的页岩气液体（如乙烷）转化为丙烯。这不仅减少了对昂贵石脑油的需求，而且提高了生产过程的可持续性。

对于丙烯的需求正在增长，尤其是来自汽车行业，同时由于石脑油裂解成本高昂导致供应受到限制，这导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨。作为回应，全球对新的PDH安装的投资激增，表明该技术有可能满足不断增长的丙烯需求。

此外，预计PDH技术在未来几年的生产产能将显著增加，因为宣布的和已经建设中的新安装数量众多。这有望大幅提高目前约为每年500万吨的丙烯产量，以满足全球不断增长的需求。

另外，美国转向使用页岩气乙烷进行蒸汽裂解的过程反映了更广泛的利用更便宜且丰富原料的趋势，这对于丙烯生产在经济可行性和可持续性方面的可行性至关重要。美国对能源独立的强调凸显了PDH技术在确保可靠和高效丙烯供应方面的重要性。
