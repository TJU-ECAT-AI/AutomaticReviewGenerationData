[1] "The demand for propylene is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future."
[2] "Alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[3] "Dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years."
[4] "These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[5] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[6] "Advancements can also be expected in other areas."
