[1] "The demand for propylene is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future."
[2] "Alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[3] "Current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."
[6] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation."

1. The demand for propylene is anticipated to stay high in the coming years.
2. Dehydrogenation and MTO methods have surpassed traditional techniques like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking in competitiveness.
3. There is scope for improvement in current dehydrogenation technologies, aiming to decrease the usage of precious metals, enhance catalyst durability, and optimize energy efficiency.
4. Despite considerable focus on alternative catalysts like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx in recent decades, a viable substitute for PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been identified.
5. An alternative approach involves utilizing solid oxygen carriers, like CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing hydrogen generated by the SHC process.
6. These measurements demonstrate that adjusting the duration of dehydrogenation and regeneration periods can maintain the catalyst's optimal state, with moderate coke amounts aiding the dehydrogenation process but excessive coke leading to catalyst degradation.

1. 在可预见的未来，丙烯的需求预计将持续高涨。
2. 脱氢和MTO方法在与传统方法如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解的竞争中变得更为有竞争力。
3. 当前的脱氢技术仍有改进空间，旨在减少贵金属的使用量、提高催化剂稳定性，并优化脱氢过程的能量效率。
4. 尽管过去几十年对诸如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等替代催化剂给予了大量关注，但尚未找到可以替代PtSn和CrOx系统的可行方案。
5. 一种替代方法是利用CeO2、SbO4、In2O3、WO3、PbOx、Tl2O3和BiO3等固体氧载体，它们能够选择性氧化由SHC反应产生的氢。
6. 这些测量结果表明，通过动态调整脱氢和再生阶段的时间，可以维持催化剂的最佳状态。适量的焦炭被认为有助于脱氢反应，而过量的焦炭会导致催化剂降解。
