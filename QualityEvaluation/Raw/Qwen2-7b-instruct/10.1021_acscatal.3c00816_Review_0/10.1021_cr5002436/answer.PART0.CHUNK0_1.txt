[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[3] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[4] "There is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[5] "The supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[6] "Propylene is produced by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[7] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[8] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[9] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[10] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include the scarcity of traditional feedstocks, inefficiencies in the production process, and limitations in product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing abundant shale gas as a feedstock, which is cheaper and more accessible than traditional naphtha sources. This allows for a more flexible and cost-effective production process. Additionally, PDH offers high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. The technology is also scalable, allowing for significant increases in propylene production capacity, as evidenced by the numerous new PDH installations announced globally.

2. The market for propylene is robust, with all major markets experiencing growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone due to the effects of economic downturn. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price differential between propane and propylene, which currently favors PDH due to favorable market conditions. This price difference is a key driver in the adoption of PDH technology.

3. The automotive industry's demand for high-quality olefins, such as propylene, has increased, while the supply of propylene has decreased and its price has risen. This has created a market opportunity for alternative production methods like PDH. Butane dehydrogenation also benefits from similar market conditions, indicating a broader trend in the chemical industry towards PDH technology.

4. The profitability of PDH is significantly influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene. This price disparity has made the market conditions highly favorable for PDH technology, driving its adoption and expansion.

5. The increase in demand for butadiene, a key component in the production of synthetic rubber, has led to higher prices. This, coupled with the high cost of naphtha cracking, has prompted investments in new butane dehydrogenation installations in countries like the US, China, and Japan.

6. Propylene is predominantly produced through the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins, such as propane, highlighting the central role of PDH in propylene production.

7. The number of new PDH installations is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, with dozens of new installations announced worldwide. Many of these installations are already in progress, reflecting a substantial expansion in propylene production capacity.

8. The shift from traditional naphtha sources to shale gas has enabled a cost-effective and efficient transition in steam cracking installations in the US. This shift has been driven by the abundance and affordability of ethane from shale gas deposits, leading to a decline in naphtha usage and a rise in ethane utilization.

9. The US is a significant producer of shale gas, accounting for a quarter of their natural gas production. This production is anticipated to increase further, driven by efforts to achieve energy independence. This emphasis on domestic gas production has fueled the expansion of PDH installations in the US and beyond.

10. Investments in new butane dehydrogenation installations in the US, China, and Japan have been spurred by the aforementioned market conditions and the potential for high returns on investment in PDH technology.
