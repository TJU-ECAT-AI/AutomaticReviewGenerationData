1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods, including addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The primary benefits are:

   - **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology can utilize unconventional feedstocks such as natural gas liquids (NGLs), particularly ethane, which are abundant and cheaper compared to traditional oil-based feedstocks. This makes PDH a more economically viable option, especially in regions with access to shale gas resources.

   - **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes, such as the Oleflex and Catofin technologies, are designed to maximize propylene yield. They operate under conditions that optimize olefin production, such as high temperatures and specific catalyst systems, which are tailored to minimize side reactions and increase selectivity towards propylene.

   - **Product Selectivity**: PDH processes are engineered to produce propylene with high purity and quality, often approaching or exceeding polymer-grade specifications. This ensures that the product is suitable for downstream applications, eliminating the need for additional purification steps that are common in naphtha cracking processes.

   - **Economic Viability**: The market conditions favor PDH due to the price differential between propane and propylene. As demand for propylene grows, especially from sectors like the automotive industry, and supply from conventional sources becomes more expensive, PDH becomes increasingly attractive. The profitability of PDH is closely tied to this price gap, which is expected to continue expanding.

2. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

   - **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional methods rely on naphtha, which is more expensive and less available due to rising oil prices and dwindling petroleum reserves. PDH utilizes ethane from natural gas, which is abundant and inexpensive, making the process more cost-effective.

   - **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes employ advanced catalysts and reactor designs that optimize the dehydrogenation reaction, reducing energy consumption and improving yield. This is particularly evident in the Oleflex and Catofin technologies, which are designed to efficiently convert propane to propylene with minimal waste.

   - **Product Selectivity**: PDH produces propylene with high purity, which is critical for downstream applications. Conventional methods often require additional refining steps to meet the same quality standards, increasing costs and complexity.

   - **Economic Viability**: The economic attractiveness of PDH is underscored by the current market conditions. The price differential between propane and propylene, coupled with growing demand for propylene, creates a lucrative opportunity for PDH investments. This economic advantage is expected to drive the expansion of PDH capacities globally, as seen with the numerous new installations announced and under construction worldwide.
