[1] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[2] "Propylene is the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[3] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[4] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[5] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[6] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[9] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[10] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[11] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[12] "These (predicted) numbers originate from ref. 7."
[13] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[14] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[15] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[16] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[17] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[18] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[19] "In fact, the use of K+ in these catalysts results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These include:
   - Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes abundant natural gas resources, specifically ethane from shale gas deposits, which are cheaper and more readily available compared to naphtha.
   - Process efficiency: PDH processes like Catofin and Oleflex offer continuous operation and high throughput, leading to efficient propylene production.
   - Product selectivity: PDH processes yield exclusively propylene, avoiding the production of unwanted byproducts, unlike traditional methods that produce a mixture of olefins and paraffins.
   - Market demand: The growing demand for propylene, particularly from the automotive industry, aligns well with the potential output of PDH, which is expected to increase significantly in the coming years due to announced new installations worldwide.
   - Economic viability: The price difference between propane and propylene, along with the favorable market conditions, makes PDH economically attractive, especially considering the cost reduction in natural gas prices.

2. The market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes is similarly advantageous as for propane, given the comparable conditions in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and market demand. This allows for the profitable production of butadiene through PDH technology.

3. The number of new PDH installations announced and under construction is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years. This growth reflects the industry's confidence in the technology's ability to meet the growing demand for propylene and the potential for cost-effective and efficient propylene production through the utilization of natural gas resources.

4. The graph to the right shows the consumption of ethylene, propylene, and butylenes in 2004, 2010, and 2016, along with the products made by these olefins. The numbers for predicted consumption originate from reference 7.

5. The emphasis on energy independence in the United States is driving the exploration and expansion of domestic natural gas resources, such as shale gas, which is expected to lead to a significant increase in ethane production and, consequently, a shift towards PDH technology for propylene production.

6. The PDH process is an on-purpose technique that yields propylene exclusively, unlike conventional methods that produce a mixture of olefins and paraffins. This characteristic enhances the efficiency and selectivity of propylene production.

7. As of the latest data, approximately 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually by PDH processes. The projected increase in the number of new installations suggests a potential for substantial growth in propylene production through PDH technology in the future.

8. The use of K+ as a promoter in PDH catalysts has been found to significantly reduce catalytic activity, indicating that certain additives or promoters may need to be carefully selected to optimize the performance of PDH catalysts.
