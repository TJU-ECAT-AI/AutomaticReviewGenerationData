[1] "Due to their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[3] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[6] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[9] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[10] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

Firstly, PDH leverages the abundance of shale gas, which is rich in natural gas liquids (NGLs) like ethane and propane, providing a cost-effective feedstock alternative to traditional sources. This has enabled the US to become a low-cost chemical producer, benefiting from the significant drop in gas costs relative to 2005 prices. 

Secondly, PDH processes are designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, minimizing waste and maximizing yield. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios where ethane cracking leads to a drop in propylene supply and price, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH.

Thirdly, the market dynamics favor PDH due to the price disparity between propane and propylene. As demand for propylene grows and the supply from PDH installations increases, this technology is poised to become a major player in the global propylene market, offering a competitive edge in terms of efficiency and profitability.

Lastly, the projected increase in PDH installations worldwide indicates a strong trend towards this technology, which promises to further enhance its efficiency and expand its capabilities in meeting the growing demand for propylene globally.

由于轻烯烃如丙烯（丙烯）和乙烯（乙烷）作为化学基础材料的广泛使用，它们在化工行业中是最重要的一类化合物。蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）是获取这些轻烯烃的最常见方法。

近年来，压裂技术的发展使得大量天然气可以以经济有效的方式开采。这导致天然气成本下降约75%，使页岩气成为具有吸引力的能源来源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料。此外，除了甲烷外，页岩气储量还含有大量的天然气液体（NGL），如乙烷和丙烷，这些液体很容易从天然气中分离出来。

因此，页岩气产量的大幅增长将美国转变为中东以外的最低成本化工生产国，美国至2013年9月已记录的126个投资项目总价值达840亿美元，这是美国化学理事会计算的结果。这些相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩气的乙烷进行蒸汽裂解安装，乙烷裂解器正在建设中，而石脑油裂解器要么被拆卸，要么被转换。

与石脑油裂解相比，乙烷蒸汽裂解产生的烯烃仅限于乙烯，因此丙烯供应减少，价格急剧上涨，为特定目的的催化技术提供了机会，如轻烷烃的直接脱氢生成相应的烯烃。

确实，丙烷脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，目前市场条件非常有利。

然而，预计在未来几年内，全球将宣布并建设数十个新的PDH安装，许多安装已经处于建设之中，这预示着PDH技术在全球丙烯市场中的潜力将进一步增强。

最后，预计PDH安装数量的增长趋势表明，这种技术有望进一步提高其效率，并扩大其在全球丙烯市场需求方面的能力。
