[1] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[2] "Propylene is the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[3] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[4] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[5] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[6] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[9] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply."
[10] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[11] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[12] "These (predicted) numbers originate from ref. 7."
[13] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[14] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[15] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[16] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[17] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[18] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[19] "In fact, the use of K+ in these catalysts results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity."

Propylene production through propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods rely heavily on naphtha, which is expensive and its supply is diminishing. PDH technology, however, allows for the direct conversion of inexpensive and abundant shale gas liquids, such as ethane, into propylene. This not only mitigates the need for expensive naphtha but also enhances the sustainability of the production process. 

The demand for propylene is growing, particularly from the automotive industry, and the supply is facing constraints due to the high costs associated with naphtha cracking. This has led to a significant increase in the price of butadiene, a key component in the production of synthetic rubber and other materials. In response, investments in new PDH installations have surged globally, indicating the technology's potential to meet the rising demand for propylene.

Furthermore, PDH technology is expected to see a substantial increase in production capacity over the coming years, as dozens of new installations are announced and are already under construction. This growth is anticipated to significantly boost the annual propylene production, which currently stands at approximately 5 million tons, to levels that can meet the increasing global demand.

In addition, the shift towards using shale-based ethane in steam cracking processes in the United States reflects a broader trend towards utilizing cheaper and more abundant feedstocks, which is crucial for the economic viability and sustainability of propylene production. The emphasis on energy independence, facilitated by the abundant natural gas resources in the United States, underscores the strategic importance of PDH technology in securing a reliable and efficient supply of propylene.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods, including addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The primary benefits are:

   - **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology can utilize unconventional feedstocks such as natural gas liquids (NGLs), particularly ethane, which are abundant and cheaper compared to traditional oil-based feedstocks. This makes PDH a more economically viable option, especially in regions with access to shale gas resources.

   - **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes, such as the Oleflex and Catofin technologies, are designed to maximize propylene yield. They operate under conditions that optimize olefin production, such as high temperatures and specific catalyst systems, which are tailored to minimize side reactions and increase selectivity towards propylene.

   - **Product Selectivity**: PDH processes are engineered to produce propylene with high purity and quality, often approaching or exceeding polymer-grade specifications. This ensures that the product is suitable for downstream applications, eliminating the need for additional purification steps that are common in naphtha cracking processes.

   - **Economic Viability**: The market conditions favor PDH due to the price differential between propane and propylene. As demand for propylene grows, especially from sectors like the automotive industry, and supply from conventional sources becomes more expensive, PDH becomes increasingly attractive. The profitability of PDH is closely tied to this price gap, which is expected to continue expanding.

2. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

   - **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional methods rely on naphtha, which is more expensive and less available due to rising oil prices and dwindling petroleum reserves. PDH utilizes ethane from natural gas, which is abundant and inexpensive, making the process more cost-effective.

   - **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes employ advanced catalysts and reactor designs that optimize the dehydrogenation reaction, reducing energy consumption and improving yield. This is particularly evident in the Oleflex and Catofin technologies, which are designed to efficiently convert propane to propylene with minimal waste.

   - **Product Selectivity**: PDH produces propylene with high purity, which is critical for downstream applications. Conventional methods often require additional refining steps to meet the same quality standards, increasing costs and complexity.

   - **Economic Viability**: The economic attractiveness of PDH is underscored by the current market conditions. The price differential between propane and propylene, coupled with growing demand for propylene, creates a lucrative opportunity for PDH investments. This economic advantage is expected to drive the expansion of PDH capacities globally, as seen with the numerous new installations announced and under construction worldwide.

[1] "Due to their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."
[3] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[6] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."
[9] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[10] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

Firstly, PDH leverages the abundance of shale gas, which is rich in natural gas liquids (NGLs) like ethane and propane, providing a cost-effective feedstock alternative to traditional sources. This has enabled the US to become a low-cost chemical producer, benefiting from the significant drop in gas costs relative to 2005 prices. 

Secondly, PDH processes are designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, minimizing waste and maximizing yield. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios where ethane cracking leads to a drop in propylene supply and price, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH.

Thirdly, the market dynamics favor PDH due to the price disparity between propane and propylene. As demand for propylene grows and the supply from PDH installations increases, this technology is poised to become a major player in the global propylene market, offering a competitive edge in terms of efficiency and profitability.

Lastly, the projected increase in PDH installations worldwide indicates a strong trend towards this technology, which promises to further enhance its efficiency and expand its capabilities in meeting the growing demand for propylene globally.

由于轻烯烃如丙烯（丙烯）和乙烯（乙烷）作为化学基础材料的广泛使用，它们在化工行业中是最重要的一类化合物。蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）是获取这些轻烯烃的最常见方法。

近年来，压裂技术的发展使得大量天然气可以以经济有效的方式开采。这导致天然气成本下降约75%，使页岩气成为具有吸引力的能源来源和生产运输燃料或化学品的原料。此外，除了甲烷外，页岩气储量还含有大量的天然气液体（NGL），如乙烷和丙烷，这些液体很容易从天然气中分离出来。

因此，页岩气产量的大幅增长将美国转变为中东以外的最低成本化工生产国，美国至2013年9月已记录的126个投资项目总价值达840亿美元，这是美国化学理事会计算的结果。这些相对便宜的天然气液体，特别是乙烷，导致美国从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩气的乙烷进行蒸汽裂解安装，乙烷裂解器正在建设中，而石脑油裂解器要么被拆卸，要么被转换。

与石脑油裂解相比，乙烷蒸汽裂解产生的烯烃仅限于乙烯，因此丙烯供应减少，价格急剧上涨，为特定目的的催化技术提供了机会，如轻烷烃的直接脱氢生成相应的烯烃。

确实，丙烷脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，目前市场条件非常有利。

然而，预计在未来几年内，全球将宣布并建设数十个新的PDH安装，许多安装已经处于建设之中，这预示着PDH技术在全球丙烯市场中的潜力将进一步增强。

最后，预计PDH安装数量的增长趋势表明，这种技术有望进一步提高其效率，并扩大其在全球丙烯市场需求方面的能力。
