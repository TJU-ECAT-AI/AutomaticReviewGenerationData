</ChineseVersionAnswer>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology as mentioned in the literature are its potential to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH offers a direct route for propylene production from propane, which is more abundant and easier to handle compared to other feedstocks used in traditional processes.
2. **Process Efficiency**: By utilizing a direct dehydrogenation approach, PDH reduces energy consumption and streamlining the production process, leading to higher yields and lower operational costs.
3. **Product Selectivity**: The regioselective distribution of subnanometric CoO clusters in MFI zeolite nanosheets enhances the selectivity towards propylene formation, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts such as carbon residues.

These advancements in PDH technology promise significant improvements in the propylene production industry, contributing to more sustainable and economically viable manufacturing processes.
