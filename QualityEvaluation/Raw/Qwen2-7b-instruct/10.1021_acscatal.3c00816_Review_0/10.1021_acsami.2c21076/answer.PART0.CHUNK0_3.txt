[1] "Boosting Propane Dehydrogenation by the Regioselective Distribution of Subnanometric CoO Clusters in MFI Zeolite Nanosheets"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by efficiently converting propane into propylene through a regioselective distribution of subnanometric CoO clusters in MFI zeolite nanosheets, enhancing the yield and purity of propylene.
