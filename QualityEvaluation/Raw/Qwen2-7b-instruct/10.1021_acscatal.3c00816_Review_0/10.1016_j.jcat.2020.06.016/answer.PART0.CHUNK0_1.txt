Propylene is a crucial component in the manufacturing of various products including plastics, solvents, and fibers. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its key advantages over conventional methods. These advantages include improved feedstock flexibility, enhanced energy efficiency, and higher product selectivity. PDH technology tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing a broader range of propane sources, such as natural gas liquids, refinery off-gases, and even bio-propane derived from renewable resources. In terms of process efficiency, PDH processes usually operate at lower temperatures and pressures, leading to reduced capital and energy costs. Moreover, the product selectivity in PDH processes is significantly improved due to optimized reaction conditions, resulting in a higher yield of propylene and lower formation of byproducts. Compared to traditional production methods, PDH technology has the potential to increase environmental sustainability by enabling the use of more abundant and less resource-intensive propane feedstocks.
