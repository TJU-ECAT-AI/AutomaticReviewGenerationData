[1] "The Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolite with different content of Zn is synthesized and then used as supports."
[2] "The introduction of zinc at the synthesis leads to the formation of the agglomerated crystal rods."
[3] "The use of Zn-ZSM-5 affects the Pt-support interaction and the platinum dispersion effectively."
[4] "The catalyst when the content of Zn is 1.0% exhibits the highest reaction activity and stability."
[5] "The substitution of Zn in the support strengthens the interaction of platinum with support and increases the platinum dispersion effectively."
[6] "The formation of PtZn alloy resulted in the loss of catalytic activity and stability, while had a promoting effect for the reaction selectivity."
[7] "The PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited the highest reaction activity and stability."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive steam reforming processes. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability, particularly in regions with abundant propane resources but limited access to natural gas. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a streamlined, single-step process that reduces the overall energy consumption compared to multi-stage processes like steam reforming. Additionally, PDH enhances product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene without the need for extensive post-processing steps typically required in refining crude oil. This results in a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially more cost-effective method of propylene production.
