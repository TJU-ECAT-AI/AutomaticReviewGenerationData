[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[4] "Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."
[5] "Unfortunately, the reaction stability of this catalyst is still not satisfactory."
[6] "As a result, great efforts have been made to improve the reaction performance of the supported Pt catalysts by using the new support with distinctive structure and property."
[7] "For instance, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "On the other hand, the introduction of the metal promoter has also been confirmed as an effective method."
[9] "It is believed that the presence of the metal can improve the reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support."
[10] "In particular, the way in which the promoter is added can influence the final properties, not only of the support but also of the metallic phases."
[11] "Among the several reported literature, Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions."
[12] "Furthermore, the promoting effect of Zn can be mainly attributed to the strong interactions between Zn and Pt, which result in the formation of PtZn alloy and the change in electronic property of Pt atom."
[13] "Nevertheless, worthy mention is that over these Zn-doped catalysts, the deposition of Zn is mainly carried out by the impregnating with aqueous solution of the Zn precursor."
[14] "To create the new active centers, the incorporation of metal species into the material matrix is an effective way."
[15] "However, up to now, few reports exist on the incorporation of zinc into the structure of the microporous molecular sieve (ZSM-5)."
[16] "In the present work, Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite with different content of zinc was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as a support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
[17] "Particular emphasis was focused on the changes of catalyst acidity and character of Pt active sites with the increasing amount of zinc."
[18] "This can provide us with important information to understand the role of zinc in the support on metallic catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. This is because PDH directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps, addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically, PDH utilizes a catalyst to efficiently convert propane into propylene under high temperatures, achieving high yields and selectivity. This method reduces the dependency on crude oil, which is a limited resource, and offers a more efficient and selective pathway for propylene production compared to traditional methods that often involve multiple steps and potentially lower yields. By focusing on the development of high-activity, high-stability, and high-selectivity catalysts, particularly those incorporating Zn into the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite, researchers aim to enhance the performance of PDH technology, making it a more viable and sustainable option for propylene production.

The key advantages of PDH technology include:
1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH directly uses propane as the feedstock, which is readily available from natural gas sources. This avoids the need for refining crude oil, reducing reliance on a scarce and fluctuating resource.
2. **Process Efficiency**: The direct conversion process of PDH leads to higher energy efficiency compared to conventional methods that require multiple stages, including cracking and separation.
3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology allows for the production of propylene with high selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts and improving overall yield.
4. **Environmental Impact**: By reducing the dependency on crude oil, PDH contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to propylene production.

Incorporating Zn into the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite as a support for platinum catalysts in PDH technology enables researchers to tailor the catalyst properties, enhancing its activity, stability, and selectivity. This approach aims to optimize the PDH process, making it more efficient and cost-effective, while also contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable chemical manufacturing sector.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法。这是因为PDH可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需中间步骤，从而解决了传统生产方法在原料获取、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。具体来说，PDH通过使用催化剂，在高温下高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，实现高产率和高选择性。这种方法减少了对有限资源石油的依赖，并与传统的多步过程相比提供了更高效、选择性更高的丙烯生产途径。

PDH技术的关键优势包括：
1. **原料获取**：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，该原料可以从天然气来源获得，无需精炼石油，从而减少对稀缺且波动资源的依赖。
2. **过程效率**：PDH直接转化过程比传统方法更高效，后者需要多个阶段，包括裂解和分离。
3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术允许以高选择性生产丙烯，最大限度地减少副产品的形成，提高整体产率。
4. **环境影响**：通过减少对石油的依赖，PDH有助于更可持续的化学制造领域，贡献于更清洁和更环保的化工产业。

将Zn融入结构为ZSM-5沸石的铂催化剂支持中，研究人员能够定制催化剂特性，增强其活性、稳定性和选择性。这种策略旨在优化PDH过程，使其更高效、成本效益更高，同时也有助于构建更清洁和更可持续的化工行业。
