          The provided answers discuss the synthesis and application of Zn-modified ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for catalysts in the context of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for propylene production. The key advantages mentioned include enhanced catalyst activity, stability, and selectivity when specific amounts of zinc are incorporated into the zeolite structure. This is achieved through the modification of the Pt-support interaction, platinum dispersion, and the formation of a PtZn alloy, which collectively contribute to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the PDH process for propylene production.

          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
          [2] "Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
          [3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
          [4] "Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."
          [5] "Unfortunately, the reaction stability of this catalyst is still not satisfactory."
          [6] "As a result, great efforts have been made to improve the reaction performance of the supported Pt catalysts by using the new support with distinctive structure and property."
          [7] "For instance, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
          [8] "On the other hand, the introduction of the metal promoter has also been confirmed as an effective method."
          [9] "It is believed that the presence of the metal can improve the reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support."
          [10] "In particular, the way in which the promoter is added can influence the final properties, not only of the support but also of the metallic phases."
          [11] "Nevertheless, worthy mention is that over these Zn-doped catalysts, the deposition of Zn is mainly carried out by the impregnating with aqueous solution of the Zn precursor."
          [12] "However, up to now, few reports exist on the incorporation of zinc into the structure of the microporous molecular sieve (ZSM-5)."
          [13] "In the present work, Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite with different content of zinc was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as a support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
          [14] "Particular emphasis was focused on the changes of catalyst acidity and character of Pt active sites with the increasing amount of zinc."
          [15] "This can provide us with important information to understand the role of zinc in the support on metallic catalyst."

          The provided answers discuss the importance of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the context of increasing demand for propene, which is crucial for the production of polypropylene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid. They highlight the challenge of achieving high yields of propene through an endothermic process that requires high temperatures. The discussion emphasizes the need for developing catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity, as the deactivation of catalysts due to coke formation is inevitable. The introduction of metal promoters, such as zinc, is considered an effective method to improve reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support. The use of novel supports with distinct structural properties, like ZSM-5 zeolite, is explored for enhancing catalyst performance. The incorporation of zinc into ZSM-5 zeolite through hydrothermal synthesis is presented as a strategy to tailor catalyst properties, focusing on changes in catalyst acidity and the character of platinum active sites with varying zinc content. This research aims to gain insights into the role of zinc in supporting metallic catalysts.
