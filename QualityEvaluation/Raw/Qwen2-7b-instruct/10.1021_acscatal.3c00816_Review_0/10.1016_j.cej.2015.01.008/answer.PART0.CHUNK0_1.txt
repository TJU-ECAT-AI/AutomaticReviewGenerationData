[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[4] "Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."
[5] "Unfortunately, the reaction stability of this catalyst is still not satisfactory."
[6] "As a result, great efforts have been made to improve the reaction performance of the supported Pt catalysts by using the new support with distinctive structure and property."
[7] "For instance, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "On the other hand, the introduction of the metal promoter has also been confirmed as an effective method."
[9] "It is believed that the presence of the metal can improve the reaction selectivity by neutralizing the acidity of the support."
[10] "In particular, the way in which the promoter is added can influence the final properties, not only of the support but also of the metallic phases."
[11] "Nevertheless, worthy mention is that over these Zn-doped catalysts, the deposition of Zn is mainly carried out by the impregnating with aqueous solution of the Zn precursor."
[12] "However, up to now, few reports exist on the incorporation of zinc into the structure of the microporous molecular sieve (ZSM-5)."
[13] "In the present work, Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite with different content of zinc was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as a support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering greater flexibility in feedstock availability. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on specific crude oil fractions, PDH can utilize a broader range of hydrocarbon sources, including natural gas liquids, which are abundant and readily available. This diversification of feedstocks helps mitigate the risks associated with volatile oil markets and ensures a more stable supply chain.

Secondly, PDH technology improves process efficiency by enabling higher yields of propylene compared to competing methods like steam cracking or isomerization. This efficiency is achieved through optimized reaction conditions and advanced catalysts, which facilitate the endothermic dehydrogenation process without sacrificing the quality of the propylene produced. 

Lastly, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, particularly in terms of propylene yield. Traditional methods might produce a mix of olefins and paraffins, leading to a more complex separation process to isolate propylene. In contrast, PDH catalysts designed for high propylene selectivity ensure that the majority of the dehydrogenated products are propylene, simplifying downstream processing and reducing energy consumption in the separation stages.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more versatile, efficient, and selective approach to propylene production, making it the preferred choice for addressing the escalating demand for propylene globally. The innovative use of ZSM-5 zeolite with strategically incorporated zinc as a catalyst support showcases the potential for further optimization and enhancement of PDH technology, paving the way for sustainable and scalable propylene production.

面对全球聚丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术凭借几个关键优势成为最有可能的丙烯生产方法。首先，PDH技术通过提供更灵活的原料供应途径解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。与依赖特定原油组分的传统方法不同，PDH能够利用更广泛的碳氢化合物来源，包括丰富的天然气液体，这有助于减轻原油市场波动带来的风险，并确保供应链的稳定性。

其次，PDH技术通过优化反应条件和先进催化剂的使用提高了过程效率，实现了与传统方法相比更高的丙烯产率。这种效率的提高不仅体现在更高的丙烯产量上，同时也减少了副产品的生成，如乙烯和丁烯等，从而降低了下游精炼过程的复杂性和能源消耗。

最后，PDH技术在产品选择性方面也表现出优势，特别是在丙烯产率方面。传统的生产方法可能会产生混合的烯烃和烷烃，需要复杂的分离过程来提取纯丙烯。相比之下，PDH催化剂的设计旨在高选择性地产生丙烯，这意味着大多数脱氢产物都是丙烯，简化了下游加工流程并减少了分离阶段的能量消耗。

总之，PDH技术提供了更灵活、高效和选择性的丙烯生产方式，使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的理想选择。通过将ZSM-5沸石与适量锌结合作为催化剂载体的创新应用，展示了进一步优化和增强PDH技术的潜力，为可持续和规模化丙烯生产铺平了道路。
