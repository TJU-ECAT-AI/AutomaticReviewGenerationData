[1] "Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
[2] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."
[3] "Unfortunately, the reaction stability of this catalyst is still not satisfactory."
[4] "As a result, great efforts have been made to improve the reaction performance of the supported Pt catalysts by using the new support with distinctive structure and property."
[5] "For instance, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel and adjustable Si-Al ratio, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "On the other hand, the introduction of the metal promoter has also been confirmed as an effective method."
[7] "It is believed that the presence of Zn either as a promoter or acting as a support (as ZnO) can improve the catalytic properties of Pt catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes significantly."
[8] "Furthermore, the promoting effect of Zn can be mainly attributed to the strong interactions between Zn and Pt, which result in the formation of PtZn alloy and the change in electronic property of Pt atom (e.g., the formation of PtδZnδ+ entities)."
[9] "Nevertheless, worthy mention is that over these Zn-doped catalysts, the deposition of Zn is mainly carried out by the impregnating with aqueous solution of the Zn precursor."
[10] "To create the new active centers, the incorporation of metal species into the material matrix is an effective way."
[11] "In this case, the use of this zinc containing ZSM-5 results in the strong interactions between Pt and the support, thus leads to a higher resistance towards reduction."
[12] "Moreover, relatively homogeneous distribution of metallic particles and the improved Pt dispersion are observed over the Zn-doped catalysts."
[13] "In our experiments, the catalytic behavior of the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample merits to be highlighted, it exhibits the highest initial activity (40.60%) and the lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after the reaction for 10 h."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The high demand for propylene is met by PDH's ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene through an endothermic process, requiring a relatively high temperature to maximize yield. This contrasts with conventional methods, which might struggle with feedstock availability, particularly in regions where propane is scarce or expensive.

PDH technology utilizes supported platinum catalysts, which are highly reactive and efficient in converting propane into propylene. The use of new supports with distinct structures, such as ZSM-5 zeolite, enhances the performance of these catalysts. ZSM-5 zeolite, with its unique three-dimensional channels and adjustable Si-Al ratio, serves as an effective carrier for the catalyst, improving the reaction pathway and selectivity for propylene production.

Metal promoters, notably zinc (Zn), play a significant role in enhancing the catalytic properties of PDH catalysts. Zn can improve the selectivity of the reaction, particularly for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, by neutralizing the acidity of the support material. The strong interactions between Zn and Pt catalysts lead to the formation of PtZn alloys, which modify the electronic properties of the Pt atoms, potentially increasing the activity and stability of the catalyst.

In the context of the study, the incorporation of zinc into the ZSM-5 zeolite support via hydrothermal synthesis creates an environment that facilitates the formation of strong interactions between the support and the platinum catalyst. This results in a catalyst that exhibits superior activity and stability, as evidenced by the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample, which showed the highest initial activity and the lowest deactivation parameter after 10 hours of reaction.

Overall, PDH technology, with its strategic use of advanced catalyst supports and metal promoters, provides an efficient and selective method for propylene production, addressing critical challenges in the industry and meeting the escalating demand for propylene worldwide.

面对全球聚丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了一系列关键优势，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH技术通过需要较高温度的放热过程高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而满足对丙烯的高需求。这与常规方法相比，后者可能在原料获取、特别是在丙烷稀缺或成本高昂的地区时面临挑战。

PDH技术利用支持铂催化剂，这些催化剂在转化丙烷为丙烯时表现出高效性。使用具有独特三维通道和可调整的Si-Al比例的新型支撑材料，如ZSM-5沸石，可以增强催化剂性能。ZSM-5沸石作为催化剂载体的有效载体，改善了反应途径和丙烯的选择性。

金属促进剂，尤其是锌（Zn），在增强PDH催化剂性能方面发挥着重要作用。Zn可以通过中和支撑材料的酸性来提高反应选择性，特别是对于轻烷烃的脱氢。Zn与Pt催化剂之间的强相互作用导致PtZn合金的形成，这修改了Pt原子的电子性质，可能提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。

在研究中，通过水热合成将锌引入ZSM-5沸石支撑中，创建了一个环境，促进了支撑物与铂催化剂之间强烈的相互作用。这导致了一种催化剂，其初始活性最高（40.60%），并在10小时反应后显示出最低的失活参数（7.3%）。

综上所述，PDH技术，结合先进的催化剂支撑材料和金属促进剂的策略性应用，提供了一种高效且选择性的丙烯生产方法，解决了行业面临的挑战，并满足了全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。
