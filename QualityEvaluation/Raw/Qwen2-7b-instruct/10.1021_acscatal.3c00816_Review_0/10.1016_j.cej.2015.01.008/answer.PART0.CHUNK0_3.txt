[1] "The Zn modified ZSM-5 zeolites with different content of Zn have been hydrothermally synthesized and then this kind of zeolite has been used as the support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Compared with the traditional impregnation method, the incorporation of Zn into the support makes the modification effect of the promoter to the metal phase and support acidity is reflected more effectively."
[3] "In our experiments, the catalytic behavior of the PtNa/Zn(1.0%)-ZSM-5 sample merits to be highlighted, it exhibits the highest initial activity (40.60%) and the lowest deactivation parameter (7.3%) after the reaction for 10 h."

In the context of growing demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for multiple intermediate steps, which enhances process efficiency. In terms of feedstock availability, PDH utilizes readily available propane as a feedstock, unlike conventional methods that might require more complex and expensive processes to prepare the feed. Moreover, PDH offers superior product selectivity, particularly for propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, which aligns well with market demands.
