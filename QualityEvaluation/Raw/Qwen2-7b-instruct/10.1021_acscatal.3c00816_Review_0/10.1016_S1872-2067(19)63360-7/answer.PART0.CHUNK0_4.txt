[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) offers several key advantages over traditional methods, including enhanced feedstock flexibility, higher process efficiency, and improved product selectivity."
[2] "PDH technology addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods, particularly concerning feedstock availability. Traditional methods often rely on naphtha, which is limited by refining capacity and subject to price volatility. PDH, on the other hand, can utilize a broader range of hydrocarbons, including propane, which is more abundant and less expensive."
[3] "In terms of process efficiency, PDH stands out due to its ability to operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to thermal cracking processes. This results in reduced energy consumption and lower operational costs."
[4] "Product selectivity is another area where PDH excels. It produces a high purity propylene yield, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which are common in other dehydrogenation processes."
