Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. These include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology offers a more reliable feedstock source, as it directly utilizes propane, which is abundant and widely available. This contrasts with conventional methods that often require more complex and less readily accessible feedstocks. In terms of process efficiency, PDH is known for its high yield and low energy consumption, making it a more economical solution compared to traditional processes. Additionally, PDH demonstrates superior product selectivity, producing higher quality propylene with fewer byproducts. This enhanced selectivity contributes to increased profitability and environmental benefits, as it minimizes waste and reduces the carbon footprint associated with propylene production.
