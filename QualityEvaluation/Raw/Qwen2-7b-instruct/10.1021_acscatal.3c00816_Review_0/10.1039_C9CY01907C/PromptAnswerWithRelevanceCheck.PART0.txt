<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene.1,2 Currently, Pt-based catalysts have drawn particular attention due to their excellent catalytic performance and environment-friendly properties in commercial PDH processes.3,4 However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering.57 Thus it is important to develop new Pt-based catalysts with excellent anti-coking and anti-sintering capabilities.57 Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition. Among these promoters, Sn is known to be one of the most efficient promoters for decreasing the formation of coke.</p>
<p>However, it failed to provide strong metalsupport interactions, leading to Pt sintering, thereby reducing the activity and regenerability. Therefore, the preparation of a stable Pt-based catalyst for the PDH reaction is still a great challenge.</p>
<p>To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts. For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports. Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its potential to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers a sustainable approach with higher selectivity in producing propylene compared to other methods. It utilizes Pt-based catalysts known for their excellent catalytic performance and environmental friendliness. However, the major challenge lies in the deactivation of these catalysts due to coke deposition and metal sintering, which reduces their activity and regenerability. The use of additional promoters like tin (Sn) is suggested to decrease coke formation by increasing the electron density of Pt atoms and weakening the adsorption of product alkenes. Despite Sn's effectiveness in reducing coke formation, it fails to provide strong metal-support interactions, leading to Pt sintering. This highlights the ongoing challenge in developing stable Pt-based catalysts for PDH. Among various strategies to improve catalyst stability, modifying supports has proven to be an effective and straightforward method. For instance, Lu et al. developed a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst with enhanced stability due to strong interactions between metals and supports. Similarly, Ma et al. demonstrated that adding gallium (Ga) into magnesium-aluminum oxide layers could significantly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH, possibly through the dispersion and stabilization of PtSn clusters by pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions, thus strengthening electronic interactions between Pt and Ga.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势在于它有可能解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH提供了一种可持续的方法，与其它方法相比具有更高的丙烯选择性。它利用了Pt基催化剂，因其出色的催化性能和环境友好性而受到关注。然而，催化剂失活的主要挑战来自于焦炭沉积和金属结粒，这会降低其活性和再生能力。通过增加Pt原子的电子密度和减弱产物烯烃的吸附来减少焦炭形成，使用额外的促进剂如锡（Sn）被建议。尽管Sn在减少焦炭形成方面有效，但它无法提供强金属支持相互作用，导致Pt结粒。这强调了开发稳定Pt基催化剂用于PDH的持续挑战。在各种提高催化剂稳定性的策略中，修改支持被认为是一种有效且简便的方法。例如，Lu等人开发了一种PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂，由于金属和支持之间的强相互作用，其在PDH中的稳定性得到增强。同样，Ma等人证明了向镁铝氧化物层中添加镓（Ga）可以显著增强PDH中Pt催化剂的稳定性，可能是因为五配位Ga3+离子通过分散和稳定PtSn簇，从而加强了Pt与Ga之间的电子相互作用。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. Key advantages include:

1. **High Product Selectivity**: PDH offers higher selectivity in propene production compared to alternative methods, making it an attractive route for propylene manufacturing.

2. **Efficient Feedstock Utilization**: PDH utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available worldwide. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability.

3. **Process Efficiency**: By employing Pt-based catalysts, PDH processes achieve high conversion rates with minimal waste products, enhancing overall process efficiency.

4. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: The use of Pt-based catalysts, along with strategic promoter doping like Sn, improves the environmental footprint of propylene production by minimizing coke deposition and metal sintering, thus ensuring long-term stability and reducing the formation of pollutants.

The confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework facilitates the dispersion of Pt clusters and strengthens the Pt-Sn interactions, which in turn prevents coke formation and metal sintering. This leads to high stability, enabling the catalyst to maintain its performance over multiple cycles at elevated temperatures, without significant loss in activity or selectivity for propene production.

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) stands out as a sustainable and highly selective method for producing propene compared to other techniques. Challenges like coke deposition and metal sintering in Pt-based catalysts have led to the development of various strategies, such as incorporating additional promoters like tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) to Pt, which effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of alkene products, thereby reducing coke formation. 

2. The research introduces a novel Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst system that incorporates tin species into the framework of dealuminated beta zeolite (Si-beta) in tetrahedral coordination states. The Pt species are dispersed as ultra-small nanoclusters on the catalyst, thanks to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined within the Si-beta framework. This system demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, achieving a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a selectivity greater than 99% at 550°C, and an even higher rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600°C. Moreover, the strong Pt-Sn interactions and confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework prevent coke and sintering of Pt clusters, maintaining the catalyst's stability and activity for dehydrogenation and regeneration even after four cycles at 550°C.
