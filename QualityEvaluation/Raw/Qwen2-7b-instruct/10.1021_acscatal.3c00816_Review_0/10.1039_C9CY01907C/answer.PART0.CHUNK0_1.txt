[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene."
[2] "Currently, Pt-based catalysts have drawn particular attention due to their excellent catalytic performance and environment-friendly properties in commercial PDH processes."
[3] "However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering."
[4] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. Key advantages include:

1. **High Product Selectivity**: PDH offers higher selectivity in propene production compared to alternative methods, making it an attractive route for propylene manufacturing.

2. **Efficient Feedstock Utilization**: PDH utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available worldwide. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability.

3. **Process Efficiency**: By employing Pt-based catalysts, PDH processes achieve high conversion rates with minimal waste products, enhancing overall process efficiency.

4. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: The use of Pt-based catalysts, along with strategic promoter doping like Sn, improves the environmental footprint of propylene production by minimizing coke deposition and metal sintering, thus ensuring long-term stability and reducing the formation of pollutants.

The confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework facilitates the dispersion of Pt clusters and strengthens the Pt-Sn interactions, which in turn prevents coke formation and metal sintering. This leads to high stability, enabling the catalyst to maintain its performance over multiple cycles at elevated temperatures, without significant loss in activity or selectivity for propene production.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术凭借其高选择性、高效利用原料和减少环境影响等优势，成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法。关键优势包括：

1. **高产品选择性**：与其它方法相比，PDH在丙烯生产过程中展现出更高的选择性，使其成为理想的丙烯制造途径。

2. **有效利用原料**：PDH以丰富且易于获取的丙烷作为主要原料，解决了原料供应问题。

3. **高效工艺**：通过使用Pt基催化剂，PDH过程能够实现高转化率，同时产生较少的副产品，提高整体工艺效率。

4. **降低环境影响**：通过采用Pt基催化剂，并战略性地添加如Sn这样的促进剂，可以减少焦炭沉积和金属熔融，从而增强催化剂的长期稳定性，减少污染物的产生。

在Si-beta框架中限制Sn的存在有助于分散Pt簇并强化Pt-Sn相互作用。这阻止了焦炭形成和金属熔融，从而确保催化剂在高温下多次循环时保持性能稳定，而不会显著降低活性或丙烯选择性。
