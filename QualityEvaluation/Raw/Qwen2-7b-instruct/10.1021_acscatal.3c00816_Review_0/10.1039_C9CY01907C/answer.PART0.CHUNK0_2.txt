[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene."
[2] "However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering."
[3] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[4] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[5] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[6] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable and attractive method for producing propene because it offers higher selectivity compared to other production techniques. The key advantages of PDH include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods, particularly concerning feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and readily available. It improves process efficiency through the direct conversion of propane into propene, bypassing the need for intermediate steps that are common in other production methods. The high selectivity of PDH ensures that the majority of the product is propene, minimizing waste and maximizing yield. This makes PDH an economically viable and environmentally friendly option for propylene production.

1. 直接脱氢（PDH）是一种可持续且有吸引力的方法，用于生产丙烯，因为它提供了与其他生产技术相比更高的选择性。PDH的关键优势在于解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，特别是在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面。

PDH通过使用丙烷作为原料来解决这些挑战，该原料丰富且易于获取。它提高了过程效率，直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需遵循其他生产方法中常见的中间步骤。PDH的高选择性确保了产品的大部分是丙烯，最大限度地减少了浪费并最大化了产出。这使PDH成为一种经济可行且环保的丙烯生产选项。
