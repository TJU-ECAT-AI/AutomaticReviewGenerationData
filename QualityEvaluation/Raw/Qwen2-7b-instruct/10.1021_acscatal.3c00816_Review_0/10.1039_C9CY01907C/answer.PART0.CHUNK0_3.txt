[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene."
[2] "However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering."
[3] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[4] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[5] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[6] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[7] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) stands out as a sustainable and highly selective method for producing propene compared to other techniques. Challenges like coke deposition and metal sintering in Pt-based catalysts have led to the development of various strategies, such as incorporating additional promoters like tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) to Pt, which effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of alkene products, thereby reducing coke formation. 

2. The research introduces a novel Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst system that incorporates tin species into the framework of dealuminated beta zeolite (Si-beta) in tetrahedral coordination states. The Pt species are dispersed as ultra-small nanoclusters on the catalyst, thanks to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined within the Si-beta framework. This system demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for PDH, achieving a propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a selectivity greater than 99% at 550°C, and an even higher rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600°C. Moreover, the strong Pt-Sn interactions and confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework prevent coke and sintering of Pt clusters, maintaining the catalyst's stability and activity for dehydrogenation and regeneration even after four cycles at 550°C.

1. 烷烃脱氢（PDH）作为一种可持续和高度选择性的方法，与其它技术相比，在生产丙烯方面具有优势。在铂基催化剂的应用中，主要挑战来自于焦炭沉积和金属聚集，这导致催化剂失活。为了解决这些问题，已经提出了多种策略，如通过向铂（Pt）中添加额外的促进剂（如锡（Sn）、铟（In）、镓（Ga）、锰（Mn）、铜（Cu）和锌（Zn）），有效增加了铂原子的电子密度，减弱了产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少了焦炭的形成。

2. 本文研究提出了一种新型的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂系统，其中将锡元素融入去铝化贝塔沸石（Si-beta）框架中的四面体配合态中。铂物种以超小型纳米簇的形式分散在催化剂上，得益于铂和Si-beta框架内锡（IV）位点之间的强烈相互作用。该系统在PDH过程中的催化性能表现出色，当温度为550°C时，丙烯生成速率可达2.3 mol g1Pt h1，选择性大于99%，而在600°C时，丙烯生成速率可高达3.1 mol g1Pt h1。此外，强铂-锡相互作用和Si-beta框架中锡的限制防止了铂簇的焦炭和聚集，即使在550°C下运行四个周期后，催化剂的稳定性仍保持不变，活性也未显著下降。
