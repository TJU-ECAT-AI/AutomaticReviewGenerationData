[1] "Propylene is the raw material for polypropylene, and the FCC unit can be one of the main sources to form propylene (the other would be steam cracking of naphtha)."
[2] "It illustrates the clear expected increase in the propylene demand, which cannot be absorbed by steam cracking alone, and has to come from the FCC unit."
[3] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 13, the world market for gasoline seems to flatten out, and developing countries and even the USA show an increasing demand for diesel as a transportation fuel."
[4] "Historically, the USA had a surplus in diesel, and the EU had a surplus in gasoline, which could be traded. With the new gasoline/diesel demand ratios predicted for the next decades, this is no longer possible, and this will no doubt have an impact on the desired products from the FCC unit as the main conversion process."

In addressing the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method. It effectively tackles several challenges posed by conventional production methods:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH bypasses the need for heavy crude oil feedstocks, which are increasingly challenging to source due to environmental regulations and diminishing reserves. Instead, it utilizes abundant propane, a byproduct of natural gas processing or from petrochemical plants, as its primary feedstock.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH boasts high energy efficiency, consuming less energy than steam cracking and having a shorter process chain, which translates to lower costs and environmental footprints.

3. **Product Selectivity**: Unlike conventional methods, PDH selectively produces propylene with minimal byproducts. It directly converts propane to propylene through a dehydrogenation step, achieving high purity propylene output.

4. **Market Dynamics**: As indicated by the evolving gasoline/diesel demand landscape, traditional markets for gasoline are stabilizing or declining. This shift towards diesel and polypropylene highlights the potential mismatch between conventional production outputs and market needs. PDH aligns with this demand by focusing on propylene, a key ingredient in the growing polypropylene sector, without the need for complex blending with other fuels.

PDH technology thus represents a strategic shift in propylene production, leveraging abundant feedstocks, optimizing process efficiency, enhancing product selectivity, and aligning with evolving market demands.

针对全球日益增长的丙烯需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是最有前景的生产方法。它有效解决了传统生产方法面临的几个挑战：

1. **原料供应**：PDH跳过了需要重质原油作为原料的传统方式，这些原料由于环境法规和储量减少变得越来越难获取。相反，它利用天然气处理过程中产生的副产品或石化工厂的原料——丙烷作为主要原料。

2. **过程效率**：PDH在能源使用效率上表现出色，消耗的能量少于蒸汽裂解，并且具有较短的过程链，这意味着成本更低、环境影响更小。

3. **产品选择性**：与传统方法不同，PDH能够通过脱氢步骤直接将丙烷转化为纯度高的丙烯，产生较少的副产品。这使得PDH成为高纯度丙烯生产的理想选择。

4. **市场动态**：根据汽油与柴油需求的变化趋势，传统市场上汽油的供应趋于稳定或下降。这种转变表明，对于柴油和聚丙烯的需求正在增加，而传统生产输出可能无法满足这一需求。PDH则聚焦于丙烯，这是快速增长的聚丙烯行业所需的关键成分，无需复杂的与其他燃料混合。

因此，PDH技术代表了丙烯生产领域的战略转变，通过利用丰富原料、优化过程效率、增强产品选择性和顺应不断变化的市场需求，为满足全球丙烯需求提供了新的解决方案。
