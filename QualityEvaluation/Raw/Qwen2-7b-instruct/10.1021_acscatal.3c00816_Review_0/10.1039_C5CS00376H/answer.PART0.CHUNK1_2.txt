PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene, bypassing the traditional hydrocarbon cracking process. This method specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It utilizes readily available propane, a feedstock that is abundant and consistent, unlike some other volatile hydrocarbons. Additionally, PDH technology demonstrates higher process efficiency, reducing energy consumption and waste generation. Furthermore, it offers superior product selectivity, producing a higher yield of propylene with less byproducts compared to traditional methods. This makes PDH technology a more sustainable and economically viable solution for propylene production.
