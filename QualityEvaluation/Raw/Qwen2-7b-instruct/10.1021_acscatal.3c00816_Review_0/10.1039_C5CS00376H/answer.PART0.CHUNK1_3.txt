<p>Early work by Derouane and co-workers109 explains this effect. The authors describe the role of the curvature of the zeolite pore surface and explain that the interaction between molecules and the zeolite surface is strongest when the radius of the molecule and the surface curvature are similar. At this exact fit, a number of phenomena are described that have a direct effect on the performance, e.g. a supermobility instead of Knudsen diffusion.</p>
<p>The increased interaction leads to increased concentration of reactants near the acid sites, and expresses itself macroscopically as increased apparent acid strength. This implies that the 3D structure of the zeolite and its effect on sorption equilibria can play a large role in reaction kinetics; they directly influence the observed rate of reaction, especially when the sorption energetics are magnified by the surface curvature.</p>
<p>This implies that the decreased rate of cracking of n-hexane in MCM-41 as compared to zeolite US-Y does not necessarily mean that the acid sites in MCM-41 are weaker than those in zeolite US-Y.</p>
<p>Moliner et al.122 describe the synthesis of ITQ-39, a new zeolite with a three-directional channel system with interconnected large (12-MR) and medium pores (10-MR). The zeolite performs well in the alkylation of benzene to cumene. The authors claim the material would be a good additive for FCC since its pore system behaves as an intermediate between zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta.</p>
<p>There are other new or fairly recently described materials that could be of use for FCC, but these have not been extensively discussed, such as the 11-MR systems JU-64 (JSR125) and EMM-25,126 and the 12-MR system MCM-68 (MSE127).</p>
<p>Another observation made possible by this X-ray nano-tomography study was that valleys and nodules at the outer surface of the FCC catalyst particle were observed, which are similar to those seen in surface topography studies of E-cat samples. Fe was found to be distributed along these valleys and nodules, showing the largest amounts in the top 1 μm outer layer of the E-cat catalyst particle.</p>
<p>Bare and co-workers172 have been studying E-cat catalyst particles at both the ensemble and single particle level making use of a combination of X-ray micro- and nano-tomography as well as μ-XRF and μ-XRD. The X-ray micro- and nano-tomography were performed at respectively beamline 2-BM of the Advanced Photon Source and the X8C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source, whereas μ-XRF and μ-XRD data were acquired at beamline ID-D of the Advanced Photon Source.</p>
<p>It was found that a large fraction of the E-cat particles contained large internal voids, which certainly affect the particles' density, including their accessibility, and catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Da Silva et al.173 used a combination of phase-contrast X-ray micro-tomography and high-resolution ptychographic X-ray tomography to investigate a model FCC catalyst body, consisting of a mixture of 5% La2O3-exchanged zeolite Y and metakaolin, at the single particle level.</p>
<p>Fig. 25 illustrates the results as obtained with ptychographic X-ray tomography operating at a 3D spatial resolution of 39 nm. Fig. 25a shows a vertical slice of the electron-density tomogram for the FCC catalyst body. The two distinct material phases present can be clearly distinguished, and the upper and some lateral parts that appear brighter indicate some re-deposition of materials during the focused ion beam (FIB) milling of this model FCC catalyst particle.</p>
<p>Kalirai et al. have recently used synchrotron-based multi-element XRF tomography with a large array Maia detector to investigate the 3-D distributions of metal poisons (i.e., Fe, Ni, V and Ca) and structural markers (i.e., La and Ti) within individual, intact and industrially deactivated FCC catalyst particles at two different catalytic life-stages.</p>
<p>Buurmans, Ruiz-Martinez and coworkers175 have developed a set of selective staining reactions, which are catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, making it possible to localize zeolite aggregate domains with a confocal fluorescence microscope.</p>
<p>A statistical analysis of the fluorescence microscopy data obtained for the two sets of FCC catalyst materials (labeled as FCC1 and FCC2), originating from two different manufacturing routes, are shown in Fig. 28.</p>
<p>These findings have been corroborated by catalytic cracking activity measurements, as well as bulk XRD, IR spectroscopy after pyridine adsorption, TPD of ammonia and N2 physisorption measurements.</p>
<p>In a follow-up manuscript, Buurmans and co-workers176 have extended their selective staining approach of FCC catalyst particles for the determination of reactive zeolite ZSM-5 and Y aggregates within single FCC catalyst particles making use of 4-fluorostyrene and 4-methoxystyrene as probe molecules.</p>
<p>Sprung and Weckhuysen177 refined the confocal fluorescence microscopy approach for single FCC catalyst particles, containing ZSM-5, and determined the size, distribution, orientation and amount of zeolite ZSM-5 aggregates within binder material.</p>
<p>Ristanovic and co-workers178 have very recently reported the first application of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and the required data analysis methods to quantitatively investigate Brnsted acidity and related catalytic activity in a single FCC catalyst particle containing ZSM-5.</p>
<p>To selectively study the zeolite ZSM-5 domains within the FCC catalyst particles the oligomerization of furfuryl alcohol was used as a selective probe reaction.</p>
<p>By investigating a population of 15 FCC catalyst particles, after adsorption of pyridine, it has been possible to evaluate both Brnsted and Lewis acidity at the single particle level.</p>
<p>Finally, an integrated laser and electron microscope (iLEM) as a chemical imaging method, as demonstrated by Karreman and co-workers,180 and by combining fluorescence microscopy with Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) imaging, as explored by Buurmans, De Winter, and co-workers.181,182</p>

1. The PDH technology offers several key advantages compared to conventional propylene production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by directly utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more abundant and easier to obtain than the traditional oil-based sources. This makes the technology more sustainable and less dependent on volatile crude oil markets. Secondly, PDH technology enhances process efficiency, as it converts propane directly into propylene with high yields, bypassing the energy-intensive refining processes typically required for crude oil. Lastly, it improves product selectivity, as PDH allows for the precise control of the reaction conditions to maximize propylene production, leading to higher purity propylene output. These advantages collectively make PDH technology the most promising method for propylene production in the face of growing global demand.

2. The PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in several ways. In terms of feedstock availability, PDH can utilize abundant propane sources, which are more readily accessible and less prone to price fluctuations compared to crude oil. Process efficiency is improved because PDH directly converts propane to propylene, eliminating the need for multiple refining steps that are energy-intensive and costly. Product selectivity is enhanced as well, as PDH can be optimized to produce propylene with high purity, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring high-quality propylene. Overall, PDH technology provides a more sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production compared to traditional oil-based methods.
