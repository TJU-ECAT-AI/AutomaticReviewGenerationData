<p>In the early 1960's and 1970's, synthetic crystalline microporous aluminosilicates (i.e. zeolites) were invented at the laboratories of Union Carbide and Mobil Oil Corporation. The first of these relevant to FCC was synthetic faujasite (IUPAC structure code FAU), or zeolite Y (Linde Y), invented by Breck at Union Carbide. Zeolite Y in various improved forms has been the main cracking component of FCC catalysts since 1964.</p>
<p>Improvements in FCC catalyst materials have included the addition of rare earth elements and phosphorus to enhance stability and propylene selectivity. Phosphorous treatment often involves impregnation of solutions of phosphate sources, typically H3PO4, or the less acidic ammonium phosphates, followed by drying (70-120°C) and calcination (450-650°C) for 1 to 6 hours. This treatment enhances stability of the zeolite lattice, decreases the formation of bulky isomers, and increases the formation of light olefins.</p>
<p>The introduction of hierarchical pore systems, with mesopores and micropores connected, aims to improve selectivity and efficiency in the conversion process. This is achieved by altering the zeolite structure to facilitate better mass transfer and reaction pathways. Post-synthesis chemical treatments can introduce mesopores into the zeolite structure, affecting its activity and selectivity.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally. This contrasts with conventional methods that often rely on naphtha or other petrochemical feedstocks, which can be more expensive and less readily available.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH offers a more efficient process for propylene production compared to conventional methods. It directly converts propane to propylene through dehydrogenation, bypassing the need for intermediate cracking and reforming steps that are typical in traditional processes. This direct conversion results in higher yields and lower energy consumption.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH technology is designed to optimize propylene production by carefully controlling reaction conditions. This leads to a higher selectivity for propylene, with minimal byproducts or unwanted compounds, resulting in cleaner and more efficient propylene output.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional propylene production by offering a more accessible, efficient, and selective process for propylene synthesis from propane feedstock.
