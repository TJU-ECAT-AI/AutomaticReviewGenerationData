[1] "Propylene is a minor product (<5% product yield) in normal FCC operation, but selectivity towards propylene can be enhanced by selectively cracking gasoline range molecules."
[2] "Although increasing the riser temperature, increasing the catalyst-to-oil ratio, and increasing the residence time will increase the propylene yield, these options are limited."
[3] "Corma et al. show for cracking over Y-zeolites, that although propylene yield increases with conversion, propane yield increases faster, so the alkene/alkane ratio decreases at higher conversion."
[4] "This is because the wide pore system of FAU allows for bimolecular cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions."
[5] "In order to selectively produce lower olefins, refiners apply additives containing zeolite ZSM-5."
[6] "Zeolite ZSM-5 can be prepared both in the presence and absence of organic SDAs."
[7] "Although a partial destruction of the zeolite lattice may improve the diffusion characteristics of the zeolite by creating access to the interior through mesopores, this also creates larger pores, and hence the opportunity for bimolecular cracking."
[8] "To increase the stability of zeolite ZSM-5, a treatment with phosphorous is often applied."
[9] "The overall interaction between the phosphorous species and the zeolite lattice seems to be relatively independent of the phosphate source, although the overall effect of the treatment on activity strongly depends on parameters like Al/P ratio, Si/Al ratio, zeolite crystal size, and activation conditions."
[10] "The exact structure and position of these clusters, as well as mechanisms to form acid sites around these cluster remains as yet unsolved, although it is suggested that the bulky SAPO-species impede the formation of carbenium ions, and thus successfully suppress the bimolecular mechanism, resulting in an improved propylene selectivity for the treated samples."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology directly converts propane to propylene, bypassing the need for cracking and reforming processes that are typically required in conventional methods. This eliminates the intermediate steps of converting heavier feedstocks to lighter hydrocarbons, which enhances process efficiency and reduces energy consumption.

Secondly, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible propane from natural gas or refinery byproducts. This makes the process more flexible and responsive to fluctuations in feedstock supply, unlike conventional methods that rely heavily on crude oil as a feedstock, which can be more volatile and subject to price fluctuations and supply disruptions.

Thirdly, PDH technology improves product selectivity. Conventional production methods often struggle with achieving high propylene yields due to the complex chemical reactions involved and the potential for unwanted byproducts. PDH, on the other hand, is designed to selectively convert propane into propylene, thereby maximizing propylene yield and minimizing the production of other hydrocarbons.

In summary, PDH technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to enhance process efficiency, provide greater feedstock flexibility, and improve product selectivity. This makes it a valuable alternative to traditional production methods, particularly in the face of growing global demand for propylene.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面提供了几个关键优势，超越了传统生产方法。首先，PDH技术直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，跳过了传统方法中需要的裂解和重整过程。这消除了将较重的原料转化为较轻烃类的中间步骤，从而提高了工艺效率并减少了能源消耗。

其次，PDH技术解决了原料可用性的问题，利用天然气或炼油厂副产品中的易得丙烷作为原料。这使该过程更加灵活，能够应对原料供应波动，而传统的生产方法则严重依赖于原油作为原料，其价格波动和供应中断的风险更高。

第三，PDH技术改善了产品选择性。传统的生产方法往往难以实现高丙烯产量，因为涉及复杂的化学反应，可能产生其他烃类的副产品。相比之下，PDH技术专门设计用于选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而最大化丙烯产量并减少其他烃类的生产。

综上所述，PDH技术凭借其提高工艺效率、提供更大原料灵活性以及改善产品选择性的能力，成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法。这使其在面对全球对丙烯需求不断增长的情况下，成为传统生产方法的有效替代方案。
