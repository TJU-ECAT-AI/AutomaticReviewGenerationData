[1] "Apart from the conversion of heavier feedstocks, we have recently also seen an increased application of relatively light, paraffinic shale oil as the feedstock to the cracker."
[2] "So the traditional feedstock of FCC, namely VGO, is replaced more and more by both heavier and lighter feedstocks."
[3] "Where (aviation) gasoline was the desired product for the initial FCC units, we have seen an increased demand for propylene over the last two decades."
[4] "Propylene is the raw material for polypropylene, and the FCC unit can be one of the main sources to form propylene (the other would be steam cracking of naphtha)."
[5] "It illustrates the clear expected increase in the propylene demand, which cannot be absorbed by steam cracking alone, and has to come from the FCC unit."
[6] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 13, the world market for gasoline seems to flatten out, and developing countries and even the USA show an increasing demand for diesel as a transportation fuel."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH can utilize propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally. This diversifies the feedstock base beyond traditional oil refining byproducts, making it more resilient to fluctuations in conventional feedstock availability.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more energy-efficient process for propylene production compared to conventional methods. It bypasses the need for cracking heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins before converting them to propylene, which is typically done in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. This streamlined process reduces energy consumption and lowers operational costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH selectively converts propane to propylene, yielding a higher purity product with a higher propylene to propane ratio than those obtained from FCC or steam cracking of naphtha. This selective conversion enhances the value of the propylene produced, making it more suitable for downstream polypropylene production, which often requires high-purity propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology the most promising method for propylene production in response to the evolving demand patterns and the need for more efficient and flexible production processes.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的优势包括解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。PDH技术通过以下方式具体应对这些挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH可以使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料在全球范围内丰富且广泛可用。这使原料基础多样化，减少了对传统炼油副产品的依赖，使其更抗波动。

2. **过程效率**：与传统的裂解方法相比，PDH提供了更高效的丙烯生产过程。它跳过了将较重的碳氢化合物裂解为较轻的烯烃的步骤，然后将其转化为丙烯，通常在FCC单元中进行。这一简化的过程降低了能源消耗并降低了运营成本。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，产生的产品纯度更高，丙烯与丙烷的比例高于通过FCC或裂解石脑油得到的产品。这种选择性转化提高了所产丙烯的价值，更适合下游聚丙烯生产，通常需要高纯度丙烯。

这些优势使得PDH技术成为响应不断变化的需求模式和更高效、更灵活生产过程需求的最具前景的丙烯生产方法。
