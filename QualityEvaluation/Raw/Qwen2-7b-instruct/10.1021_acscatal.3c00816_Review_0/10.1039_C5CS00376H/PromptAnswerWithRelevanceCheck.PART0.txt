[1] "Propylene is a minor product (<5% product yield) in normal FCC operation, but selectivity towards propylene can be enhanced by selectively cracking gasoline range molecules."
[2] "Although increasing the riser temperature, increasing the catalyst-to-oil ratio, and increasing the residence time will increase the propylene yield, these options are limited."
[3] "Corma et al. show for cracking over Y-zeolites, that although propylene yield increases with conversion, propane yield increases faster, so the alkene/alkane ratio decreases at higher conversion."
[4] "This is because the wide pore system of FAU allows for bimolecular cracking and hydrogen transfer reactions."
[5] "In order to selectively produce lower olefins, refiners apply additives containing zeolite ZSM-5."
[6] "Zeolite ZSM-5 can be prepared both in the presence and absence of organic SDAs."
[7] "Although a partial destruction of the zeolite lattice may improve the diffusion characteristics of the zeolite by creating access to the interior through mesopores, this also creates larger pores, and hence the opportunity for bimolecular cracking."
[8] "To increase the stability of zeolite ZSM-5, a treatment with phosphorous is often applied."
[9] "The overall interaction between the phosphorous species and the zeolite lattice seems to be relatively independent of the phosphate source, although the overall effect of the treatment on activity strongly depends on parameters like Al/P ratio, Si/Al ratio, zeolite crystal size, and activation conditions."
[10] "The exact structure and position of these clusters, as well as mechanisms to form acid sites around these cluster remains as yet unsolved, although it is suggested that the bulky SAPO-species impede the formation of carbenium ions, and thus successfully suppress the bimolecular mechanism, resulting in an improved propylene selectivity for the treated samples."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology directly converts propane to propylene, bypassing the need for cracking and reforming processes that are typically required in conventional methods. This eliminates the intermediate steps of converting heavier feedstocks to lighter hydrocarbons, which enhances process efficiency and reduces energy consumption.

Secondly, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible propane from natural gas or refinery byproducts. This makes the process more flexible and responsive to fluctuations in feedstock supply, unlike conventional methods that rely heavily on crude oil as a feedstock, which can be more volatile and subject to price fluctuations and supply disruptions.

Thirdly, PDH technology improves product selectivity. Conventional production methods often struggle with achieving high propylene yields due to the complex chemical reactions involved and the potential for unwanted byproducts. PDH, on the other hand, is designed to selectively convert propane into propylene, thereby maximizing propylene yield and minimizing the production of other hydrocarbons.

In summary, PDH technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to enhance process efficiency, provide greater feedstock flexibility, and improve product selectivity. This makes it a valuable alternative to traditional production methods, particularly in the face of growing global demand for propylene.

[1] "Propylene is the raw material for polypropylene, and the FCC unit can be one of the main sources to form propylene (the other would be steam cracking of naphtha)."
[2] "It illustrates the clear expected increase in the propylene demand, which cannot be absorbed by steam cracking alone, and has to come from the FCC unit."
[3] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 13, the world market for gasoline seems to flatten out, and developing countries and even the USA show an increasing demand for diesel as a transportation fuel."
[4] "Historically, the USA had a surplus in diesel, and the EU had a surplus in gasoline, which could be traded. With the new gasoline/diesel demand ratios predicted for the next decades, this is no longer possible, and this will no doubt have an impact on the desired products from the FCC unit as the main conversion process."

<p>In the early 1960's and 1970's, synthetic crystalline microporous aluminosilicates (i.e. zeolites) were invented at the laboratories of Union Carbide and Mobil Oil Corporation. The first of these relevant to FCC was synthetic faujasite (IUPAC structure code FAU), or zeolite Y (Linde Y), invented by Breck at Union Carbide. Zeolite Y in various improved forms has been the main cracking component of FCC catalysts since 1964.</p>
<p>Improvements in FCC catalyst materials have included the addition of rare earth elements and phosphorus to enhance stability and propylene selectivity. Phosphorous treatment often involves impregnation of solutions of phosphate sources, typically H3PO4, or the less acidic ammonium phosphates, followed by drying (70-120°C) and calcination (450-650°C) for 1 to 6 hours. This treatment enhances stability of the zeolite lattice, decreases the formation of bulky isomers, and increases the formation of light olefins.</p>
<p>The introduction of hierarchical pore systems, with mesopores and micropores connected, aims to improve selectivity and efficiency in the conversion process. This is achieved by altering the zeolite structure to facilitate better mass transfer and reaction pathways. Post-synthesis chemical treatments can introduce mesopores into the zeolite structure, affecting its activity and selectivity.</p>

<p>Early work by Derouane and co-workers109 explains this effect. The authors describe the role of the curvature of the zeolite pore surface and explain that the interaction between molecules and the zeolite surface is strongest when the radius of the molecule and the surface curvature are similar. At this exact fit, a number of phenomena are described that have a direct effect on the performance, e.g. a supermobility instead of Knudsen diffusion.</p>
<p>The increased interaction leads to increased concentration of reactants near the acid sites, and expresses itself macroscopically as increased apparent acid strength. This implies that the 3D structure of the zeolite and its effect on sorption equilibria can play a large role in reaction kinetics; they directly influence the observed rate of reaction, especially when the sorption energetics are magnified by the surface curvature.</p>
<p>This implies that the decreased rate of cracking of n-hexane in MCM-41 as compared to zeolite US-Y does not necessarily mean that the acid sites in MCM-41 are weaker than those in zeolite US-Y.</p>
<p>Moliner et al.122 describe the synthesis of ITQ-39, a new zeolite with a three-directional channel system with interconnected large (12-MR) and medium pores (10-MR). The zeolite performs well in the alkylation of benzene to cumene. The authors claim the material would be a good additive for FCC since its pore system behaves as an intermediate between zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta.</p>
<p>There are other new or fairly recently described materials that could be of use for FCC, but these have not been extensively discussed, such as the 11-MR systems JU-64 (JSR125) and EMM-25,126 and the 12-MR system MCM-68 (MSE127).</p>
<p>Another observation made possible by this X-ray nano-tomography study was that valleys and nodules at the outer surface of the FCC catalyst particle were observed, which are similar to those seen in surface topography studies of E-cat samples. Fe was found to be distributed along these valleys and nodules, showing the largest amounts in the top 1 μm outer layer of the E-cat catalyst particle.</p>
<p>Bare and co-workers172 have been studying E-cat catalyst particles at both the ensemble and single particle level making use of a combination of X-ray micro- and nano-tomography as well as μ-XRF and μ-XRD. The X-ray micro- and nano-tomography were performed at respectively beamline 2-BM of the Advanced Photon Source and the X8C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source, whereas μ-XRF and μ-XRD data were acquired at beamline ID-D of the Advanced Photon Source.</p>
<p>It was found that a large fraction of the E-cat particles contained large internal voids, which certainly affect the particles' density, including their accessibility, and catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Da Silva et al.173 used a combination of phase-contrast X-ray micro-tomography and high-resolution ptychographic X-ray tomography to investigate a model FCC catalyst body, consisting of a mixture of 5% La2O3-exchanged zeolite Y and metakaolin, at the single particle level.</p>
<p>Fig. 25 illustrates the results as obtained with ptychographic X-ray tomography operating at a 3D spatial resolution of 39 nm. Fig. 25a shows a vertical slice of the electron-density tomogram for the FCC catalyst body. The two distinct material phases present can be clearly distinguished, and the upper and some lateral parts that appear brighter indicate some re-deposition of materials during the focused ion beam (FIB) milling of this model FCC catalyst particle.</p>
<p>Kalirai et al. have recently used synchrotron-based multi-element XRF tomography with a large array Maia detector to investigate the 3-D distributions of metal poisons (i.e., Fe, Ni, V and Ca) and structural markers (i.e., La and Ti) within individual, intact and industrially deactivated FCC catalyst particles at two different catalytic life-stages.</p>
<p>Buurmans, Ruiz-Martinez and coworkers175 have developed a set of selective staining reactions, which are catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, making it possible to localize zeolite aggregate domains with a confocal fluorescence microscope.</p>
<p>A statistical analysis of the fluorescence microscopy data obtained for the two sets of FCC catalyst materials (labeled as FCC1 and FCC2), originating from two different manufacturing routes, are shown in Fig. 28.</p>
<p>These findings have been corroborated by catalytic cracking activity measurements, as well as bulk XRD, IR spectroscopy after pyridine adsorption, TPD of ammonia and N2 physisorption measurements.</p>
<p>In a follow-up manuscript, Buurmans and co-workers176 have extended their selective staining approach of FCC catalyst particles for the determination of reactive zeolite ZSM-5 and Y aggregates within single FCC catalyst particles making use of 4-fluorostyrene and 4-methoxystyrene as probe molecules.</p>
<p>Sprung and Weckhuysen177 refined the confocal fluorescence microscopy approach for single FCC catalyst particles, containing ZSM-5, and determined the size, distribution, orientation and amount of zeolite ZSM-5 aggregates within binder material.</p>
<p>Ristanovic and co-workers178 have very recently reported the first application of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and the required data analysis methods to quantitatively investigate Brnsted acidity and related catalytic activity in a single FCC catalyst particle containing ZSM-5.</p>
<p>To selectively study the zeolite ZSM-5 domains within the FCC catalyst particles the oligomerization of furfuryl alcohol was used as a selective probe reaction.</p>
<p>By investigating a population of 15 FCC catalyst particles, after adsorption of pyridine, it has been possible to evaluate both Brnsted and Lewis acidity at the single particle level.</p>
<p>Finally, an integrated laser and electron microscope (iLEM) as a chemical imaging method, as demonstrated by Karreman and co-workers,180 and by combining fluorescence microscopy with Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) imaging, as explored by Buurmans, De Winter, and co-workers.181,182</p>

Advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is particularly suited for handling heavy feedstocks like tight oils and biomass-derived oxygenates, which are increasingly important given the trends towards heavier feedstocks and the growing demand for propylene. It offers higher process efficiency, as it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate liquid products, which reduces energy consumption and increases yield. Moreover, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with fewer impurities compared to traditional methods, which is crucial for meeting the stringent specifications required in various industries. Additionally, PDH technology is more flexible in terms of feedstock versatility, allowing for the utilization of unconventional and renewable resources that might not be suitable for conventional processes.

[1] "Apart from the conversion of heavier feedstocks, we have recently also seen an increased application of relatively light, paraffinic shale oil as the feedstock to the cracker."
[2] "So the traditional feedstock of FCC, namely VGO, is replaced more and more by both heavier and lighter feedstocks."
[3] "Where (aviation) gasoline was the desired product for the initial FCC units, we have seen an increased demand for propylene over the last two decades."
[4] "Propylene is the raw material for polypropylene, and the FCC unit can be one of the main sources to form propylene (the other would be steam cracking of naphtha)."
[5] "It illustrates the clear expected increase in the propylene demand, which cannot be absorbed by steam cracking alone, and has to come from the FCC unit."
[6] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 13, the world market for gasoline seems to flatten out, and developing countries and even the USA show an increasing demand for diesel as a transportation fuel."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH can utilize propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally. This diversifies the feedstock base beyond traditional oil refining byproducts, making it more resilient to fluctuations in conventional feedstock availability.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more energy-efficient process for propylene production compared to conventional methods. It bypasses the need for cracking heavier hydrocarbons into lighter olefins before converting them to propylene, which is typically done in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. This streamlined process reduces energy consumption and lowers operational costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH selectively converts propane to propylene, yielding a higher purity product with a higher propylene to propane ratio than those obtained from FCC or steam cracking of naphtha. This selective conversion enhances the value of the propylene produced, making it more suitable for downstream polypropylene production, which often requires high-purity propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology the most promising method for propylene production in response to the evolving demand patterns and the need for more efficient and flexible production processes.
