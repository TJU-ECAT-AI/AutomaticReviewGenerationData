Advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is particularly suited for handling heavy feedstocks like tight oils and biomass-derived oxygenates, which are increasingly important given the trends towards heavier feedstocks and the growing demand for propylene. It offers higher process efficiency, as it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate liquid products, which reduces energy consumption and increases yield. Moreover, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with fewer impurities compared to traditional methods, which is crucial for meeting the stringent specifications required in various industries. Additionally, PDH technology is more flexible in terms of feedstock versatility, allowing for the utilization of unconventional and renewable resources that might not be suitable for conventional processes.
