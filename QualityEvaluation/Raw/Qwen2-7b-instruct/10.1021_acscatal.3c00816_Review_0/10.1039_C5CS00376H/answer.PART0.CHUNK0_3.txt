<p>Propylene is a minor product (<5% product yield) in normal FCC operation, but selectivity towards propylene can be enhanced by selectively cracking gasoline range molecules.</p>
<p>Although increasing the riser temperature, increasing the catalyst-to-oil ratio, and increasing the residence time will increase the propylene yield,69 these options are limited.</p>
<p>To increase the stability of zeolite ZSM-5, a treatment with phosphorous is often applied. The trick has been used in ZSM-5 for various applications apart from FCC, such as methanol-to-olefins (MTO) conversion, alkylation, and ethanol dehydration.77</p>
<p>The overall interaction between the phosphorous species and the zeolite lattice seems to be relatively independent of the phosphate source, although the overall effect of the treatment on activity strongly depends on parameters like Al/P ratio, Si/Al ratio, zeolite crystal size, and activation conditions.77,78</p>
<p>Hansen et al.82 describe this can be tackled by a number of operational changes, such as minimizing the diesel fraction in the FCC feedstock, changing cutpoints and reducing the cracking severity. However, this leads to an increased coke formation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to change the FCC catalyst to a more diesel-selective catalyst. Hansen et al.82 describe that one option is to lower the zeolite content and increase matrix activity. However, this leads to an increased coke formation.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to introduce a hierarchical pore structure, in which mesopores and micropores are connected, in zeolites. A review on hierarchical zeolites is presented by Li et al.,83 while other recent reviews on hierarchical zeolites are those by Na et al., Moliner, and Serrano et al.8486</p>
<p>Li et al.83 describe, as summarized in Fig. 18, two approaches: bottom up, in which the hierarchical zeolite is synthesized directly from a silica-alumina gel, and top-down, in which existing zeolites are post-treated.</p>
<p>The authors stress the need for a sustainable route, and note that most bottom-up approaches make use of exotic ingredients or larger amounts of organic templates than the original materials. Top-down approaches typically have low yields because they leach away either alumina or silica, and thus give rise to waste-streams.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges primarily revolve around feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for a direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for cracking or reforming heavy feedstocks, which are often more expensive and less readily available than propane. This not only simplifies the production process but also enhances the economic viability by utilizing a more abundant feedstock.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges by offering a more efficient process compared to conventional methods. Traditional processes often rely on heavy crude oil or gas condensates as feedstocks, which require extensive refining and upgrading before propylene can be extracted. PDH, on the other hand, directly converts propane to propylene, thereby eliminating the need for these additional processing steps. This reduces the overall energy consumption and capital investment required for the production of propylene.

3. In terms of product selectivity, PDH technology demonstrates a high degree of selectivity towards propylene production. The process is designed to maximize the yield of propylene while minimizing the formation of byproducts, ensuring a high-quality output with minimal waste. This selective conversion is crucial for optimizing the production of propylene, which is a key intermediate in the manufacture of numerous chemical products, including polymers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals.

4. PDH technology also offers environmental benefits. By utilizing a cleaner feedstock and employing a more streamlined production process, PDH contributes to reduced emissions and lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods that may involve more complex and energy-intensive refining steps. This aligns with growing sustainability goals and regulations aimed at reducing carbon footprints and promoting cleaner energy sources.
