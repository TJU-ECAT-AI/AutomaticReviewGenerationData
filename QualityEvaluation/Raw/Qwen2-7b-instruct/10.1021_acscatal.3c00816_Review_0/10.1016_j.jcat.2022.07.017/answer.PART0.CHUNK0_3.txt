<p>Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability.</p>
<p>The mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) over such catalysts has been extensively studied. V5+/V4+ or V5+/V3+ redox cycle was considered to be important.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies were focused on PDH, and the recognition of effective VOx species needs to be further strengthened.</p>
<p>The nature of VOx species and its catalytic performance are related to vanadium precursor usage, additive introduction and preparation method.</p>
<p>In addition, the choice of support has been regarded as the key point influencing catalyst activity and product selectivity.</p>
<p>Hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) possessing medium mesopore and high specific surface area is especially suitable due to its prominent capacity in improving the active sites dispersion and enhancing the diffusion of reactants.</p>
<p>High amounts of vanadium could be well dispersed as VOx on the surface of HMS, and propylene yield was 1.2 times higher in comparison with SBA-15-based sample.</p>
<p>However, deep studies on VOx species in vanadium-based HMS catalysts are rare, and the specific active sites are still unclear.</p>
<p>To close such gaps, the present work aimed to study systematically the nature of VOx species and the catalytic performance of vanadium-based HMS catalysts in this reaction.</p>
<p>Typical catalyst of 8V-HMS with 8 wt% of vanadium on HMS exhibited 0.73 kg·h1·kgcat1 of propylene space time yield, and its initial activity could be well retained after regeneration for three cycles, which could all be attributed to the formation of VOx aggregates (mainly in low-polyvanadate form).</p>
<p>Based on temporal analysis of products, H2 formation is determined as the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction over V-HMS.</p>
<p>The evolution of propane dehydrogenation over the as-prepared catalysts was also studied.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to produce propylene efficiently with high selectivity and its potential for better process efficiency compared to conventional methods. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by traditional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It offers a direct conversion pathway from propane to propylene without the need for oxygen or water, which reduces the complexity and environmental impact of the process. Additionally, PDH can utilize a wider range of feedstocks, including unconventional sources of propane, making it more flexible and adaptable to varying market conditions. The high activity and selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts, particularly when supported on hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of PDH processes. The ability of these catalysts to regenerate well over multiple cycles also enhances the economic viability of PDH plants. The rate-limiting step in PDH over vanadium-based HMS catalysts is the formation of hydrogen (H2), which is crucial for understanding the reaction kinetics and optimizing the process conditions.

PDH技术的关键优势在于其能够高效地生产丙烯，并且具有与传统方法相比更高的过程效率。PDH特别解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。它提供了一条直接从丙烷到丙烯转化的途径，无需氧气或水，从而降低了过程的复杂性和环境影响。此外，PDH可以利用更广泛的原料，包括非传统来源的丙烷，使其在市场条件变化时更具灵活性和适应性。当在六方介孔二氧化硅（HMS）上负载的钒基催化剂表现出高活性和选择性时，这为PDH过程的效率和有效性做出了贡献。这些催化剂能够很好地再生，适用于多个周期，也有助于PDH工厂的经济可行性。PDH过程过HMS催化剂的限速步骤是氢（H2）的形成，这对于理解反应动力学并优化工艺条件至关重要。
