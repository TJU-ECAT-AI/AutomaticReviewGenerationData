In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on natural gas, PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock. Propane is widely available from natural gas processing, refinery byproducts, and renewable sources, providing a more flexible and potentially sustainable feedstock option.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient process for propylene production. It bypasses the energy-intensive steps involved in steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which require high temperatures and consume significant amounts of energy. PDH operates at lower temperatures, potentially reducing energy consumption and operational costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH is designed to selectively produce propylene with minimal by-product formation. This is crucial for downstream applications where propylene purity is essential. By minimizing by-products, PDH reduces the complexity and cost of purification processes required for other production methods.

By tuning the dispersion of VOx species on the surface of hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) through variation of vanadium loading, researchers have developed a catalyst that exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH. VOx species in low-polyvanadate form are deemed to be more active and stable, contributing to the catalyst's excellent regeneration stability. The rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction is established as hydrogen formation, indicating that the catalyst efficiently facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

This work provides a promising candidate for PDH technology, which will not only enhance propylene production efficiency and sustainability but also deepen our understanding of vanadium oxide species' role in propane activation.

考虑到全球丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战。PDH技术在以下方面特别解决了这些挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：与依赖天然气的传统方法不同，PDH利用丙烷作为原料。丙烷可以从天然气加工、炼油副产品和可再生能源中广泛获得，提供了一个更灵活且可能更加可持续的原料选项。

2. **过程效率**：PDH为丙烯生产提供了更高效的流程。它跳过了蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解等传统方法中的高能耗步骤，这些步骤需要高温和大量能源。PDH在较低温度下运行，可能降低能源消耗和运营成本。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH被设计为选择性地产生丙烯，同时尽可能减少副产品的形成。这对于下游应用至关重要，因为丙烯纯度对于这些应用来说是必需的。通过减少副产品的形成，PDH降低了其他生产方法所需的复杂性和成本。

通过调整表面范德华氧化物（VOx）物种在六方介孔二氧化硅（HMS）上的分散性，研究人员开发了一种催化剂，该催化剂在PDH中表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性。在低聚合度的VOx物种形式中被认为更加活跃和稳定，这有助于催化剂的优秀再生稳定性。PDH反应的限速步骤被确定为氢的生成，这表明催化剂有效地促进了脱氢过程。

这项工作提供了一个PDH技术的有希望的候选者，不仅将增强丙烯生产效率和可持续性，还将加深我们对丙烷激活中VOx物种作用的理解。
