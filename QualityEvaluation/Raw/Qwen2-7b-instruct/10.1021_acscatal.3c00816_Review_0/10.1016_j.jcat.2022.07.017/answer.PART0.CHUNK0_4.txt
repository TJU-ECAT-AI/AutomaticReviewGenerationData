[1] "Driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention."
[2] "Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability."
[3] "The mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) over such catalysts has been extensively studied."
[4] "The nature of VOx species and its catalytic performance are related to vanadium precursor usage, additive introduction and preparation method."
[5] "The structure of VOx species could be modulated by the kind of support through variation of texture property, acidity and vanadium-support interaction, which could tune the polymerization degree of VOx."
[6] "Silica-based materials are typically used as supports for preparing selective PDH catalysts as they do not possess acidic sites which are considered to negatively affect selectivity due to coke formation."
[7] "Hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS) possessing medium mesopore and high specific surface area is especially suitable due to its prominent capacity in improving the active sites dispersion and enhancing the diffusion of reactants."
[8] "High amounts of vanadium could be well dispersed as VOx on the surface of HMS, and propylene yield was 1.2 times higher in comparison with SBA-15-based sample."
[9] "The nature of VOx species and its catalytic performance are related to vanadium precursor usage, additive introduction and preparation method."
[10] "It was found that some additives, such as P and Mg, can adjust the surface acidity and interaction between VOx species and support, which would further affect catalytic performance."
[11] "The rate-limiting step in the course of PDH was established by H2 formation."
[12] "In-situ DRIFTS results suggest that VOx-C3H5 species is an important intermediate which was observed both in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has gained significant attention due to its potential to address challenges in propylene production, including feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

2.Vanadium-based catalysts offer superior activity and selectivity for propylene production compared to platinum- and chromium-based catalysts, along with good regeneration capability.

3.Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) mechanisms have been extensively studied over vanadium-based catalysts.

4.Vanadium precursor usage, additive introduction, and preparation method significantly influence the nature of VOx species and their catalytic performance.

5.The structure of VOx species can be adjusted by varying the type of support, impacting its texture property, acidity, and vanadium-support interaction, which tunes the polymerization degree of VOx.

6.Silica-based materials, particularly hexagonal mesoporous SiO2 (HMS), are preferred for selective PDH catalysts due to their absence of acidic sites that could negatively affect selectivity.

7.HMS, with its medium mesopore and high specific surface area, enhances active site dispersion and reactant diffusion, leading to improved propylene yield.

8.High dispersion of vanadium as VOx on the HMS surface results in a 1.2 times higher propylene yield compared to SBA-15-based samples.

9.The relationship between vanadium precursor usage, additive introduction, and preparation method plays a crucial role in determining the nature of VOx species and their catalytic performance.

10.Additives like phosphorus and magnesium can modify the surface acidity and interaction between VOx species and support, affecting the catalytic performance.

11.Hydrogen formation is identified as the rate-limiting step in the PDH reaction over vanadium-based HMS catalysts.

12.VOx-C3H5 species, detected through in-situ DRIFTS, acts as an important intermediate in both propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation processes.

13.Further conversion of VOx-C3H5 results in the formation of either gas-phase propylene or coke.
