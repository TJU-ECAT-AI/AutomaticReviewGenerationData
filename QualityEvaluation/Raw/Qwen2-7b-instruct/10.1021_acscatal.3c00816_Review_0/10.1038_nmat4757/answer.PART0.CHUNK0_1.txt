Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as the sole feedstock, which is widely available and abundant in many regions. This reduces dependence on more limited resources compared to conventional methods that often require additional processing steps to convert other hydrocarbons into propylene.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH technology typically operates at high temperatures, enabling the direct conversion of propane to propylene with high yields and selectivity. This results in a more efficient process compared to conventional methods, which may involve multiple steps with lower overall yields and selectivities.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers better product selectivity, meaning that it can produce propylene with minimal byproducts. This improves the purity of the propylene output, which is crucial for various downstream applications, particularly in the petrochemical industry where high-purity propylene is required.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology enhances the economic viability and environmental sustainability of propylene production, making it a preferred choice in the chemical industry.

面对丙烯日益增长的全球需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需中间产品。这种技术通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH技术仅使用丙烷作为原料，该原料在全球范围内广泛且充足。这减少了对更有限资源的依赖，与传统方法相比，这些方法往往需要额外的步骤来将其他烃类转化为丙烯。

2. **工艺效率**：PDH技术通常在高温下运行，能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时保持高产率和选择性。相比之下，传统方法可能涉及多个步骤，总体产率和选择性较低。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术提供了更好的产品选择性，意味着它可以产生纯净的丙烯，几乎没有副产品。这对于各种下游应用尤为重要，尤其是化学工业中需要高度纯净的丙烯。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术提高了丙烯生产的经济性和环境可持续性，使其成为化工行业首选的选择。
