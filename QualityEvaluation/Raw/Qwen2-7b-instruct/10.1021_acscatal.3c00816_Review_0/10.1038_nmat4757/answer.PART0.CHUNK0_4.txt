Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out for its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products. This method addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in several key ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant and widely available propane as its feedstock, offering a reliable supply compared to the more volatile and less abundant ethane used in steam cracking, another common propylene production method.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are generally more energy-efficient and produce less waste than traditional methods. The direct conversion of propane to propylene minimizes the steps required, reducing the potential for energy losses and environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technologies can offer better control over the product selectivity, producing a higher yield of propylene with minimal byproducts. This is particularly advantageous in refining operations where propylene demand is high and the need for purity is critical.

By leveraging these advantages, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional methods related to feedstock scarcity, inefficiency, and environmental impact, making it a promising approach for propylene production.

面对丙烯日益增长的全球需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术以其能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯而无需中间产品的能力脱颖而出。这种方法在以下几个关键方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH技术利用广泛且易得的丙烷作为原料，提供了可靠的供应，与另一种常见的丙烯生产方法蒸汽裂解相比，其原料更为稳定且丰富。

2. **工艺效率**：与传统方法相比，PDH过程通常更节能且产生的废物更少。直接将丙烷转化为丙烯减少了步骤，降低了能量损失和环境影响的可能性。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术可以提供更好的产品选择性控制，产生高纯度的丙烯，同时减少副产品的产生。这对于精炼操作来说尤为重要，因为丙烯的需求高且纯度要求严格。

通过利用这些优势，PDH技术解决了传统方法中与原料稀缺、效率低下和环境影响相关的挑战，使其成为丙烯生产的一个有前景的方法。
