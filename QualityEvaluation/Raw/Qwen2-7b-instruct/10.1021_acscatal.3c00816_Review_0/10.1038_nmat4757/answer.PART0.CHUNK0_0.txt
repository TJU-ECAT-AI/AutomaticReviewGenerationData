In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: Propane is abundant and widely available globally, making it a viable feedstock for propylene production. Unlike traditional methods that rely on naphtha, PDH utilizes propane, which is readily accessible from natural gas liquids (NGLs).

2. Process efficiency: PDH technology is highly efficient, enabling the conversion of propane to propylene with high yields. This efficiency reduces energy consumption and waste generation compared to conventional methods, which often involve multiple stages and consume significant amounts of energy.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology offers improved product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts. This purity enhances the value of the propylene produced and reduces the need for further purification steps, which are often required in traditional production methods.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology represents a significant advancement in propylene production, offering a cleaner, more efficient, and more sustainable alternative to conventional methods.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法的关键优势在于其能够解决与原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性相关的挑战。PDH技术以以下方式特别解决了这些挑战：

1. 原料供应：丙烷在全球范围内丰富且易得，使其成为丙烯生产的理想原料。与依赖石脑油的传统方法不同，PDH利用丙烷，后者可以从天然气液体（NGLs）中获得。

2. 过程效率：PDH技术具有高度的效率，能够将丙烷高效转化为丙烯，同时产生高产率。与传统方法相比，这种效率降低了能源消耗和废物产生，而传统方法通常涉及多个阶段并消耗大量能源。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术提供了改进的产品选择性，能够产生高纯度的丙烯，同时产生的副产品极少。这种纯度提高了所生产丙烯的价值，并减少了进一步精制步骤的需求，这是传统生产方法通常需要的。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术代表了丙烯生产领域的一个重大进步，提供了一个更清洁、更高效、更可持续的替代传统方法的选择。
