[1] "Main The unique catalytic properties of metal clusters have attracted great attention because they have a behaviour that is distinct from metal nanoparticles (NPs) and mononuclear metal compounds1,2. However, the stability of metal clusters can be a limitation for their applications in heterogeneous catalysis at higher temperatures."
[2] "Loading atomically dispersed metal species on solid supports can be a method to improve their stability3,4. In this respect, because of their high thermal stability and confinement effects, zeolite materials appear as promising supports for preparing supported metal clusters5."
[3] "In this work, we present a new strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite with exceptional high stability, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. Pt single atoms and clusters are stable after calcination in air at 540C and under reaction conditions."
[4] "This new method provides a possibility for the generation of highly stable subnanometric metal catalysts for high-temperature catalytic reactions in pure siliceous zeolites."
[5] "In the case of the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample prepared by the impregnation method, most of Pt NPs (1  5nm) should be located only at the external surface."
[6] "Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reactionregeneration cycles at high temperature41."
[7] "Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional methods are its ability to address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on naphtha as a primary feedstock, which faces issues with decreasing availability and increasing prices. PDH technology, on the other hand, uses propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and inexpensive. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability. 

In terms of process efficiency, PDH technology allows for a more streamlined production process compared to traditional methods that involve multiple steps including steam cracking and fractional distillation. PDH bypasses the need for cracking naphtha into lighter hydrocarbons, thus reducing the overall energy consumption and potentially lowering the environmental impact.

Regarding product selectivity, PDH technology is designed to produce high-purity propylene, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. Traditional methods may yield mixtures of hydrocarbons that require further separation, leading to higher costs and energy usage. PDH technology ensures a high selectivity towards propylene, optimizing the yield and minimizing waste.

Moreover, PDH technology facilitates frequent reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperatures, making it suitable for continuous operation in industrial settings. This is particularly evident in the case of the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, which shows exceptional stability even after multiple cycles of propane dehydrogenation, retaining a high level of activity compared to conventional impregnated catalysts. This stability is crucial for maintaining high productivity and minimizing maintenance requirements.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective approach to propylene production, addressing key challenges faced by traditional methods.
