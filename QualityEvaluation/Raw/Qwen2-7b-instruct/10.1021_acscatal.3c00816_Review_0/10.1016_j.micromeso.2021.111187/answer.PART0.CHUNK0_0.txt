The study highlights that hydrogen pre-reduction affects the performance of cobalt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). At lower temperatures (650-700°C), the catalyst undergoes a multistage migration of framework Co2+ ions into extraframework Co0 species, which leads to improved reaction rates and propylene selectivity compared to unreduced catalysts. However, at higher temperatures (750-800°C), this process results in the formation of large Co particles, causing a decline in reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and severe coke deposition. The study also indicates that hydrogen pre-reduction influences the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, affecting the overall performance of the PDH reactions, including propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation.

研究强调了氢预还原对丙烷脱氢（PDH）催化剂性能的影响。在较低温度（650-700°C）下，催化剂经历框架Co2+离子向额外框架Co0物种的多阶段迁移，这导致与未处理催化剂相比，选择性PDH反应的反应速率和丙烯选择性得到改善。然而，在较高温度（750-800°C）下，这一过程导致形成大颗粒Co，从而引起反应速率、丙烯选择性和严重焦油沉积的下降。研究还表明，氢预还原调节了钴物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用，影响PDH反应的整体性能，包括丙烷活化、丙烯脱附和焦油形成。
