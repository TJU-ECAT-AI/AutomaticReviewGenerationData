• "Multistage migration of framework Co2+ into extraframework Co0 species can be achieved by the prereduction."
• "The catalysts reduced at 650700 C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst."
• "A higher prereduction temperature of 750800 C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition."
• "Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption and coke formation for the Cocatalyzed PDH reactions."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, which addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include limited feedstock availability, low process efficiency, and poor product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these issues by utilizing a highly active catalyst system, such as cobalt-based catalysts on mesoporous materials like MCM-41, which can effectively activate propane, enhance propylene selectivity, and minimize coke formation during the reaction. The use of hydrogen pre-reduction in the preparation of the catalyst modifies the interaction between cobalt species and the silica support, optimizing the catalytic performance for the PDH reaction. This results in improved reaction rates, selectivity towards propylene, and reduced coke formation compared to unreduced catalysts. The multistage migration of framework cobalt ions to extraframework cobalt species during the pre-reduction process is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic activity and propylene yield.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的优点是它能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。这些挑战包括有限的原料可用性、低过程效率和产品选择性差。PDH技术通过使用高度活性的催化剂系统，如基于钴的催化剂与介孔材料（如MCM-41）相结合，有效地激活丙烷，提高丙烯选择性，并减少反应过程中焦炭的形成，从而针对性地解决了这些问题。氢预还原在催化剂制备中的应用，通过调整钴物种与二氧化硅支持物之间的相互作用，优化了PDH反应的催化性能。这导致了比未还原催化剂更高的反应速率、丙烯产率以及焦炭形成的减少。预还原过程中框架钴离子向额外框架钴物种的多阶段迁移对于实现最佳催化活性和丙烯产量至关重要。
