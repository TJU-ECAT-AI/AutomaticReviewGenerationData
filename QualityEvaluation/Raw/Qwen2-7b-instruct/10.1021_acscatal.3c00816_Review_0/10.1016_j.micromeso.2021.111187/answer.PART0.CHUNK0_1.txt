<p>The catalysts reduced at 650-700°C are consisting of both framework Co2+ ions and small-size Co0 nanoclusters confined in the MCM41 channels, displaying 23 times higher reaction rates in the selective PDH reactions in comparison with the unreduced catalyst.</p>
<p>A higher prereduction temperature of 750-800°C causes the formation of large Co particles that are responsible for significantly declined reaction rates and propylene selectivity as well as severe coke deposition.</p>
<p>Hydrogen prereduction tunes the interaction between Co species and silica support, determining the performances of propane activation, propylene desorption, and coke formation for the Co-catalyzed PDH reactions.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as discussed in the literature, are its potential to efficiently produce propylene with high product selectivity and lower energy consumption compared to conventional methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. The use of hydrogen prereduction in cobalt catalysts (Co@MCM-41) enhances the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. This is achieved through the multistage migration of framework Co2+ ions into extraframework Co0 species, leading to an optimal size of Co0 clusters with moderate interaction with the silica support. The literature highlights that a balance in the interaction strength between cobalt species and the silica support is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and minimal coke formation during the PDH reactions.

文献中讨论的丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势是其有可能高效地生产丙烯，同时具有高产品选择性和较低的能量消耗，与传统方法相比。PDH技术通过使用作为原料的丙烷来解决原材料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。通过在二氧化硅支持下的钴催化剂（Co@MCM-41）中进行氢前处理，可以增强催化活性和丙烯选择性。这通过框架Co2+离子的多阶段迁移进入额外框架Co0物种实现，导致形成适度与二氧化硅支持相互作用的Co0簇。文献强调了钴物种与二氧化硅支持之间的相互作用强度的平衡对于实现高丙烯选择性和最小的焦炭形成期间PDH反应至关重要。
