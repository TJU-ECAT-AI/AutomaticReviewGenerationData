The study highlights the effectiveness of hydrogen pre-reduction in enhancing the performance of Co@MCM41 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. This technique enables the migration of framework Co2+ ions into extraframework Co0 species, leading to improved reaction rates and selectivity. The catalysts treated at temperatures of 650-700°C show optimal performance due to the presence of both Co2+ ions and small Co0 clusters within the MCM41 channels. Conversely, higher pre-reduction temperatures result in the formation of larger Co particles, which negatively impact reaction rates, propylene selectivity, and increase coke formation. By tuning the interaction between Co species and the silica support through hydrogen pre-reduction, the catalysts can achieve better propane activation, propylene desorption, and reduced coke formation, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

研究强调了氢预还原在提高Co@MCM41催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产丙烯的性能方面的有效性。这种技术使框架Co2+离子迁移到额外的Co0物种中，导致反应速率和选择性的改善。温度为650-700°C处理的催化剂由于在MCM41通道内存在两种Co2+离子和小型Co0簇而表现出最优性能。相反，较高的预还原温度会导致较大Co粒子的形成，这会负面影响反应速率、丙烯选择性和增加焦炭沉积。通过氢预还原调节Co物种与硅酸盐支持物之间的相互作用，催化剂可以实现更好的丙烷激活、丙烯脱附和减少焦炭形成，从而解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
