[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."
[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."
[4] "While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt."
[5] "Ceria (CeO2) supports are unique in their ability to trap Pt atoms in ionic form, facilitating redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens."
[6] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are very stable, even during extended reaction at 680C. Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."
[7] "Upon oxidation, the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: The abundance of shale gas deposits has made propane more readily available, making PDH technology viable for propylene production from a plentiful resource.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By dehydrogenating propane directly, PDH technology bypasses the need for multiple processing steps compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: Traditional methods often suffer from low selectivity for propylene due to the endothermic nature of the reaction requiring high temperatures. PDH technology, especially when using ceria-supported platinum-tin clusters, ensures high selectivity towards propylene by efficiently converting propane without the unwanted side reactions.

4. **Catalyst Stability and Redispersibility**: Ceria (CeO2) as a support enables the trapping of ionic platinum (Pt) atoms, ensuring stable and redispersible catalysts. This is particularly advantageous as it allows for the restoration of Pt's atomic dispersion without the use of corrosive halogens, enhancing the catalyst's longevity and efficiency.

5. **Suppression of Coke Formation**: The addition of water vapor to the feed stream during the PDH process helps to suppress coke formation, a common issue with high-temperature reactions. This ensures a cleaner reaction environment and maintains the catalyst's performance over extended periods.

6. **Regenerability**: Upon oxidation, the ceria-supported PtSn clusters readily revert to their atomically dispersed state, making them fully regenerable. This feature significantly reduces the operational costs associated with catalyst replacement or regeneration, making PDH technology economically attractive.

By leveraging these advantages, PDH technology provides a sustainable and efficient solution for propylene production, addressing the escalating demand for this critical chemical building block in the petrochemical industry.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面提供了几个关键优势，以应对传统方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：由于页岩气储量丰富，丙烷变得更为充裕，为PDH技术提供了可行的原料来源。

2. **过程效率**：通过直接脱氢丙烷，PDH技术可以绕过与传统方法相比需要的多个加工步骤，可能降低成本并提高效率。

3. **产品选择性**：传统方法在高温度下进行脱氢反应时，往往存在低选择性的问题。PDH技术，特别是使用铈氧化物支持的铂-锡簇，能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时避免了不必要的副反应。

4. **催化剂稳定性与再分散性**：铈氧化物（CeO2）作为支持物能够捕获离子型铂（Pt）原子，确保稳定且可再分散的催化剂。这一特性特别有利于在不使用腐蚀性卤素的情况下恢复Pt的原子分散状态，从而提升催化剂的寿命和效率。

5. **抑制焦炭形成**：向反应流中添加水蒸气有助于抑制焦炭形成，这是高温反应中常见的问题。这确保了反应环境的清洁，并维持了催化剂的性能长达数月之久。

6. **再生性**：在氧化后，铈氧化物支持的PtSn簇可轻易恢复到其原子分散状态，使其具有完全再生能力。这一特性显著降低了催化剂更换或再生操作的成本，使PDH技术在经济上更具吸引力。

通过利用这些优势，PDH技术提供了一种可持续和高效的丙烯生产解决方案，满足了这一重要化学基础材料日益增长的需求。
