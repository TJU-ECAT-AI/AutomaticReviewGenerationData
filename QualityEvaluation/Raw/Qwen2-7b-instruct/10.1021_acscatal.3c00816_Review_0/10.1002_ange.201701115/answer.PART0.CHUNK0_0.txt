[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."
[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."
[4] "Pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2 (3wt% Sn) were also tested for propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions (680C). No dehydrogenation and decomposition reactivity was found on pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2."
[5] "Adding Sn to the Pt single-atom catalyst modifies the selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier."
[6] "Formation of small PtSn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high selectivity towards propylene because of facile desorption of the product."
[7] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."
[8] "Upon oxidation, the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods. It specifically addresses:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant shale gas deposits to produce propylene, which is more accessible compared to traditional methods relying on specific oil fractions.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By converting light alkanes directly into propylene, PDH bypasses the need for additional refining processes, enhancing overall efficiency and reducing costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The introduction of tin (Sn) to the catalyst system enables high selectivity towards propylene production. This results in a more targeted output, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts such as methane and carbon dioxide.

4. **Catalyst Stability and Redispersibility**: The ceria (CeO2) support ensures stable and redispersible PtSn clusters, even at high temperatures, preventing catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. This stability allows for the use of water vapor to suppress coke formation, facilitating efficient operation without the need for aggressive regeneration conditions.

5. **Regenerability**: The ability to revert the PtSn clusters back to atomically dispersed species upon oxidation makes the catalyst fully regenerable, reducing the need for costly and potentially harmful halogen treatments.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术通过解决传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战，尤其是以下几个方面：

1. **原料供应**：PDH利用大量页岩气储量来生产丙烯，相比依赖特定原油组分的传统方法，原料获取更加便捷且丰富。

2. **工艺效率**：通过将轻烷烃直接转化为丙烯，PDH跳过了额外精炼过程，提高了整体效率并降低了成本。

3. **产品选择性**：在催化剂体系中引入锡（Sn）能够实现高选择性向丙烯的生产。这导致了更精确的产出，最大限度地减少了甲烷和二氧化碳等副产品的生成。

4. **催化剂稳定性和再分散性**：氧化铈（CeO2）支持确保了铂锡（PtSn）簇的稳定性和再分散性，即使在高温下也能防止催化剂失活，通过使用水蒸气来抑制焦炭形成，实现了高效运行，无需使用苛刻的再生条件。

5. **可再生性**：催化剂在氧化后能够恢复到原子分散状态的能力使其完全可再生，减少了需要昂贵且可能有害的卤化物处理的成本。
