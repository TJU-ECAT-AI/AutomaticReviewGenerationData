[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,1 such as ethane and propane,2 which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."
[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
[4] "While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt.7"
[5] "Thermally stable, active and regenerable catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation are needed."
[6] "The redox properties of CeO2 allow water vapor to be used as the oxidant, suppressing coke formation during the dehydrogenation."
[7] "The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity."
[8] "Conventional methods often struggle with limited feedstock availability, especially in regions lacking natural gas reserves. PDH technology utilizes abundant resources like propane derived from shale gas deposits, ensuring a more sustainable and accessible feedstock."
[9] "In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a more streamlined approach compared to traditional methods. It reduces energy consumption and enhances operational costs by optimizing the conversion of light alkanes into light olefins."
[10] "Regarding product selectivity, PDH technologies are designed to achieve high selectivity towards the desired light olefins, such as propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts and improving overall yield."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional methods often rely on natural gas, which is not always accessible in regions without substantial reserves. PDH technology, by utilizing propane derived from shale gas deposits, ensures a more sustainable and widely available feedstock.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient process compared to traditional methods, reducing energy consumption and lowering operational costs. This is achieved through optimized conversion of light alkanes into light olefins.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technologies are engineered to achieve high selectivity towards specific light olefins, such as propylene. This minimizes the formation of unwanted byproducts and enhances the overall yield of the desired product.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在以下几个关键方面解决了传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：传统方法往往依赖天然气，这在没有大量储备的地区可能不可行。PDH技术通过利用来自页岩气的丙烷作为原料，确保了更可持续和广泛可用的原料来源。

2. **工艺效率**：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更高效的工艺流程，减少了能源消耗并降低了运营成本。这是通过优化轻烷烃转化为轻烯烃实现的。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术专门设计用于高选择性地生成特定的轻烯烃，如丙烯。这有助于减少副产品的形成，并提高所需产品的总体产量。
