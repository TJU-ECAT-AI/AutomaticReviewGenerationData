[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,1 such as ethane and propane,2 which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."
[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."
[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6"
[4] "While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt.7"
[5] "CeO2 supports are unique in their ability to trap Pt atoms in ionic form.10 The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens."
[6] "Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."
[7] "Formation of small PtSn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high selectivity towards propylene because of facile desorption of the product."
[8] "The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are very stable, even during extended reaction at 680C."
[9] "Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed."
[10] "Upon oxidation the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to efficiently produce propylene from abundant feedstocks, specifically propane, which is derived from shale gas deposits. PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: By utilizing propane, PDH leverages a plentiful and cost-effective feedstock compared to traditional methods that often rely on more expensive and less available sources of olefins. Shale gas deposits provide a reliable supply of propane, enhancing the economic viability of propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH technology operates at high temperatures to dehydrogenate propane into propylene. This process is optimized to achieve economically attractive yields, making it competitive with other olefin production methods. The use of catalysts, particularly those that can be easily redispersed and regenerated, contributes to the efficiency of the process.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The introduction of tin (Sn) into the catalyst system transforms isolated single atoms of platinum (Pt) into PtSn clusters. This modification enhances the selectivity of the catalyst towards propylene production. The PtSn clusters allow for the facile desorption of propylene, reducing unwanted side reactions and improving the purity of the propylene product.

4. **Reduction of Coke Formation**: By incorporating water vapor into the feed, PDH technology significantly reduces the formation of coke, a common byproduct that can lead to catalyst deactivation in conventional dehydrogenation processes. This reduces maintenance costs and extends the operational life of the catalyst.

5. **Regenerability**: The ability of the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst to be redispersed upon mild oxidative regeneration, without the need for corrosive halogens, ensures the catalyst's longevity and economic sustainability. This feature makes the catalyst fully regenerable, minimizing waste and operational expenses.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient, selective, and sustainable process for propylene production, leveraging abundant propane feedstocks and advanced catalyst systems that minimize coke formation and facilitate catalyst regeneration.

在丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术中，关键优势在于它能够高效地从大量可用的原料气（如页岩气衍生的丙烷）生产轻烯烃。PDH技术通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **原料供应**：通过利用丙烷作为原料，PDH技术依赖于页岩气中的丰富和成本效益高的原料，相比传统的以更昂贵且供应有限的原料生产轻烯烃的方法更具竞争力。

2. **过程效率**：在高温下对丙烷进行脱氢以生产丙烯，PDH技术优化了过程以实现经济上吸引人的产量。催化剂的有效使用，特别是那些易于分散和再生的催化剂，有助于提高过程的效率。

3. **产品选择性**：将锡（Sn）引入催化剂系统中，可将孤立的铂（Pt）单原子转化为PtSn簇。这种修改提高了催化剂对丙烯生产的选择性。PtSn簇允许丙烯的简便脱附，减少不必要的副反应，提高丙烯产品的纯度。

4. **减少焦炭形成**：通过在原料中加入水蒸气，PDH技术显著减少了焦炭的形成，这是传统脱氢过程中常见的一种副产品，可能导致催化剂失效。这减少了维护成本并延长了催化剂的使用寿命。

5. **可再生性**：催化剂能够在温和的氧化再生过程中重新分散，无需腐蚀性卤素，确保了催化剂的持久性和经济可持续性。这一特性使催化剂完全可再生，减少了废物和运营成本。

综上所述，PDH技术通过提供更高效、选择性和可持续的生产方法来解决传统生产方法的挑战，利用丰富的丙烷原料，并采用先进的催化剂系统来最小化焦炭形成和促进催化剂再生，从而实现丙烯生产。
