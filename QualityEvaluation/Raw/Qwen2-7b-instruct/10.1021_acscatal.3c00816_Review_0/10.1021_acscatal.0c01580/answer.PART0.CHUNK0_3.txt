[1] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising technologies for propylene production due to its high yield, energy efficiency, and low environmental impact."
[2] "The challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as steam cracking, include limited feedstock availability, low product selectivity, and high energy consumption."
[3] "PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more abundant and less expensive than ethane, and by achieving higher product selectivity and lower energy consumption compared to traditional methods."

PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it offers a high yield, energy efficiency, and low environmental impact. Conventional production methods, like steam cracking, struggle with limited feedstock availability, low product selectivity, and high energy consumption. PDH technology overcomes these challenges by using propane, a more abundant and cheaper feedstock, and by achieving higher product selectivity and lower energy consumption.
