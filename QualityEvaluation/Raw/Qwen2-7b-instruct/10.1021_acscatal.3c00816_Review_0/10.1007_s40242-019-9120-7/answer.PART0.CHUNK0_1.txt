[1] "The effect of different contents of TS-1 on PDH was investigated, and the optimal amount of TS-1 was determined to be 10%."
[2] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the document, is its superior catalytic performance in producing propylene. This technology specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, offering a more reliable source compared to traditional methods that might rely on less accessible or fluctuating raw materials.
   
2. **Process Efficiency**: The document emphasizes the importance of catalyst optimization, particularly in the use of a novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16. This composite enhances mass transfer performance due to its hierarchical porous structure, leading to higher activity and efficiency in the PDH reaction.
   
3. **Product Selectivity**: The catalyst optimized with 10% TS-1 demonstrates the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial conversion rate of propane to propylene at 54.5%. This high selectivity outperforms other supported catalysts, making PDH a more effective method for propylene production.

该文献中提到，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于其在生产丙烯方面的优越催化性能。这种技术通过以下几个方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. **原料获取性**：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料丰富且广泛可用，相比依赖于更难获取或波动较大的原材料的传统方法提供了更可靠的选择。
   
2. **过程效率**：文献强调了催化剂优化的重要性，特别是新型TS-1@SBA-16复合材料的应用。这种复合材料因其层级孔结构而提高了传质性能，从而在PDH反应中表现出更高的活性和效率。
   
3. **产品选择性**：含有10% TS-1的催化剂显示出最高的PDH活性，丙烷转化为丙烯的初始转化率可达54.5%。这种高选择性使其优于其他支持型催化剂，使PDH成为丙烯生产更有效的方法。
