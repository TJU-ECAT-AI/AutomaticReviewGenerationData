[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction."
[3] "Catalysts were characterized by means of N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, TEM XPS, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy."
[4] "The effect of different contents of TS-1 on PDH was investigated, and the optimal amount of TS-1 was determined to be 10%."
[5] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[6] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing a novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 as a catalyst support. This composite has an optimal TS-1 content of 10% which significantly enhances the PDH activity, achieving an initial conversion rate of propane to propylene as high as 54.5%, surpassing other catalysts.

2. The superior performance of the Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 catalyst is attributed to several factors: the hierarchical porous structure provides excellent mass transfer properties, the suitable acidity facilitates the chemical reactions, and the electronic effect of Ti species improves the catalytic efficiency.

1.PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。它通过使用一种新型复合材料TS-1@SBA-16作为催化剂支撑来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。这种复合材料的最佳TS-1含量为10%，显著提高了PDH活性，使得丙烷初始转化率达到54.5%，超过其他催化剂。

2.Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16催化剂的优越性能归因于几个因素：层级孔结构提供了出色的质传递特性，适当的酸性有助于化学反应，Ti物种的电子效应提高了催化效率。
