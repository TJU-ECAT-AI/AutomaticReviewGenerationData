element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica. This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction.
The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones.
The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species.

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. These challenges typically involve limited feedstock availability, low process efficiency, and poor product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these issues by offering a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene from propane, utilizing advanced catalyst supports like the novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16. This material, when loaded with Pt-SnOx, demonstrates superior catalytic performance due to its hierarchical porous structure, which facilitates excellent mass transfer, along with appropriate acid strength and electronic effects provided by titanium species, enhancing both the activity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.
