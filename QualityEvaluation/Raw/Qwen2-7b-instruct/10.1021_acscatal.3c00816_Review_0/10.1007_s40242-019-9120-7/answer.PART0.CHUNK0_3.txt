[1] "element not found novel composite material of TS-1@SBA-16 was synthesized by enwrapping TS-1 zeolite crystals with mesoporous SBA-16 silica."
[2] "This composite was used as catalyst support for loading Pt-SnOx in the propane dehydro-genation(PDH) reaction."
[3] "Catalysts were characterized by means of N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, TEM XPS, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy."
[4] "The effect of different contents of TS-1 on PDH was investigated, and the optimal amount of TS-1 was determined to be 10%."
[5] "The catalyst with TS-1 content of 10% showed the highest PDH activity and the initial conversion of propane over it can achieve 54.5%, higher than those over TS-1 or SBA-16-supported ones."
[6] "The superior catalytic performance of Pt-SnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 is related to the synergistic effect of the excellent mass transfer performance through the hierarchical porous structure, suitable acid acidity and electronic effect of Ti species."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the document, are its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, a critical component in the petrochemical industry. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane resources, which are widely available and cost-effective compared to traditional methods that often rely on more expensive hydrocarbons.

2. Process Efficiency: The document mentions the use of a novel composite material (TS-1@SBA-16) as a catalyst support, which leads to enhanced efficiency in the PDH reaction. This composite material improves mass transfer performance, resulting in higher conversion rates and yields.

3. Product Selectivity: The study shows that the catalyst with a specific TS-1 content of 10% demonstrates the highest PDH activity, achieving an initial conversion rate of propane to propylene at 54.5%, surpassing those of other catalysts. This indicates improved selectivity towards the desired product, propylene.

In summary, PDH technology stands out due to its efficient use of readily available feedstocks, enhanced process efficiency, and high product selectivity, making it a promising method for propylene production.

在文献中提到，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于其高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯的能力，这在石化行业中至关重要。PDH通过以下方式特别解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丰富且成本效益高的丙烷资源，与依赖更昂贵的碳氢化合物的传统方法相比，具有优势。

2. 生产过程效率：文献中提到了使用一种新型复合材料（TS-1@SBA-16）作为催化剂支持，这提高了PDH反应的效率。这种复合材料改善了质量传递性能，从而实现了更高的转化率和产率。

3. 产品选择性：研究表明，特定TS-1含量为10%的催化剂表现出最高的PDH活性，丙烷转化为丙烯的初始转化率达到54.5%，超过其他催化剂。这表明了对目标产品的更高选择性，即丙烯。

总之，PDH技术因其有效利用易得的原料、提高的过程效率以及高产品选择性而脱颖而出，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法。
