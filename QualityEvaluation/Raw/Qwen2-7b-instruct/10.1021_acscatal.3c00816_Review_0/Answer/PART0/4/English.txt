PDH technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH utilizes abundant and cost-effective propane as a feedstock, reducing the reliance on expensive and volatile oil-based resources. Secondly, PDH processes demonstrate superior product selectivity and higher conversion rates, resulting in increased propylene output and improved economic performance. Moreover, PDH offers a more sustainable approach to propylene production, as it provides a cleaner alternative that reduces carbon footprints compared to traditional fossil fuel-based methods. Additionally, the high yield and efficiency of PDH technology enable it to effectively address the challenges associated with fluctuating feedstock availability and price volatility. Lastly, PDH processes are characterized by enhanced energy efficiency, which leads to lower operational costs and a decreased environmental impact.

4. Zeolites with a high Si/Ti ratio exhibit reduced surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, compared to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites, which aids in the efficient desorption of C3H6, thereby improving selectivity and anti-coke stability.
