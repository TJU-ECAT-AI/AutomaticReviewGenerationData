          The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology lies in its thermodynamic efficiency, offering a potentially more efficient method for propylene production compared to conventional methods. PDH specifically addresses challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By directly converting propane into propylene without the need for oxygen, PDH circumvents the limitations posed by the thermodynamic limitations of direct dehydrogenation routes. ODH, with its favorable thermodynamics, further enhances this efficiency. Developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is essential for the industrial application of ODH reactions.

          In addressing the challenges posed by conventional production methods, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out for its ability to efficiently utilize abundant propane resources. By converting propane directly to propylene, PDH processes reduce dependence on scarce and expensive feedstocks such as oil and natural gas. This method offers higher product selectivity, generating a greater proportion of propylene with fewer byproducts, compared to traditional processes. Moreover, PDH technologies are engineered to minimize side reactions and coke formation, ensuring improved process efficiency and product purity. Overall, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production in today's global market.
