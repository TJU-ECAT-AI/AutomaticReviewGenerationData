{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes", "English": "Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. It addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in distinct ways:\n\n1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and widely available globally. This makes it less susceptible to supply chain disruptions compared to methods relying on more localized or scarce feedstocks.\n2. Process efficiency: PDH offers higher energy efficiency than traditional methods, such as steam cracking, which often require significant amounts of heat and energy input. This results in lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact.\n3. Product selectivity: The PDH process is designed to yield high purity propylene with minimal byproducts. This enhances the economic viability and marketability of the propylene produced, as pure propylene commands a premium price in the chemical industry.", "Chinese": "答案：丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其与传统生产方法相比的几个关键优势而脱颖而出，有效解决了原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性等方面的问题：\n\n1. 原料可用性：PDH技术利用全球广泛且丰富的丙烷作为原料。这使其相对于依赖于局部或稀缺原料的方法而言，更不易受到供应链中断的影响。\n2. 工艺效率：PDH提供了比传统方法（如蒸汽裂解）更高的能效。传统方法往往需要大量热量和能量输入，这导致了较低的运营成本和较小的环境影响。\n3. 产品选择性：PDH过程设计用于生成高纯度丙烯，副产品最少。这增强了所生产的丙烯的经济可行性和市场竞争力，因为纯净的丙烯在化工行业中享有较高的市场价格。", "Doi": "10.1126/sciadv.aar5418"},
