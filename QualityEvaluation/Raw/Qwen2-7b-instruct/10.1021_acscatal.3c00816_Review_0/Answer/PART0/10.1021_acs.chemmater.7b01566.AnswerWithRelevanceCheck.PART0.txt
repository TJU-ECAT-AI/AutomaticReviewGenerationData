          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production because it effectively tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, addressing concerns about traditional methods that may rely on less accessible or more expensive feedstocks. PDH processes are designed to enhance the efficiency of the conversion, leading to higher yields of propylene. Additionally, PDH offers improved product selectivity, meaning it produces propylene with reduced byproducts, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.
