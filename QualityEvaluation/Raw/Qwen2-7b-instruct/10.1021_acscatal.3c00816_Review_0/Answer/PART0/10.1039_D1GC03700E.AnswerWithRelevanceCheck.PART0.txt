          [1] "Despite the growing global demand for propylene, the conventional production methods face challenges in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity."
          [2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production."
          [3] "PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more efficient use of feedstocks, particularly natural gas liquids (NGLs), which are abundant and readily available."
          [4] "Compared to conventional methods, PDH technology improves process efficiency, allowing for higher yields of propylene and lower energy consumption."
          [5] "PDH technology also enhances product selectivity, leading to a more consistent and higher-quality propylene output."
          [6] "By directly converting propane into propylene, PDH bypasses the need for additional processing steps, simplifying the overall manufacturing process and reducing costs."
          [7] "This technology is especially advantageous as it can utilize a wider range of feedstocks, including lighter hydrocarbons, which are more sustainable and less costly than traditional fossil fuels."

          [1] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially."
          [2] "The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."
          [3] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts."
          [4] "ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia, due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes."
          [5] "ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years."

          1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize abundant feedstocks like natural gas liquids, improve process efficiency, enhance product selectivity, simplify the manufacturing process, and reduce costs.
          2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over oxygen (ODH-O2) offers an advantage by avoiding the formation of coke completely, but until recently, the space-time yield (STY) of catalysts for this process was significantly lower than that of PDH catalysts.
          3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) has gained interest, particularly in academic circles, due to its potential for utilizing carbon dioxide in a way that could contribute to carbon-neutral or carbon-negative processes.
          4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen oxide (ODH-N2O) is the least researched among the processes reviewed, with limited progress in recent years.
