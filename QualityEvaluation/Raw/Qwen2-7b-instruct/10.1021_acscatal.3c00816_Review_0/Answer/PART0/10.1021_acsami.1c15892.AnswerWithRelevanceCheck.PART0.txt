          This research focuses on utilizing atomically dispersed cobalt(II) sites incorporated into a silicalite-1 zeolite framework as a catalyst for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The exceptional performance and resistance to coke buildup of this catalyst make it an ideal choice for propylene manufacturing processes. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its benefits such as better access to feedstock sources, increased operational efficiency, and higher yield of the desired product compared to traditional methods. However, PDH technology is emphasized as a promising method for propylene production because of its potential to overcome constraints of conventional methods.
