          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation over PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite A PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst with very high activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation is reported in this paper."
          [2] "The excellent properties of the catalyst originate from the strong interaction of the Ti existing in the zeolite framework with Zn and Pt."
          [3] "The crucial functions of the Ti in constructing the structure and for modifying the reaction were evidenced by the CO adsorption capacity, CO adsorption IR spectroscopy and C3H6-TPD of the related catalysts."
          [4] "Thanks to the interaction of the Ti with Zn and Pt, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst exhibited a very high initial specific rate of 58.09 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and a quite low deactivation constant of 0.0158 h1 in the 96.8 h time on stream at 600 C."
          [5] "For the DHP, the various research groups around the world have investigated the catalysts under quite different reaction conditions."
          [6] "Over the total reaction period of 96.8 hours, the selectivity towards C3H6 was maintained at about 96%, and substantial deactivation of the catalyst began after the reaction had been conducted for a time on stream of about 25 hours."
          [7] "Clearly, these should be associated with the surface silanol groups of the silicalite-1 zeolite."
          [8] "The initial C3H8 conversion over the PtZn/0.02TS-170 at a WHSV of 48 h1 is 47.3%, which is considerably higher than those reported in the literature."

          In the context of growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. It specifically addresses challenges faced by traditional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH leverages abundant shale gas reserves to produce propylene from propane, offering a more sustainable and economically viable alternative. The process bypasses the need for traditional methods that rely on expensive and scarce naphtha or heavy oil. By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH ensures a more efficient and streamlined process, reducing energy consumption and waste generation. Moreover, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, minimizing the formation of byproducts and enhancing economic feasibility. The use of a catalyst system with high activity, selectivity, and durability, such as PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite, demonstrates the potential for PDH to offer a sustainable and economically viable alternative for propylene production.
