          Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. It addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in distinct ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and widely available globally. This makes it less susceptible to supply chain disruptions compared to methods relying on more localized or scarce feedstocks.
2. Process efficiency: PDH offers higher energy efficiency than traditional methods, such as steam cracking, which often require significant amounts of heat and energy input. This results in lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact.
3. Product selectivity: The PDH process is designed to yield high purity propylene with minimal byproducts. This enhances the economic viability and marketability of the propylene produced, as pure propylene commands a premium price in the chemical industry.
