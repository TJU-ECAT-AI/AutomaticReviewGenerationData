The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a feedstock. This makes the technology more flexible and less dependent on scarce resources compared to methods relying on ethylene, which often requires extensive processing of crude oil.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH demonstrates a higher tolerance for catalytic deactivation, meaning that the catalysts used in PDH processes can maintain their performance for longer periods, leading to higher operational efficiency. This is particularly evident in the comparison between PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, where the latter shows significantly stronger stability against deactivation.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The technology's ability to selectively produce propylene from propane enhances the economic viability of the process. By focusing on a specific product, PDH allows for optimized use of resources and potentially higher yields of the desired product compared to more generalized cracking processes.

4. **Coke Transport Phenomena**: The stability of PtSn catalysts is influenced by the type of PtSn alloy, which affects how coke moves within the catalyst. The study found that the Pt3Sn alloy leads to faster deactivation compared to the PtSn alloy. This implies that understanding and controlling the coke transport phenomena could lead to improvements in catalyst design and performance.

In summary, PDH technology offers a promising solution to the challenges of propylene production, including efficient use of abundant feedstocks, maintaining high process efficiency, optimizing product selectivity, and managing the dynamics of coke transport within the catalyst system.

全球丙烯需求的增长速度超过了乙烯，这导致蒸汽裂解提供的丙烯供应短缺。直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）技术特别有助于解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. **原料获取**：PDH利用的丙烷资源丰富且易于获取，作为原料使用相比依赖稀缺资源的乙烷裂解方法更为灵活。

2. **工艺效率**：PDH表现出对催化剂失活的更高耐受性，这意味着在PDH过程中使用的催化剂可以保持更长的时间性能，从而提高操作效率。对比PtSn/Al2O3和PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂，后者显示出显著更强的稳定性，对失活的容忍度更高。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH专注于从丙烷转化为丙烯，提高了资源的有效利用和目标产品的产出率。相比更广泛的裂解过程，PDH通过专注于特定产品提供了优化的流程选择性。

4. **焦炭运输现象**：催化剂的稳定性受到PtSn合金类型的影响，进而影响焦炭在催化剂内的移动。研究发现，Pt3Sn合金导致更快的催化剂失活，与PtSn合金相比。这表明理解并控制焦炭运输现象可能为催化剂设计和性能改进提供途径。

总之，PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了有前景的解决方案，包括有效利用丰富的原料、维持高工艺效率、优化产品选择性和管理催化剂系统中的焦炭运输动态。
