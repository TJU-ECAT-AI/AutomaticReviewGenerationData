[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[3] "The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed a stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "The high catalytic stability of PtSn/ZnAl2O4 originates from the relatively faster coke mobility from the metal surface to the support."
[5] "Coke on PtSn had higher mobility than that on Pt3Sn."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by providing a more efficient and selective method for propylene production compared to conventional methods. It ensures a steady supply of propylene by directly converting propane into propylene without the need for intermediate ethylene production, thus bypassing the limitations of ethylene supply. The technology improves process efficiency by optimizing the reaction conditions for maximum propylene yield, minimizing energy consumption, and enhancing overall throughput. Product selectivity is enhanced as PDH selectively converts propane to propylene, offering higher purity and quality of propylene compared to mixed olefin products from steam cracking processes. Additionally, PDH technology offers a more sustainable approach by potentially utilizing a wider range of feedstocks, including natural gas liquids and renewable propane, contributing to the circular economy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
