1. Propane dehydrogenation technology addresses the challenges of conventional propylene production methods by improving feedstock flexibility, enhancing process efficiency, and increasing product selectivity. It specifically tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is more readily available and abundant than naphtha. Process efficiency is improved through selective catalytic reactions, and product selectivity is enhanced by optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst design, leading to a higher yield of propylene.

2. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst demonstrated superior stability compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation, indicating that the choice of support material significantly impacts the catalyst's performance and longevity.

3. Tin modifies the electronic and geometric properties of platinum (Pt) by forming PtSn alloys, which can enhance the catalyst's activity and selectivity for olefin production. This modification allows for better control over the catalytic process and product distribution.

4. The distinct bimetallic alloy compositions and phase transitions in PtSn catalysts affect the mobility of coke formed during the reaction. This impact on coke mobility can influence the catalyst's deactivation rate and overall stability, highlighting the importance of alloy structure in determining catalyst performance.
