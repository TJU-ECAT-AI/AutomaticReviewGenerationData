The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a feedstock. This makes the technology more flexible and less dependent on scarce resources compared to methods relying on ethylene, which often requires extensive processing of crude oil.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH demonstrates a higher tolerance for catalytic deactivation, meaning that the catalysts used in PDH processes can maintain their performance for longer periods, leading to higher operational efficiency. This is particularly evident in the comparison between PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, where the latter shows significantly stronger stability against deactivation.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The technology's ability to selectively produce propylene from propane enhances the economic viability of the process. By focusing on a specific product, PDH allows for optimized use of resources and potentially higher yields of the desired product compared to more generalized cracking processes.

4. **Coke Transport Phenomena**: The stability of PtSn catalysts is influenced by the type of PtSn alloy, which affects how coke moves within the catalyst. The study found that the Pt3Sn alloy leads to faster deactivation compared to the PtSn alloy. This implies that understanding and controlling the coke transport phenomena could lead to improvements in catalyst design and performance.

In summary, PDH technology offers a promising solution to the challenges of propylene production, including efficient use of abundant feedstocks, maintaining high process efficiency, optimizing product selectivity, and managing the dynamics of coke transport within the catalyst system.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a more readily available feedstock compared to naphtha used in traditional methods. This allows for a more diverse and potentially more abundant source of raw material. In terms of process efficiency, PDH enables a more streamlined production process that can potentially offer higher yields and lower operational costs. Moreover, PDH improves product selectivity by favoring the production of propylene over ethylene, aligning more closely with market demands. The incorporation of tin as a promoter in the catalysts enhances the stability and selectivity of the process, leading to better performance and reduced coke generation. The use of ZnAl2O4 as a support material further aids in suppressing coke formation, thereby maintaining higher efficiency and reducing deactivation rates over time. This combination of advantages makes PDH a promising method for propylene production, particularly in response to the growing demand for propylene globally.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and flexible way to produce propylene. It specifically tackles issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive steam cracking processes. This not only reduces the dependency on traditional feedstocks but also improves the overall energy efficiency and reduces environmental impact. In terms of product selectivity, PDH technology offers a cleaner and more controlled production process, leading to higher quality propylene.

2. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is attributed to its enhanced ability to resist deactivation and its lower coke deposition rates, which contribute to its stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation. The use of ZnAl2O4 as a support in the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst leads to a decrease in coke content, thereby improving the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

3. Tin modifies the electronic and geometric properties of platinum (Pt) by forming PtSn alloys and diluting Pt sites. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, as the alloys and dilutions alter the surface chemistry and enhance the catalytic sites available for reactions.

4. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst demonstrated significantly better catalytic stability than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is due to the faster mobility of coke from the metal surface to the support in the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, which helps in maintaining the catalyst's activity and stability over prolonged periods.

5. Compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, the PtSn catalysts produced significantly less coke during the reaction, ranging from 2.5 to 6.1 wt% under similar reaction conditions. This reduction in coke formation is crucial as it minimizes the deactivation of the catalyst, leading to improved process efficiency and economic viability.
