1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and flexible way to produce propylene. It specifically tackles issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive steam cracking processes. This not only reduces the dependency on traditional feedstocks but also improves the overall energy efficiency and reduces environmental impact. In terms of product selectivity, PDH technology offers a cleaner and more controlled production process, leading to higher quality propylene.

2. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst showed superior stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is attributed to its enhanced ability to resist deactivation and its lower coke deposition rates, which contribute to its stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation. The use of ZnAl2O4 as a support in the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst leads to a decrease in coke content, thereby improving the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

3. Tin modifies the electronic and geometric properties of platinum (Pt) by forming PtSn alloys and diluting Pt sites. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, as the alloys and dilutions alter the surface chemistry and enhance the catalytic sites available for reactions.

4. The PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst demonstrated significantly better catalytic stability than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. This is due to the faster mobility of coke from the metal surface to the support in the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst, which helps in maintaining the catalyst's activity and stability over prolonged periods.

5. Compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, the PtSn catalysts produced significantly less coke during the reaction, ranging from 2.5 to 6.1 wt% under similar reaction conditions. This reduction in coke formation is crucial as it minimizes the deactivation of the catalyst, leading to improved process efficiency and economic viability.

1.PDH技术通过提供更高效和灵活的方法来生产丙烯，解决了传统生产方法面临的问题。它特别针对原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等问题。PDH技术允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，跳过了昂贵且能源密集型的蒸汽裂解过程的需求。这不仅减少了对传统原料的依赖，而且提高了整体能源效率，降低了环境影响。在产品选择性方面，PDH技术提供了更清洁和更可控的生产过程，从而得到更高质量的丙烯。

2.PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在丙烷脱氢化中的稳定性与选择性优于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这归因于其增强的抗失活能力以及较低的焦炭沉积率，从而导致其更强的催化活性。使用ZnAl2O4作为PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂的支持物导致焦炭含量降低，从而改善了催化剂的稳定性和效率。

3.锡通过形成PtSn合金和稀释Pt位点来修改铂（Pt）的电子和几何性质。这导致了在脱氢正构烷烃过程中改善的催化活性和选择性，因为合金和稀释改变了表面化学并增强了可用于反应的催化位点。

4.PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂在稳定性方面显著优于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。这是由于金属表面到支持物中焦炭的更快移动性，在PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂中有助于维持催化剂的活性和稳定性。

5.与单一金属Pt催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂在类似反应条件下产生的焦炭量明显较少，范围为2.5至6.1 wt%。这种焦炭形成的减少对于最小化催化剂的失活至关重要，从而提高了过程效率和经济可行性。
