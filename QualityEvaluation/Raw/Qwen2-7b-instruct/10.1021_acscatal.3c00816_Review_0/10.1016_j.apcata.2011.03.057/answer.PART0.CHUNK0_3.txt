[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[3] "To better understand the relationship between the catalytic stability and the PtSn bimetallic alloy system, the PtSn bimetallic phases were investigated through CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, TPR, and HRTEM with fresh and spent catalysts."
[4] "Under a longer TOS, the propane conversion decreased while the coke deposits on the catalysts were generated through cracking, hydrogenolysis, and pyrolysis, resulting in a small decrease in propylene selectivity."
[5] "This indicates that the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst had a much stronger tolerance for catalytic deactivation, as compared to the PtSn/Al catalyst."
[6] "The addition of Sn as a promoter apparently lessened the coke generation."
[7] "Therefore, the ZnAl2O4 support plays an important role in the suppression of the generation of coke during the reaction."
[8] "With the Al2O3 support, the coke contents were 4.1 and 6.1 wt% whereas the PtSn/ZnAlO catalyst generated only 2.5 and 4.9 wt% coke."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a more readily available feedstock compared to naphtha used in traditional methods. This allows for a more diverse and potentially more abundant source of raw material. In terms of process efficiency, PDH enables a more streamlined production process that can potentially offer higher yields and lower operational costs. Moreover, PDH improves product selectivity by favoring the production of propylene over ethylene, aligning more closely with market demands. The incorporation of tin as a promoter in the catalysts enhances the stability and selectivity of the process, leading to better performance and reduced coke generation. The use of ZnAl2O4 as a support material further aids in suppressing coke formation, thereby maintaining higher efficiency and reducing deactivation rates over time. This combination of advantages makes PDH a promising method for propylene production, particularly in response to the growing demand for propylene globally.
