<p>Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH).</p>
<p>However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications.</p>
<p>The exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent.</p>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, such as shale gas, which reduces dependency on traditional oil-based feedstocks. Secondly, PDH technology aims to achieve lower costs and environmental impact compared to conventional methods, making it more economically viable and sustainable. Lastly, PDH offers improved process efficiency and product selectivity, particularly in terms of propylene yield and purity, which are critical factors for the chemical industry.
