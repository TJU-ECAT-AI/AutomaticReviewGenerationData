[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
[2] "The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."
[3] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[4] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."
[5] "Gongs group [ 18 ] employed the Pt-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction, wherein the ZnO serving as Lewis acid sites (LAS) were the active phases while Pt only acted as promoter."
[6] "Stair et al. [ 19 ] reported single-site Zn2+ supported on silica was an active catalyst for PDH, demonstrating that isolated Zn2+ species were the active sites in spite of weak catalytic activity."
[7] "Our group [ 20 ] recently found that the ZnO nanoclusters in Al-free SiBeta support showed great catalytic activity in PDH, confirming that the Lewis acidic ZnO clusters possessed admirable catalytic ability."
[8] "In short, isolated Zn2+ species and small bonded ZnO clusters were both reported to serve as LAS which were able to facilitate the heterolytic CH bond cleavage and simultaneously depressed the rupture of CC bond [ [21] ,[22] ,[23] ]."
[9] "Unfortunately, Zn-modified regular HZSM-5 catalysts are mostly employed in the reactions of small alkane conversion to aromatics, wherein framework Zn2+ and Brnsted acid sites (BAS) have a synergy resulting in an enhanced catalytic activity in alkane conversion toward aromatics [ 22 ,23 ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ]."
[10] "In alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the BAS in HZSM-5 are counterproductive by promoting the occurrence of side reactions [ 18 ,26 ,30 ,31 ]."
[11] "They also demonstrated the superiority of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in OPDH [ 33 ], while they just put attention on the acid sites distributions of HZSM-5 and lacked analysis to Zn species."
[12] "Herein, we put forward that this catalyst may similarly be of potential for PDH under oxygen-free condition [ 34 ,35 ], and focus on the comprehensive analysis of the ZnO catalyst supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in terms of active Zn species and the properties of HZSM-5."
[13] "As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[14] "The obtained Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were systematically characterized by N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM), diffuse reflectance UVvis (DR UVvis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), C3H6 and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (C3H6-TPD and NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA)."
[15] "The high-silica HZSM-5 with low acidity greatly minimizes coke deposition during the reaction of PDH at high temperature, and thus, obtaining a long-term reaction stability in PDH."
[16] "Also, the presence of Al atoms may have two contrary roles for PDH: The positive role is to increase the chance of bonding metal species, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalysts deactivation due to the strong acidity."
[17] "In combination with above characterizations, the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, with low Al content and good structural properties, shows positive effects on the catalytic performance of ZnO in PDH by providing appropriate acidic condition, dispersing Zn species and having strong interaction with the supported Zn species."
[18] "This catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 exhibits great catalytic activity and reaction stability, offering a thinking for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction."

1. The direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize abundant and alternative hydrocarbon sources, such as shale gas. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly approach to propylene production, reducing the reliance on expensive and toxic catalysts like PtSn and CrOx. 

2. The PDH process specifically addresses the challenges by enabling the conversion of abundant feedstocks like propane into valuable chemical products like propylene without the need for oxygen, unlike other methods. It offers a viable alternative to traditional methods that rely on limited fossil fuels, potentially reducing costs and environmental impacts.
