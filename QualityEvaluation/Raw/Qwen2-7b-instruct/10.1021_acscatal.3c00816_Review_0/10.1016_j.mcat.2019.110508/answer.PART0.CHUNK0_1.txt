[1] "The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."
[2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."
[4] "In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH."
[5] "As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[6] "The obtained Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were systematically characterized by N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM), diffuse reflectance UVvis (DR UVvis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), C3H6 and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (C3H6-TPD and NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA)."
[7] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."
[8] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."
[9] "Moreover, the catalytic activity of small bonded ZnO clusters in the PDH reaction is proposed."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its potential to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Specifically, PDH technology offers:

1. Feedstock availability: By utilizing abundant and alternative hydrocarbon sources such as shale gas, PDH technology ensures a reliable supply of propane for propylene production, which is a critical component in the chemical industry.

2. Process efficiency: PDH technology aims to achieve higher efficiency compared to conventional methods. For instance, the use of ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio demonstrates improved selectivity and stability, making the process more effective.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology focuses on enhancing propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability. This is accomplished through the adjustment of acidity levels and the promotion of propylene desorption, thereby minimizing side reactions and ensuring a cleaner and more targeted product output.

4. Cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability: The development of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability reduces the overall cost of propylene production and minimizes environmental impact, aligning with the increasing demand for sustainable chemical manufacturing practices.

The proposed catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 not only exhibits high catalytic activity and reaction stability but also provides a promising approach for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction. This makes PDH technology particularly appealing for addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
