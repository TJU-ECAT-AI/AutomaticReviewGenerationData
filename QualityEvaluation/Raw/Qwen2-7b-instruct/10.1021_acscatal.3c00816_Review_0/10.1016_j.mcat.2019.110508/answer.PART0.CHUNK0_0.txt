[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
[2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[3] "The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."
[4] "Up to now, PtSn [ [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ] and CrOx [ [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ] catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process."
[5] "Unfortunately, Zn-modified regular HZSM-5 catalysts are mostly employed in the reactions of small alkane conversion to aromatics."
[6] "It was concluded that rationally raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio had a positive effect on the propylene selectivity and reaction stability."
[7] "They also demonstrated the superiority of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in OPDH [ 33 ], while they just put attention on the acid sites distributions of HZSM-5 and lacked analysis to Zn species."
[8] "In alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the BAS in HZSM-5 are counterproductive by promoting the occurrence of side reactions [ 18 ,26 ,30 ,31 ]."
[9] "As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
[10] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."
[11] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert abundant shale gas into propylene, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability and process efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that often rely on expensive and toxic catalysts like PtSn and CrOx, PDH offers a more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative.

2. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing readily available shale gas as a feedstock, thereby reducing dependence on traditional, limited resources. It also improves process efficiency through optimized catalyst use, enhancing product selectivity and reducing the generation of unwanted byproducts.

1. 直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够高效地将丰富的页岩气转化为丙烯，从而解决原料可用性和过程效率的挑战。与传统方法依赖昂贵且有毒的催化剂如PtSn和CrOx不同，PDH提供了成本更低、更环保的替代方案。

2. PDH通过利用易得的页岩气作为原料，减少对传统、有限资源的依赖，进而提高过程效率，增强产品选择性并减少副产品的生成，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。
