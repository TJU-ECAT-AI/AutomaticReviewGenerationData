<p>Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH).</p>
<p>However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications.</p>
<p>ZnO supported on high-silica HZSM-5 as efficient catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.</p>

1. PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically tackles these issues by utilizing abundant shale gas as a feedstock, avoiding the high costs and toxicity associated with traditional PtSn and CrOx catalysts, and improving product selectivity through the use of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5.
