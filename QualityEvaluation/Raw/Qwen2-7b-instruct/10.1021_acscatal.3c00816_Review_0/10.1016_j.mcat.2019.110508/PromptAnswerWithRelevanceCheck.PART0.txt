<quotes>
[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products."
[2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[3] "The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."
[4] "Up to now, PtSn [ [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ] and CrOx [ [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ] catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process."
[5] "Unfortunately, Zn-modified regular HZSM-5 catalysts are mostly employed in the reactions of small alkane conversion to aromatics."
[6] "It was concluded that rationally raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio had a positive effect on the propylene selectivity and reaction stability."
[7] "They also demonstrated the superiority of ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 in OPDH [ 33 ], while they just put attention on the acid sites distributions of HZSM-5 and lacked analysis to Zn species."
[8] "In alkane dehydrogenation reactions, the BAS in HZSM-5 are counterproductive by promoting the occurrence of side reactions [ 18 ,26 ,30 ,31 ]."
[9] "As a result, the catalytic performance and reaction stability of the ZnO catalysts increase as rationally elevating the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support."
[10] "Moreover, it is proposed that the small ZnO clusters directly connected with the framework of HZSM-5 zeolite are active phases, which are massively produced upon the zeolite support with fine structure condition and sparse Al sites."
[11] "The ZnO catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 is low-cost, toxicity-free and reusable, is thus of great promising to be used in industrial propylene production."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert abundant shale gas into propylene, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability and process efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that often rely on expensive and toxic catalysts like PtSn and CrOx, PDH offers a more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly alternative.

2. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing readily available shale gas as a feedstock, thereby reducing dependence on traditional, limited resources. It also improves process efficiency through optimized catalyst use, enhancing product selectivity and reducing the generation of unwanted byproducts.

[2] "However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."
[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."
[4] "In this work, ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites (Zn/xHZSM-5, where x represents SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) were prepared by using impregnation method and tested in PDH."
[5] "As a result, ZnO supported on the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (250) exhibited much better selectivity toward propylene and stability compared with that with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios."
[6] "The obtained Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were systematically characterized by N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM), diffuse reflectance UVvis (DR UVvis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), C3H6 and NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (C3H6-TPD and NH3-TPD) and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA)."
[7] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity, while ZnO supported on low-silica HZSM-5 is prone to aggregate into bulk ZnO on the zeolite external surface."
[8] "Also, the well-adjusted acidity of high-silica HZSM-5 can significantly improve the propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability by promoting the propylene desorption and minimizing side reactions."
[9] "Moreover, the catalytic activity of small bonded ZnO clusters in the PDH reaction is proposed."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its potential to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Specifically, PDH technology offers:

1. Feedstock availability: By utilizing abundant and alternative hydrocarbon sources such as shale gas, PDH technology ensures a reliable supply of propane for propylene production, which is a critical component in the chemical industry.

2. Process efficiency: PDH technology aims to achieve higher efficiency compared to conventional methods. For instance, the use of ZnO catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolites with a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio demonstrates improved selectivity and stability, making the process more effective.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology focuses on enhancing propylene selectivity and dehydrogenation stability. This is accomplished through the adjustment of acidity levels and the promotion of propylene desorption, thereby minimizing side reactions and ensuring a cleaner and more targeted product output.

4. Cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability: The development of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability reduces the overall cost of propylene production and minimizes environmental impact, aligning with the increasing demand for sustainable chemical manufacturing practices.

The proposed catalyst system of ZnO loaded on high-silica HZSM-5 not only exhibits high catalytic activity and reaction stability but also provides a promising approach for designing highly-efficient transition metal catalysts for PDH reaction. This makes PDH technology particularly appealing for addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

[5] "Gongs group [ 18 ] employed the Pt-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction, wherein the ZnO serving as Lewis acid sites (LAS) were the active phases while Pt only acted as promoter."
[6] "Stair et al. [ 19 ] reported single-site Zn2+ supported on silica was an active catalyst for PDH, demonstrating that isolated Zn2+ species were the active sites in spite of weak catalytic activity."
[7] "Our group [ 20 ] recently found that the ZnO nanoclusters in Al-free SiBeta support showed great catalytic activity in PDH, confirming that the Lewis acidic ZnO clusters possessed admirable catalytic ability."

[15] "The high-silica HZSM-5 with low acidity greatly minimizes coke deposition during the reaction of PDH at high temperature, and thus, obtaining a long-term reaction stability in PDH."
[16] "Also, the presence of Al atoms may have two contrary roles for PDH: The positive role is to increase the chance of bonding metal species, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalysts deactivation due to the strong acidity."
[17] "In combination with above characterizations, the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, with low Al content and good structural properties, shows positive effects on the catalytic performance of ZnO in PDH by providing appropriate acidic condition, dispersing Zn species and having strong interaction with the supported Zn species."
