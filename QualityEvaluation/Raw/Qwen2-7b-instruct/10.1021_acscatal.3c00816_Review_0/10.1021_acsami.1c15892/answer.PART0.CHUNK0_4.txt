The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods include its ability to efficiently utilize a wide range of feedstocks, enhance process efficiency, and improve product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by enabling the conversion of less valuable propane into high-value propylene, thus optimizing resource utilization. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a streamlined approach that reduces energy consumption and operational costs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, PDH technology improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene with reduced byproducts, which contributes to more sustainable and cost-effective propylene production.
