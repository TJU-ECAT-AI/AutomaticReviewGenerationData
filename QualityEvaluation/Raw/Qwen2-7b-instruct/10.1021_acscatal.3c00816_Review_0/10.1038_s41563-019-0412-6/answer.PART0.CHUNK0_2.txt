[1] "Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4."
[2] "For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects."
[3] "Attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)5,6,7."
[4] "However, when functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 12nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11."
[5] "This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes14,15,16,17."
[6] "To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials."
[7] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[8] "Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels."
[9] "Finally, atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electronically modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "The encapsulation of Pt particles in MFI zeolite As illustrated in Fig. 1a,b, by a one-pot synthesis strategy, Pt species can be encapsulated into purely siliceous MFI zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4wt% (Supplementary Table 1)."
[11] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[12] "As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3)."
[13] "To investigate the role of K, we first characterized the as-synthesized, non-calcined, Pt-zeolite samples (K-Pt@MFI-SDA and Pt@MFI-SDA), obtained in the presence and absence of K, by electron microscopy."
[14] "As shown in Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5, only atomically dispersed Pt species are detected in both as-synthesized samples, as confirmed by image simulation (Supplementary Fig. 6)."
[15] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids."
[16] "The characteristics of the location of Pt atoms described above are the same when the synthesis is carried out in the presence of K+ (K-Pt@MFI-SDA sample), indicating that K+ does not play a relevant role in the encapsulation of atomically dispersed Pt species during the hydrothermal synthesis."
[17] "Interestingly, when the K-containing K-Pt@MFI-air sample was reduced in H2 at 600C, Pt atoms turned into subnanometric clusters, as shown in Fig. 1d."
[18] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 12, the number of OH groups in the K-free Pt-zeolite samples measured by infrared spectroscopy decreased significantly after the introduction of K+ (ref. 27)."
[19] "As shown in Fig. 2a, the XANES spectra (a) and EXAFS spectra (b) of the Pt L3-edge of different Pt-zeolite samples."
[20] "Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that subnanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels)."
[21] "By using the newly developed iDPC technique, the atomic structure of the MFI zeolite can be recorded simultaneously with the HR HAADF-STEM image under low-dose conditions (Fig. 3b)22,23."
[22] "According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples."
[23] "The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy."
[24] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was chosen as a model reaction to test the reactivity and stability of Pt particles or clusters encapsulated in pure-silica MFI zeolite."
[25] "As displayed in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping."
[26] "Additionally, in the experimental HR HAADF-STEM images of the K-PtSn@MFI sample, we have found areas showing intensity profiles similar to those observed in simulation results (Supplementary Fig. 45)."
[27] "As shown in Fig. 5a, Pt@MFI was initially active but a fast deactivation was observed. Therefore, regeneration of the deactivated sample was carried out by a calcination treatment in air at 600C followed by a subsequent reduction by H2 at 600C."
[28] "According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced."
[29] "Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:
   - Feasibility with readily available propane as the feedstock, bypassing the need for costly and resource-intensive fossil fuels for propylene production.
   - Higher energy efficiency compared to traditional methods, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.
   - Enhanced product selectivity, particularly for propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, ethene, and ethane, which are produced in conventional cracking processes.

2. The one-pot synthesis strategy involves encapsulating Pt species within MFI zeolite, aiming to create subnanometric Pt clusters. This approach ensures better stabilization of the Pt species, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity for alkane activation and other chemical transformations. The synthesis also facilitates the regioselective generation of Pt clusters within specific zeolite channels, enhancing the material's overall catalytic performance.

3. The presence of potassium (K+) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Pt species during the synthesis process, preventing them from aggregating into larger nanoparticles. This stabilization leads to the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters, which are highly reactive and selective for the targeted chemical reactions. The use of K+ also aids in maintaining the Pt clusters' location within the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, further contributing to their superior catalytic properties.

4. The encapsulation of Pt species in MFI zeolite results in a catalyst with enhanced stability and selectivity. This is achieved through the controlled generation of subnanometric Pt clusters, which exhibit higher reactivity than larger Pt nanoparticles. The catalyst's ability to regenerate effectively after each reaction cycle, thanks to the strategic placement and stabilization of Pt clusters, extends its operational lifespan and improves overall efficiency.

5. The integration of tin (Sn) with Pt in the MFI zeolite matrix modifies the electronic properties of the Pt clusters, increasing their selectivity for propylene production during the propane dehydrogenation reaction. This dual-metallic system enhances the catalyst's reactivity, stability, and recyclability, making it a highly effective solution for propylene synthesis.

6. The encapsulation of Pt species within the MFI zeolite framework offers several benefits, including enhanced stability, selectivity, and catalytic activity. The Pt clusters are localized within the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, providing optimal conditions for alkane activation and other reactions. This approach also minimizes the risk of sintering and aggregation, ensuring long-term performance and efficiency.
