[1] "Regioselective generation and reactivity control of subnanometric platinum clusters in zeolites for high-temperature catalysis"
[2] "Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4."
[3] "However, the poor stabilization of subnanometric metal species towards sintering at high temperature (>500C) under oxidative or reductive reaction conditions limits their catalytic application."
[4] "Zeolites can serve as an ideal support to stabilize subnanometric metal catalysts, but it is challenging to localize subnanometric metal species on specific sites and modulate their reactivity."
[5] "These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene."
[6] "Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions."
[7] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[8] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[9] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids."
[10] "This stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials."
[11] "The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metalorganic frameworks and zeolites."

The document outlines the development of a method to generate and stabilize subnanometric platinum clusters within zeolite structures for high-temperature catalysis. The key advantages of this method include the ability to precisely control the reactivity and stability of platinum catalysts. By localizing the platinum species in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, the researchers were able to create a catalyst that demonstrates high stability, selectivity, and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene. This is particularly advantageous because it addresses the challenges of conventional methods, such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, by providing a more controlled and efficient way to produce propylene. The regioselective generation of these platinum clusters within the zeolite channels enhances their stability against sintering at high temperatures, making the catalyst suitable for industrial use.

This technology can potentially be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including metalorganic frameworks and zeolites, further broadening its applicability. The use of potassium ions (K+) in the synthesis process plays a crucial role in stabilizing the platinum clusters, ensuring they remain in the desired locations within the zeolite structure, thus maintaining their high activity and stability under high-temperature conditions.

<p>Main challenges in synthesizing zeolites with active sites: (1) to generate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystallites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material.</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of generating stable subnanometric Pt clusters within the 10MR channels of MFI zeolite, a one-pot synthesis strategy was employed. Pt species were encapsulated into purely siliceous MFI zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4wt%. The presence of K+ significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species, with subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm being the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample.</p>
<p>The encapsulated Pt clusters remained stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550°C) under a reductive atmosphere. This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes.</p>
<p>The synthesis of bimetallic PtSn clusters in MFI zeolite was also achieved, where the Pt and Sn clusters were preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure. The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample was investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of Pt-zeolite materials for propane dehydrogenation was tested, and it was found that the K-PtSn@MFI sample showed high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage was already quite high (90%), and the lifetime of the catalyst was significantly extended.</p>
<p>The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metalorganic frameworks and zeolites. The use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This eliminates the need for costly and limited fossil fuels used in traditional methods. The process is designed to enhance the yield of propylene, the primary product, by efficiently converting propane into propylene through a series of catalytic reactions. The high selectivity of PDH technology ensures that the majority of the converted propane is transformed into propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as methane, ethylene, and ethane. This not only increases the economic viability of propylene production but also reduces environmental impact by decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases associated with less efficient production methods. Furthermore, PDH technology offers a scalable and adaptable platform that can be optimized for different industrial settings, making it a versatile solution for propylene production across various industries.

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:
   - Feasibility with readily available propane as the feedstock, bypassing the need for costly and resource-intensive fossil fuels for propylene production.
   - Higher energy efficiency compared to traditional methods, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.
   - Enhanced product selectivity, particularly for propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts like methane, ethene, and ethane, which are produced in conventional cracking processes.

2. The one-pot synthesis strategy involves encapsulating Pt species within MFI zeolite, aiming to create subnanometric Pt clusters. This approach ensures better stabilization of the Pt species, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity for alkane activation and other chemical transformations. The synthesis also facilitates the regioselective generation of Pt clusters within specific zeolite channels, enhancing the material's overall catalytic performance.

3. The presence of potassium (K+) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Pt species during the synthesis process, preventing them from aggregating into larger nanoparticles. This stabilization leads to the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters, which are highly reactive and selective for the targeted chemical reactions. The use of K+ also aids in maintaining the Pt clusters' location within the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, further contributing to their superior catalytic properties.

4. The encapsulation of Pt species in MFI zeolite results in a catalyst with enhanced stability and selectivity. This is achieved through the controlled generation of subnanometric Pt clusters, which exhibit higher reactivity than larger Pt nanoparticles. The catalyst's ability to regenerate effectively after each reaction cycle, thanks to the strategic placement and stabilization of Pt clusters, extends its operational lifespan and improves overall efficiency.

5. The integration of tin (Sn) with Pt in the MFI zeolite matrix modifies the electronic properties of the Pt clusters, increasing their selectivity for propylene production during the propane dehydrogenation reaction. This dual-metallic system enhances the catalyst's reactivity, stability, and recyclability, making it a highly effective solution for propylene synthesis.

6. The encapsulation of Pt species within the MFI zeolite framework offers several benefits, including enhanced stability, selectivity, and catalytic activity. The Pt clusters are localized within the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, providing optimal conditions for alkane activation and other reactions. This approach also minimizes the risk of sintering and aggregation, ensuring long-term performance and efficiency.
