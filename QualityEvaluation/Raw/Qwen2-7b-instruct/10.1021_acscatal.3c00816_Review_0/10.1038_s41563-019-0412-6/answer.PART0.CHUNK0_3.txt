[1] "Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4."
[2] "This stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials."
[3] "Regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metalorganic frameworks and zeolites."
[4] "Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level."

In the synthesis of zeolites and other microporous materials, a significant challenge is to locate active sites in the desired positions within the framework or outside it. The stabilization of subnanometric metal species, particularly within the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, is crucial for their catalytic application. This strategy can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, such as metalorganic frameworks and zeolites. Furthermore, the combination of high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR HAADF-STEM) and integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) imaging techniques offers a general approach for studying the atomic-level positioning of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts.

在合成沸石和其他微孔材料时，一个主要挑战是将活性位点定位在框架内的期望位置或框架之外。在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石的特定通道中稳定亚纳米金属物种对于它们的催化应用至关重要。这一策略可以扩展到其他结晶性多孔材料，如金属有机框架和沸石。此外，结合高分辨率高角暗场扫描透射电子显微镜（HR HAADF-STEM）和集成差分相位对比（iDPC）成像技术，可以为研究异质金属催化剂中金属物种的原子级定位提供一般方法。
