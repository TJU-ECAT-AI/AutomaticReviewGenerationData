[1] "Regioselective generation and reactivity control of subnanometric platinum clusters in zeolites for high-temperature catalysis"
[2] "Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4."
[3] "However, the poor stabilization of subnanometric metal species towards sintering at high temperature (>500C) under oxidative or reductive reaction conditions limits their catalytic application."
[4] "Zeolites can serve as an ideal support to stabilize subnanometric metal catalysts, but it is challenging to localize subnanometric metal species on specific sites and modulate their reactivity."
[5] "These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene."
[6] "Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions."
[7] "The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position."
[8] "Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species."
[9] "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids."
[10] "This stabilization strategy could be extended to other crystalline porous materials."
[11] "The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metalorganic frameworks and zeolites."

The document outlines the development of a method to generate and stabilize subnanometric platinum clusters within zeolite structures for high-temperature catalysis. The key advantages of this method include the ability to precisely control the reactivity and stability of platinum catalysts. By localizing the platinum species in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, the researchers were able to create a catalyst that demonstrates high stability, selectivity, and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene. This is particularly advantageous because it addresses the challenges of conventional methods, such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, by providing a more controlled and efficient way to produce propylene. The regioselective generation of these platinum clusters within the zeolite channels enhances their stability against sintering at high temperatures, making the catalyst suitable for industrial use.

This technology can potentially be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including metalorganic frameworks and zeolites, further broadening its applicability. The use of potassium ions (K+) in the synthesis process plays a crucial role in stabilizing the platinum clusters, ensuring they remain in the desired locations within the zeolite structure, thus maintaining their high activity and stability under high-temperature conditions.

文档描述了一种在沸石结构中生成和稳定亚纳米铂簇以进行高温催化的方法。这种方法的关键优势包括精确控制铂催化剂的反应性和稳定性。通过将铂物种定位在MFI沸石结构的波纹通道中，研究人员能够创造出一种在丙烷脱氢形成丙烯过程中表现出高稳定性、选择性和活性的催化剂。这特别有优势，因为它解决了传统方法面临的一些挑战，如原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性，通过提供一种更可控和高效的方式来生产丙烯。

该技术可能被扩展到其他结晶多孔材料，包括金属有机框架和沸石，进一步扩大其应用范围。在合成过程中使用钾离子（K+）在稳定铂簇方面发挥着关键作用，确保它们保留在沸石结构中的预期位置，从而保持其在高温条件下的高活性和稳定性。
