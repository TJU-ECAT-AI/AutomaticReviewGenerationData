<p>Main challenges in synthesizing zeolites with active sites: (1) to generate stable subnanometric metal species within the zeolite crystallites, (2) to stabilize them regioselectively within the 10MR channels and (3) to achieve the above goals with purely siliceous MFI zeolite and to avoid the presence of acid sites in the final material.</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of generating stable subnanometric Pt clusters within the 10MR channels of MFI zeolite, a one-pot synthesis strategy was employed. Pt species were encapsulated into purely siliceous MFI zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4wt%. The presence of K+ significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species, with subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm being the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample.</p>
<p>The encapsulated Pt clusters remained stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550°C) under a reductive atmosphere. This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes.</p>
<p>The synthesis of bimetallic PtSn clusters in MFI zeolite was also achieved, where the Pt and Sn clusters were preferentially located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure. The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample was investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of Pt-zeolite materials for propane dehydrogenation was tested, and it was found that the K-PtSn@MFI sample showed high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage was already quite high (90%), and the lifetime of the catalyst was significantly extended.</p>
<p>The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metalorganic frameworks and zeolites. The use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This eliminates the need for costly and limited fossil fuels used in traditional methods. The process is designed to enhance the yield of propylene, the primary product, by efficiently converting propane into propylene through a series of catalytic reactions. The high selectivity of PDH technology ensures that the majority of the converted propane is transformed into propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as methane, ethylene, and ethane. This not only increases the economic viability of propylene production but also reduces environmental impact by decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases associated with less efficient production methods. Furthermore, PDH technology offers a scalable and adaptable platform that can be optimized for different industrial settings, making it a versatile solution for propylene production across various industries.
