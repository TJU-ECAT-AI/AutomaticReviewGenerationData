<p>However, there still exist vast obstacles such as the low target selectivity of olefins, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply, which make it urgent to develop new processes to achieve valuable propylene. Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention.</p>
<p>Moreover, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the production of olefins from propane could be simply classified into three categories as follows: (1) reaction without an oxidant involved in propane dehydrogenation, simply designated as direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene; (2) oxygen or air jointly involved in dehydrogenation, denoted as PDH-O2; and (3) carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant or hydrogen serving as feeding gas, named CO2/H2 mediated dehydrogenation (PDH-CO2/PDH-H2).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the catalysis of the dehydrogenation of propane concerning oxides as reactants is hardly constrained by a thermodynamic equivalent. In contrast, the direct dehydrogenation along with H2 as a reactant involved in the reaction process is restricted by thermodynamic balance.</p>
<p>In this review, a comprehensive overview of the research progress and future prospects for PDH catalysts will be given.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and selective process for propylene production. It specifically tackles issues like the low selectivity of olefins, limitations in fossil energy resources, and inadequate market supply. PDH, alongside other processes like MTP and WGSR, is attracting significant attention due to its potential to produce valuable propylene. The advancement in hydraulic fracturing technology also encourages the conversion and utilization of low-value propane, which is abundant in Earth's natural resources.

2. PDH can be categorized into three main processes: (1) direct propane dehydrogenation without the involvement of an oxidant, (2) dehydrogenation involving oxygen or air, and (3) dehydrogenation with the assistance of carbon dioxide or hydrogen. These categorizations highlight the flexibility of PDH in terms of the reactants used and the thermodynamic constraints associated with each category.

3. The catalysis of propane dehydrogenation, particularly when involving oxides as reactants, is less constrained by thermodynamic principles compared to direct dehydrogenation with hydrogen. This distinction is crucial in understanding the efficiency and selectivity of PDH processes.

4. The review aims to provide a comprehensive insight into the advancements and future outlook of PDH catalysts, focusing on their development, performance, and optimization for practical industrial applications.

1. 烯烃选择性低、化石能源资源有限和市场供应不足等问题，迫切需要发展新的工艺以实现有价值的丙烯生产。目前，甲醇制丙烯过程（MTP）、费托水煤气变换反应（WGSR）和丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯（PDH）过程等技术吸引了极大的关注。

2. 丙烷脱氢可以分为三种主要类别：（1）不含氧化剂参与的单纯丙烷脱氢，简称为直接丙烷脱氢制丙烯；（2）氧气或空气共同参与的脱氢，表示为PDH-O2；（3）二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂或氢气作为供气气体，命名为CO2/H2介导脱氢（PDH-CO2/PDH-H2）。这些分类说明了丙烷脱氢在反应物使用和热力学约束方面的灵活性。

3. 与氢作为反应物的丙烷脱氢相比，当涉及氧化物作为反应物时，其催化过程受到的热力学限制较少。这一区别对于理解PDH过程的效率和选择性至关重要。
