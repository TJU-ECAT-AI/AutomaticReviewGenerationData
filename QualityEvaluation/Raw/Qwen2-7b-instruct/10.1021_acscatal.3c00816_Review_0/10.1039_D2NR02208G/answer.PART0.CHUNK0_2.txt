1. Pure siliceous materials have been prioritized due to their ability to avoid the inherent acidic flaws in traditional Al2O3, but the crystallization process poses risks such as hazardous synthesis conditions (high temperature or strong alkali), causing metal aggregation and low metal efficiency.

2. The well-defined zeolite material faces challenges related to crystallization processes, which involve hazardous conditions like high temperature or strong alkali, potentially leading to metal aggregation and reduced efficiency of the metal species.

3. Surface-exposed metals undergo a perilous migration and aggregation process in severe reaction conditions, causing rapid deactivation in the PDH process.

4. The ligand-protected direct H2 reduction strategy has been proven effective for large-scale application in producing high-performance catalysts for PDH reactions.

5. Ligands effectively prevent metal aggregation in the hydrothermal reaction, offering protection against aggregation.
