<p>However, there still exist vast obstacles such as the low target selectivity of olefins, restricted fossil energy resources, and insufficient market supply, which make it urgent to develop new processes to achieve valuable propylene.</p>

<p>Until now, a variety of techniques such as the methanol to propylene process (MTP), FischerTropsch water gas shift reaction (WGSR), and propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) process have attracted tremendous attention.24 Methanol steam reforming and coal gasification reaction are highly exothermic and the initiation phase demands lots of energy consumption, leading to an aggravated greenhouse effect.5 Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products.6 Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane.7 The production of olefins from propane could be simply classified into three categories as follows: (1) reaction without an oxidant involved in propane dehydrogenation, simply designated as direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene; (2) oxygen or air jointly involved in dehydrogenation, denoted as PDH-O2; and (3) carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant or hydrogen serving as feeding gas, named CO2/H2 mediated dehydrogenation (PDH-CO2/PDH-H2).</p>

<p>Modern process technology mainly includes Catofin, Oleflex, STAR, Linde, FBD-4, ADHO, FCDh and K-PROt processes for prolonged periods of time (Fig. 1).8 Among them, the most widely applicable processes are Oleflex and Catofin processes, in which catalysts consist of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively.8,9</p>

<p>What's more, the prime bottlenecks of PDH-O2 during commercial application can be concluded as follows: (1) the conversion rate and selectivity of PDH are too small to achieve practical industrial utilization; meanwhile, the incomplete reaction of alkanes needs to be recycled using a pure oxide, resulting in increased cost and energy consumption. (2) Due to the competition of adsorption, the introduction of oxides might sharply weaken the interaction between the active center and propane, leading to a low propane conversion and poor propene selectivity.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for additional processing steps, which reduces the complexity and cost of the overall process. It also utilizes Earth-abundant resources, such as shale gas, which are readily available and can be efficiently converted into propylene. In comparison to other production methods, such as methanol to propylene (MTP) and Fischer-Tropsch water gas shift reactions (WGSR), PDH offers higher product selectivity and lower energy consumption, making it more environmentally friendly. Additionally, PDH technology can be integrated with advancements in hydraulic fracturing, enhancing the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane. 

The PDH process specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in the following ways:
1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH leverages the abundant availability of propane, a readily accessible feedstock, to produce propylene, thus reducing reliance on fossil energy resources and addressing supply issues.
2. **Process Efficiency**: By converting propane directly to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, PDH simplifies the process, reducing energy consumption and costs associated with additional processing.
3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers higher selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, which enhances the purity and quality of the final product.

In summary, PDH technology is positioned as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene with high selectivity and minimal environmental impact, making it a viable solution for the growing demand for propylene ingredients.
