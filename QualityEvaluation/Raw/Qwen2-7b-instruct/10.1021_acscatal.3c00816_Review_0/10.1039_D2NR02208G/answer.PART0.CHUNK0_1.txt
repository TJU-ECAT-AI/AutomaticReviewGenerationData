[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is one of the most valued industrial production technologies, which satisfies the worldwide propylene ingredient requirement."
[2] "However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."
[3] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."
[4] "Moreover, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to satisfy the global demand for propylene. The demand for propylene exceeded approximately 116,000,000 tons in 2020. Considering the costs and environmental impacts, PDH is viewed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly pathway to produce high-value propylene. Advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology have also facilitated the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane, emphasizing the importance of enhancing PDH technology.
