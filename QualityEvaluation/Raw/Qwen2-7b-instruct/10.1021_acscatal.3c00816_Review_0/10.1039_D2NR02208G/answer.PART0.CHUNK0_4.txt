[1] "Until now, significant attention has been paid to pure siliceous materials in order to evade the inherent acidic defects of conventional Al2O3. However, the well-defined zeolite also brings concerns about a crystallization process with the hazardous synthesis conditions (high temperature or strong alkali), resulting in the detrimental effect of metal aggregation and the low efficiency of metal species."
[2] "It is worth noting that the intermediates and propene products of dehydrogenation reaction easily induce a deep cracking process to generate coke (Fig. 3).26 This will inevitably decrease the propane conversion and propene selectivity, resulting in fast deactivation, short-term lifetime, and frequent regeneration."
[3] "Taking this point into consideration, the subsequent sections mainly focus on the typical development strategies to improve the activity of PDH catalysts."
[4] "For instance, metallic oxide (MOx) nanocomposite catalysts, by combining the advantages of advanced synthetic strategies and characterization techniques, may be successfully replaced by the current catalysts in the near future."

1. The use of pure siliceous materials avoids the acidic defects of conventional Al2O3, but the crystallization process with hazardous conditions can lead to metal aggregation and low metal species efficiency.
2. The dehydrogenation reaction intermediates and propene products can easily cause deep cracking, leading to coke formation, which decreases propane conversion and propene selectivity, causing fast catalyst deactivation and short lifetime.
3. The next sections concentrate on strategies to enhance the activity of PDH catalysts.
4. Metal oxide (MOx) nanocomposite catalysts, by integrating advanced synthesis and characterization methods, may replace current catalysts in the near future.
