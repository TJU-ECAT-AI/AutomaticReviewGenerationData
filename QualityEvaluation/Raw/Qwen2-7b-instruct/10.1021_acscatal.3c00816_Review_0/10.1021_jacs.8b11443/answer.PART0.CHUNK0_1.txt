[1] "Mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3."
[2] "The use of propane as a feedstock offers several advantages over traditional methods, including improved process efficiency, enhanced product selectivity, and increased flexibility in feedstock availability."
[3] "Conventional methods often rely on heavy hydrocarbons as feedstocks, which can limit their scalability and environmental impact due to issues like sulfur content and higher boiling points."
[4] "PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a lighter hydrocarbon that is more abundant and less expensive compared to heavier feedstocks."
[5] "This results in a more efficient and environmentally friendly process, as PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps or additional purification."
[6] "Furthermore, PDH technology demonstrates high product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts, which improves both economic viability and environmental performance."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods. Key advantages include improved process efficiency, enhanced product selectivity, and increased flexibility in feedstock availability. PDH utilizes propane, a lighter, more abundant, and less expensive hydrocarbon compared to heavier feedstocks used in conventional methods. This results in an efficient and environmentally friendly process with high product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts.
