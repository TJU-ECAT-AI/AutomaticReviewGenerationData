The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than the traditional oil-based sources used in conventional methods. It also enhances process efficiency through optimized catalytic reactions, leading to higher yields of propylene. Furthermore, PDH technology improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher proportion of propylene in the output compared to other methods.
