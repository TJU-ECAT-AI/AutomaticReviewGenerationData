[1] "Mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3."
[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers significant advantages over conventional methods."
[3] "PDH technology specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than the traditional oil-based sources used in conventional methods. It also enhances process efficiency through optimized catalytic reactions, leading to higher yields of propylene. Furthermore, PDH technology improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher proportion of propylene in the output compared to other methods.

[1] "Mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI prepared via vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI with GaCl3."
[2] "The use of propane as a feedstock offers several advantages over traditional methods, including improved process efficiency, enhanced product selectivity, and increased flexibility in feedstock availability."
[3] "Conventional methods often rely on heavy hydrocarbons as feedstocks, which can limit their scalability and environmental impact due to issues like sulfur content and higher boiling points."
[4] "PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane, a lighter hydrocarbon that is more abundant and less expensive compared to heavier feedstocks."
[5] "This results in a more efficient and environmentally friendly process, as PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps or additional purification."
[6] "Furthermore, PDH technology demonstrates high product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts, which improves both economic viability and environmental performance."
