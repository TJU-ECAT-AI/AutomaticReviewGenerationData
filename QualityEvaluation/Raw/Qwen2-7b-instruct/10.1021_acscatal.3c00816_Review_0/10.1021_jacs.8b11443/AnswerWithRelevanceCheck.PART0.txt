          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than traditional oil-based sources. It enhances process efficiency through optimized catalytic reactions, leading to higher yields of propylene. Additionally, PDH improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher proportion of propylene in the output compared to other methods.

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology provides several advantages over conventional production methods. These include improved process efficiency, enhanced product selectivity, and increased flexibility in feedstock availability. PDH utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is more abundant and less expensive than heavier feedstocks used in traditional methods. This leads to an efficient and environmentally friendly process with high product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts.
