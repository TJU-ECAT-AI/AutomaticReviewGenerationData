1. The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its capability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, bypassing the need for cracking processes that are typically required in conventional methods. PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing a readily accessible and abundant feedstock, propane, which is easier to handle and transport compared to oil or natural gas used in traditional methods. It also improves process efficiency by avoiding the energy-intensive steps involved in cracking and refining. Additionally, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, producing high-quality propylene with minimal byproducts, thus offering a cleaner and more sustainable production route.
