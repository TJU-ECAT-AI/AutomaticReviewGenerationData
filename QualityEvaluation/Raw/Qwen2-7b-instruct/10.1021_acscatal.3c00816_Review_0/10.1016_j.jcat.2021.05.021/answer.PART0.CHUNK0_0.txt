<p>However, in addition to the exposure of active sites, the smaller particle size also results in the lower Tammann temperatures and the higher surface energy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the metalsupport interaction plays a major role in the dispersion of metals.</p>
<p>The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been directly linked to the presence of electronic defects on the surfaces of oxides such as oxygen vacancies.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been confirmed that the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate of Al3+ sites (Al3+penta site) presented in commercial γ-Al2O3 can act as binding sites for anchoring metals.</p>
<p>With 27Al MAS NMR, HRTEM and XRD techniques, we have been able to measure the amount of Al3+penta site and the Ru particle size over various catalysts.</p>
<p>Clearly, the surface area of comm-γ-Al2O3 is much higher than that of CUA.</p>
<p>This high dispersion of Ru species is suggested to result from that the Ru atoms are anchored preferentially on the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites.</p>
<p>It reveals that there is a strong correlation between surface deformation and Ru-support interaction energies.</p>
<p>The most stable Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) configuration is obtained by added an additional Ru atom in various configurations to the most stable Run-1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0).</p>
<p>Clearly, Ru size play a major role for benzene hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The Ru dispersion of Ru/CUA-A higher than 100% may be attributed to the twin adsorption of CO on Ru/CUA-A.</p>
<p>For our work, the calculated benzene adsorption energy over Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) exhibits the following rules ( Fig. 6 a and Fig. S16 ): Eads(C6H6-Ru2) > Eads(C6H6-Ru1) > Eads(C6H6-Ru4) > Eads(C6H6-Ru3).</p>
<p>Under this premise, due to the the consistent size of Ru particle size between Ru/CUA-N and Ru2 cluster model, the Ru/CUA-N reasonably exhibits the highest activity among the tested catalysts with regard to benzene hydrogenation conversion and TOFs.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its efficient use of feedstocks, improved process efficiency, and enhanced product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: Unlike traditional methods that rely on crude oil or natural gas, PDH technology uses propane, which is more abundant and readily available as a feedstock. This makes the process more sustainable and reduces dependency on fossil fuels.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH processes are designed to operate at high temperatures and pressures, allowing for a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. This results in higher yields and lower energy consumption compared to conventional methods.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH technology typically produces a higher proportion of propylene with fewer byproducts, improving the purity and quality of the final product. This enhances the economic viability and marketability of the propylene produced.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the limitations of traditional production methods.
