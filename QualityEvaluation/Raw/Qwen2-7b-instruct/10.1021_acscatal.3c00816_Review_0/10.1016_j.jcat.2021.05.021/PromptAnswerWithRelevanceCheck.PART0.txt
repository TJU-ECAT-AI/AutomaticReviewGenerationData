<quotes>
<p>However, in addition to the exposure of active sites, the smaller particle size also results in the lower Tammann temperatures and the higher surface energy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the metalsupport interaction plays a major role in the dispersion of metals.</p>
<p>The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been directly linked to the presence of electronic defects on the surfaces of oxides such as oxygen vacancies.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been confirmed that the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate of Al3+ sites (Al3+penta site) presented in commercial γ-Al2O3 can act as binding sites for anchoring metals.</p>
<p>With 27Al MAS NMR, HRTEM and XRD techniques, we have been able to measure the amount of Al3+penta site and the Ru particle size over various catalysts.</p>
<p>Clearly, the surface area of comm-γ-Al2O3 is much higher than that of CUA.</p>
<p>This high dispersion of Ru species is suggested to result from that the Ru atoms are anchored preferentially on the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites.</p>
<p>It reveals that there is a strong correlation between surface deformation and Ru-support interaction energies.</p>
<p>The most stable Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) configuration is obtained by added an additional Ru atom in various configurations to the most stable Run-1/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0).</p>
<p>Clearly, Ru size play a major role for benzene hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The Ru dispersion of Ru/CUA-A higher than 100% may be attributed to the twin adsorption of CO on Ru/CUA-A.</p>
<p>For our work, the calculated benzene adsorption energy over Run/γ-Al2O3(1 0 0) exhibits the following rules ( Fig. 6 a and Fig. S16 ): Eads(C6H6-Ru2) > Eads(C6H6-Ru1) > Eads(C6H6-Ru4) > Eads(C6H6-Ru3).</p>
<p>Under this premise, due to the the consistent size of Ru particle size between Ru/CUA-N and Ru2 cluster model, the Ru/CUA-N reasonably exhibits the highest activity among the tested catalysts with regard to benzene hydrogenation conversion and TOFs.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its efficient use of feedstocks, improved process efficiency, and enhanced product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: Unlike traditional methods that rely on crude oil or natural gas, PDH technology uses propane, which is more abundant and readily available as a feedstock. This makes the process more sustainable and reduces dependency on fossil fuels.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH processes are designed to operate at high temperatures and pressures, allowing for a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. This results in higher yields and lower energy consumption compared to conventional methods.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH technology typically produces a higher proportion of propylene with fewer byproducts, improving the purity and quality of the final product. This enhances the economic viability and marketability of the propylene produced.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the limitations of traditional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势在于其对原料的高效利用、过程效率的提升以及产物选择性的增强。PDH技术通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料获取：与依赖原油或天然气的传统方法不同，PDH技术使用更为丰富且易于获取的丙烷作为原料。这使得工艺更加可持续，并减少了对化石燃料的依赖。

2. 过程效率：PDH工艺设计在高温高压下运行，能够更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，相较于传统方法具有更高的产出率和更低的能量消耗。

3. 产物选择性：PDH技术通常能产生更高比例的丙烯，同时减少副产品的生成，提高了最终产品的纯度和质量。这增强了丙烯生产的经济性和市场竞争力。

综上所述，PDH技术提供了一种更为可持续、高效和选择性的丙烯生产方法，解决了传统生产方法的局限性。

This literature focuses on the synthesis and characterization of a new alumina support named CUA, which contains a high percentage of pentacoordinate aluminum sites. It is designed to anchor and disperse metal catalysts like Ru and Pd effectively. The CUA support enables the preparation of highly dispersed metal catalysts with improved stability and activity. The literature does not provide specific details on the application of PDH technology for propylene production or how it compares to conventional methods. However, it does discuss the benefits of using such advanced materials in catalytic processes, which could potentially enhance the efficiency, selectivity, and feedstock utilization in propylene production. The key advantages highlighted in this context are the high dispersion of metals, stability of the catalyst, and the potential for improved selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. The literature does not directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods, but it suggests that the use of optimized supports like CUA could lead to improvements in these areas.
