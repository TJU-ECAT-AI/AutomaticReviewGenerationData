[1] "Propane is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals and of great practical value in various reactions such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses."
[2] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene."
[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst."
[5] "The development of efficient catalysts with high selectivities for propene and excellent anti-coking abilities is therefore important."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its unique advantages. Key advantages of PDH technology include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically, PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a feedstock, bypassing the limitations of fossil oil resources that are increasingly scarce. This makes PDH more sustainable and ensures a continuous supply of raw materials for propylene production.

PDH technology also boasts higher process efficiency compared to conventional methods. By converting propane directly into propylene without the intermediate steps of steam cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking, PDH minimizes energy consumption and operational costs. This streamlined process enhances both economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, PDH technology offers superior product selectivity, ensuring that a high percentage of the output is propylene. This is crucial as propylene is a versatile chemical used in the production of numerous downstream products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. High selectivity means less waste and greater profitability.

To address the challenges posed by hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation at high temperatures, which can degrade catalyst performance, PDH technology incorporates advanced catalysts and promoter systems. The addition of Sn promoters, for instance, enhances the selectivity and anti-coking abilities of Pt-based catalysts, maintaining high activity and stability throughout the reaction.

Innovative synthesis methods, such as the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis described in the document, enable the creation of highly ordered mesoporous materials like Sn-SBA-15. These materials effectively confine and stabilize Pt nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration and enhancing the dispersion of metal particles. This leads to improved catalytic performance and stability, critical factors for achieving optimal propene yields while minimizing coke formation.

The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst, with its optimized Sn loading, demonstrates the highest propene selectivity (98.5%) and corresponding propane conversion (43.8%) after 6 hours of operation. This exceptional performance, combined with a low deactivation parameter (12.6%), highlights the effectiveness of PDH technology in producing propylene efficiently and sustainably, with minimized environmental impact and high product quality.

在对全球日益增长的丙烯需求的背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为最有可能用于丙烯生产的途径。PDH技术具有独特的优势，能够解决传统生产方法面临的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。具体而言，PDH技术利用作为原料的丰富且易得的丙烷，避免了化石油资源日益稀缺的问题，确保了丙烯生产所需的稳定原料供应。

PDH技术还提供了比传统方法更高的过程效率。通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需进行蒸汽裂解或流化床催化裂解等中间步骤，PDH技术减少了能源消耗和运营成本。这一精简的过程不仅提升了经济竞争力，而且增强了环境可持续性。

此外，PDH技术提供了优于产品的选择性，确保了高比例的输出为丙烯。这对于丙烯的广泛应用，包括聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物和乙腈合成至关重要。高度的选择性意味着更少的浪费和更高的盈利能力。

为了应对高温下由碳氢化合物裂解和焦炭形成带来的催化剂性能下降问题，PDH技术采用了先进的催化剂和促进系统。例如，添加Sn促进剂可以增强基于铂的催化剂的选择性和抗结焦能力，从而维持高活性和稳定性。

创新的合成方法，如文档中描述的一锅法水热合成，使得像Sn-SBA-15这样的高度有序介孔材料的创建成为可能。这些材料有效地限制和稳定了铂纳米颗粒，防止了聚集并提高了金属粒子的分散度。这导致了改善的催化性能和稳定性，对于实现最优的丙烯产量以及最小化焦炭形成至关重要。

以优化Sn负载的Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂为例，其显示出最高丙烯选择性（98.5%）和相应的丙烷转化率（43.8%）在6小时的操作后。结合低失活参数（12.6%），这突显了PDH技术在高效和可持续地生产丙烯的同时，减少环境影响和保持高质量产品的有效性。
