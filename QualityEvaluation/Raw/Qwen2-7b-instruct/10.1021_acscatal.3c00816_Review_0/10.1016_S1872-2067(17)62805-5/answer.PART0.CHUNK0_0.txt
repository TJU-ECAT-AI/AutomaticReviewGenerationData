[1] "Propane is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals and of great practical value in various reactions such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses."
[2] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene."
[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst."
[5] "The development of efficient catalysts with high selectivities for propene and excellent anti-coking abilities is therefore important."
[6] "Considerable research has been devoted to developing methods such as promoter addition for improving the catalytic performances of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[7] "The introduction of Sn promoters into a Pt-based catalytic system effectively improves the catalytic activity, resistance to coke formation, and operating lifetime of the catalyst."
[8] "The Sn promoter modifies the properties of Pt-based catalysts via geometric and electronic effects."
[9] "The reported methods for introduction of a Sn promoter almost all involve traditional post-synthesis procedures."
[10] "The one-pot synthesis improved the efficiency of the Sn promoter compared with that achieved using the traditional impregnation method."
[11] "The Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 showed excellent catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation."
[12] "The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample showed the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%, and the lowest deactivation parameter (12.6%) after reaction for 6 h."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, thus ensuring a reliable supply of raw material for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Unlike traditional methods, PDH requires high temperatures to produce propene, which leads to increased energy consumption. However, the technology aims to optimize the process to minimize waste and maximize the yield of propene.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers superior selectivity towards propene production compared to conventional methods, reducing unwanted by-products such as ethylene and acetylene. This higher selectivity ensures a cleaner and more efficient production process.

4. **Resistance to Coke Formation**: Conventional methods often suffer from coke formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation and decreased productivity. PDH, through the strategic use of promoters like tin (Sn), enhances the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation, thereby maintaining high activity and stability over time.

5. **Improved Catalyst Performance**: The introduction of tin (Sn) promoters in Pt-based catalysts for PDH significantly improves their catalytic activity, resistance to coke formation, and operational longevity. This is crucial for sustaining high yields and minimizing downtime in industrial settings.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology offers a sustainable and efficient pathway for propylene production, making it a preferred method in the industry.
