[1] "Propane is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals and of great practical value in various reactions such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses."
[2] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene."
[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst."
[5] "The development of efficient catalysts with high selectivities for propene and excellent anti-coking abilities is therefore important."
[6] "The reported methods for introduction of a Sn promoter almost all involve traditional post-synthesis procedures."
[7] "Such processes often give uneven distributions of Sn species, and block the pores and channels, leading to a decrease in the surface area and loss of efficiency of the Sn promoter."
[8] "This paper describes the preparation of homogeneous Sn-SBA-15 composites using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method."
[9] "The one-pot synthesis improved the efficiency of the Sn promoter compared with that achieved using the traditional impregnation method."
[10] "The best catalytic performance, with an optimal initial propane conversion of 43.8% and propene selectivity of 98.5%, was achieved with the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample."
[11] "The stabilities of the catalysts decreased in the order Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/1Sn-SBA-15 > Pt/0.5Sn/SBA-15-IM > Pt/2Sn-SBA-15."
[12] "The changes in the surface morphologies of the catalysts after the catalytic performance tests were investigated using TEM."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a byproduct of natural gas processing and petrochemical refining. This makes it a viable alternative to the more traditional but often scarce crude oil, which is the primary feedstock for conventional propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers higher process efficiency compared to conventional methods. The high-temperature conditions required for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction can lead to a more streamlined and potentially more energy-efficient process, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of a well-designed catalyst in PDH, particularly those containing tin (Sn) incorporated into SBA-15 mesoporous materials, enhances the selectivity towards propene. This results in a higher yield of propene with minimal byproducts, improving the economic viability of the process. The one-pot hydrothermal method described in the document ensures better dispersion of Sn species, leading to improved promoter efficiency and catalyst performance.

4. **Anti-Coking Abilities**: PDH technologies incorporate catalysts that exhibit excellent anti-coking abilities. This means they can operate at higher temperatures without experiencing significant decreases in activity and stability due to coke formation, a common issue in high-temperature reactions like steam cracking. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst, for instance, demonstrated the best propene selectivity and stability, with a high initial propane conversion and low deactivation parameter after prolonged operation.

In conclusion, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective pathway for propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by conventional methods through optimized catalyst design and process engineering.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战，包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。

1. **原料可用性**：PDH技术利用的是作为天然气加工和石油化工副产品的丙烷，这使得它成为与传统的、往往稀缺的原油相比，更可获得的丙烯生产原料。这种原料的广泛可用性为PDH技术提供了经济基础。

2. **过程效率**：与传统方法相比，PDH技术在更高的温度下运行，这些温度是脱氢反应所需的，这可能使过程更加高效，从而降低运营成本并减少环境影响。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术中使用的催化剂，特别是那些将锡（Sn）整合到SBA-15多孔材料中的催化剂，可以增强丙烯的选择性。这意味着它可以产生更高比例的丙烯，同时减少副产品的生成，提高过程的经济可行性。文档中描述的一锅法热合成方法确保了Sn物种更好的分散，从而提高了促进剂效率和催化剂性能。

4. **抗结焦能力**：PDH技术采用的催化剂具有出色的抗结焦能力。这意味着它们可以在较高的温度下操作，而不会因结焦导致活性和稳定性显著下降的问题，这是在高温反应如蒸汽裂解中常见的问题。例如，Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂展示了最佳的丙烯选择性和稳定性，具有高初始丙烷转化率和长时间运行后的低失活参数。

总之，PDH技术提供了一种可持续、高效且选择性的丙烯生产途径，通过优化催化剂设计和过程工程，解决了传统方法面临的挑战。
