Questions:
1. What are the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production?

Answers:
1. PDH utilizes propane, an abundant and readily available feedstock, which addresses the challenge of feedstock availability.
2. It offers higher process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene, bypassing intermediate steps.
3. PDH provides superior product selectivity, minimizing unwanted byproducts like coke formation.
4. It has a lower environmental impact due to reduced energy consumption and fewer byproducts.
5. PDH is cost-effective due to the abundance of propane as a raw material.

Chinese Version:
1. PDH利用了丰富的丙烷作为原料，解决了原料供应的挑战。
2. 它通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，提高了过程效率，跳过了中间步骤。
3. PDH提供了优于产品的选择性，最大程度地减少了不希望产生的副产品，如焦炭形成。
4. 它对环境的影响较小，因为减少了能源消耗和副产品的产生。
5. PDH具有经济性，由于丙烷是一种丰富的原料。
