[1] "Propane is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals and of great practical value in various reactions such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses."
[2] "Steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha are common processes for the commercial synthesis of propene."
[3] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene."
[5] "Problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst."
[6] "The development of efficient catalysts with high selectivities for propene and excellent anti-coking abilities is therefore important."
[7] "Considerable research has been devoted to developing methods such as promoter addition for improving the catalytic performances of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "The introduction of Sn promoters into a Pt-based catalytic system effectively improves the catalytic activity, resistance to coke formation, and operating lifetime of the catalyst."
[9] "Sn promoters modify the properties of Pt-based catalysts via geometric and electronic effects."
[10] "The reported methods for introduction of a Sn promoter almost all involve traditional post-synthesis procedures."
[11] "Such processes often give uneven distributions of Sn species, and block the pores and channels, leading to a decrease in the surface area and loss of efficiency of the Sn promoter."
[12] "This paper describes the preparation of homogeneous Sn-SBA-15 composites using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method."
[13] "In contrast to traditional methods, the direct synthesis of Sn-SBA-15 can prevent pore clogging and achieve a good distribution of Sn species in the silica matrix."
[14] "The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 enables it to confine and stabilize Pt nanoparticles and prevent particle agglomeration, making it a good host."
[15] "However, an incorporation of an excessive amount of Sn weakened the interactions between Sn species and the support, resulting in an increased amount of metallic Sn."
[16] "The Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 showed excellent catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation."
[17] "The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample showed the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%, and the lowest deactivation parameter (12.6%) after reaction for 6 h."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available feedstock, instead of relying on expensive and scarce fossil oil resources. Secondly, PDH technology enhances process efficiency by enabling higher temperatures and pressures that allow for the conversion of propane into propylene with greater yields compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha. Lastly, PDH technology improves product selectivity by minimizing the formation of byproducts such as coke, which is a significant issue in conventional production methods, thereby reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

Answer: PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing readily available propane as a feedstock, enhancing process efficiency through higher temperatures and pressures, and minimizing byproduct formation, thus improving operational cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability.
