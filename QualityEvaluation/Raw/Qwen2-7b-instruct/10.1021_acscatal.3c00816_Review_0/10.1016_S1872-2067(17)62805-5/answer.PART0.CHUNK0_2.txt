<p>Propane is an important raw material in the production of various chemicals and of great practical value in various reactions such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile syntheses.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene.</p>
<p>Problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst.</p>
<p>Cr-based catalysts have been extensively researched, but their practical applications are limited because of severe pollution by chromium.</p>
<p>Pt-based catalysts show good initial activities in propane dehydrogenation; this is because Pt activates CH bonds without promoting CC cleavage.</p>
<p>However, undesired thermal cracking and coke deposition rapidly deactivate these catalysts.</p>
<p>The development of efficient catalysts with high selectivities for propene and excellent anti-coking abilities is therefore important.</p>
<p>The reported methods for introduction of a Sn promoter almost all involve traditional post-synthesis procedures.</p>
<p>This paper describes the preparation of homogeneous Sn-SBA-15 composites using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method.</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional methods, the direct synthesis of Sn-SBA-15 can prevent pore clogging and achieve a good distribution of Sn species in the silica matrix.</p>
<p>The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 enables it to confine and stabilize Pt nanoparticles and prevent particle agglomeration, making it a good host.</p>
<p>Under severe reaction conditions, fast sintering of Pt metal particles occurs easily when interactions between Pt species and the support are weak.</p>
<p>This causes rapid hydrogenolysis and a decline in the propene selectivity because this undesired side reaction relies on the presence of large Pt clusters.</p>
<p>It has also been proposed that on the surface of a PtSn catalyst, the Pt active sites are present in two forms: M1 and M2 sites.</p>
<p>M1 sites are multiple Pt centers generated from Pt directly loaded on the support surface, and Pt particles anchored on the SnOx surfaces in sandwich structures correspond to M2 sites.</p>
<p>Generally, M1 sites are responsible for side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and coking, and M2 sites are the main active sites for propane dehydrogenation.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the following key advantages:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and inexpensive as a feedstock. This contrasts with conventional methods that might rely on scarce and expensive raw materials.

2. Process Efficiency: PDH offers higher energy efficiency compared to traditional processes. By directly converting propane to propylene, it bypasses intermediate steps, reducing energy consumption and costs.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH provides a high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing unwanted byproducts such as coke formation. This leads to cleaner and more efficient production of propylene.

4. Environmental Impact: PDH has a lower environmental impact than conventional methods due to its reduced need for energy and fewer byproducts. This aligns with sustainability goals in chemical production.

5. Cost-Effectiveness: Given the abundant availability of propane, PDH is cost-effective. Its ability to produce propylene efficiently and with high selectivity makes it a more economical option compared to traditional methods that might require more complex and costly feedstocks.

In summary, PDH technology stands out as a promising solution for propylene production due to its advantages in feedstock availability, process efficiency, product selectivity, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness.
