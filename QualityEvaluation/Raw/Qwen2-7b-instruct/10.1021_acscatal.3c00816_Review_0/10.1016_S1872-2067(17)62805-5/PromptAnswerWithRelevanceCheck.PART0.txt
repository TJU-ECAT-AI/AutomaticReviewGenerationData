In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, thus ensuring a reliable supply of raw material for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Unlike traditional methods, PDH requires high temperatures to produce propene, which leads to increased energy consumption. However, the technology aims to optimize the process to minimize waste and maximize the yield of propene.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers superior selectivity towards propene production compared to conventional methods, reducing unwanted by-products such as ethylene and acetylene. This higher selectivity ensures a cleaner and more efficient production process.

4. **Resistance to Coke Formation**: Conventional methods often suffer from coke formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation and decreased productivity. PDH, through the strategic use of promoters like tin (Sn), enhances the catalyst's ability to resist coke formation, thereby maintaining high activity and stability over time.

5. **Improved Catalyst Performance**: The introduction of tin (Sn) promoters in Pt-based catalysts for PDH significantly improves their catalytic activity, resistance to coke formation, and operational longevity. This is crucial for sustaining high yields and minimizing downtime in industrial settings.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology offers a sustainable and efficient pathway for propylene production, making it a preferred method in the industry.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a byproduct of natural gas processing and petrochemical refining. This makes it a viable alternative to the more traditional but often scarce crude oil, which is the primary feedstock for conventional propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers higher process efficiency compared to conventional methods. The high-temperature conditions required for the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction can lead to a more streamlined and potentially more energy-efficient process, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of a well-designed catalyst in PDH, particularly those containing tin (Sn) incorporated into SBA-15 mesoporous materials, enhances the selectivity towards propene. This results in a higher yield of propene with minimal byproducts, improving the economic viability of the process. The one-pot hydrothermal method described in the document ensures better dispersion of Sn species, leading to improved promoter efficiency and catalyst performance.

4. **Anti-Coking Abilities**: PDH technologies incorporate catalysts that exhibit excellent anti-coking abilities. This means they can operate at higher temperatures without experiencing significant decreases in activity and stability due to coke formation, a common issue in high-temperature reactions like steam cracking. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst, for instance, demonstrated the best propene selectivity and stability, with a high initial propane conversion and low deactivation parameter after prolonged operation.

In conclusion, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective pathway for propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by conventional methods through optimized catalyst design and process engineering.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its unique advantages. Key advantages of PDH technology include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically, PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a feedstock, bypassing the limitations of fossil oil resources that are increasingly scarce. This makes PDH more sustainable and ensures a continuous supply of raw materials for propylene production.

PDH technology also boasts higher process efficiency compared to conventional methods. By converting propane directly into propylene without the intermediate steps of steam cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking, PDH minimizes energy consumption and operational costs. This streamlined process enhances both economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, PDH technology offers superior product selectivity, ensuring that a high percentage of the output is propylene. This is crucial as propylene is a versatile chemical used in the production of numerous downstream products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. High selectivity means less waste and greater profitability.

To address the challenges posed by hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation at high temperatures, which can degrade catalyst performance, PDH technology incorporates advanced catalysts and promoter systems. The addition of Sn promoters, for instance, enhances the selectivity and anti-coking abilities of Pt-based catalysts, maintaining high activity and stability throughout the reaction.

Innovative synthesis methods, such as the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis described in the document, enable the creation of highly ordered mesoporous materials like Sn-SBA-15. These materials effectively confine and stabilize Pt nanoparticles, preventing agglomeration and enhancing the dispersion of metal particles. This leads to improved catalytic performance and stability, critical factors for achieving optimal propene yields while minimizing coke formation.

The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst, with its optimized Sn loading, demonstrates the highest propene selectivity (98.5%) and corresponding propane conversion (43.8%) after 6 hours of operation. This exceptional performance, combined with a low deactivation parameter (12.6%), highlights the effectiveness of PDH technology in producing propylene efficiently and sustainably, with minimized environmental impact and high product quality.
