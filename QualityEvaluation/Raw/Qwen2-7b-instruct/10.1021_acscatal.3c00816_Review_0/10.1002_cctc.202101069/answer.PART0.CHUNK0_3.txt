The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically tackles these issues by utilizing readily available propane feedstock, achieving higher efficiency in propylene production, and minimizing byproduct generation. Compared to traditional methods that rely on expensive platinum or toxic chromium oxide catalysts, PDH offers cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits due to the use of low-cost zinc oxide (ZnO) catalysts. The PDH process demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and stability, particularly when employing zinc oxide species dispersed and stabilized on silicalite-1 (S-1) support. This setup ensures high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, making PDH a promising method for propylene production.

PDH技术的优势在于解决丙烯生产中的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。PDH通过使用易于获取的丙烷作为原料，实现更高效率的丙烯生产，并且减少了副产品的生成。与依赖昂贵铂金或有毒铬氧化物催化剂的传统方法相比，PDH凭借低成本的锌氧化物（ZnO）催化剂提供了成本效益和环境优势。通过在硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）支持下分散和稳定锌氧化物种，PDH过程表现出优异的催化活性和稳定性，特别体现在高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性上，使其成为丙烯生产的有前景方法。
