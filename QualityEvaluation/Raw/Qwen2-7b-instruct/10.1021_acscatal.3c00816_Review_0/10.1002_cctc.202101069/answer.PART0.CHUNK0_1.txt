The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and readily available from natural gas sources. This makes it a more flexible option compared to traditional methods that often require crude oil as a primary feedstock, which can be more scarce and subject to geopolitical issues.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, minimizing energy use and waste generation. This leads to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly production method, especially when compared to conventional cracking processes that produce a wide range of hydrocarbons with varying degrees of purity.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology offers better control over the selectivity of the reaction, favoring the formation of propylene over other byproducts. This results in a higher yield of propylene, which is crucial for downstream chemical production processes that rely on this compound.

4. **Cost-effectiveness**: Zinc oxide (ZnO) based catalysts used in PDH processes are cheaper and more environmentally benign compared to precious metals like platinum and chromium oxide. This reduces the overall cost of production and enhances economic viability.

5. **Stability and Efficiency**: The study demonstrates that the silicalite-1 (S-1) supported ZnO catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance in PDH reactions. The 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst, in particular, shows a high propylene yield with a stable performance over time, indicating efficient and reliable operation.

6. **Environmental Impact**: PDH processes generate fewer byproducts and waste compared to conventional methods, leading to a lower environmental impact. This aligns with global efforts to reduce pollution and promote cleaner energy production.

These advantages collectively position PDH technology as a promising method for propylene production, offering a viable alternative to traditional processes that face limitations in terms of feedstock availability, efficiency, selectivity, cost, and environmental sustainability.

这些优势共同将PDH技术定位为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，提供了一种替代传统过程的可行选择，这些过程在原料可用性、效率、产品选择性、成本和环境可持续性方面存在限制。

1. **原料可用性**：与传统的生产方法相比，PDH技术利用丰富的丙烷作为原料，这种原料可以从天然气来源中获取。这使得它比通常需要原油作为主要原料的传统方法更具灵活性，后者可能更为稀缺，并且受地缘政治问题的影响。

2. **过程效率**：PDH过程旨在高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时尽量减少能源使用和废物产生。这导致了一种更可持续和环保的生产方法，特别是与传统裂解过程相比，后者产生各种不同纯度的烃类化合物，其纯度各不相同。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术能够更好地控制反应的选择性，优先形成丙烯，而不是其他副产品。这导致了更高比例的丙烯产出，对于依赖此化合物的下游化学生产过程至关重要。

4. **经济性**：用于PDH过程的锌氧化物（ZnO）催化剂比铂金等贵金属和铬氧化物便宜，并且更加环境友好。这降低了生产成本并提高了经济效益。

5. **稳定性和效率**：研究显示，硅酸铝（S-1）支持的ZnO催化剂在PDH反应中表现出出色的催化性能。5%Zn/S-1催化剂特别显示出高丙烯产出率，并在长时间运行后保持稳定性能，表明操作高效且可靠。

6. **环境影响**：与传统方法相比，PDH过程产生的副产品和废物较少，导致更低的环境影响。这符合全球减少污染和促进清洁能源生产的努力。

这些优势总体上使PDH技术成为丙烯生产的一个有吸引力的选项，提供了一种具有竞争力的替代方案。
