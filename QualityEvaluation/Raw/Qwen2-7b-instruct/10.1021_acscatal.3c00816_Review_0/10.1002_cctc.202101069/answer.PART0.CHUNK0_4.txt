[1] "Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
[2] "However, the high cost of Pt, strong toxicity of CrOx in addition to the fast deactivation still hinder their wide applications."
[3] "Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts,11-15 Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties."
[4] "Compared with high-priced Platinum and toxic Chromium oxide, ZnO based catalysts attract wide attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly character."
[5] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
[6] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
[7] "This study may open a promising way for development of highly efficient PDH catalysts."
[8] "For comparision, ZnO supported on SiO2, Al2O3 and high-silica H-ZSM-5 were also synthesized for PDH reaction."
[9] "Considering the thermodynamic constraints, PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C."
[10] "The propylene yield are summarized in TableS1, which shows that 5%Zn/S-1 gives a highest yield (44.0%) among the studied catalysts."
[11] "Although 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5 gives a higher initial propane conversion (66.2%) than 5%Zn/S-1, its initial propylene selectivity is only 39.8% thus exhibiting a low propylene yield of only 26.3%."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing readily available propane derived from natural gas, particularly through improved hydraulic fracturing techniques. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on expensive and limited crude oil feedstocks. Secondly, PDH offers improved process efficiency as it generates propylene directly from propane without the need for additional cracking steps, reducing energy consumption and costs. Moreover, PDH has the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to conventional methods, enhancing environmental sustainability. Lastly, PDH enables higher product selectivity, particularly when compared to catalysts like Pt and CrOx, which are not only expensive but also toxic. The use of ZnO-based catalysts, in particular, stands out for their low-cost and environmentally friendly nature, making them an attractive alternative for propylene production through PDH.
