Propyne direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible propane from sources like shale gas extraction, which is more abundant and cost-effective compared to traditional methods. Secondly, PDH offers greater process efficiency, as it minimizes byproduct generation, unlike conventional methods that often produce unwanted副products. Lastly, PDH provides superior product selectivity, ensuring that the majority of the converted material is propylene, thus optimizing the yield and purity of the final product.
