In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH offers the advantage of less byproducts, making it a more environmentally friendly process compared to conventional methods. Secondly, PDH utilizes readily available propane as a feedstock, addressing the challenge of feedstock scarcity in traditional production methods. Thirdly, PDH processes can achieve high propylene selectivity, enhancing the efficiency of propylene production. Lastly, the use of zinc oxide (ZnO) based catalysts in PDH processes is economically favorable due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. Among various metal-based catalysts, Zn-based catalysts have garnered significant interest due to their low-cost and eco-friendly characteristics. Isolated zinc ions (Zn2+) and nanosized ZnO assemblies have shown active behavior in PDH reactions, with the intrinsic activity of these catalysts being further enhanced by the promotion of ZrO2 with TiO2. Additionally, ZnO-based catalysts display superior stability compared to their counterparts. The study highlighted in the document introduces a novel approach by constructing Zn-containing catalysts using in-situ hydrothermal synthesis, identifying partially reduced zinc cations as the active sites. This demonstrates the potential for developing highly efficient PDH catalysts, contributing to the advancement of propylene production technologies.
