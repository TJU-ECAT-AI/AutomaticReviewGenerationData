<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to produce propylene directly from propane, bypassing the need for intermediate products. This method addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by improving feedstock availability through the use of more readily accessible propane sources. It enhances process efficiency by simplifying the production steps and potentially reducing energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology optimizes product selectivity, yielding high purity propylene as the primary output.
