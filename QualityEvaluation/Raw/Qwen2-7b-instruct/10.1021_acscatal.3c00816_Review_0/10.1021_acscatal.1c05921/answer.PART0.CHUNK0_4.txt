<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is the most promising method due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for oxidation, thereby potentially improving feedstock availability and reducing energy consumption compared to traditional methods.
