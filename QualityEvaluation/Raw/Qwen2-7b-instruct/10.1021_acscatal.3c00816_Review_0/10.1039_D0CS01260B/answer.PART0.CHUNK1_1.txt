[1] "The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount."
[2] "For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."
[3] "The apparent activation energy of the PDH reactions declines from 245 to 165 kJ mol1 with increasing V loading in the V/Al catalysts, indicating the structural change in the active V sites over these catalysts."
[4] "The volcano-shape variation of the TOF values further suggests that the isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active in comparison with other V sites."
[5] "The in situ DRIFT spectral results demonstrate that the vanadium propyl (V-C3H7) and vanadium propenyl (V-C3H5) species may serve as the reaction intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane and further transformation into propylene."
[6] "For the 60-VOxSiO2-580 catalyst (60 and 580 represent the temperature of gelation and calcination, respectively), the propane conversion shows a decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h PDH reaction, and the propylene selectivity remains 91% over eight cycles of reaction and regeneration."
[7] "The presence of surface OH groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are proved to be strongly connected with the intrinsic PDH activity and the coke formation process, based on the results of the in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations."
[8] "In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction."
[9] "According to the examination results of the free energies for the alkane dehydrogenation reactions over Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites, [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ serve as the stable Ga cationic species in the reduced catalyst, showing higher activity in comparison with the isolated Brnsted acid site and the Ga+ site."
[10] "The kinetic results demonstrate that [GaH]2+ cations in the Ga/H-MFI zeolite display two orders of magnitude higher TOF for PDH relative to cracking, and one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding TOFs over the Ga-free H-MFI zeolite."
[11] "The β-H elimination from the C3H7 fragment is identified as the rate-determining step for the PDH pathway, while the attack of CC bond in the same propyl fragment by the Brnsted acid sites is regarded as the rate-determining step for cracking."
[12] "The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during the synthesis of the gallosilicate MFI zeolites causes significantly increased content of the strong Lewis acid sites and a higher ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, for enhancing the PDH activity and propylene selectivity."
[13] "For the modified Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ba, the high dispersion state of β-Ga2O3 species on the α-Al2O3 is confirmed to be independent of the presence of Ba additives, and the tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites are covered with Ba atoms."
[14] "Considering that the AlOGa bond facilitates the heterolytic activation of propane CH bond, the mononuclear Ga1 sites supported on γ-Al2O3 display a significantly higher PDH activity than the dinuclear Ga2Ox sites on SiO2."
[15] "The surface acidbase property of the GaAl2O3 catalysts determines the binding energy of dissociated hydrogen, which serves as a descriptor to predict the overall dehydrogenation reaction rates."
[16] "The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes."
[17] "For the Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with cobalt nitrate, the Co loading at lower levels (<10%) results in the formation of the surface CoAl spinel with tetrahedral Co2+ ions that contribute to selectively activating the CH bonds of propane and to producing propylene."
[18] "However, the Co/Al2O3 catalysts with a higher Co loading of >10% consist of only large Co3O4 assemblies that can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles to cause dramatically serious side-reactions including CC cracking and coking."
[19] "The Al2O3 morphology can significantly affect the structure and the catalytic property of the isolated Co2+ ions as the active sites."
[20] "The 5 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles disperse on the surface of the Al2O3 support for the Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, whereas the Co2+ ions embed into the Al2O3 matrix and occupy the tetrahedral Al3+ sites to form a local spinel structure."
[21] "The effects of Si-additive modification on the Co2+Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated."
[22] "The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions."
[23] "For the SnPd/SiO2 catalyst, the optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Sibeta catalyst displays 57% initial conversion and 96% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 600 C."
[24] "For the 3.9 wt% Zn/SiO2 catalyst, the crystalline SnO2 is fully reduced to metallic Sn after high-temperature reduction by H2, whereas the isolated Sn2+ species can be stabilized by their strong interactions with SiO2 matrix."
[25] "The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions."
[26] "The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include limited feedstock availability, inefficiencies in the process, and difficulties in achieving high product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these issues by utilizing propane as a versatile and abundant feedstock, offering a potentially more efficient and selective pathway for propylene production compared to traditional methods that often rely on crude oil-derived hydrocarbons.

2. The advantages of PDH technology include:
   - **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, a widely available and relatively inexpensive feedstock, making it more accessible and cost-effective compared to methods that require scarce or expensive crude oil.
