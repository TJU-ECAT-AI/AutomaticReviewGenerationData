[1] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, as shown below:"
[2] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "The binding energies of the weakest CH bonds are 444 and 361 kJ mol1 for ethylene and propylene, respectively."
[5] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
[6] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
[7] "To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production."
[8] "In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades."
[9] "Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years."
[10] "For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by efficiently and selectively activating the CH bond over the CC bond, suppressing the CC cleavage, and ensuring high olefin desorption. This leads to high product selectivity and avoids the formation of coke, which is a major issue in conventional processes. The PDH process allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for additional oxidation or cracking steps, making it more efficient and suitable for the mass manufacture of high-value chemicals and intermediates.

面对全球丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法。它通过高效选择性地激活CH键而非CC键、抑制CC裂解以及确保高烯烃脱附，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。这导致了高产品选择性和避免了焦炭形成，这是传统过程中的一大问题。PDH过程允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需额外的氧化或裂化步骤，使其在制造高价值化学品和中间体方面更有效率且更适合大规模生产。
