[1] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies."
[3] "To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these challenges in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as the feedstock, which is abundant and readily available from natural gas and refinery byproducts. This contrasts with conventional production methods that often rely on scarce and expensive resources such as coal or oil.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH operates at high temperatures under reductive atmospheres, which allows for efficient conversion of propane to propylene. This process is more energy-efficient compared to alternative methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which require higher temperatures and consume more energy.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH selectively produces propylene with high purity, minimizing the formation of byproducts and waste. This is achieved by controlling the activation of the CH bond over the CC bond, leading to a high yield of propylene and reduced formation of coke and other unwanted compounds.

To address the challenges, PDH technology focuses on developing catalysts that can efficiently activate the CH bond, selectively produce olefins, and maintain stability over time. The development of novel catalysts, such as single-atom catalysts and metal-support interactions, aims to improve the selectivity, efficiency, and longevity of PDH processes, making it a preferred choice for propylene production in the future.

基于全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面具有最前景的优势，主要体现在解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等方面。PDH技术通过以下方式具体应对这些挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料源自天然气和炼油副产品，资源丰富且易于获取。相比之下，传统生产方法往往依赖稀缺和昂贵的资源，如煤炭或石油。

2. **过程效率**：PDH在高温下运行，在还原气氛中进行，这使得丙烷高效转化为丙烯。与蒸汽裂解或流化床催化裂解等其他方法相比，PDH过程更节能。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH能够高纯度地生产丙烯，同时减少副产物和废物的形成。通过控制CH键的活化而非CC键活化，PDH实现了高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性的良好平衡。

为了解决挑战，PDH技术专注于开发能够有效激活CH键、选择性生成烯烃并保持长期稳定的催化剂。新型催化剂的发展，如单原子催化剂和金属-载体相互作用，旨在提高PDH过程的选择性、效率和寿命，使其成为未来丙烯生产的首选方法。
