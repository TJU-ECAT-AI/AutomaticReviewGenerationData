2.2.2. VOx In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins. In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration.133

The VOx catalysts, particularly when supported on MCM-41, are considered promising alternatives for propane direct dehydrogenation due to their low cost and high reactivity. They offer superior selectivity towards propylene and stability over multiple cycles compared to industrially relevant CrOx and PtSn catalysts. This makes them attractive for propylene production, addressing the need for efficient and selective methods that overcome the challenges of conventional production techniques.

VOx催化剂，特别是当它们被支持在MCM-41上时，被认为是丙烷直接脱氢的有前景的替代品，因为它们具有低成本和高活性。它们在非氧化性PDH反应和氧化再生的多个循环中表现出对丙烯的优越选择性和稳定性，与工业相关的CrOx和PtSn催化剂相比。这使得它们成为提高丙烯生产效率和选择性的有吸引力的方法，以应对传统生产技术面临的挑战。
