[1] "In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins."
[2] "The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration."
[3] "For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."

The supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are considered a promising alternative to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx)-based catalysts for the selective direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of light alkanes into olefins. These VOx catalysts offer superior selectivity to propylene and maintain their stability over multiple cycles of non-oxidative PDH reactions and oxidative regeneration, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx and PtSn catalysts on mesoporous materials like MCM-41. The dispersion of VOx species on the support significantly influences their catalytic activity and selectivity. As the surface density of VOx increases, it forms isolated vanadium (V), polymetric VOx, and crystalline V2O5 species, which exhibit different catalytic performances.

支持的钒氧化物（VOx）催化剂被认为是有潜力的替代铂和铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂，用于轻烷烃直接脱氢生成烯烃的选择性过程。这些VOx催化剂在非氧化性PDH反应和氧化再生过程中展现出对丙烯的优异选择性和稳定性，超越了工业上常用的CrOx和PtSn催化剂在MCM-41等多孔材料上的性能。VOx物种在支撑物上的分散程度显著影响其催化活性和选择性。随着表面密度的增加，会形成孤立的钒（V）、聚态VOx和晶格V2O5物种，它们表现出不同的催化性能。

[1] "The structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts are also improved by the selected support. A less than one monolayer Si/Al ratio of Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) strongly affects the catalytic activity and stability of the supported VOx species for the PDH reaction."
[2] "By changing the support from commercial γ-Al2O3 to ZrO2, a sixfold increased TOF value is achieved on the supported VOx catalyst for the PDH reaction, and the reaction rate increases linearly with increasing V loading until the loading reaches 2 wt% (Fig. 17a)."
[3] "The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) possess a well-defined 3D center-radial mesopore structure and a large pore diameter, allowing the isolated VO4 active sites to highly disperse with an appropriate concentration and facile accessibility and improving the internal diffusion of the relevant reactants."

Selected support materials significantly enhance the structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH). Using Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a Si/Al ratio below one monolayer, the catalytic activity and stability of supported VOx species in PDH reactions are notably improved. Transitioning from γ-Al2O3 to ZrO2 as the support results in a six-fold increase in the turnover frequency (TOF) value for the PDH reaction on VOx catalysts, with the reaction rate increasing linearly with vanadium (V) loading up to 2 wt%. Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with a defined 3D radial mesopore structure and large pore diameter enable the isolation of VO4 active sites that are dispersed with appropriate concentration, high accessibility, and improved internal diffusion of reactants.

[1] "In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction."
