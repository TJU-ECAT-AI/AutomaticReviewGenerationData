[1] "In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts."

[2] "For the VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration."

1. The VOx-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes of light alkanes have received more attention than the non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) reactions over supported VOx catalysts, which often lack detailed structure-reactivity relationships and catalytic mechanisms.

2. Supported VOx catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species show superior selectivity for propylene and longer time-on-stream stability compared to industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in non-oxidative PDH reactions and oxidative regeneration.

3. Supported VOx catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species demonstrate higher propylene selectivity and better stability over multiple cycles of non-oxidative PDH reactions and oxidative regeneration compared to industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts.

1. 对于VOx催化氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中的轻烷烃，与支持的VOx催化剂上的非氧化性脱氢反应相关的结构活性关系和催化机制的研究相对较少。

2. 高分散的VOx物种负载在VOx/MCM-41催化剂上显示出比工业相关的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/MCM-41催化剂更高的丙烯选择性和更长的流时稳定性，在非氧化性PDH反应和氧化再生过程中。

3. 在非氧化性PDH反应和氧化再生过程中，高分散的VOx物种负载在VOx/MCM-41催化剂上显示出比工业相关的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/MCM-41催化剂更高的丙烯选择性和更好的稳定性。
