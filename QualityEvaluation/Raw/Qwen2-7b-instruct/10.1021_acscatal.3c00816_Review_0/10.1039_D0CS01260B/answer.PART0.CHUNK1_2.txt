"In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts."
"The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as compared to conventional methods, include:
1. Improved selectivity and efficiency in converting propane to propylene.
2. Enhanced stability over multiple cycles of the PDH reaction and regeneration processes.
3. Potential for utilizing a wider range of feedstocks, potentially including those that are less abundant or harder to obtain through traditional methods.
4. Possibility of achieving higher product purity, leading to improved downstream processing capabilities and cost-effectiveness.
5. Reduced environmental impact due to the avoidance of oxidation processes, which can generate pollutants and require additional purification steps.
