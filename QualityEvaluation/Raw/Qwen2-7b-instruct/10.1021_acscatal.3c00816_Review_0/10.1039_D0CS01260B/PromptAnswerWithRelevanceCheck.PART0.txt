The supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are considered a promising alternative to platinum and chromium oxide (CrOx)-based catalysts for the selective direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of light alkanes into olefins. These VOx catalysts offer superior selectivity to propylene and maintain their stability over multiple cycles of non-oxidative PDH reactions and oxidative regeneration, outperforming industrially relevant CrOx and PtSn catalysts on mesoporous materials like MCM-41. The dispersion of VOx species on the support significantly influences their catalytic activity and selectivity. As the surface density of VOx increases, it forms isolated vanadium (V), polymetric VOx, and crystalline V2O5 species, which exhibit different catalytic performances.

[2] "By changing the support from commercial γ-Al2O3 to ZrO2, a sixfold increased TOF value is achieved on the supported VOx catalyst for the PDH reaction, and the reaction rate increases linearly with increasing V loading until the loading reaches 2 wt% (Fig. 17a)."
[3] "The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) possess a well-defined 3D center-radial mesopore structure and a large pore diameter, allowing the isolated VO4 active sites to highly disperse with an appropriate concentration and facile accessibility and improving the internal diffusion of the relevant reactants."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Selected support materials significantly enhance the structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH). Using Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a Si/Al ratio below one monolayer, the catalytic activity and stability of supported VOx species in PDH reactions are notably improved. Transitioning from γ-Al2O3 to ZrO2 as the support results in a six-fold increase in the turnover frequency (TOF) value for the PDH reaction on VOx catalysts, with the reaction rate increasing linearly with vanadium (V) loading up to 2 wt%. Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with a defined 3D radial mesopore structure and large pore diameter enable the isolation of VO4 active sites that are dispersed with appropriate concentration, high accessibility, and improved internal diffusion of reactants.

[1] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, as shown below:"
[2] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "The binding energies of the weakest CH bonds are 444 and 361 kJ mol1 for ethylene and propylene, respectively."
[5] "Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene."
[6] "Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes."
[7] "To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production."
[8] "In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades."
[9] "Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years."
[10] "For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by efficiently and selectively activating the CH bond over the CC bond, suppressing the CC cleavage, and ensuring high olefin desorption. This leads to high product selectivity and avoids the formation of coke, which is a major issue in conventional processes. The PDH process allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for additional oxidation or cracking steps, making it more efficient and suitable for the mass manufacture of high-value chemicals and intermediates.

[1] "The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount."
[2] "For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."
[3] "The apparent activation energy of the PDH reactions declines from 245 to 165 kJ mol1 with increasing V loading in the V/Al catalysts, indicating the structural change in the active V sites over these catalysts."
[4] "The volcano-shape variation of the TOF values further suggests that the isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active in comparison with other V sites."
[5] "The in situ DRIFT spectral results demonstrate that the vanadium propyl (V-C3H7) and vanadium propenyl (V-C3H5) species may serve as the reaction intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane and further transformation into propylene."
[6] "For the 60-VOxSiO2-580 catalyst (60 and 580 represent the temperature of gelation and calcination, respectively), the propane conversion shows a decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h PDH reaction, and the propylene selectivity remains 91% over eight cycles of reaction and regeneration."
[7] "The presence of surface OH groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are proved to be strongly connected with the intrinsic PDH activity and the coke formation process, based on the results of the in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations."
[8] "In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction."
[9] "According to the examination results of the free energies for the alkane dehydrogenation reactions over Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites, [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ serve as the stable Ga cationic species in the reduced catalyst, showing higher activity in comparison with the isolated Brnsted acid site and the Ga+ site."
[10] "The kinetic results demonstrate that [GaH]2+ cations in the Ga/H-MFI zeolite display two orders of magnitude higher TOF for PDH relative to cracking, and one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding TOFs over the Ga-free H-MFI zeolite."
[11] "The β-H elimination from the C3H7 fragment is identified as the rate-determining step for the PDH pathway, while the attack of CC bond in the same propyl fragment by the Brnsted acid sites is regarded as the rate-determining step for cracking."
[12] "The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during the synthesis of the gallosilicate MFI zeolites causes significantly increased content of the strong Lewis acid sites and a higher ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, for enhancing the PDH activity and propylene selectivity."
[13] "For the modified Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ba, the high dispersion state of β-Ga2O3 species on the α-Al2O3 is confirmed to be independent of the presence of Ba additives, and the tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites are covered with Ba atoms."
[14] "Considering that the AlOGa bond facilitates the heterolytic activation of propane CH bond, the mononuclear Ga1 sites supported on γ-Al2O3 display a significantly higher PDH activity than the dinuclear Ga2Ox sites on SiO2."
[15] "The surface acidbase property of the GaAl2O3 catalysts determines the binding energy of dissociated hydrogen, which serves as a descriptor to predict the overall dehydrogenation reaction rates."
[16] "The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes."
[17] "For the Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with cobalt nitrate, the Co loading at lower levels (<10%) results in the formation of the surface CoAl spinel with tetrahedral Co2+ ions that contribute to selectively activating the CH bonds of propane and to producing propylene."
[18] "However, the Co/Al2O3 catalysts with a higher Co loading of >10% consist of only large Co3O4 assemblies that can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles to cause dramatically serious side-reactions including CC cracking and coking."
[19] "The Al2O3 morphology can significantly affect the structure and the catalytic property of the isolated Co2+ ions as the active sites."
[20] "The 5 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles disperse on the surface of the Al2O3 support for the Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, whereas the Co2+ ions embed into the Al2O3 matrix and occupy the tetrahedral Al3+ sites to form a local spinel structure."
[21] "The effects of Si-additive modification on the Co2+Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated."
[22] "The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions."
[23] "For the SnPd/SiO2 catalyst, the optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Sibeta catalyst displays 57% initial conversion and 96% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 600 C."
[24] "For the 3.9 wt% Zn/SiO2 catalyst, the crystalline SnO2 is fully reduced to metallic Sn after high-temperature reduction by H2, whereas the isolated Sn2+ species can be stabilized by their strong interactions with SiO2 matrix."

In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration.133

[1] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production because it offers unique advantages compared to conventional methods. It specifically addresses challenges such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike other methods that utilize methanol, Fischer-Tropsch processes, or alkane oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides as oxidants, PDH processes exclusively produce olefins, offering a high degree of selectivity.

2. The PDH processes involve activation of the CH bond over the CC bond, which is favored due to the geometric effect. However, controlling the selectivity towards CH cleavage versus CC cleavage is critical because of the different binding energies of their respective bonds. The average binding energies are 347 kJ/mol for the CC bond and 414 kJ/mol for the CH bond.

3. Efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of CC cleavage is essential for the performance of EDH and PDH catalysts. This is because propane and ethane have different adsorption-desorption properties, necessitating the use of appropriate catalysts to achieve high selectivity towards olefins. Given propylene's lower stability compared to ethylene, special attention must be paid to the PDH reaction.

4. In consideration of the differences in adsorption-desorption properties between propane and ethane, utilizing suitable catalysts becomes necessary to achieve high selectivity for olefins in both direct dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in PDH reactions where propylene's stability poses a challenge.

1.PDH技术被认为是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法，因为它提供了与传统方法相比的独特优势。它特别解决了原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。与使用甲醇、费歇尔-特罗斯特过程或含氧气体（如氧气、二氧化碳和氮氧化物）的烷烃氧化脱氢相比，PDH过程仅能独家生产烯烃，提供高度的选择性。

2.PDH过程涉及在几何效应的推动下激活CH键而非CC键。然而，控制CH裂解相对于CC裂解的选择性是关键的，因为它们各自的键的结合能量不同。平均结合能量分别为CC键的347 kJ/mol和CH键的414 kJ/mol。

3.为了提高EDH和PDH催化剂的性能，需要高效且选择性地激活CH键并抑制CC裂解。考虑到丙烷和乙烷在吸附-脱附性质上的差异，使用适当的催化剂以实现烯烃的高度选择性变得必要。鉴于丙烯稳定性较低与乙烷相比，PDH反应尤其需要关注。

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods are as follows:

1. High temperature requirement: PDH requires high temperatures to effectively activate the CH bonds in propane and ethane, leading to olefin production. This addresses the challenge of feedstock stability and the need for high-yield olefin products.

2. Selective activation: PDH focuses on selectively activating the CH bonds rather than the CC bonds, which are more stable in ethane and propane. This ensures efficient conversion and high olefin selectivity.

3. Product selectivity: The PDH process yields primarily olefins as target products, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This aligns with the high demand for olefins in downstream chemical production.

4. Catalyst stability: PDH utilizes catalysts designed to maintain structure stability during the high-temperature reactions, mitigating issues like coke formation and catalyst deactivation. 

5. Synthesis strategies: Advanced synthesis methods and in situ characterization techniques enable the development of novel catalysts that overcome the limitations of conventional catalysts, improving activation, desorption, and anti-coking abilities.

6. Insights into key processes: Detailed studies on the structure-property relationships in PDH catalysts help in understanding the activation, adsorption-desorption, and coking mechanisms, leading to more efficient and selective catalyst designs.

In summary, PDH technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by optimizing activation mechanisms, catalyst design, and process conditions.
