[1] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to efficiently address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these challenges in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: By utilizing propane as a feedstock, PDH technology can exploit the abundant natural gas resources that are often rich in propane. This addresses the limitations faced by conventional methods that might rely on scarce or expensive feedstocks.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes operate at high temperatures under reductive atmospheres, which allows for the selective activation of the CH bond over the CC bond, leading to high yields of olefins. This contrasts with conventional methods that might involve multiple steps or have lower efficiencies.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The selective activation of the CH bond ensures that the PDH process predominantly produces olefins, which are highly valuable chemicals. This selective production is critical for maintaining high product quality and maximizing economic benefits compared to conventional methods that might produce a broader range of potentially less valuable products.

4. **Regeneration Challenges**: While frequent regeneration of the used catalyst is necessary to remove coke, this process can be resource-intensive and costly. PDH technology aims to optimize catalyst stability and longevity to reduce the frequency of regeneration, thereby minimizing these challenges. Advanced catalyst design and synthesis strategies have been employed to enhance catalyst stability and reduce coke formation.

In summary, PDH technology offers a promising solution for propylene production by addressing the key challenges associated with conventional methods, thereby enabling more efficient, sustainable, and economically viable production processes.
