[1] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."
[2] "Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production because it offers unique advantages compared to conventional methods. It specifically addresses challenges such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike other methods that utilize methanol, Fischer-Tropsch processes, or alkane oxidative dehydrogenation with oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides as oxidants, PDH processes exclusively produce olefins, offering a high degree of selectivity.

2. The PDH processes involve activation of the CH bond over the CC bond, which is favored due to the geometric effect. However, controlling the selectivity towards CH cleavage versus CC cleavage is critical because of the different binding energies of their respective bonds. The average binding energies are 347 kJ/mol for the CC bond and 414 kJ/mol for the CH bond.

3. Efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of CC cleavage is essential for the performance of EDH and PDH catalysts. This is because propane and ethane have different adsorption-desorption properties, necessitating the use of appropriate catalysts to achieve high selectivity towards olefins. Given propylene's lower stability compared to ethylene, special attention must be paid to the PDH reaction.

4. In consideration of the differences in adsorption-desorption properties between propane and ethane, utilizing suitable catalysts becomes necessary to achieve high selectivity for olefins in both direct dehydrogenation reactions, particularly in PDH reactions where propylene's stability poses a challenge.

1.PDH技术被认为是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法，因为它提供了与传统方法相比的独特优势。它特别解决了原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。与使用甲醇、费歇尔-特罗斯特过程或含氧气体（如氧气、二氧化碳和氮氧化物）的烷烃氧化脱氢相比，PDH过程仅能独家生产烯烃，提供高度的选择性。

2.PDH过程涉及在几何效应的推动下激活CH键而非CC键。然而，控制CH裂解相对于CC裂解的选择性是关键的，因为它们各自的键的结合能量不同。平均结合能量分别为CC键的347 kJ/mol和CH键的414 kJ/mol。

3.为了提高EDH和PDH催化剂的性能，需要高效且选择性地激活CH键并抑制CC裂解。考虑到丙烷和乙烷在吸附-脱附性质上的差异，使用适当的催化剂以实现烯烃的高度选择性变得必要。鉴于丙烯稳定性较低与乙烷相比，PDH反应尤其需要关注。

4.考虑到丙烷与乙烷在吸附-脱附性质上的差异，使用合适的催化剂以实现两种直接脱氢反应中烯烃的高度选择性变得必要，特别是在PDH反应中，由于丙烯的稳定性构成挑战。
