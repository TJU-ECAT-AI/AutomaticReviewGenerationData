[1] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."
[2] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."
[3] "Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts."
[4] "For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability."
[5] "Previous excellent reviews have broadly elaborated the activation of light alkanes as well as the DH or ODH reactions of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene."
[6] "In this review, the novel catalysts mainly reported within the last five years are outlined for EDH and PDH reactions, considering that several newly developed synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques have been adopted to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels."
[7] "The relationships between the structure and properties of these catalysts in key processes, including CH and CC activation, adsorption-desorption, and coking, are also discussed for facing the challenges existing in the alkane DH processes."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods are as follows:

1. High temperature requirement: PDH requires high temperatures to effectively activate the CH bonds in propane and ethane, leading to olefin production. This addresses the challenge of feedstock stability and the need for high-yield olefin products.

2. Selective activation: PDH focuses on selectively activating the CH bonds rather than the CC bonds, which are more stable in ethane and propane. This ensures efficient conversion and high olefin selectivity.

3. Product selectivity: The PDH process yields primarily olefins as target products, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This aligns with the high demand for olefins in downstream chemical production.

4. Catalyst stability: PDH utilizes catalysts designed to maintain structure stability during the high-temperature reactions, mitigating issues like coke formation and catalyst deactivation. 

5. Synthesis strategies: Advanced synthesis methods and in situ characterization techniques enable the development of novel catalysts that overcome the limitations of conventional catalysts, improving activation, desorption, and anti-coking abilities.

6. Insights into key processes: Detailed studies on the structure-property relationships in PDH catalysts help in understanding the activation, adsorption-desorption, and coking mechanisms, leading to more efficient and selective catalyst designs.

In summary, PDH technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by optimizing activation mechanisms, catalyst design, and process conditions.
