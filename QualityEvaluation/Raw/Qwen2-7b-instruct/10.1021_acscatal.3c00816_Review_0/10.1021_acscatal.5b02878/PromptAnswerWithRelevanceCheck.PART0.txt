<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges posed by conventional production methods. It minimizes the usage of platinum, a critical yet expensive catalyst, thereby reducing costs. Additionally, PDH offers improved catalytic stability, ensuring longer operational periods without significant degradation in performance. This technology specifically tackles the issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing a more sustainable catalyst and enhancing the yield and purity of propylene production.
