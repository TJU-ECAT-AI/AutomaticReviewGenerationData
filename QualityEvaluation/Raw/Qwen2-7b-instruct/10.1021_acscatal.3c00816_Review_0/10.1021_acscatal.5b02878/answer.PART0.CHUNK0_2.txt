Propyne direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize the growing global demand for propyne. This technology specifically tackles the limitations of traditional production methods in three key areas: feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By employing platinum-modified ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts, PDH achieves minimized platinum usage and improved catalytic stability, thereby enhancing its performance in propane dehydrogenation.
