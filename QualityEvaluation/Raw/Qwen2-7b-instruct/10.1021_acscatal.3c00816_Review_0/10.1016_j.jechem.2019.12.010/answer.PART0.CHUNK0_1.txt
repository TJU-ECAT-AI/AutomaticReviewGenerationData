<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas.</p>
<p>However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life.</p>
<p>It was reported that the low-coordinated Cr3+ species were the active sites for PDH, but they tended to aggregate, leading to low activity and regenerability.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that metal species supported on nanocarbons exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions, due to the presence of strong interactions between metal and nanocarbon supports.</p>
<p>Zeolites, possessing high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability and tunable acidity, can be used as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>In particular, ZSM-5 zeolite has a channel of 0.56 × 0.51 nm, a little larger than propane (0.47 nm), which might be good for propane adsorption.</p>
<p>De Moor et al. and Tranca et al. have reported that the adsorption of propane in HZSM-5 zeolite was exothermic, where the adsorption of propane on Brnsted acid sites was much easier than propane adsorbed in the channels of HZSM-5 zeolite.</p>
<p>The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a great challenge.</p>
<p>Here a series of CrOx catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability.</p>
<p>The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was elucidated on the basis of the physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The key advantages of PDH technology include:

1. Addressing feedstock availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane resources, particularly those derived from shale gas, which are increasingly accessible and economically viable.

2. Enhancing process efficiency: By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH bypasses the need for intermediate hydrogenation steps, potentially reducing energy consumption and costs compared to traditional processes that require additional steps to produce propylene.

3. Improving product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of byproducts and waste, which is beneficial for both environmental sustainability and economic efficiency.

The challenges in PDH technology, such as the formation of coke and the aggregation of active Cr3+ species, are being addressed through the development of advanced catalysts, like those supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites. These catalysts exhibit high activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability, making them a promising solution for achieving both high efficiency and selectivity in propylene production through PDH. The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in the catalysts, along with the physicochemical characterizations and Na+ doping experiments, contribute to understanding and optimizing the PDH process for improved performance.
