<p>For various reasons, CrOx-Al2O3 based catalysts have been commercially utilized in Catofin process [1 ,4 ,5]. However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life.</p>
<p>In the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to increase the stability of CrOx catalysts by loading them onto porous supports such as SBA-15, mesoporous carbon and ordered mesoporous ZrO2 [11 ,18 ,19]. After Cr species are supported, their physicochemical properties (e.g., reducibility, dispersion, structure and electronic properties) would be greatly changed [1 ,12 ,13]. It was reported that the low-coordinated Cr3+ species were the active sites for PDH, but they tended to aggregate, leading to low activity and regenerability [1 ,4 ,5 ,20]. For instance, Cr species supported on ZrO2 were observed to deactivate faster than Cr/Al2O3 in PDH due to the presence of weak metal-support interactions between Cr species and ZrO2 [13]. Also, it was reported that metal species supported on nanocarbons exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions, due to the presence of strong interactions between metal and nanocarbon supports [21],[22],[23]. Therefore, the selection of supports for preparation of Cr-based catalysts for PDH is of great significance.</p>
<p>Zeolites, possessing high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability and tunable acidity, can be used as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions [24],[25],[26],[27],[28],[29]. In particular, ZSM-5 zeolite has a channel of 0.56 × 0.51 nm, a little larger than propane (0.47 nm) [30], which might be good for propane adsorption. De Moor et al. [31] and Tranca et al. [32] have reported that the adsorption of propane in HZSM-5 zeolite was exothermic, where the adsorption of propane on Brnsted acid sites was much easier than propane adsorbed in the channels of HZSM-5 zeolite. In recent years, several studies have reported that metal species (such as ZnO, GaOx and MoOx) supported on HZSM-5 zeolites exhibited high catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation to olefin, however, the high acidity of HZSM-5 led to serious secondary reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation [33],[34],[35],[36]. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a great challenge.</p>
<p>Here a series of CrOx catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was investigated in detail. For comparison, CrOx catalysts supported on commonly used supports (i.e., Al2O3 and SiO2) were synthesized for PDH, which exhibited much lower catalytic performance than Cr/HZSM-5(260).</p>
<p>The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique (Figs. 4 and S7). As shown in Fig. 4(a), the NH3-TPD curves of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts display an obvious signal in the temperature range of 50–600°C, which can be deconvoluted into three Gaussian peaks centered at around 130–160, 190–240 and 400–430°C, respectively, corresponding to the physically adsorbed NH3 (peak α), weakly acid sites (peak β) and strongly acid sites (peak γ), respectively [43],[44],[45]. It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites) [44,45].</p>
<p>During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature would result in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. In general, coke hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites [50]. So, the anti-coking capability of catalysts is very crucial for PDH catalysts. To quantify the coke content, 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts after different reaction periods are tested by TG analysis. And the 5%Cr/Al2O3 sample after 5 h time on stream was also tested for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6, 5%Cr/Al2O3-5 h displays a weight loss of 5.7% from 300 to 600°C. However, 5%Cr/Z-5(260)5 h possesses a slight weight loss of 0.6%, indicating the formation of only a little coke. After 50 h time-on-stream, a weight loss of 5.8% can be detected over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260)50 h sample, which is comparable to that of 5%Cr/Al2O3-5 h (5.7%). This illustrates that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst system possesses strong anti-coking capability in PDH process, in good agreement with its excellent catalytic stability (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Generally, the interactions between react/product molecules and catalysts are very important in dehydrogenation process [1],[2],[3],[4],[9],[10],[11]. Here C3H8/C3H6-TPD experiments over the CrOx catalyst supported on different supports were carried out in the temperature range of 100–600°C (Fig. 7).</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 7(a), all the Cr/Z-5 catalysts exhibit an obvious C3H8 desorbed signal in the temperature range of 150–500°C. In particular, the peak centers of Cr/Z-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, i.e., the peak centers of Cr/Z-5(260), Cr/Z-5(80), Cr/Z-5(43) and Cr/Z-5(28) are 312, 320, 335 and 396°C, respectively. This indicates that the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support can affect the interactions between propane and 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts. For better understanding the role of HZSM-5 support, the HZSM-5(260) zeolite was tested by C3H8-TPD (Fig. S8). Interestingly, HZSM-5(260) possesses an obvious propane desorbed signal in the temperature range of 200–500°C, indicating the presence of a certain interaction between propane and HZSM-5 support.</p>
<p>On the basis of C3H8/C3H6-TPD results, it can be found that Brnsted acid sites in zeolite are good for propane adsorption and activation, however, too high amount of Brnsted acid sites in zeolite would result in deep dehydrogenation, cracking and/or coke formation. Gong et al. have reported that the strongly adsorbed propylene upon catalyst would be deep dehydrogenated and/or cracked, which is negative for PDH process [53,54]. Also, Song et al. reported that the adjacent Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite (ZSM-5 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) displayed higher alkane cracking activity than isolated Brnsted acid site due to the presence of more positive intrinsic activation entropies at the adjacent Brnsted acid sites [37]. So, HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable amount of acidic sites would be very crucial for Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH reaction. The detail discussion and experimental results are provided in Section 3.5.3.</p>
