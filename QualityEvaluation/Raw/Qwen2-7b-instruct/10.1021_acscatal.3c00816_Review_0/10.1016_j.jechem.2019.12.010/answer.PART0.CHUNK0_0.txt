[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas."
[2] "However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life."
[3] "For various reasons, CrOx-Al2O3 based catalysts have been commercially utilized in Catofin process."
[4] "It was reported that the low-coordinated Cr3+ species were the active sites for PDH, but they tended to aggregate, leading to low activity and regenerability."
[5] "Therefore, the selection of supports for preparation of Cr-based catalysts for PDH is of great significance."
[6] "Zeolites, possessing high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability and tunable acidity, can be used as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions."
[7] "In particular, ZSM-5 zeolite has a channel of 0.56 × 0.51 nm, a little larger than propane ( 0.47 nm) [30], which might be good for propane adsorption."
[8] "However, the high acidity of HZSM-5 led to serious secondary reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
[9] "The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a great challenge."
[10] "Here a series of CrOx catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."
[11] "This study may provide an important instruction to design and synthesize stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses several key challenges. Firstly, PDH technology allows for the utilization of abundant shale gas as a feedstock, which is often more readily available compared to traditional sources used in conventional propylene production methods. This not only ensures a steady supply of raw material but also opens up new avenues for energy diversification. Secondly, PDH technology is known for its high process efficiency, enabling the conversion of propane to propylene with minimal waste and energy loss. Lastly, PDH technology offers superior product selectivity, meaning it can produce propylene with less by-product formation, which is crucial for optimizing yields and reducing environmental impact. These advantages collectively position PDH technology as a viable and efficient solution for propylene production in the face of increasing demand and evolving market needs.
