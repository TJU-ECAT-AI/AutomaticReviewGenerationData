<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas.</p>
<p>However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life.</p>
<p>The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make.</p>
<p>At the WHSV of 0.59 h<sup>−1</sup>, a propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> (32.6% propane conversion and 94.2% propylene selectivity) can be maintained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream.</p>
<p>With increasing the WHSV to 5.9 h<sup>−1</sup>, a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> can be obtained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream.</p>
<p>Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing challenges in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically:

1. PDH technology efficiently utilizes abundant propane feedstock derived from shale gas, ensuring a reliable and scalable supply source for propylene production.
2. It offers improved process efficiency compared to conventional methods, as evidenced by the high propylene formation rates achieved, even at high weight hourly space velocities (WHSV).
3. PDH technology demonstrates excellent product selectivity, with high propylene yields maintained over extended operational periods, indicating superior stability and reduced side reactions.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly attractive for propylene production, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional manufacturing methods.
