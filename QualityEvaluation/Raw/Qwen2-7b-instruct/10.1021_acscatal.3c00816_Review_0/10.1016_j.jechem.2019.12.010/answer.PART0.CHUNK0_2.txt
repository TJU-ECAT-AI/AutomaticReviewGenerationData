[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas."
[2] "However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life."
[3] "The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make."
[4] "At a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h1, a propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat1 h1 ( 32.6% propane conversion and  94.2% propylene selectivity) can be maintained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream."
[5] "This result is much better than previous reported Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive processes like steam cracking or reforming that are typically used in conventional methods. This approach addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

Conventional methods often rely on hydrocarbons like naphtha or natural gas, which can be scarce or subject to price fluctuations. PDH, on the other hand, utilizes propane, which is widely available and abundant. This ensures a more reliable and cost-effective feedstock supply.

In terms of process efficiency, PDH is notably more energy-efficient than traditional methods. It requires less energy input and produces fewer byproducts, leading to lower operational costs and environmental impact.

Regarding product selectivity, PDH demonstrates superior performance. The document highlights that at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h1, the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst maintained a high propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat1 h1, representing 32.6% propane conversion and 94.2% propylene selectivity. This is a significant improvement over previously reported Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, showcasing the enhanced selectivity and efficiency of PDH technology.

In summary, PDH stands out due to its ability to use readily available propane as a feedstock, its improved energy efficiency, and its exceptional product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production in addressing the challenges posed by conventional methods.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了一系列关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，跳过了传统方法中常用的蒸汽裂解或重整等昂贵且耗能的过程。这在解决传统生产方法面临的原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性问题方面具有优势。

传统方法通常依赖于诸如石脑油或天然气这样的碳氢化合物，这些资源可能稀缺或价格波动。而PDH则利用广泛可用且丰富的丙烷作为原料，确保了更可靠和成本效益的原料供应。

在过程效率方面，PDH显示出更高的效率。它需要较少的能量输入，并产生更少的副产品，从而降低了运营成本和环境影响。

关于产品选择性，PDH表现出显著的优越性。文献指出，在重量小时空速（WHSV）为0.59 h1的情况下，5%Cr/Z-5(260)催化剂保持了高丙烯生成速率4.1 mmol gcat1 h1，代表了32.6%丙烷转化率和94.2%丙烯选择性。这一结果明显优于之前报道的Pt-和CrOx基催化剂，展示了PDH技术在提高选择性和效率方面的增强性能。

综上所述，PDH凭借其使用易于获得的丙烷作为原料的能力、改进的能源效率以及出色的产品选择性，在解决传统方法面临的挑战方面脱颖而出，使其成为最具前景的丙烯生产方法。
