[1] "The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites."
[2] "This method of ultrafast encapsulation opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity."
[3] "The resultant Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 showed excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[4] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate compounds."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production because it directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for intermediate compounds. This approach addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Conventional methods often struggle with feedstock availability, process inefficiencies, and low product selectivity. PDH technology ensures a steady supply of propylene, which is crucial given the growing global demand. It enhances process efficiency by reducing the number of steps required for propylene production. Additionally, it improves product selectivity, producing pure propylene with minimal waste. By overcoming these challenges, PDH technology offers a sustainable and efficient solution for propylene production.
