Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps, thereby addressing the challenges of conventional production methods related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By bypassing the need for large quantities of naphtha or natural gas, PDH reduces dependency on traditional feedstocks, which may be limited or subject to price fluctuations. This method enhances process efficiency by eliminating the energy-intensive steps required for cracking and purification in traditional methods. Moreover, PDH offers superior product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene, which is critical for industries requiring this chemical as a raw material. The use of metal nanoclusters encapsulated in zeolites in PDH catalysis exemplifies how this technology can achieve high conversion rates and maintain stability over multiple cycles, making it particularly advantageous in terms of operational reliability and economic feasibility.
