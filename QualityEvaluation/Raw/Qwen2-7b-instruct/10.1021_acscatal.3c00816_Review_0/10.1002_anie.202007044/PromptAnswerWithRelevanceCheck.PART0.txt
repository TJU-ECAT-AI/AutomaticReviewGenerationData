Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps, thereby addressing the challenges of conventional production methods related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By bypassing the need for large quantities of naphtha or natural gas, PDH reduces dependency on traditional feedstocks, which may be limited or subject to price fluctuations. This method enhances process efficiency by eliminating the energy-intensive steps required for cracking and purification in traditional methods. Moreover, PDH offers superior product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene, which is critical for industries requiring this chemical as a raw material. The use of metal nanoclusters encapsulated in zeolites in PDH catalysis exemplifies how this technology can achieve high conversion rates and maintain stability over multiple cycles, making it particularly advantageous in terms of operational reliability and economic feasibility.

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. Firstly, PDH technology effectively tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources, unlike traditional methods that may require scarce or expensive feedstocks. Secondly, PDH demonstrates high process efficiency by directly converting propane into propylene without the intermediate steps needed in conventional methods, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs. Lastly, PDH offers superior product selectivity, minimizing the formation of byproducts and improving the purity and yield of propylene. The ultrafast encapsulation method described in the literature provides a novel approach to creating highly active and stable catalysts for PDH, specifically by encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites. This technique allows for the rapid formation of nanoclusters and synchronization with zeolite crystallization, resulting in enhanced catalyst performance and stability. The addition of tin (Sn) plays a crucial role in controlling the size and dispersion of platinum (Pt) nanoclusters, further optimizing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The successful application of this method is evidenced by the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst's exceptional performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, maintaining high conversion rates and selectivities even after multiple reaction and regeneration cycles at high temperatures.
