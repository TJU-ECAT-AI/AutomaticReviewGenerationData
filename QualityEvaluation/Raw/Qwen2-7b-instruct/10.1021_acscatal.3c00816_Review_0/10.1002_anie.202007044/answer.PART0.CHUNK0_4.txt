In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology ensures better feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and widely available. Secondly, it improves process efficiency by providing a direct pathway for propylene production, bypassing the need for intermediate steps that are common in traditional methods. Lastly, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, allowing for a higher yield of propylene with minimal byproducts. This combination of factors makes PDH a highly efficient and sustainable approach to propylene production, particularly in response to the increasing demand for this critical chemical.
