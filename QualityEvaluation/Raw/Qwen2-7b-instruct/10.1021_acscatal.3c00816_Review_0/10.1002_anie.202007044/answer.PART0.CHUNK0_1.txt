Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. Firstly, PDH technology effectively tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources, unlike traditional methods that may require scarce or expensive feedstocks. Secondly, PDH demonstrates high process efficiency by directly converting propane into propylene without the intermediate steps needed in conventional methods, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs. Lastly, PDH offers superior product selectivity, minimizing the formation of byproducts and improving the purity and yield of propylene. The ultrafast encapsulation method described in the literature provides a novel approach to creating highly active and stable catalysts for PDH, specifically by encapsulating metal nanoclusters into zeolites. This technique allows for the rapid formation of nanoclusters and synchronization with zeolite crystallization, resulting in enhanced catalyst performance and stability. The addition of tin (Sn) plays a crucial role in controlling the size and dispersion of platinum (Pt) nanoclusters, further optimizing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The successful application of this method is evidenced by the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst's exceptional performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, maintaining high conversion rates and selectivities even after multiple reaction and regeneration cycles at high temperatures.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它能够有效解决几个关键挑战。首先，PDH技术通过利用丰富的丙烷资源来解决原料供应问题，与传统方法需要稀缺或昂贵的原料不同。其次，PDH技术通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需传统方法所需的中间步骤，从而提高过程效率并降低能耗和成本。最后，PDH技术提供了更优的产品选择性，最大限度地减少了副产品的生成，并提高了丙烯的纯度和产率。文献中描述的超快速封装方法提供了一种创建高度活性和稳定的催化剂的新途径，特别是通过将金属纳米簇封装到沸石中。这种方法允许快速形成纳米簇并与沸石结晶同步，从而提高催化剂性能和稳定性。添加锡（Sn）对控制铂（Pt）纳米簇的大小和分散起到至关重要的作用，进一步优化催化剂的活性和选择性。成功应用此方法的证据体现在Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯方面的出色表现，即使在高温下进行多次反应和再生循环后，仍能保持高转化率和选择性。
