[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent."
[2] "However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene."
[3] "In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process, FischerTropsch (FT) process, and propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."
[4] "In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."
[5] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to produce only propylene, unlike conventional methods that generate a mix of hydrocarbons. It directly addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing access to abundant feedstocks through fracking technology, adjusting to diverse reactions, and offering profitability due to the price difference between propylene and propane.

2.PDH technology ensures a higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods, which often produce a blend of hydrocarbons, including propylene. This selectivity is crucial in meeting the growing demand for pure propylene in various industries.

3.Conventional propylene production relies heavily on fossil fuels, leading to high CO2 emissions. PDH, on the other hand, offers a cleaner alternative by using propane as a feedstock, which is derived from natural gas and thus emits fewer greenhouse gases.

4.PDH technology is adaptable and can be modified to perform other reactions, making it a versatile process. This flexibility allows PDH factories to respond to market demands and operate efficiently.

5.The profitability of PDH is bolstered by the disparity between the prices of propylene and propane. As the demand for propylene increases, PDH becomes an increasingly lucrative option.

1.PDH技术是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它能够直接生产纯丙烯，而传统方法往往生成混合烃类。它解决了传统生产方法面临的主要挑战，通过压裂技术获取丰富的原料，适应多种反应，并且由于丙烯和丙烷的价格差异，实现高利润。

2.PDH技术的丙烯选择性高于传统方法，后者通常生成混合烃类，包括丙烯。这种选择性对于满足不断增长的丙烯需求至关重要。

3.传统丙烯生产严重依赖化石燃料，导致大量二氧化碳排放。相比之下，PDH使用天然气衍生的丙烷作为原料，排放较少的温室气体。

4.PDH技术灵活可调，可以进行多种反应，使其成为一种多功能过程。这种灵活性使PDH工厂能够响应市场需求并高效运行。

5.PDH的盈利能力得益于丙烯和丙烷价格的差异。随着丙烯需求的增长，PDH成为越来越有利可图的选择。
