[1] "In recent years, zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts, suggesting their great application prospects."
[2] "However, during the PDH reaction at high temperatures (500600 C), Al2O3-supported metal catalysts are usually subjected to severe metal sintering, resulting in a fast and irreversible loss in their activity, requiring frequent regeneration."
[3] "Zeolites are a class of crystalline nanoporous materials with large specific surface areas, well-defined and varisized microporous channels, and adjustable acidity and basicity, which have been widely applied in various industrial processes, exhibiting extraordinary catalytic activities and product selectivities."
[4] "Considering that there is a rising tide in the design and development of zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH processes, we aim to present a comprehensive summary of the advances in zeolite-supported metal catalysts, including zeolite-supported monometal catalysts, zeolite-supported bimetal catalysts, and zeolite-supported single-site catalysts, for PDH reactions, especially in the last five years."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is derived from shale gas, making it readily available and relatively inexpensive. This contrasts with conventional methods that rely on fossil fuels like naphtha and light diesel, which are subject to price fluctuations and supply chain complexities.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH is an on-purpose process designed specifically to produce propylene, eliminating the need for the multiple steps and waste streams associated with traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. This enhances overall process efficiency and reduces the environmental footprint.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH produces pure propylene without the byproducts generated by other methods, offering a cleaner and more focused output. This aligns with the growing market demands for high-purity propylene, which is essential in the manufacturing of polymers, oxygenates, and other chemical products.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness and Profitability**: With the advent of fracking technology, the feedstock for PDH becomes extremely cheap. Additionally, PDH factories are adaptable and can be utilized for various reactions beyond propylene production. The difference in price between propylene and propane, combined with the growing market for propylene, makes PDH highly profitable.

5. **Environmental Impact**: By reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing waste, PDH offers a more sustainable approach to propylene production, addressing the environmental concerns associated with traditional methods.

6. **Industrial Competition**: Established companies like Chevron and UOP have already developed proprietary technologies for PDH, such as Catofin and Oleflex, respectively, which have been patented since 1968 and 1970. These technologies have proven their effectiveness and reliability in the industry.

7. **Regulatory and Economic Factors**: The increasing demand for propylene, combined with stringent regulations on emissions and energy usage, pushes industries towards more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods like PDH.

PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a more cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally sustainable solution for propylene production, utilizing abundant and relatively cheap feedstocks, and offering a cleaner and more targeted product output.
