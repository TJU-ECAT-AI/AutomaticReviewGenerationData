[1] "In recent years, zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts, suggesting their great application prospects."
[2] "However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene."
[3] "Given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically."
[4] "In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."
[5] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."
[6] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."
[7] "Zeolite-supported metal catalysts show significantly improved thermal/hydrothermal stability during catalytic reactions, especially under harsh conditions and unique shape-selective catalytic performances."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene with high efficiency and selectivity, addressing the challenges faced by conventional methods. It specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

- **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes abundant propane from sources like shale gas, which is cheaper compared to traditional fossil fuels. This makes PDH a more economical choice.

- **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more direct and efficient process for propylene production, unlike conventional methods that involve multiple steps and processes, leading to lower efficiency.

- **Product Selectivity**: PDH has a higher propylene selectivity, producing propylene as the primary product without unwanted by-products, which improves economic viability and environmental impact.

2. Zeolite-supported metal catalysts significantly enhance PDH efficiency and stability by providing superior thermal/hydrothermal stability, which is crucial for maintaining activity and selectivity under high-temperature conditions. These catalysts also offer unique shape-selective catalytic performances, which contribute to high propylene yields and selectivity.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，并且效率和选择性都很高，解决了传统方法面临的一些挑战。它通过以下方式解决这些挑战：

- **原料供应**：PDH利用从页岩气中获得的大量廉价丙烷，这使得PDH在经济上更为可行。

- **过程效率**：PDH提供了一个更直接、更高效的丙烯生产过程，与传统的多步骤过程相比，效率更高。

- **产品选择性**：PDH具有更高的丙烯选择性，能够产生丙烯作为主要产品，而没有不需要的副产品，从而提高经济效益和环境影响。

2. 由沸石支持的金属催化剂显著提高了PDH的效率和稳定性，提供了出色的热/水热稳定性，这对于维持高温条件下的活性和选择性至关重要。这些催化剂还提供了独特的形状选择性催化性能，这有助于提高丙烯产率和选择性。
