Advances in zeolite-supported metal catalysts for propane dehydrogenation Propylene is one of the building blocks in modern industry and the feedstock for polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and other important chemicals. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most promising on-purpose technologies to produce propylene, and thus has attracted widespread attention from both the academic and industrial communities. In recent years, zeolite-supported metal catalysts have exhibited excellent activity and superhigh stability in PDH reactions, which even exceed that of industrial catalysts, suggesting their great application prospects.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene, bypassing the production of mixed hydrocarbon products. This method addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically, PDH technology utilizes inexpensive propane feedstocks derived from fracking, which are abundant and cheap. It also boasts high propylene selectivity, exceeding 99%, which is significantly higher than that of conventional methods. This high selectivity reduces the need for further separation processes, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
