[1] "In the past few years, multiple technologies for the production of propylene have been developed, such as the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process,4,5 FischerTropsch (FT) process,6 and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).7 Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products.715"

[2] "Given these circumstances, a highly efficient way to produce propylene is urgently need, both scientifically and economically."

[3] "In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[4] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[5] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

[6] "To date, platinum (Pt)- and chromic oxide (CrOx)-based catalysts are the most popular catalysts for these industrial processes, which generally use Al2O3 as a support to immobilize the metal species."

[7] "Zeolites are a class of crystalline nanoporous materials with large specific surface areas, well-defined and varisized microporous channels, and adjustable acidity and basicity, which have been widely applied in various industrial processes, exhibiting extraordinary catalytic activities and product selectivities."

[8] "In recent years, zeolites have also been regarded as ideal supports to anchor different types of metal species with high dispersity, achieving excellent performance in various heterogeneous catalysis."

[9] "Considering that there is a rising tide in the design and development of zeolite-supported metal catalysts for PDH processes, we aim to present a comprehensive summary of the advances in zeolite-supported metal catalysts, including zeolite-supported monometal catalysts, zeolite-supported bimetal catalysts, and zeolite-supported single-site catalysts, for PDH reactions, especially in the last five years."

1.Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its on-purpose nature, producing only propylene without creating hybrid hydrocarbon products. This contrasts with conventional methods that might produce a mix of products, complicating separation and purification processes. PDH also benefits from the availability of propane as a feedstock, which becomes cheap due to the advent of fracking technology. Its adjustable nature allows PDH factories to adapt to various reactions, offering flexibility and efficiency. The economic disparity between propylene and propane prices, coupled with the growing demand for propylene, makes PDH a highly profitable process.

2.A key challenge faced by conventional propylene production methods involves their reliance on fossil fuels, which are not only costly but also contribute significantly to CO2 emissions. PDH technology addresses this issue by utilizing propane, a resource that is abundant and cheaper due to the proliferation of shale gas. 

3.Conventional methods for propylene production typically involve cracking naphtha or light diesel oil, which are derived from crude oil. These processes require significant energy inputs and do not always yield high propylene selectivity, making them less efficient and less adaptable to market demands. PDH, on the other hand, offers a cleaner, more flexible, and potentially more cost-effective alternative, as it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for complex separation processes.

4.PDH technology also offers a significant advantage in terms of product selectivity. Unlike other methods that might produce a mixture of hydrocarbons, PDH ensures a high purity of propylene, which is essential for downstream chemical processes. This high selectivity reduces the need for additional refining steps, further enhancing efficiency.

5.In terms of catalysts, industrial processes often use platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) based catalysts with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as a support. However, these catalysts face issues like metal sintering and acidity, which can lead to deactivation and require frequent regeneration. Zeolite-supported metal catalysts, on the other hand, exhibit superior stability and selectivity, particularly in PDH reactions, making them a preferred choice for industrial applications.

6.Zeolites are a class of crystalline materials known for their large surface area, well-defined microporous channels, and tunable acidity/basicity, which makes them ideal for various industrial processes. Their capability to support different metal species with high dispersion has expanded their utility in heterogeneous catalysis, providing a platform for efficient reactions with high product selectivity.

7.Zeolite-supported metal catalysts have shown unprecedented stability and selectivity in PDH reactions, exceeding the performance of industrial catalysts. This has led to a surge in research focused on developing these catalysts, aiming to optimize their synthesis, characterization, and catalytic mechanisms. The field is advancing rapidly, driven by the potential for large-scale industrial applications that can meet the growing demand for propylene while addressing environmental concerns.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其仅生产丙烯而没有混合碳氢化合物产品的特性，被认为是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法。与传统方法可能产生混合物并需要复杂分离和精炼过程相比，PDH具有明显优势。由于页岩气的兴起，作为原料的丙烷变得非常便宜，这使得PDH工厂可以灵活调整运行多种不同的反应，提高效率。丙烯和丙烷价格之间的经济差异以及对丙烯需求的增长使PDH成为一个极其有利可图的过程。

2. 传统的丙烯生产方法主要依赖于化石燃料，不仅成本高，而且排放大量二氧化碳。PDH技术通过利用丙烷这一丰富且成本低廉的资源，提供了一种更清洁、更灵活且可能更具成本效益的选择。它可以直接将丙烷转化为纯度很高的丙烯，无需复杂的分离步骤，从而提高了效率。

3. 与常规方法相比，PDH技术在产品选择性方面具有显著优势。与其他方法可能产生混合碳氢化合物相比，PDH确保了高度纯净的丙烯，这对于下游化学过程至关重要。这种高选择性减少了额外精炼步骤的需求，进一步提高了效率。

4.PDH技术还提供了催化剂选择的优势。工业过程中通常使用铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）基催化剂，以氧化铝（Al2O3）为载体。然而，这些催化剂面临金属聚集和酸性等问题，可能导致催化剂失活并需要频繁再生。相比之下，基于沸石的金属催化剂在PDH反应中表现出卓越的稳定性和选择性，使其成为工业应用的理想选择。

5. 沸石是一类具有大表面积、定义明确的微孔通道和可调酸碱性的晶体材料，适用于各种工业过程，并提供高效反应和高产物选择性的平台。

6.PDH反应中的沸石支持金属催化剂已经显示出超出工业催化剂性能的稳定性和选择性，这导致了研究领域的快速发展，旨在优化催化剂的合成、表征和催化机制。该领域正在迅速发展，旨在满足对丙烯日益增长的需求，同时解决环境问题。
