<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the article, include its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability. PDH technology allows for a more direct and potentially cleaner production process compared to conventional methods, which often rely on multiple steps including steam cracking. This direct conversion enhances process efficiency, reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering environmental impact. Moreover, PDH technology improves product selectivity, enabling higher yields of propylene, which is crucial for meeting the growing global demand for this chemical intermediate.
