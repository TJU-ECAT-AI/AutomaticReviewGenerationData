[1] "Boosting Propane Dehydrogenation over PtZn Encapsulated in an Epitaxial High-Crystallized Zeolite with a Low Surface Barrier"
[2] "The current industrial process for propylene production relies on steam cracking of naphtha, which faces challenges such as high energy consumption, low propylene yield, and environmental concerns."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative for propylene production, as it directly converts propane to propylene without the need for hydrogen."
[4] "This technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing better feedstock availability, higher process efficiency, and improved product selectivity."
