The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. PDH technology offers improved feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible propane as its primary reactant. It enhances process efficiency through optimized catalytic reactions and potentially lower energy consumption compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, PDH technology improves product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with reduced byproducts, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry.
