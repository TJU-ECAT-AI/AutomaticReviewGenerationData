<quotes>
[1] "Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile."
[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."
[3] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes."
[4] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."
[5] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures."
[6] "As such, the coking occurs easily during the reaction process and the Pt particles tend to grow large, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation and decline of product selectivity."
[7] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals."
[8] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts."
[9] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."
[10] "To combine the complementary advantages of zeolite structure and additives in one matrix, several studies have tried to incorporate Pt into Sn-Beta zeolite, while only evenly dispersed surface nanoparticles were obtained."
[11] "Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically addresses these challenges by offering a more direct and efficient way to produce propylene from cheap alkanes compared to traditional naphtha cracking, which faces limitations in meeting the increasing demand for downstream products of propylene. Moreover, PDH allows for the production of high-value olefins from cheaper alkane sources, reducing the dependency on volatile oil prices and leveraging the abundant supply of shale gas. The process, however, is endothermic and requires high temperatures, which can lead to coking and catalyst deactivation. By incorporating metals like platinum (Pt) into carriers such as zeolites, particularly those containing tin (Sn), researchers have developed methods to confine Pt clusters, enhancing stability and selectivity.

2. The key advantages of PDH technology are its ability to directly convert propane into propylene with high efficiency, reduce reliance on expensive feedstocks, and produce higher-value products. It addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant alkane sources, improves process efficiency through direct conversion, and enhances product selectivity by minimizing the formation of undesirable byproducts.

3. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by leveraging inexpensive and widely available alkane sources. Process efficiency is improved because PDH is a direct conversion process, unlike cracking, which involves multiple steps. Product selectivity is enhanced by controlling the reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield and minimize the formation of other products, such as coke, which can deactivate the catalyst and reduce selectivity.

4. The PDH process is challenged by the formation of coke during high-temperature reactions, which leads to catalyst deactivation and a decline in product selectivity. To overcome this, researchers have focused on developing methods to confine the active metal sites within zeolite structures, providing a confinement effect that prevents the growth of metal particles and maintains their activity and selectivity over time. By incorporating tin (Sn) into zeolites, they create a matrix that not only supports the metal catalyst but also provides a structural framework that confines the metal clusters, enhancing their stability and performance in PDH reactions.

1.PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它解决了原料获取、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的问题。它通过提供一种直接且高效的丙烯生产方式，从廉价的烷烃中生产丙烯，与传统的石脑油裂解相比，后者难以满足对丙烯下游产品的持续需求。此外，PDH允许使用更便宜的烷烃来源生产高价值的烯烃，减少对波动的油价的依赖，并利用丰富的页岩气资源。然而，该过程是吸热的，需要高温，这可能导致焦化并导致催化剂活性和产品选择性快速下降。通过将金属如铂（Pt）引入载体，尤其是含锡（Sn）的沸石中，研究人员开发了方法来限制Pt簇，从而增强其稳定性。 

2.PDH技术的优势在于能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，提高效率，减少对昂贵原料的依赖，并产生更高价值的产品。它通过直接转换过程解决了传统生产方法在原料获取方面的挑战，与裂解不同，后者涉及多个步骤。产品选择性得到了提升，因为通过控制反应条件以最大化丙烯产量并减少其他产物（如焦炭）的形成，这些产物会使催化剂失活并降低选择性。

3.PDH技术通过利用大量可用的烷烃来源解决了传统生产方法面临的原料获取挑战。过程效率得到改善，因为PDH是一个直接转换过程，而不是裂解，后者涉及多个步骤。产品选择性得到了增强，通过控制反应条件以最大化丙烯产量并减少其他产物（如焦炭）的形成，这些产物会使得催化剂失活并降低选择性。

4.PDH过程面临的挑战是在高温反应过程中形成焦炭，这会导致催化剂失活并降低产品选择性。为了克服这一问题，研究人员专注于开发方法来将活性金属位点限制在沸石结构内部，提供一种封闭效果，防止金属颗粒生长并保持其活动性和选择性。通过将锡（Sn）引入沸石中，他们创建了一个不仅支持金属催化剂的矩阵，而且提供了一个结构框架来限制金属簇，增强它们在PDH反应中的稳定性和性能。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH technology allows for the efficient production of propylene from propane, which is a more abundant and cheaper feedstock compared to naphtha traditionally used in cracking processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability, particularly given the fluctuating prices of oil and the rise in shale gas production, which offer a more economical alternative for producing high-value olefins like propylene. Secondly, PDH processes can directly convert propane into propylene without the need for cracking, which typically involves additional steps and energy consumption. This results in a more streamlined and potentially more energy-efficient production process. Lastly, PDH technologies enable the production of propylene in a manner that maintains high product selectivity, even under the challenging conditions of high reaction temperatures required for the endothermic dehydrogenation of propane. The use of zeolite materials, especially those with well-defined pore structures, serves as effective carriers for metal catalysts, providing confinement effects that prevent metal aggregation and ensure the stability of the catalyst under harsh reaction conditions. In particular, incorporating tin (Sn) as an additive in zeolite matrices offers both geometric and electronic benefits, enhancing the stability and activity of Pt catalysts used in PDH processes. This strategy not only suppresses the aggregation of Pt particles but also tunes the adsorption properties of key intermediates involved in the PDH process, ultimately leading to improved performance and selectivity in propylene production.
