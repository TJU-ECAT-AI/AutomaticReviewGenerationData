<p>Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications.</p>
<p>Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile.</p>
<p>Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes.</p>
<p>So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes.</p>
<p>However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures.</p>
<p>As such, the coking occurs easily during the reaction process and the Pt particles tend to grow large, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation and decline of product selectivity.</p>
<p>Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals.</p>
<p>Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the metal species hardly enter into the zeolite channels of subnano-sized pore windows by impregnation due to the diffusion constrains, but mainly locate on the crystal external surface, showing unsatisfied performance in stabilizing metal species under harsh reaction conditions.</p>
<p>For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact.</p>
<p>The electronic effect has been reported to tune the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates in the PDH process.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH technology allows for the efficient production of propylene from propane, which is a more abundant and cheaper feedstock compared to naphtha traditionally used in cracking processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability, particularly given the fluctuating prices of oil and the rise in shale gas production, which offer a more economical alternative for producing high-value olefins like propylene. Secondly, PDH processes can directly convert propane into propylene without the need for cracking, which typically involves additional steps and energy consumption. This results in a more streamlined and potentially more energy-efficient production process. Lastly, PDH technologies enable the production of propylene in a manner that maintains high product selectivity, even under the challenging conditions of high reaction temperatures required for the endothermic dehydrogenation of propane. The use of zeolite materials, especially those with well-defined pore structures, serves as effective carriers for metal catalysts, providing confinement effects that prevent metal aggregation and ensure the stability of the catalyst under harsh reaction conditions. In particular, incorporating tin (Sn) as an additive in zeolite matrices offers both geometric and electronic benefits, enhancing the stability and activity of Pt catalysts used in PDH processes. This strategy not only suppresses the aggregation of Pt particles but also tunes the adsorption properties of key intermediates involved in the PDH process, ultimately leading to improved performance and selectivity in propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH技术允许从丙烷高效生产丙烯，与传统用于裂解的石脑油相比，丙烷是一种更丰富且成本更低的原料。这解决了原料可用性的问题，尤其是在油价波动和页岩气产量增加的情况下，这些提供了更经济的选择来生产如丙烯等高价值的烯烃。其次，PDH过程可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需额外步骤和能源消耗，从而实现更简洁且可能更节能的生产流程。最后，PDH技术能够通过保持高产品选择性来生产丙烯，即使在需要高温进行脱氢反应的条件下也是如此。使用具有明确孔结构的沸石材料作为金属催化剂的有效载体，提供限制效应，防止金属聚集并确保催化剂在苛刻反应条件下的稳定性。特别是将锡（Sn）作为添加剂引入沸石矩阵中，不仅提供了几何和电子益处，还能增强铂（Pt）催化剂在PDH过程中使用的稳定性和活性。这种策略不仅抑制了Pt颗粒的聚集，而且调节了PDH过程中涉及的关键中间体的吸附性质，最终导致了丙烯生产的性能和选择性的改善。
