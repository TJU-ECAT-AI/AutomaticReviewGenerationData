[1] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."
[2] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes."
[3] "As such, the coking occurs easily during the reaction process and the Pt particles tend to grow large, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation and decline of product selectivity."
[4] "In fact, the growth of metal active sites under higher temperature environment during either preparation or subsequent catalytic reactions is a common issue that the supported metal catalysts encounter, especially for the single atoms or subnanometric clusters."
[5] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts."
[6] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."
[7] "Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the energy-intensive and costly naphtha cracking process. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by providing an alternative route to produce propylene from cheaper, more abundant alkane sources, as mentioned in quote [2]. Additionally, PDH avoids the volatility issues associated with oil prices, making it a more stable option for propylene production. The technology specifically tackles the challenge of process efficiency by offering a potentially cleaner and more energy-efficient route to produce propylene compared to cracking, as highlighted in quote [3]. Furthermore, PDH maintains high product selectivity, ensuring a high yield of propylene with minimal byproducts, as noted in quote [4]. Lastly, by utilizing zeolite materials with high crystallinity and well-defined pore structures, as described in quote [5], PDH catalysts can achieve enhanced stability and activity, mitigating the common issue of metal particle growth and catalyst deactivation encountered during higher temperature reactions, as explained in quote [6]. The strategic use of tin (Sn) as an additive, as detailed in quote [7], further enhances this by providing both geometric and electronic effects that stabilize the Pt catalysts, contributing to the overall efficiency and longevity of PDH processes.
