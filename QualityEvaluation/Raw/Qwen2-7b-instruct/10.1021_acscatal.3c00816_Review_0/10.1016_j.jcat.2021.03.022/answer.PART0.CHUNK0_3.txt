[1] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."
[2] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes."
[3] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."
[4] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures."
[5] "As such, the coking occurs easily during the reaction process and the Pt particles tend to grow large, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation and decline of product selectivity."
[6] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals."
[7] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts."
[8] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."
[9] "To combine the complementary advantages of zeolite structure and additives in one matrix, several studies have tried to incorporate Pt into Sn-Beta zeolite, while only evenly dispersed surface nanoparticles were obtained."
[10] "Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species."
[11] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing a more efficient and versatile approach to propylene production. It specifically tackles the issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods rely on naphtha cracking, which is not sustainable due to fluctuating oil prices and the increasing demand for downstream products. PDH technology utilizes cheap alkanes as feedstock, which is more abundant and cost-effective. It also operates at lower temperatures compared to cracking processes, reducing the risk of coking and preserving the integrity of the catalyst, thus maintaining high product selectivity. The use of zeolite materials, particularly Sn-Beta zeolite, provides a confinement effect that prevents the growth of Pt particles, ensuring high dispersion and stability of the catalyst.

2. The key advantages of PDH technology are its ability to utilize a wider range of alkanes as feedstock, its efficiency in producing propylene, and its potential to maintain high product selectivity even at high temperatures. By addressing the limitations of conventional methods, PDH technology enhances the sustainability and economic viability of propylene production, aligning with the growing global demand for this essential chemical.

3. The confinement effect provided by zeolite materials, particularly Sn-Beta zeolite, is crucial in PDH technology. It allows for the trapping of Pt clusters within the zeolite structure, preventing their growth and promoting high dispersion. This results in a catalyst that is highly active, selective, and stable, even at high reaction temperatures where coking is a concern. The synergy between zeolite structure and the addition of tin (Sn) as an additive optimizes the catalytic performance, making PDH technology a promising method for propylene production.

1.PDH技术通过提供更高效和灵活的方法来解决传统生产方法面临的问题，特别是针对原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的问题。与传统的裂解过程依赖于波动的油价和下游产品需求的增长不同，PDH技术使用廉价的烷烃作为原料，这更加丰富且成本效益更高。与裂解过程相比，它在较低温度下运行，降低了结焦的风险，保持催化剂的完整性，从而维持高产品选择性。使用沸石材料，特别是Sn-Beta沸石，提供了限制作用，防止铂粒子生长，确保催化剂的高度分散性和稳定性。

2.PDH技术的关键优势在于其能够利用更广泛的烷烃作为原料，提高生产效率，并在高温下维持高产品选择性。通过解决传统方法的局限性，PDH技术增强了丙烯生产的可持续性和经济可行性，符合全球对这种重要化学品日益增长的需求。

3.沸石材料提供的限制效果，特别是Sn-Beta沸石，对于PDH技术至关重要。它允许将铂簇捕获在沸石结构内部，防止它们生长并促进高度分散。这导致一个活性高、选择性强且稳定的催化剂，即使在高温下也是如此，高温下结焦是一个问题。Zeo石结构和添加锡（Sn）作为添加剂之间的协同作用优化了催化性能，使PDH技术成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法。
