<p>Unfortunately, the metal species hardly enter into the zeolite channels of subnano-sized pore windows by impregnation due to the diffusion constrains, but mainly locate on the crystal external surface, showing unsatisfied performance in stabilizing metal species under harsh reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction.</p>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for expensive naphtha cracking, which traditionally produces propylene as a by-product. This method ensures a more consistent supply of propylene, as it does not rely on the availability and price fluctuations of crude oil. Moreover, PDH enables the production of propylene from cheaper alkanes, such as propane, making the process more economically viable. By utilizing zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area, and well-defined pore channels, PDH can achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability, even under harsh reaction conditions. The confinement effect provided by the zeolite structure and the addition of tin (Sn) as an additive play crucial roles in stabilizing the metal species, particularly platinum (Pt), and preventing their aggregation or sintering, which are common issues encountered in high-temperature reactions. This results in an efficient and sustainable production of propylene with high yield and purity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH允许将丙烷直接转化为丙烯，跳过了传统上通过昂贵的石脑油裂解来生产丙烯的步骤。这种方法确保了丙烯的稳定供应，因为它不需要依赖原油的价格波动和供应情况。此外，PDH使从更便宜的烷烃，如丙烷，生产丙烯成为可能，这使得过程更加经济可行。利用具有高度结晶结构、大比表面积和精确孔道的沸石材料，PDH可以在恶劣的反应条件下实现高活性、高选择性和稳定性。由沸石结构和添加锡（Sn）作为添加剂提供的封装效应对于稳定金属物种，特别是铂（Pt），并防止其聚合或结块起着关键作用。这导致了高效且可持续的丙烯生产，产率高且纯度高。
