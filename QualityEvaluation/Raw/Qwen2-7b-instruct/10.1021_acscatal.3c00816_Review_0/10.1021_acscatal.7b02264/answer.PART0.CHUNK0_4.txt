<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production. It addresses challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology provides high selectivity and durability in propane dehydrogenation, which enhances process efficiency. It also ensures better product selectivity compared to traditional methods, leading to higher yields of propylene. This makes PDH technology particularly promising for propylene production as it optimizes resource utilization and improves economic viability.
