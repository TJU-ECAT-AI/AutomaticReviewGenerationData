<p>Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc.</p>
<p>Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene.</p>
<p>For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively.</p>
<p>However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>Specifically, if excessive Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are present in the modified zeolites, undesirable side reactions might be promoted for reducing propylene selectivity and forming coke species in PDH reactions.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production include addressing the challenges faced by conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology leverages the mass exploitation of shale gas resources, making it a viable complement for producing propylene. Compared to traditional methods, PDH utilizes catalysts with rationally designed structures and satisfactory performance, which mitigate issues like high cost, toxicity, and low cycling life. Moreover, by minimizing the presence of Brnsted acid sites, PDH avoids unwanted side reactions that reduce propylene selectivity and lead to coke formation, thereby enhancing process efficiency and product quality.
