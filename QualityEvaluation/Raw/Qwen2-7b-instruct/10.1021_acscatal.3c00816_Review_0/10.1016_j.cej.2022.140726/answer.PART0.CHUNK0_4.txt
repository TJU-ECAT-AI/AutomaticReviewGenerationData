[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc."
[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene."
[3] "Considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance."
[4] "Specifically, if excessive Brnsted acid sites (BAS) are present in the modified zeolites, undesirable side reactions might be promoted for reducing propylene selectivity and forming coke species in PDH reactions."
[5] "Furthermore, Co@Si-BEA catalyst adsorbs propylene in a favorable configuration, leading to desired adsorption features with respect to less amount and weaker strength in comparison with that on non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst."
[6] "Therefore, facile propylene desorption can be achieved on Co@Si-BEA catalyst, which is responsible for its high propylene selectivity, activity, and long-term stability in PDH reaction."
[7] "Specifically, either pre-reduction of Co@MCM-41 with H2 or modification of Co@ZSM-5 with Ti4+ additive has been approved effective for stabilization of Co nanoparticles by the zeolite supports."

In addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages:

1. Propane, a byproduct of natural gas and oil refining, provides a more abundant and cost-effective feedstock compared to traditional methods that often rely on naphtha. This addresses the issue of feedstock availability.

2. PDH utilizes catalytic non-oxidative processes, which are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional methods that involve cracking. This enhances process efficiency.

3. The PDH process produces propylene with high selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This improves product selectivity.

4. By controlling the structure of the catalyst, such as using dealuminated Si-BEA zeolites with isolated Co2+ active sites, the PDH process can reduce the formation of coke species and minimize side reactions. This ensures high stability and prevents deactivation.

5. The Co@Si-BEA catalyst, in particular, exhibits high propylene selectivity, activity, and long-term stability due to its unique adsorption properties and efficient propylene desorption. This contributes to better process performance.

6. The use of pre-reduction techniques, such as hydrogen treatment or titanium additive incorporation, stabilizes the Co nanoparticles, ensuring better catalytic performance and longevity.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising method for propylene production, offering solutions to the limitations of conventional production methods.
