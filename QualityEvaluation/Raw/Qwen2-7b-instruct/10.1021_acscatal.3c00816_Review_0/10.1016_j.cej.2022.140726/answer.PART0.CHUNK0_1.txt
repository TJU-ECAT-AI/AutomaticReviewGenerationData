[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc."
[2] "With BEA (Si/Al = 20) and dealuminated Si-BEA zeolite as supports, the supported Co2+ catalysts are prepared by vacuum impregnation method and attempted in nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions."
[3] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst."
[4] "Co@Si-BEA catalyst also demonstrates a great long-term catalytic stability in eight-time reaction-regeneration recycling test, not only highlighting the high structural stability of the catalyst active sites but also illustrating the reversible deactivation phenomenon caused by coke deposition."
[5] "As a contrast, the non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst is consisting of a varied Co2+ coordination environment and a higher density of surface Brnsted acid sites (BAS), and displays severe issues in terms of propane CC bond scission and coke formation due to the catalytically competitive advantage of BAS on these side-reactions over the Co2+-catalyzed selective PDH process."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to effectively utilize the abundant shale gas resources, which are increasingly being exploited globally. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability, as it allows for the conversion of readily accessible natural gas into propylene without the need for more expensive and scarce naphtha. Moreover, PDH technology enhances process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene in a single-step process, bypassing the multi-step routes traditionally used in fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. This leads to improved product selectivity, as the PDH process is specifically optimized to produce propylene with high yield and purity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. 

2. The dealumination pretreatment of the BEA zeolite support plays a pivotal role in enhancing the PDH reaction performance. It facilitates the anchoring of isolated Co2+ cations within the zeolite micropores, which are identified as the primary active sites for the selective activation of CH bonds in propane. This leads to the preferential production of propylene over other byproducts, ensuring high product selectivity. The dealumination process also modifies the surface properties of the zeolite, reducing the density of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) and improving the stability of the Co2+ active sites, thus contributing to the catalyst's longevity and efficiency.

3. The dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst exhibits remarkable stability in the PDH reaction, capable of undergoing multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration without significant loss in activity or selectivity. This is attributed to the high structural stability of the isolated Co2+ cations, which remain intact throughout the reaction, and the reversible deactivation mechanism associated with coke deposition. The reversible nature of deactivation allows for the regeneration of the catalyst, maintaining its performance over extended periods.

4. In contrast, the non-dealuminated Co@BEA catalyst is characterized by a more complex Co2+ coordination environment and a higher density of surface Brnsted acid sites. This leads to the competitive advantage of BAS in promoting undesirable side reactions such as propane CC bond scission, which can lead to the formation of coke and other byproducts. The presence of these competing reactions diminishes the catalyst's selectivity for propylene production, affecting its overall efficiency and product quality.

5. The propylene chemisorption property on the Co@Si-BEA catalyst is superior to that on the Co@BEA catalyst. This is evidenced by the lower adsorption amount and weaker strength of propylene on the dealuminated catalyst, which facilitates the easy desorption of propylene as a product. This advantageous property contributes to the high propylene selectivity, activity, and long-term stability of the Co@Si-BEA catalyst in the PDH reaction, making it a preferred choice for propylene production from propane.

1. 烷丙直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够有效利用全球日益增长的页岩气资源而成为丙烯生产最具前景的方法。这解决了原料供应的问题，因为它允许将易获取的天然气转化为丙烯，而无需依赖更昂贵且稀缺的石脑油。此外，PDH技术通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程提高了工艺效率，跳过了传统上用于流化催化裂解和蒸汽裂解的多步骤路线。这导致了产品选择性的提高，因为PDH过程专门优化为以高产率和纯度产生丙烯，同时最小化其他副产品的形成。

2. BEA沸石载体的脱铝预处理在增强PDH反应性能方面发挥了关键作用。它使孤立的Co2+离子能够在沸石微孔中锚定，这些离子被发现在选择性活化丙烷中的CH键时占主导地位。这导致丙烯的优先生产，而不是其他副产品的生成，确保了高度的产品选择性。脱铝过程也修改了沸石的表面性质，减少了表面酸性位点（BAS）的密度，并改善了Co2+活性位点的稳定性，从而有助于催化剂的长期性和效率。

3. 脱铝化的Co@Si-BEA催化剂在PDH反应中表现出惊人的稳定性，能够在多次反应和再生循环后保持其活动性和选择性不减。这归因于孤立的Co2+离子的高度结构稳定，这些离子在整个反应过程中保持不变，以及与焦炭沉积相关的可逆失活机制。这种可逆的失活机制允许催化剂的再生，维持其性能长达数月。

4. 相比之下，非脱铝化的Co@BEA催化剂具有更为复杂的Co2+配合环境和较高的表面酸性位点密度。这导致表面酸性位点（BAS）在促进不利于PDH过程的选择性丙烯生产的副反应，如丙烷CC键断裂中占据优势的竞争性优势。这些竞争反应减少了催化剂对丙烯生产的选择性，影响了其整体效率和产品质量。

5. Co@Si-BEA催化剂上的丙烯化学吸附特性优于Co@BEA催化剂。这体现在脱铝化催化剂上较低的吸附量和较弱的丙烯强度，这促进了丙烯作为产品的容易脱附。这一有利的特性贡献了Co@Si-BEA催化剂在PDH反应中的高丙烯选择性、活性和长期稳定性，使其成为从丙烷生产丙烯的首选催化剂。
