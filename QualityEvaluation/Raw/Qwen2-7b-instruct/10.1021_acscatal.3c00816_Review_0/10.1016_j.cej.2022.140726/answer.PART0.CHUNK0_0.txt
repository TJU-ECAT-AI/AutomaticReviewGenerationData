[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc."
[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene."
[3] "The challenges still exist for Co-catalyzed PDH reactions with respect to structural stability and catalytic activity of Co-relevant active site in the catalysts."
[4] "Specifically, the post-treatment (e.g., dealumination) of zeolites can regulate the pore structure and acidic property and change the accommodation of various introduced metallic sites, determining the catalytic properties in the reactions."
[5] "Therefore, fine tuning the location and chemical state of isolated Co cations in the zeolites is significant for providing in-depth insight into the structure-performance relationship of Co@zeolite PDH catalysts."
[6] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively."
[7] "It has also been reported that subnanometric Co or CoO nanoclusters encapsulated within zeolites are responsible to high activity and stability in PDH reaction due to the confinement effect of zeolites."
[8] "The isolated Co2+ cations, which are anchored in the zeolite micropores through interaction with the silanol generated within dealumination process, dominate over the dealuminated Co@Si-BEA catalyst, as evidenced by a series of infrared, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectral characterizations."
[9] "The stable and unreducible Co2+ cations serve as the catalytically active sites exhibiting a high propylene selectivity of over 93 % in the PDH reaction at 590 C."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible and abundant natural gas resources, particularly through the mass exploitation of shale gas. This contrasts with conventional production methods that often rely on more scarce or expensive feedstocks. Secondly, PDH technology enhances process efficiency by directly converting propane into propylene, bypassing the need for multiple stages typically required in other production methods. This results in a streamlined process with potentially lower energy consumption and costs. Lastly, PDH technology improves product selectivity, as evidenced by the high propylene yield achieved through the use of optimized catalysts, such as those containing isolated Co2+ cations. These catalysts, when anchored in zeolite micropores through a dealumination process, exhibit superior stability and activity, contributing to a high propylene selectivity of over 93% at high temperatures. Overall, PDH technology effectively addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a leading method for propylene production.
