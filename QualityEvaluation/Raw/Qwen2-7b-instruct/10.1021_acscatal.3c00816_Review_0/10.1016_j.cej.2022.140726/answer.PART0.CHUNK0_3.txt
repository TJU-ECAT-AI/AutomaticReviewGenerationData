<p>Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene.</p>
<p>For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively. However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance.</p>

In response to the increasing demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology emerges as the most promising method for propylene production. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering feedstock flexibility, improved process efficiency, and enhanced product selectivity. PDH utilizes the abundant shale gas resources to produce propylene more efficiently and economically compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha. Moreover, it aims to develop alternative catalysts with better rational design and performance to overcome the limitations of existing catalysts, such as high cost, toxicity, and short cycle life.
