<p>The demand for ethylene can be covered by these technologies; the share of propene and isobutene cannot be further increased in the steam cracking process that produces about 70% of propene worldwide.</p>
<p>There are several processes employing Pt-Sn/Al2O3 (STAR by Phillips and Krupp-Uhde, Oleflex by UOP, PDH by Linde, BASF, Borealis and Statoil) or CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin by ABB Lummus, FDB by Snamprogetti and Yarsintez) catalysts.</p>

<p>Going from SiO2 support to mixed SiO2-Al2O3, VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 with 110 wt.% Al2O3 revealed higher propene productivity in comparison with VOx/SiO2 and VOx/Al2O3.</p>
<p>Since it is determined from carbon balance, its precision is not high and therefore, we calculated a mean value over all data points measured within 25 h on stream. Coke selectivity increases with V loading ( Fig. S9 ) from 1% for 0.3V/MCM over 2.5% for 1.4V/MCM and 1.7V/MCM to 34% for the higher loaded catalysts (2.46.3 wt.% V).</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

1. Feedstock availability: PDH allows for the utilization of propane as a feedstock, which is readily available and abundant, particularly from natural gas liquids. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on naphtha, which might be more limited in supply or require additional processing.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is considered more efficient because it directly converts propane into propylene without the intermediate step of cracking heavy hydrocarbons, which is required in steam cracking. This direct conversion can lead to higher yield and potentially lower energy consumption.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers better control over product selectivity. Traditional processes might produce a mix of olefins, requiring additional separation and purification steps. PDH, by focusing solely on propane conversion, aims to maximize propylene yield with fewer unwanted byproducts.

PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional methods by providing a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially more cost-effective route to propylene production, especially when considering the increasing demand for propylene in various industries.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的关键优势在于它能够解决传统生产方法面临的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。

1. 原料供应：PDH允许使用丙烷作为原料，该原料易于获取且储量丰富，特别是从天然气液体中。这与传统的依赖重质烃类的裂解方法形成对比，后者可能供应有限或需要额外的处理。

2. 过程效率：PDH被认为更有效，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需中间的裂解步骤。这种直接转换可能导致更高的产出率，并可能降低能耗。

3. 产品选择性：PDH能够更好地控制产品选择性。传统工艺可能会产生多种烯烃，需要额外的分离和净化步骤。而PDH专注于仅将丙烷转化为丙烯，旨在最大限度地提高丙烯产量，并减少不必要的副产品。

PDH技术通过提供更清洁、更高效、以及可能更经济的丙烯生产途径，尤其是考虑到对丙烯日益增长的需求时，具体解决了传统方法面临的问题。
