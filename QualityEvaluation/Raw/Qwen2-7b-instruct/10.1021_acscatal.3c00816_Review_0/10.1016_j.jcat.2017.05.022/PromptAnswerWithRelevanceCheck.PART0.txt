In general, their performance is typically affected by the kind of support, the presence of dopant, and polymerization degree. For example, VOx/Al2O3 or VOx/SiO2 prepared by simple impregnation of the supports with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 showed higher activity and selectivity to isobutene in comparison with bulk V2O5 [14] . Activity and selectivity of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts could be increased by doping with SnO2 [15] or K2O [13] . Isobutene was produced with high selectivity and onstream stability upon isobutane DH over highly dispersed VOx species on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) in the presence of small amounts of oxygen [16] . Recently, we published a comparative study of isobutane DH over VOx species dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2-Al2O3 [17] . Highest selectivity to isobutene was obtained over VOx/Al2O3 whereas VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41 [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] , which performed similar to analogs of CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 industrial catalysts [19] . Moreover, it was stable over several DH-regeneration cycles owing to high stability of VOx species against restructuring as was proven by in situ UVvis spectroscopy. Going from SiO2 support to mixed SiO2-Al2O3, VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 with 110 wt.% Al2O3 revealed higher propene productivity in comparison with VOx/SiO2 and VOx/Al2O3 [20] . On the basis of our detailed study of deactivation of VOx/SiO2-Al2O3 catalysts in propane DH, VOx species were concluded to be more active for coke formation than acidic sites of support and their activity to coke formation increases with aggregation degree of VOx species [21] .

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and widely available. Secondly, PDH technology provides enhanced process efficiency, as it converts propane directly into propylene without the need for the energy-intensive cracking process employed in steam cracking. This leads to a more streamlined and potentially lower-cost production process. Thirdly, PDH technology improves product selectivity, as it selectively dehydrogenates propane into propylene rather than producing multiple products as in conventional methods, which often involve additional separation and purification steps. 

The study highlights that PDH catalysts, particularly those based on vanadium oxide (VOx) supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41), demonstrate superior performance in terms of activity and selectivity compared to traditional catalysts like V2O5. The use of dopants like tin oxide (SnO2) or potassium oxide (K2O) can further enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of PDH catalysts. Additionally, PDH catalysts based on VOx/MCM-41 show high stability and resistance to coke formation, a common issue in industrial processes that can lead to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance costs. The stability of these catalysts is attributed to the high stability of VOx species against restructuring, as evidenced by in situ UVvis spectroscopy. Furthermore, the study indicates that PDH catalysts perform comparably to industrial catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3, suggesting potential for competitive performance in the market.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by providing access to abundant feedstocks, improving process efficiency, and enhancing product selectivity, while also demonstrating high stability and performance comparable to existing industrial catalysts.

在丙烯全球需求不断增长的背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了丙烯生产的几个关键优势。首先，它通过利用丰富的丙烷资源来解决原料可用性问题。其次，PDH技术提供了更高的过程效率，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需蒸汽裂解过程中所需的能源密集型步骤，从而实现更简洁且可能成本更低的生产流程。此外，PDH技术提高了产品选择性，因为它仅选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而不需要传统方法中涉及的额外分离和精炼步骤。

研究指出，基于二氧化硅（MCM-41）支持的范德华氧化物（VOx）的PDH催化剂，在活性和选择性方面优于传统的催化剂，如V2O5。使用锡氧化物（SnO2）或钾氧化物（K2O）作为助剂可以进一步增强PDH催化剂的活性和选择性。此外，基于VOx/MCM-41的PDH催化剂显示出高稳定性和抗焦炭形成能力，这是工业过程中常见问题，可能导致效率下降和维护成本增加。这些催化剂的稳定性归因于VOx物种对重构的高稳定性，这由原位紫外光谱法证实。进一步研究表明，PDH催化剂的性能与CrOx/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3等现有工业催化剂相当，这表明其在市场上具有竞争力的潜力。

综上所述，PDH技术通过提供丰富原料、提高过程效率以及增强产品选择性，并且展现出与现有工业催化剂相媲美的高稳定性和性能，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional methods lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for steam cracking. PDH offers higher product selectivity, specifically targeting propylene production, which is in high demand. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing a more sustainable feedstock (propane) and achieving better process efficiency. In terms of feedstock availability, PDH relies on propane, which is abundant and widely available, unlike the need for heavy oil residues in steam cracking. Moreover, PDH can operate with higher propylene yields, up to 70% in some cases, compared to the typical 60-70% yield from steam cracking. Product selectivity is improved because PDH specifically targets the production of propylene, minimizing the formation of other byproducts. This makes PDH a promising method for propylene production, especially in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to produce propylene efficiently from propane, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Propane is abundant and readily available, unlike some other feedstocks required for traditional propylene production methods. PDH allows for a streamlined process that converts propane directly into propylene without the need for intermediate products or complex refining steps, enhancing process efficiency. Additionally, the selectivity of PDH is high, meaning that the majority of the propane is converted into propylene rather than byproducts, ensuring optimal product selectivity. The use of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH highlights the technology's capability to operate efficiently, with isolated VOx sites showing higher turnover frequency and resistance against deactivation, contributing to improved overall performance and reliability.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

1. Feedstock availability: PDH allows for the utilization of propane as a feedstock, which is readily available and abundant, particularly from natural gas liquids. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on naphtha, which might be more limited in supply or require additional processing.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is considered more efficient because it directly converts propane into propylene without the intermediate step of cracking heavy hydrocarbons, which is required in steam cracking. This direct conversion can lead to higher yield and potentially lower energy consumption.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers better control over product selectivity. Traditional processes might produce a mix of olefins, requiring additional separation and purification steps. PDH, by focusing solely on propane conversion, aims to maximize propylene yield with fewer unwanted byproducts.

PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional methods by providing a cleaner, more efficient, and potentially more cost-effective route to propylene production, especially when considering the increasing demand for propylene in various industries.
