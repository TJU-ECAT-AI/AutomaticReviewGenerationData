[1] "The catalysts were tested in dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane."
[2] "Lewis-acidic V3+ and V4+ were identified as DH active sites."
[3] "For both dehydrogenation reactions, a direct correlation between apparent turnover frequency and the mean number of VOV bonds around a central V cation was established."
[4] "Since isomerization reactions are impossible for propene its selectivity is only slightly influenced by degree of aggregation of VOx species."
[5] "Isolated VOx species are most active and resistant against deactivation."

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to produce propylene efficiently from propane, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Propane is abundant and readily available, unlike some other feedstocks required for traditional propylene production methods. PDH allows for a streamlined process that converts propane directly into propylene without the need for intermediate products or complex refining steps, enhancing process efficiency. Additionally, the selectivity of PDH is high, meaning that the majority of the propane is converted into propylene rather than byproducts, ensuring optimal product selectivity. The use of VOx/MCM-41 catalysts in PDH highlights the technology's capability to operate efficiently, with isolated VOx sites showing higher turnover frequency and resistance against deactivation, contributing to improved overall performance and reliability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。丙烷资源丰富且易于获取，这与某些其他传统丙烯生产方法所需的原料不同。PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需中间产品或复杂精炼步骤，提高工艺效率。此外，PDH的选择性很高，意味着大部分丙烷被转化为丙烯而不是副产品，确保最佳的产品选择性。使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂在PDH中的应用凸显了该技术的高效性和可靠性，其中孤立的VOx位点显示出更高的周转频率和抗失活能力，为整体性能和稳定性做出了贡献。
