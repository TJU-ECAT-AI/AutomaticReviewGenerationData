[1] "Going from SiO2 support to mixed SiO2-Al2O3, VOx on SiO2-Al2O3 with 110 wt.% Al2O3 revealed higher propene productivity in comparison with VOx/SiO2 and VOx/Al2O3."
[2] "Since it is determined from carbon balance, its precision is not high and therefore, we calculated a mean value over all data points measured within 25 h on stream."
[3] "This is related to the strong Lewis acidity of single VOx sites."
[4] "Following our argumentation in a previous paper [21], this surprising fact can be explained when looking at the mechanism of coke formation."

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional methods lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for steam cracking. PDH offers higher product selectivity, specifically targeting propylene production, which is in high demand. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing a more sustainable feedstock (propane) and achieving better process efficiency. In terms of feedstock availability, PDH relies on propane, which is abundant and widely available, unlike the need for heavy oil residues in steam cracking. Moreover, PDH can operate with higher propylene yields, up to 70% in some cases, compared to the typical 60-70% yield from steam cracking. Product selectivity is improved because PDH specifically targets the production of propylene, minimizing the formation of other byproducts. This makes PDH a promising method for propylene production, especially in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

PDH技术的关键优势在于能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需进行蒸汽裂解。与传统生产方法相比，PDH能够更有效地实现过程效率，并且具有更高的产品选择性，专门针对丙烯的生产。它解决了传统生产方法的挑战，因为PDH使用的是充足的、广泛可用的丙烷作为原料，而蒸汽裂解需要重油残渣。此外，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯产量，最高可达70%，相比之下，蒸汽裂解的产率通常为60%-70%。在产品选择性方面，PDH专门针对丙烯的生产，最大限度地减少了其他副产品的形成。这使得PDH成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，特别是对于解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品质量选择性的挑战。
