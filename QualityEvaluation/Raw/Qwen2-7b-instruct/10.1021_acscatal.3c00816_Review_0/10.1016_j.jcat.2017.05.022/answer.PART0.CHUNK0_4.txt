<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without requiring the use of expensive catalysts like platinum or chromium. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing a widely available feedstock, propane. Process efficiency is enhanced as PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for multiple steps found in conventional methods. Product selectivity is improved as PDH selectively produces propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This technology specifically addresses the limitations of conventional methods in terms of cost, environmental impact, and yield optimization.
