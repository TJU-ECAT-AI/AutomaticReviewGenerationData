[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted considerable attention as an alternative method for propylene production due to its high yield and selectivity."
[2] "Compared to conventional methods, PDH offers several advantages: it utilizes a wider range of feedstocks, including propane, which is more abundant and less expensive than naphtha traditionally used in steam cracking."
[3] "PDH processes also tend to have higher energy efficiency, lower environmental impact, and improved product selectivity."
[4] "The use of Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts in PDH has been shown to enhance the conversion rates and stability of the process."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its high yield and selectivity. It addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing a broader range of feedstocks, particularly propane, which is more abundant and economical compared to naphtha typically used in steam cracking. PDH processes exhibit higher energy efficiency, reduced environmental footprint, and better product selectivity. The application of Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts further improves the conversion rates and durability of the PDH process.
