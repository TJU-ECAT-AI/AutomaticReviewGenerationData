Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) stands out as a highly promising method for propylene production due to its ability to tackle several significant challenges posed by traditional production techniques. These challenges encompass restricted availability of suitable feedstocks, inefficiencies within the processes, and low selectivity for propylene production. PDH technology rectifies these issues by directly transforming propane into propylene through the use of catalysts, notably Pt/TiO2Al2O3, which facilitates high conversion rates and selectivities.
