[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising methods for propylene production due to its high efficiency, low energy consumption, and ability to handle a wide range of feedstocks."
[2] "The key advantages of PDH technology include its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity."
[3] "Conventional propylene production methods often rely on ethane as a primary feedstock, which is less abundant compared to propane. PDH technology allows for direct conversion of propane, thus potentially increasing the availability of propylene."
[4] "In terms of process efficiency, PDH has been shown to have higher yields and better selectivity towards propylene compared to other methods."
[5] "Product selectivity is another critical aspect where PDH excels, offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly route to produce propylene."

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它具有高效率、低能耗和能够处理广泛原料的优势。它具体解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。传统丙烯生产方法通常依赖乙烷作为主要原料，而乙烷的储量相对于丙烷较少。PDH技术允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而可能增加丙烯的供应量。从过程效率的角度来看，PDH已被证明具有更高的产率和更好的丙烯选择性，与其他方法相比。产品选择性是PDH的另一个关键方面，在这里它表现出更高的效率和环境友好性，提供了一条更高效的丙烯生产途径。
