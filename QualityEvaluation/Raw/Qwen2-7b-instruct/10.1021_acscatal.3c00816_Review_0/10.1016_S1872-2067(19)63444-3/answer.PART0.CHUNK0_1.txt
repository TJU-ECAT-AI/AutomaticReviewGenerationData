[1] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning low-value propane into value-added propylene."
[2] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application."
[3] "Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration."
[4] "These issues necessitate the exploration of alternative catalysts that should exhibit advantages in terms of environmental and economic aspects."
[5] "Supported VOx catalysts have been intensively employed in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH) [ 12 ,13 ,14 ], while they have received relatively less attention in oxygen-free PDH reaction."
[6] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."
[7] "The catalytic performance of the 3VSiBeta catalyst was completely restored after several regeneration cycles, presenting its great reusability."
[8] "Meanwhile, the catalytic performance of the 3VSiBeta catalyst was completely restored after several regeneration cycles, presenting its great reusability."
[9] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [ 32 ], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."
[10] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst possesses isolated VOx species in monolayer on the zeolite, generating substantial acidic sites, and thus shows the comparable catalytic activity with the 7/10VSiBeta catalysts."
[11] "Moreover, the original valance state of V has a negligible impact on the catalytic performance."
[12] "It is also confirmed that both of propylene selectivity and the deactivation rate caused by coke deposition increase with the increasing polymerization degree of VOx species."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH provides a viable alternative for propylene production that addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods relying on naphtha or heavy oil cracking, PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and relatively inexpensive, making it more environmentally friendly and economically viable. 

Secondly, PDH circumvents the limitations of conventional catalysts, such as the high cost and toxicity of platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are typically used in commercial PDH processes. These catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration, which increases operational costs and reduces efficiency. 

PDH, particularly when employing VOx catalysts supported on SiBeta zeolite, demonstrates high catalytic activity, comparable to that of catalysts with higher vanadium loadings, and exhibits excellent reusability. The catalysts maintain their performance after multiple regeneration cycles, indicating robustness and sustainability. This is crucial for industrial applications, as it minimizes the need for constant catalyst replacement and enhances operational efficiency.

The PDH process is further optimized by the nature of the vanadium species (VOx) on the SiBeta support. Monomeric or isolated VOx species at low vanadium loadings show high catalytic activity, while higher loadings lead to the formation of polymerized VOx species, which increase propylene selectivity and contribute to deactivation rates. Understanding these relationships allows for the rational design of catalysts that maximize propylene yield and minimize coke formation, thereby enhancing overall process efficiency.

In summary, PDH offers a more sustainable and efficient method for propylene production compared to traditional techniques, addressing critical issues such as feedstock availability, catalyst economics, and process performance. By leveraging the unique properties of VOx catalysts on SiBeta supports, this technology promises to revolutionize the propylene industry, contributing to both environmental and economic benefits.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中展现出一系列关键优势，并解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，包括原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性。与依赖石脑油或重油裂解的传统方法不同，PDH利用丙烷作为原料，后者丰富且成本较低，这使其在环境友好性和经济性方面更具吸引力。

PDH克服了铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx）等传统催化剂的局限性，这些催化剂通常用于商业PDH过程中，成本高且毒性大，需要频繁再生，增加了运营成本并降低了效率。

使用二氧化硅β型沸石支持的VOx催化剂，PDH表现出高度的催化活性，与负载更高量钒的催化剂相当，并且具有出色的可重复使用性。催化剂在多次再生循环后仍能保持其性能，显示出其稳健性和可持续性。这对于工业应用至关重要，因为它减少了不断更换催化剂的需求，提高了运营效率。

PDH过程通过二氧化硅β型沸石支持的钒物种（VOx）的独特性质得到了优化。低钒负载下的孤立或单体VOx物种显示出了高催化活性，而较高的负载导致形成聚合化的VOx物种，这增加了丙烯选择性和导致结焦速率的增加。理解这些关系允许根据丙烯产量最大化和减少焦炭形成的原则设计催化剂，从而提高整体过程效率。

综上所述，PDH提供了一种更可持续、更高效的丙烯生产方法，与传统技术相比，它解决了关键问题，如原料供应、催化剂经济学和工艺性能。通过利用二氧化硅β型沸石支持的VOx催化剂的独特特性，这项技术有望彻底改变丙烯行业，为环境和经济效益带来贡献。
