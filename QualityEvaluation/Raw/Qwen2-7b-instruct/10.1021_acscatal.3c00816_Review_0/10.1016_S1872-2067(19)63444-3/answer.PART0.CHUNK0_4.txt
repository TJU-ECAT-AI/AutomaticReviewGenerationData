[1] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning low-value propane into value-added propylene."
[2] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application."
[3] "Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration."
[4] "Given the above, there is not a definite conclusion about the kind of active vanadium species for PDH, in terms of polymerization degree, acidity and oxidation state, because the surface chemistry of VOx species is deeply affected by support characteristics."
[5] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [32], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, it provides a more sustainable route to propylene production, particularly given the rise in shale gas exploitation, as it can efficiently convert low-value propane into value-added propylene. This method bypasses the need for expensive and toxic catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx), which are used in traditional processes but come with high costs and environmental concerns. Additionally, PDH avoids the frequent deactivation and regeneration requirements that plague Pt and CrOx-based catalysts, improving process efficiency. Furthermore, the PDH technology does not have a definitive conclusion regarding the optimal type of active vanadium species involved, due to the complex surface chemistry of vanadium oxide (VOx) species on different supports. However, the proposed use of vanadium loaded on silicon beta zeolite (V-SiBeta) suggests it might be a promising catalyst for PDH, potentially offering an alternative route with favorable characteristics.

考虑到全球丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术通过解决几个关键问题来应对传统生产方法面临的挑战。首先，它提供了一种更可持续的丙烯生产途径，特别是在页岩气开发日益增长的情况下，能够高效地将低价值的丙烷转化为附加值更高的丙烯。这种方法跳过了使用昂贵且有毒的催化剂如铂（Pt）和铬氧化物（CrOx），这些传统过程具有高成本和环境问题。此外，PDH避免了Pt和CrOx基催化剂经常需要的失活和再生要求，提高了过程效率。另外，PDH技术对于涉及的活性钒物种的最佳类型没有明确的结论，这归因于不同支撑材料上VOx物种复杂的表面化学性质。然而，提议在硅β沸石上负载钒（V-SiBeta）可能是PDH的一个有前景的催化剂，可能提供具有有利特性的替代途径。
