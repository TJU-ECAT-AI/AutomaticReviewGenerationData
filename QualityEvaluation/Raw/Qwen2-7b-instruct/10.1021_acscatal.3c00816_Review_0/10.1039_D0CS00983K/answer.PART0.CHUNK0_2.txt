[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."
[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[3] "However, the high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment-friendly catalysts."
[4] "In terms of catalysts, the development of a highly coking and sintering-resistant Pt catalyst is an important direction, and researchers have already achieved exciting improvements."
[5] "Moreover, the exploration of in situ characterization techniques for in-depth research on the reaction mechanism as well as the nature of the active sites of the catalyst is also a great challenge."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. Key advantages include:
   - Addressing feedstock availability concerns by utilizing readily available propane as a feedstock.
   - Enhancing process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene in a single step, bypassing the need for multi-stage processes typically involved in conventional methods.
   - Improving product selectivity, allowing for higher yields of propylene with reduced production of byproducts.

2. The high demand for propylene has propelled the rapid development and application of PDH technologies, making it a preferred solution for propylene production.

3. Researchers aim to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts used in PDH processes, addressing the limitations posed by the high cost of Pt and potential environmental issues related to the use of CrOx catalysts.

4. Significant advancements have been made in developing highly coking and sintering-resistant Pt catalysts, demonstrating promising results in PDH applications.

5. The ongoing challenge involves the in-depth research of reaction mechanisms and catalyst active sites, which could lead to further improvements in PDH technology and catalyst performance.
