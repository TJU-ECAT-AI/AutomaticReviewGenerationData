<quotes>
[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to mono-olefins, especially propane dehydrogenation to propylene has gained widespread attention and much development in the field of research and commercial application."
[3] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[4] "High energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol−1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium."
[5] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."
[6] "Operating at around 600 C seems to be more feasible."
[7] "The most suitable reaction pressure may be equal to the sum of the pressure-drop from the outlet of the reactor to the inlet of the oil vapor compressor and the inlet pressure of the compressor, which is controlled to be slightly above atmospheric pressure."
[8] "In the initial stage of the development of a new catalyst, the evaluating conditions should be screened carefully to ensure that the research work is meaningful."
[9] "The key is to improve efficiency with reduced pressure drop, since reducing the operation pressure of the reactor is helpful to enhance the single-pass conversion and reduce the energy consumption of the whole process."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically tackles these challenges as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, which is readily available as a feedstock. It does not require the high-pressure cracking of hydrocarbons like conventional methods, making it more flexible in terms of feedstock sourcing.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By converting propane directly to propylene, PDH bypasses intermediate steps that consume energy, such as cracking naphtha to produce lighter hydrocarbons. This results in a more efficient process with reduced energy consumption and lower operational costs.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology is designed to maximize the yield of propylene with high selectivity, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts like methane, ethane, and coke. This leads to higher-quality propylene output, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring pure propylene.

4. **Thermodynamic Optimization**: PDH optimizes reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, to enhance the conversion of propane to propylene while minimizing the formation of byproducts. This is achieved through careful control of reaction parameters, ensuring that the process operates efficiently within the thermodynamic limits for propylene production.

5. **Energy Efficiency**: Reducing the operation pressure of the reactor helps to enhance the single-pass conversion of propane to propylene, thereby reducing the overall energy consumption of the process. This is crucial for achieving sustainable and economically viable operations.

In summary, PDH technology offers a streamlined, efficient, and environmentally friendly approach to propylene production that addresses the limitations of traditional methods, making it a promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

在最近几年，丙烯需求的持续增长推动了轻烷烃脱氢技术，尤其是丙烷脱氢制丙烯的广泛应用和发展。使用工业上广泛采用的铂锡（PtSn）和铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂，在适当的条件下，它们展现出满意的脱氢活性和选择性。

脱氢过程面临的挑战主要包括高能耗问题：完全转化一摩尔丙烷至丙烯所需的热量约为120 kJ/mol；单次通过转化率受限于热力学平衡。为提高丙烷转化率，可采取以下措施：提高反应温度、降低烃分压以及降低氢气分压。操作温度大约为600°C较为可行。最合适的反应压力应当等于从反应器出口到油蒸汽压缩机入口的压力损失加上压缩机入口压力，通常控制在稍高于大气压力。

新催化剂的开发初期，应仔细筛选评估条件，以确保研究工作具有实际意义。优化设计的关键在于提高效率并减少压降，通过降低反应器的操作压力来增强单次转化率，并减少整个过程的能量消耗。

总之，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术以其解决传统生产方法面临的原料获取、过程效率和产品选择性问题的优势脱颖而出，成为丙烯生产的最具前景的方法。通过优化反应条件、提高转化率并减少副产品的生成，PDH技术不仅提供了更灵活的原料选择，还提高了过程效率，减少了能耗，同时提升了丙烯的质量，从而满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求。

<p>Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added.</p>
<p>Between 500 C and 700 C, the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes increases nearly linearly with temperature (Fig. 1a); the accepted upper limit of temperature for PDH, however, may be about 630 C.1 Exceeding the limit will cause severe side reactions including thermal cracking and coking. Hence, operating at around 600 C seems to be more feasible. For isobutane dehydrogenation, the temperature can be a little lower.</p>
<p>Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple. To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2.</p>
<p>An overview of the representative dehydrogenation catalysts, including reaction conditions, key results, and references, is given in Table 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a.png" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b.png" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor. For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussions, it can be seen that additives play key roles in improving the selectivity to olefins, catalyst coking and sintering resistance. The additives are classified into two categories: one is alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides to neutralize the acidity of the carriers to lessen the side reactions catalyzed by acid sites44 and the other is metal or nonmetal elements to modify the properties of Pt. The latter category will be discussed here.</p>
<p>As stated above, it is very difficult to study the dehydrogenation mechanism of light alkanes such as propane over solid catalysts at high temperatures, and it is almost impossible to identify the intermediate species of the reaction. Therefore, how the reaction is carried out on the surface of a catalyst can only be speculated based on experimental phenomena and theoretical calculations.</p>
<p>According to the one-step dehydrogenation mechanism, shortening the mean residence time of oil vapor in the catalyst bed of the reactor is the most effective measure to improve the selectivity to olefins, since the formed olefins go straight into the gas phase without desorbing from the active sites.</p>
<p>In terms of catalysts, the development of a highly coking and sintering-resistant Pt catalyst is an important direction, and researchers have already achieved exciting improvements. However, for new environment-friendly catalysts, the long term stability of both the dehydrogenation performance and the structural properties is of great importance for industrial application.</p>
