<p>Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added.</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to achieve the ideal state in practice, the actual results can approach this state very closely via the application of both an appropriate catalyst and the optimized reaction conditions.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) theoretically achieves an atom-economic reaction, producing one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen from one mole of propane. While this ideal state might not be practically attainable, it can be closely approached through the use of an appropriate catalyst and optimized conditions.
