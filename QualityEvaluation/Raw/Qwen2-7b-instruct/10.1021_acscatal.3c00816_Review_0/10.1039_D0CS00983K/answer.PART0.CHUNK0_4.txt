<p>Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added.</p>
<p>Between 500 C and 700 C, the equilibrium conversion of light alkanes increases nearly linearly with temperature (Fig. 1a); the accepted upper limit of temperature for PDH, however, may be about 630 C.1 Exceeding the limit will cause severe side reactions including thermal cracking and coking. Hence, operating at around 600 C seems to be more feasible. For isobutane dehydrogenation, the temperature can be a little lower.</p>
<p>Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple. To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2.</p>
<p>An overview of the representative dehydrogenation catalysts, including reaction conditions, key results, and references, is given in Table 1.</p>

<p>For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor. For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussions, it can be seen that additives play key roles in improving the selectivity to olefins, catalyst coking and sintering resistance. The additives are classified into two categories: one is alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides to neutralize the acidity of the carriers to lessen the side reactions catalyzed by acid sites44 and the other is metal or nonmetal elements to modify the properties of Pt. The latter category will be discussed here.</p>
<p>As stated above, it is very difficult to study the dehydrogenation mechanism of light alkanes such as propane over solid catalysts at high temperatures, and it is almost impossible to identify the intermediate species of the reaction. Therefore, how the reaction is carried out on the surface of a catalyst can only be speculated based on experimental phenomena and theoretical calculations.</p>
<p>According to the one-step dehydrogenation mechanism, shortening the mean residence time of oil vapor in the catalyst bed of the reactor is the most effective measure to improve the selectivity to olefins, since the formed olefins go straight into the gas phase without desorbing from the active sites.</p>
<p>In terms of catalysts, the development of a highly coking and sintering-resistant Pt catalyst is an important direction, and researchers have already achieved exciting improvements. However, for new environment-friendly catalysts, the long term stability of both the dehydrogenation performance and the structural properties is of great importance for industrial application.</p>
