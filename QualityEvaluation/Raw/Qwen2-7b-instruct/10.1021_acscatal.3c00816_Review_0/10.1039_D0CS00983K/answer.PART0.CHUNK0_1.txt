1. The growing global demand for propylene has led to the rapid adoption and advancement of propane dehydrogenation technology. This method is particularly advantageous due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to traditional production methods.

2. Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely utilized in the industry and demonstrate satisfactory performance in dehydrogenation processes. However, the high cost of Pt and the environmental concerns associated with CrOx have prompted researchers to seek ways to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to develop new, less expensive, and environmentally friendly catalyst alternatives.

3. Researchers are focusing on developing highly resistant Pt catalysts that can withstand coking and sintering, showing promising improvements. 

4. For new environment-friendly catalysts, maintaining both high dehydrogenation performance and structural stability over time is crucial for their successful industrial application.
