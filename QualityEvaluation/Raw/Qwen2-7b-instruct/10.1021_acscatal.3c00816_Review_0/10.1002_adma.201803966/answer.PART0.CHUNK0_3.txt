The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is more readily available and abundant compared to the traditional feedstocks used in conventional methods. This makes PDH a more sustainable option. In terms of process efficiency, PDH technology allows for a direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, leading to a higher yield and reduced energy consumption. Additionally, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, producing pure propylene without the formation of unwanted byproducts, which enhances the economic viability and environmental impact of the process.
