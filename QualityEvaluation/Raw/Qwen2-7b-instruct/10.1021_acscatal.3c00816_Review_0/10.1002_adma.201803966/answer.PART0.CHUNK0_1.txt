[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and more readily available compared to traditional oil-based sources used in steam cracking. This addresses the issue of feedstock scarcity and variability in oil markets. 

In terms of process efficiency, PDH is a more direct and energy-efficient process for producing propylene from propane, eliminating the need for intermediate steps like cracking and reforming. This reduces overall energy consumption and operational costs.

Product selectivity is another major advantage, as PDH selectively produces propylene without the byproducts associated with steam cracking, such as ethylene, butadiene, and hydrogen. This results in a cleaner and more valuable propylene product stream, enhancing marketability and profitability.

Moreover, PDH technology can operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to steam cracking, reducing capital investment and operational costs. It also allows for the utilization of existing infrastructure, making the transition to PDH technology more economically feasible for existing petrochemical plants.

In summary, PDH technology provides a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective means of propylene production, leveraging abundant propane resources, minimizing byproduct formation, and reducing environmental impact compared to traditional steam cracking methods.

最近的研究主要集中在将超小的贵金属纳米粒子，如金、铂、钯、钌和铑，固定在结晶型多孔材料上。相比之下，关于在结晶型多孔材料上支持超小非贵金属纳米粒子的报道很少，因为非贵金属纳米粒子活性更高，容易聚集并随反应和还原条件增大，导致性能下降。

PDH技术在丙烯生产中的优势包括解决传统方法面临的挑战，涉及原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性。PDH技术使用丙烷作为原料，其供应丰富且稳定性高，相比于传统的以石油为基础的原料（如蒸汽裂解）更易获得。这解决了石油市场波动性和稀缺性问题。

从工艺效率角度看，PDH是一种直接且能源高效的丙烯生产方式，能够从丙烷直接转化为丙烯，无需中间步骤如裂解和重整。这减少了整体能耗和运营成本。

产品选择性是另一个重要优势，PDH技术能选择性地生产丙烯，避免了蒸汽裂解过程中产生的乙烷、丁二烯和氢等副产物，产生更纯净、更有价值的丙烯产品流，提高市场竞争力和盈利能力。

此外，与蒸汽裂解相比，PDH技术可在较低温度和压力下运行，降低资本投资和运营成本。它还可以利用现有的基础设施，使现有石油化工厂转换为PDH技术更加经济可行。

综上所述，PDH技术提供了一种可持续、高效、低成本的丙烯生产方式，充分利用丰富的丙烷资源，减少副产物形成，并降低环境影响，与传统蒸汽裂解方法相比更具优势。
