[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials."
[2] "In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."

In the context of propylene production, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products like ethylene, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. This direct conversion enhances process efficiency by bypassing the traditional multi-step processes that involve the production of ethylene, which can be energy-intensive and less efficient. Moreover, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, yielding propylene with minimal byproducts, which improves the economic viability and environmental impact of propylene production.

PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:
1. Feedstock Availability: Conventional methods often rely on ethylene, which is derived from crude oil or natural gas. PDH technology utilizes propane, a more abundant and versatile feedstock, particularly in regions with ample natural gas resources but limited access to crude oil.
2. Process Efficiency: By directly converting propane into propylene, PDH technology minimizes the number of processing steps, reducing energy consumption and operational costs. This streamlined process also decreases the risk of impurities and side reactions, enhancing overall efficiency.
3. Product Selectivity: PDH technology ensures high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of byproducts like paraffins and olefins. This selective conversion is crucial for maintaining high-quality propylene output, which is essential for various downstream applications in petrochemicals and plastics manufacturing.

在丙烯生产背景下，PDH技术的主要优势在于其能够解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH技术是目前最具有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需中间产物如乙烯，从而解决了原料供应的问题。这一直接转化方式通过绕过传统多步骤流程（这些流程涉及乙烯的生产，这通常既能耗高又效率低），提升了过程效率。此外，PDH技术确保了高产品选择性，能有效减少副产品的形成，提高了丙烯生产的经济性和环境影响。

PDH技术在以下几个方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：
1. 原料供应：传统方法往往依赖于乙烯，后者来源于原油或天然气。相比之下，PDH技术利用更丰富且更具灵活性的丙烷作为原料，特别是在拥有大量天然气资源但原油资源有限的地区。
2. 过程效率：PDH技术通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，减少了处理步骤的数量，降低了能源消耗和运营成本。这一精简流程也有助于降低杂质和副反应的风险，从而提升整体效率。
3. 产品选择性：PDH技术确保了高选择性丙烯生产，最大限度地减少了副产品的形成，如烷烃和烯烃。这种选择性的转化对于维持高质量的丙烯输出至关重要，这对于塑料和其他下游应用的石化产品制造非常重要。
