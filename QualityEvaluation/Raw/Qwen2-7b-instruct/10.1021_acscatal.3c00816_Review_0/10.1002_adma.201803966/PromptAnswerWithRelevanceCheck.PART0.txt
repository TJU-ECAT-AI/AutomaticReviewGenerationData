<p>In recent decades, metal nanoparticles (MNPs) have drawn increasing attention as an important class of nanocatalysts because of their superior activities in heterogeneous catalytic reactions in which the size of the MNPs is a significant factor in determining their performance.1 Decreasing the particle size of MNPs can greatly increase the exposed active sites; in particular, sub-nanometric metallic clusters and even single metal atom catalysts have demonstrated their excellent ability to achieve high catalytic activity and selectivity.2 However, the poor stability and severe aggregation in catalytic processes remain major problems for MNPs with small particle sizes due to their substantially increased surface free energy. To overcome the aforementioned problems, MNPs can be immobilized onto solid supports.3 Thus far, various supports, including graphene, metal oxides, polymers, and nanoporous materials have been used to anchor the MNPs. However, doping the MNPs onto the surface of the supports may not supply satisfactory stability due to direct exposure of metals under harsh reaction conditions. Among these supports, nanoporous materials, such as zeolites, mesoporous silica, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) with high surface areas and well-defined nanopores/cavities, have proven to be a class of ideal hosts to confine ultrasmall MNPs in their nanopores to protect against sintering.4 Notably, crystalline nanoporous materials, such as zeolites with ordered micropores (<2 nm) and MOFs constructed from metal sites coordinated with functional organic linkers, are currently the most popular nanoporous supports.[4, 5] These crystalline nanoporous supports can act as powerful hosts, encapsulating the MNPs inside the inner void nanospaces and protecting their further size increase as well as facilitating the unique catalytic shape selectivities.6 The resultant nanopore-encaged metal catalysts are widely used as highly efficient nanocatalysts in many industrial applications, including olefin polymerization, olefin dehydrogenation, and diesel oxidation.[4, 7] In recent years, these nanocatalysts have also been used in many new catalytic fields, such as chemical energy storage involving the hydrogen generated from formic acid, ammonia borane or hydrazine, the production of biomass-derived fuels and chemicals, as well as new energy generated from fuel processing.8 Moreover, taking advantage of the synergistic effect between confined small MNPs and nanoporous frameworks with active sites can realize significant improvements in catalytic performance9 and can afford efficient cascade catalytic processes.10</p>

[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and more readily available compared to traditional oil-based sources used in steam cracking. This addresses the issue of feedstock scarcity and variability in oil markets. 

In terms of process efficiency, PDH is a more direct and energy-efficient process for producing propylene from propane, eliminating the need for intermediate steps like cracking and reforming. This reduces overall energy consumption and operational costs.

Product selectivity is another major advantage, as PDH selectively produces propylene without the byproducts associated with steam cracking, such as ethylene, butadiene, and hydrogen. This results in a cleaner and more valuable propylene product stream, enhancing marketability and profitability.

Moreover, PDH technology can operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to steam cracking, reducing capital investment and operational costs. It also allows for the utilization of existing infrastructure, making the transition to PDH technology more economically feasible for existing petrochemical plants.

In summary, PDH technology provides a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective means of propylene production, leveraging abundant propane resources, minimizing byproduct formation, and reducing environmental impact compared to traditional steam cracking methods.

最近的研究主要集中在将超小的贵金属纳米粒子，如金、铂、钯、钌和铑，固定在结晶型多孔材料上。相比之下，关于在结晶型多孔材料上支持超小非贵金属纳米粒子的报道很少，因为非贵金属纳米粒子活性更高，容易聚集并随反应和还原条件增大，导致性能下降。

PDH技术在丙烯生产中的优势包括解决传统方法面临的挑战，涉及原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性。PDH技术使用丙烷作为原料，其供应丰富且稳定性高，相比于传统的以石油为基础的原料（如蒸汽裂解）更易获得。这解决了石油市场波动性和稀缺性问题。

从工艺效率角度看，PDH是一种直接且能源高效的丙烯生产方式，能够从丙烷直接转化为丙烯，无需中间步骤如裂解和重整。这减少了整体能耗和运营成本。

产品选择性是另一个重要优势，PDH技术能选择性地生产丙烯，避免了蒸汽裂解过程中产生的乙烷、丁二烯和氢等副产物，产生更纯净、更有价值的丙烯产品流，提高市场竞争力和盈利能力。

此外，与蒸汽裂解相比，PDH技术可在较低温度和压力下运行，降低资本投资和运营成本。它还可以利用现有的基础设施，使现有石油化工厂转换为PDH技术更加经济可行。

综上所述，PDH技术提供了一种可持续、高效、低成本的丙烯生产方式，充分利用丰富的丙烷资源，减少副产物形成，并降低环境影响，与传统蒸汽裂解方法相比更具优势。

In the context of propylene production, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products like ethylene, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. This direct conversion enhances process efficiency by bypassing the traditional multi-step processes that involve the production of ethylene, which can be energy-intensive and less efficient. Moreover, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, yielding propylene with minimal byproducts, which improves the economic viability and environmental impact of propylene production.

PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:
1. Feedstock Availability: Conventional methods often rely on ethylene, which is derived from crude oil or natural gas. PDH technology utilizes propane, a more abundant and versatile feedstock, particularly in regions with ample natural gas resources but limited access to crude oil.
2. Process Efficiency: By directly converting propane into propylene, PDH technology minimizes the number of processing steps, reducing energy consumption and operational costs. This streamlined process also decreases the risk of impurities and side reactions, enhancing overall efficiency.
3. Product Selectivity: PDH technology ensures high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of byproducts like paraffins and olefins. This selective conversion is crucial for maintaining high-quality propylene output, which is essential for various downstream applications in petrochemicals and plastics manufacturing.
