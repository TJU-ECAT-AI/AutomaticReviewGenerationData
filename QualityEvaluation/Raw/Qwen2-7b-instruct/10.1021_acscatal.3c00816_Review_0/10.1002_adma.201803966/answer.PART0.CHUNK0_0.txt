<p>In recent decades, metal nanoparticles (MNPs) have drawn increasing attention as an important class of nanocatalysts because of their superior activities in heterogeneous catalytic reactions in which the size of the MNPs is a significant factor in determining their performance.1 Decreasing the particle size of MNPs can greatly increase the exposed active sites; in particular, sub-nanometric metallic clusters and even single metal atom catalysts have demonstrated their excellent ability to achieve high catalytic activity and selectivity.2 However, the poor stability and severe aggregation in catalytic processes remain major problems for MNPs with small particle sizes due to their substantially increased surface free energy. To overcome the aforementioned problems, MNPs can be immobilized onto solid supports.3 Thus far, various supports, including graphene, metal oxides, polymers, and nanoporous materials have been used to anchor the MNPs. However, doping the MNPs onto the surface of the supports may not supply satisfactory stability due to direct exposure of metals under harsh reaction conditions. Among these supports, nanoporous materials, such as zeolites, mesoporous silica, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) with high surface areas and well-defined nanopores/cavities, have proven to be a class of ideal hosts to confine ultrasmall MNPs in their nanopores to protect against sintering.4 Notably, crystalline nanoporous materials, such as zeolites with ordered micropores (<2 nm) and MOFs constructed from metal sites coordinated with functional organic linkers, are currently the most popular nanoporous supports.[4, 5] These crystalline nanoporous supports can act as powerful hosts, encapsulating the MNPs inside the inner void nanospaces and protecting their further size increase as well as facilitating the unique catalytic shape selectivities.6 The resultant nanopore-encaged metal catalysts are widely used as highly efficient nanocatalysts in many industrial applications, including olefin polymerization, olefin dehydrogenation, and diesel oxidation.[4, 7] In recent years, these nanocatalysts have also been used in many new catalytic fields, such as chemical energy storage involving the hydrogen generated from formic acid, ammonia borane or hydrazine, the production of biomass-derived fuels and chemicals, as well as new energy generated from fuel processing.8 Moreover, taking advantage of the synergistic effect between confined small MNPs and nanoporous frameworks with active sites can realize significant improvements in catalytic performance9 and can afford efficient cascade catalytic processes.10</p>
