[1] "Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials."
[2] "In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, such as steam reforming and methanol production. This reduces the complexity and cost of the process, as well as the environmental impact. It specifically addresses the challenges by utilizing a more abundant and versatile feedstock (propane) compared to traditional methods that rely heavily on natural gas. The PDH process is more efficient in terms of energy usage and product selectivity, producing propylene with higher yields and purity. Additionally, PDH technology can operate under a wider range of conditions, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability to different industrial settings.
