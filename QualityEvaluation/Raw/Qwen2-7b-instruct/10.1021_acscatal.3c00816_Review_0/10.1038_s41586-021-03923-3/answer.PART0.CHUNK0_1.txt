PDH technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production, addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Firstly, PDH provides an alternative to oil-based cracking processes, making it a sustainable option for producing propylene. It avoids the toxicity issues associated with Cr(VI) compounds and the ecological harm caused by chlorine usage in catalyst regeneration, which are common in conventional technologies. The development of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO showcases a significant advancement in the field. These catalysts, prepared through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment, enable the formation of active ZnOx species. This method is particularly effective due to the role of defective OH groups in this process. When benchmarked against a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 demonstrates superior performance, achieving approximately three times higher propene productivity while maintaining comparable propene selectivity under industrially relevant conditions.

PDH技术在丙烯生产中提供了一系列关键优势，解决了传统方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。首先，PDH为基于油裂解过程之外的丙烯生产提供了替代方案，使其成为可持续生产丙烯的选项。它避免了与Cr(VI)化合物相关的毒性问题和常规技术中使用对环境有害的氯进行催化剂再生的问题。根据商业ZnO开发的环境兼容支持催化剂展示了一个重要的进展领域。这些催化剂通过将支持OH基团与在还原处理过程中从ZnO产生的Zn原子反应形成活性ZnOx物种来准备。这种方法特别有效，由于缺陷OH基团在此过程中发挥的作用。当与商用KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂进行基准测试时，开发的ZnOsilicalite-1表现出显著的性能优势，在工业相关条件下，丙烯转化率接近时，其丙烯生产力大约提高了三倍，同时保持了相似的丙烯选择性。
