[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
[3] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."
[4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

PDH technology stands out due to its ability to produce propylene as an alternative to oil-based cracking processes, offering benefits in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It addresses the challenges of conventional methods by eliminating the toxicity issues associated with Cr(VI) compounds and reducing the ecological harm caused by chlorine usage in catalyst regeneration. By utilizing ZnO-supported catalysts, this technology achieves higher propene productivity while maintaining comparable propene selectivity, demonstrating its potential as a more sustainable and efficient approach to propylene production.
