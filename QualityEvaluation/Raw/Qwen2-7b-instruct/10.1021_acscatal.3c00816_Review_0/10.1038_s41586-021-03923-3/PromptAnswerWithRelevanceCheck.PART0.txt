PDH technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production, addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Firstly, PDH provides an alternative to oil-based cracking processes, making it a sustainable option for producing propylene. It avoids the toxicity issues associated with Cr(VI) compounds and the ecological harm caused by chlorine usage in catalyst regeneration, which are common in conventional technologies. The development of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO showcases a significant advancement in the field. These catalysts, prepared through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment, enable the formation of active ZnOx species. This method is particularly effective due to the role of defective OH groups in this process. When benchmarked against a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 demonstrates superior performance, achieving approximately three times higher propene productivity while maintaining comparable propene selectivity under industrially relevant conditions.
