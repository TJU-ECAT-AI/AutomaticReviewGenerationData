[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
[3] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."
[4] "For benchmarking purposes, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 and an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 were tested in the same setup under industrially relevant conditions at close propane conversion over about 400h on propane stream."
[5] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production. It addresses the challenges of conventional methods by providing an alternative to oil-based cracking processes, which ensures a more sustainable feedstock source. PDH technology avoids the toxicity issues associated with chromium compounds and eliminates the need for environmentally harmful chlorine in catalyst regeneration, promoting a more eco-friendly production process. 

2. In the context of PDH technology, the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst stands out for its enhanced performance. Compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the ZnOsilicalite-1 shows significantly higher propene productivity while maintaining a similar level of propene selectivity. This indicates a more efficient conversion of propane to propene, contributing to higher output and potentially lower operational costs.

1. 烷基脱氢化（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中提供了几个关键优势。它通过提供一种替代石油基裂解过程的方法，确保了更可持续的原料来源，解决了传统方法的挑战。PDH技术避免了与六价铬化合物相关的毒性问题，并消除了在催化剂再生过程中使用对环境有害的氯的需求，从而促进了一个更环保的生产过程。

2. 在PDH技术背景下，开发的ZnOsilicalite-1催化剂表现出显著的优势。与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂相比，ZnOsilicalite-1在类似丙烯选择性的情况下，丙烯生产力更高。这表明了更高的丙烷到丙烯的转化效率，可能带来更高的产出和更低的操作成本。
