[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical1,2."
[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration9."
[3] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."
[4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

1.Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers an alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, which is a crucial industrial chemical. It addresses challenges associated with conventional methods, such as the toxicity of chromium compounds and the environmental impact of using chlorine for catalyst regeneration.

2. The key advantages of PDH technology include its ability to utilize propane as a feedstock, potentially offering greater flexibility and sustainability compared to traditional oil-based processes. It also aims to improve process efficiency and product selectivity, as demonstrated by the developed ZnOsilicalite-1 catalyst, which exhibits enhanced propene productivity while maintaining high propene selectivity.
