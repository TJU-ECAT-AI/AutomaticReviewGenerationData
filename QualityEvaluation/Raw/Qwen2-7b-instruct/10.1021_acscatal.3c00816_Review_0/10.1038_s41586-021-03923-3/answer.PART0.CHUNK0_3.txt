The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as presented in the document, include its potential to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers an alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propylene, an industrially important platform chemical. It specifically addresses these challenges in several ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which may offer more sustainable and potentially abundant resources compared to oil-based methods, addressing concerns over feedstock availability.
2. Process efficiency: The introduction of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO highlights the development of more efficient processes that reduce environmental impact. The in-situ formation of active ZnOx species through reductive treatment above 550°C demonstrates a novel approach to catalyst preparation that could enhance process efficiency.
3. Product selectivity: The document reports that the developed catalyst shows significantly higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity, indicating improved efficiency in converting propane to propene while maintaining high selectivity. This addresses the challenge of achieving high product selectivity in the production process.
