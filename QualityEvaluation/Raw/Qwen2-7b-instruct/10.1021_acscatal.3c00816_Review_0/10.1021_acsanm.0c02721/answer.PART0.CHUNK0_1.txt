The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology efficiently converts propane into propylene, making it a promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more direct and potentially more sustainable pathway for propylene synthesis. This method enhances feedstock utilization, improves process efficiency, and ensures better product selectivity compared to traditional methods.
