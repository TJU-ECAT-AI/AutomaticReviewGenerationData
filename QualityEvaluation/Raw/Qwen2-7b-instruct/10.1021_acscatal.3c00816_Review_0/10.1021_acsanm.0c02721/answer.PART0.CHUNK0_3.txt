Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production. It addresses challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available worldwide. This makes it less dependent on scarce or regionally limited resources compared to methods that rely on more specialized or expensive feedstocks.

2. Process efficiency: PDH technology typically operates at lower temperatures and pressures than other processes, such as catalytic cracking or steam cracking, which reduces energy consumption and lowers operational costs. Additionally, it often involves a more straightforward process flow, minimizing the complexity and potential for inefficiencies in the production chain.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology selectively converts propane to propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This results in higher purity propylene, which is essential for applications requiring high-purity products, such as petrochemicals and polymers. Furthermore, the process allows for greater control over the yield and quality of propylene, optimizing the production for specific market demands.

在丙烯日益增长的世界需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产领域具有多项关键优势，并且能够针对传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战，具体体现在以下几个方面：

1. 原料供应：PDH技术以丙烷为主要原料，该原料全球广泛可用且储量丰富。相比之下，依赖于稀缺或地区性资源的其他方法可能会受到限制。

2. 工艺效率：与催化裂化或蒸汽裂化等其他过程相比，PDH技术通常在较低温度和压力下运行，从而降低了能耗并降低了运营成本。此外，其过程流通常更为简单，减少了生产链中的复杂性和潜在的低效问题。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术仅选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，最大限度地减少了副产品的形成。这导致了更高纯度的丙烯产出，这对于需要高纯度产品的应用（如石油化工和聚合物）至关重要。此外，该过程允许对丙烯的产率和质量进行更精确的控制，以优化满足特定市场需求的生产。
