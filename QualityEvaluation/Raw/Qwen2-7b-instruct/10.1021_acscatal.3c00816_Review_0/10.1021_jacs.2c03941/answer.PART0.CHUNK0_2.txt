<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its potential to address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene without oxidation, which enhances feedstock flexibility and reduces the dependency on fossil fuels. It also offers higher process efficiency and improved product selectivity, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production.
