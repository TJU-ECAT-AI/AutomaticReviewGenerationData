[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c).

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
PDH is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to utilize abundant and inexpensive propane derived from shale gas, its capability to inhibit unwanted overoxidation compared to ODH, and its high propylene selectivity that distinguishes it from other processes like MTO and FTO, particularly in terms of product purity.

PDH被认为是最有前景的方法，因为它能够利用来自页岩气的大规模提取，产生廉价且充足的丙烷作为原料。与ODH相比，它能够抑制不必要的过氧化，而且其高丙烯选择性使其在与其他过程如MTO和FTO相比时具有独特性，特别是在产品纯度方面。
