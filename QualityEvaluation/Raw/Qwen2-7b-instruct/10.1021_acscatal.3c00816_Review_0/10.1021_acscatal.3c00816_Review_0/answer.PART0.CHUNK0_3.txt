[1] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil."
[2] "Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."
[3] "Over the past few decades, researchers have developed several new technologies for propylene production, including propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), methanol-to-olefin (MTO), and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO)."
[4] "Especially, PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its ability to utilize abundant and inexpensive propane feedstock derived from shale gas, its effectiveness in preventing unwanted overoxidation in comparison to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and its high propylene selectivity which distinguishes it from hybrid products in methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

PDH技术的关键优势包括能够利用从页岩气中提取的大规模廉价丙烷原料，与氧化脱氢（ODH）相比，它能有效防止不必要的过氧化，以及其高丙烯选择性，这使它与其他MTO和FTO过程中的混合产品区分开来。这解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。
