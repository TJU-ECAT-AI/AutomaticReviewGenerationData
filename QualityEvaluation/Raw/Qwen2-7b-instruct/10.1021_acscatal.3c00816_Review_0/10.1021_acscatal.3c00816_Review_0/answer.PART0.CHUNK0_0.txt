[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."
[2] "The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives."
[3] "To date, several PDH technologies have been developed and industrialized. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin have the widest applications, which, respectively, rely on Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts."
[4] "Valuable lessons could be learned from the mature fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technologies that also operate in harsh conditions, which initially employ the SiO2Al2O3-based catalysts and gradually turn to molecular sieve (zeolite)-based catalysts."
[5] "Researchers have developed several efficient strategies to stabilize highly dispersed active sites on/within molecular sieves, which exhibit outstanding catalytic PDH performance, especially in catalytic lifetime and propylene selectivity."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to utilize abundant shale gas as a cheap and plentiful feedstock, effectively preventing unwanted overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and offering high propylene selectivity through a proprietary technology that distinguishes it from the mixed products of methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes. The high cost of platinum (Pt) and environmental concerns related to chromium oxide (CrOx) have driven researchers to seek out more economical and environmentally friendly alternatives. While Oleflex and Catofin, which use Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts respectively, are widely applied PDH technologies, the industry has benefited from lessons learned from the mature fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, which transitioned from SiO2Al2O3-based catalysts to molecular sieve (zeolite)-based catalysts. Researchers have successfully developed strategies to stabilize highly dispersed active sites within molecular sieves, leading to improved catalytic performance, particularly in terms of long-term stability and propylene selectivity in PDH processes.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够利用大量开采的页岩气作为廉价且充足的原料，有效防止氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中发生的不必要的过氧化反应，并通过一种专有的技术提供高丙烯选择性，这与MTO和FTO过程中的混合产品相区别。铂（Pt）的高昂成本以及铬氧化物（CrOx）对环境的影响促使研究者寻找更经济和环保的替代方案。虽然以Pt为基础和CrOx为基础的催化剂分别应用于Oleflex和Catofin等广泛应用的PDH技术，但从成熟的流化床催化裂化（FCC）工艺中吸取经验，即从SiO2Al2O3基催化剂过渡到分子筛（沸石）基催化剂，对行业而言是有益的。研究者成功开发了在分子筛内稳定高度分散活性位点的策略，这导致了PDH过程的催化性能显著提升，特别是在长期稳定性和丙烯选择性方面。
