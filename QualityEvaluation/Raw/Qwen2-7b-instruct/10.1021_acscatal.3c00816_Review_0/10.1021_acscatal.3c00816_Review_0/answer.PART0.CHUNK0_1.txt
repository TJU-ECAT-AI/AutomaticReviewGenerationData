[2] "To date, several PDH technologies have been developed and industrialized. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin have the widest applications, which, respectively, rely on Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts."
[3] "The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives."
[4] "PDH is acknowledged as a structure-insensitive reaction where the CH bond cleavage can occur on every metal or metaloxygen site, while the undesired CC cracking reactions are typical structure-sensitive reactions that prefer to occur on aggregated sites."

[6] "Unfortunately, the insufficient Al3+5c concentration (27%) restricts the amount of stabilized metal sites (10) and thereby limits the catalytic performance."
[7] "Compared to Al2O3 or other oxide supports, the molecular sieve supports possess a larger specific surface area and well-defined pores/cavities, which have been proven to possess stronger capability to prevent subnanometric metal species from sintering."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to utilize the vast and inexpensive shale gas as a feedstock, inhibit undesired overoxidation, and differentiate itself from hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes through high propylene selectivity. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by relying on abundant and low-cost propane from shale gas extraction. In terms of process efficiency, PDH operates under thermodynamically limited conditions requiring high temperatures, which allows for the effective cleavage of CH bonds. For product selectivity, PDH favors the formation of propylene over other products, which is advantageous for propylene production. Moreover, the development of advanced catalysts, particularly those based on metal-molecular sieves, enhances both the stability and selectivity of the PDH process, leading to increased efficiency and sustainability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产中最具前景的方法，其关键优势在于能够利用大量且低成本的页岩气作为原料，抑制不必要的过氧化，以及与MTO和FTO过程中的混合产品在高丙烯选择性方面相区分。它解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应问题，通过依赖从页岩气提取的大量且低廉的丙烷。就过程效率而言，PDH在需要高温的热力学限制条件下运行，这允许有效地断裂CH键。对于产品选择性，PDH更倾向于形成丙烯而不是其他产品，这对于丙烯生产非常有利。此外，高级催化剂的发展，特别是基于金属分子筛的催化剂，增强了PDH过程的稳定性和选择性，从而提高了效率和可持续性。
