[1] "Recent Progress in Metal-Molecular Sieve Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation"
[2] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil."
[3] "Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."
[4] "Over the past few decades, researchers have developed several new technologies for propylene production, including propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), methanol-to-olefin (MTO), and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO)."
[5] "Especially, PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes."
[6] "The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives."
[7] "To date, several PDH technologies have been developed and industrialized. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin have the widest applications, which, respectively, rely on Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts."
[8] "The stabilization of subnanometric active sites requires large surface area support with a strong metalsupport interaction, which cannot be fully satisfied by conventional Al2O3 support."
[9] "Valuable lessons could be learned from the mature fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technologies that also operate in harsh conditions, which initially employ the SiO2Al2O3-based catalysts and gradually turn to molecular sieve (zeolite)-based catalysts."
[10] "Compared to Al2O3 or other oxide supports, the molecular sieve supports possess a larger specific surface area and well-defined pores/cavities, which have been proven to possess stronger capability to prevent subnanometric metal species from sintering."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes the abundant and inexpensive shale gas as its feedstock, making it more accessible and cost-effective compared to traditional methods that often require expensive naphtha and heavy oil. This allows PDH to produce a steady supply of propane, which is then converted into propylene.

2. Process Efficiency: Unlike oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), PDH inhibits unwanted overoxidation, leading to higher propylene yields and a cleaner production process.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH is a proprietary technology known for its high propylene selectivity, distinguishing it from other methods like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO), which produce a mix of hydrocarbons. This specificity results in a higher purity of propylene as a product.

4. Technological Advancements: Researchers have developed various strategies to stabilize subnanometric active sites, enhancing the efficiency of PDH catalysts. These advancements have led to the use of molecular sieves as supports, which offer superior properties to traditional oxide supports, preventing the sintering of metal species and maintaining their catalytic activity.

5. Environmental Considerations: The high cost of precious metals like platinum (Pt) and environmental concerns related to chromium (Cr) compounds have prompted the exploration of alternative, non-precious, and less toxic catalyst materials. PDH's reliance on these metals and their environmental impact is mitigated by the development of more sustainable alternatives.

6. Industrialization: PDH technologies, such as Oleflex and Catofin, have been successfully industrialized, demonstrating their practicality and scalability for large-scale production.

7. Catalyst Stabilization: The stabilization of subnanometric active sites requires a large surface area support with a strong interaction between the metal and the support. Traditional Al2O3 supports are insufficient for this purpose, necessitating the use of molecular sieves with their larger surface area and defined pore structures.

8. Learning from Mature Technologies: Insights from mature fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technologies, which also operate under harsh conditions, have informed the transition to molecular sieve-based catalysts in PDH processes. This learning has contributed to the development of more effective and stable catalysts for PDH.

考虑到全球丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法。它通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料供应：PDH利用丰富的且价格低廉的页岩气作为原料，这使得其能够提供稳定的丙烷供应，进而将其转化为丙烯，相比传统的需要昂贵的石脑油和重油的方法更具成本效益。

2. 生产效率：与氧化脱氢（ODH）不同，PDH能够抑制不必要的过氧化反应，从而提高丙烯产量并实现更清洁的生产过程。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是一种专有的技术，以其高丙烯选择性而著称，这与甲醇到烯烃（MTO）和费希尔-特罗普斯到烯烃（FTO）过程中的混合物产品相区别。这种特异性导致了更高纯度的丙烯产品。

4. 技术进步：研究人员开发了各种策略来稳定亚纳米级活性位点，提高了PDH催化剂的效率。这些进展导致了分子筛作为支持材料的应用，它们比传统氧化物支持提供了更好的性能，防止金属物种的聚集并维持其催化活性。

5. 环境考虑：铂金（Pt）等贵金属的高昂成本以及铬（Cr）化合物的环境问题促使探索替代的、非贵金属和较少有毒的催化剂材料。PDH对这些金属及其环境影响的依赖通过开发更可持续的替代品得到了缓解。

6. 工业化：如Oleflex和Catofin这样的PDH技术已经成功实现了工业化，证明了其在大规模生产中的实用性和可扩展性。

7. 催化剂稳定性：为了稳定亚纳米级活性位点，需要大表面积的支持材料与金属之间有强大的相互作用。传统的Al2O3支持无法满足这一需求，因此需要使用具有更大表面积和定义明确孔隙结构的分子筛。

8. 学习成熟技术：从成熟的流体催化裂解（FCC）技术中汲取经验，这些技术也在恶劣条件下运行，促进了向分子筛基催化剂在PDH过程中的过渡。这些学习为PDH开发了更有效和稳定的催化剂做出了贡献。
