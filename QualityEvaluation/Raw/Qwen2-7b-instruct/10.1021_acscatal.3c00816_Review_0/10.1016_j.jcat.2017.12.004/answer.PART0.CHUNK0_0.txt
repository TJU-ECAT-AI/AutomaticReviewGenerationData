<p>Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst obtained by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized by the in-situ one-step method show markedly superior catalytic performance, except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. VOX-MCM-41 achieved 40% initial propane conversion and 79% propene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 2. The propane conversion of VOX-MCM-41 drops to 17% after 6h reaction. Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst.</p>
<p>When the catalyst is prepared above 60°C gelation temperature, the catalytic performance obviously decreases, especially in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. As a result, the catalyst gelled at 60°C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst gelled at 30°C (Fig. 1), but both achieve similar catalytic yields after 4h reaction. In addition, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits a lower deactivation rate, in agreement with the variation in TOF values (Table 1), where propane conversion and propene yield show a 15% decline during a 6h reaction.</p>
<p>In addition to gelation temperature, calcination temperature is another crucial factor for synthesizing VOX-SiO2 catalysts and plays an essential role in the structure and properties of these catalysts [36]. The catalyst gelled at 60°C was selected as a representative sample to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on catalyst structure and properties.</p>
<p>As calcination temperature increases, propane conversion gradually decreases, but propene selectivity slightly increases. The variation trends of propane conversion and propene selectivity are similar to those found in other studies [37]. Although the catalyst calcined at 550°C has better initial catalytic activity for PDH, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst calcined at 580°C exhibits superior stability and shows higher propane conversion after 3h reaction. The TOF values of catalysts with different calcination temperatures also indicate this phenomenon (Table 1).</p>
<p>The results of this work will be beneficial for further industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.</p>

Key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology can utilize a wide range of hydrocarbon feedstocks, including propane, which is abundant and easily accessible worldwide. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on more limited resources or require extensive processing steps to prepare their feedstocks.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). It bypasses the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation, leading to higher yields and lower energy consumption. Additionally, PDH minimizes the formation of by-products, enhancing the purity of the propylene output.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology provides high selectivity to propene, which is a critical petrochemical intermediate used in the production of various chemicals. This selectivity is advantageous over traditional methods that may produce a broader spectrum of hydrocarbons, requiring additional separation processes to isolate propene.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective pathway for propylene production, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in conventional methods.
