In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane to propylene without the need for cracking or deep oxidation, addressing the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more efficient and selective process. Secondly, PDH avoids the thermodynamic limitations associated with cracking processes, allowing for a more streamlined and potentially higher yield of propylene. Thirdly, by focusing on the direct dehydrogenation of propane, PDH reduces the dependency on fossil fuels for feedstock, enhancing sustainability and reducing the environmental impact. Lastly, PDH processes often lead to higher product selectivity for propylene, minimizing the generation of byproducts and improving overall economic viability. The use of novel catalysts, such as those based on vanadium (V), gallium (Ga), and tin (Sn), further optimizes the PDH process, enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the conversion, particularly when used with supports like silica (SiO2), zirconia (ZrO2), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The research conducted on porous VOX-SiO2 solids, synthesized via an in-situ one-step method, exemplifies the potential of these catalysts in achieving superior performance in PDH reactions, with notable improvements in catalytic activity, stability, and long-term operation, demonstrating their potential for industrial development and application in the production of propylene.
