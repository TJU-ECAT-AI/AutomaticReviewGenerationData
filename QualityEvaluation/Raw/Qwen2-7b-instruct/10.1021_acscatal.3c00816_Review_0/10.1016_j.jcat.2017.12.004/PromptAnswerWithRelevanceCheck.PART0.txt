<p>Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst obtained by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized by the in-situ one-step method show markedly superior catalytic performance, except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. VOX-MCM-41 achieved 40% initial propane conversion and 79% propene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 2. The propane conversion of VOX-MCM-41 drops to 17% after 6h reaction. Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst.</p>
<p>When the catalyst is prepared above 60°C gelation temperature, the catalytic performance obviously decreases, especially in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. As a result, the catalyst gelled at 60°C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst gelled at 30°C (Fig. 1), but both achieve similar catalytic yields after 4h reaction. In addition, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits a lower deactivation rate, in agreement with the variation in TOF values (Table 1), where propane conversion and propene yield show a 15% decline during a 6h reaction.</p>
<p>In addition to gelation temperature, calcination temperature is another crucial factor for synthesizing VOX-SiO2 catalysts and plays an essential role in the structure and properties of these catalysts [36]. The catalyst gelled at 60°C was selected as a representative sample to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on catalyst structure and properties.</p>
<p>As calcination temperature increases, propane conversion gradually decreases, but propene selectivity slightly increases. The variation trends of propane conversion and propene selectivity are similar to those found in other studies [37]. Although the catalyst calcined at 550°C has better initial catalytic activity for PDH, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst calcined at 580°C exhibits superior stability and shows higher propane conversion after 3h reaction. The TOF values of catalysts with different calcination temperatures also indicate this phenomenon (Table 1).</p>
<p>The results of this work will be beneficial for further industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.</p>

Key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology can utilize a wide range of hydrocarbon feedstocks, including propane, which is abundant and easily accessible worldwide. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on more limited resources or require extensive processing steps to prepare their feedstocks.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). It bypasses the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation, leading to higher yields and lower energy consumption. Additionally, PDH minimizes the formation of by-products, enhancing the purity of the propylene output.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology provides high selectivity to propene, which is a critical petrochemical intermediate used in the production of various chemicals. This selectivity is advantageous over traditional methods that may produce a broader spectrum of hydrocarbons, requiring additional separation processes to isolate propene.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective pathway for propylene production, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in conventional methods.

<p>In previous studies, these catalysts have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional methods include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these issues in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Unlike conventional methods that rely on limited fossil resources like natural gas or crude oil, PDH can utilize propane, a more abundant and widely available feedstock. This diversifies the feedstock sources and reduces dependency on traditional oil and gas reserves.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to operate at high efficiencies, often achieving higher conversion rates of propane to propylene compared to traditional cracking methods. This results in lower energy consumption and higher throughput.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers better control over the selectivity of the products, allowing for a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene with minimal byproducts. This improves the purity and quality of the propylene produced, which is critical for downstream chemical processes.

PDH specifically addresses these challenges by offering a more sustainable, versatile, and efficient route to propylene production, leveraging the abundant propane feedstock while optimizing process efficiency and product selectivity. The study on vanadium-doped porous silica solids (VOX-SiO2) further enhances this technology by providing a catalyst system that exhibits superior performance and stability in PDH reactions, making it a promising candidate for commercial PDH processes.

在以往的研究中，这些催化剂主要被用于氧化脱氢反应。此外，当使用不同的支持物如二氧化硅、氧化锆和氧化铝时，催化剂性能会受到显著影响。到目前为止，已报道了使用氧化铝和MCM-41支持物的V基催化剂，这些催化剂在无气相氧气的情况下表现出良好的PDH催化性能，并且可以通过氧化再生完全恢复其性能。因此，可以得出结论，V基催化剂可能是商业PDH过程的理想候选材料。

借鉴多孔硅胶微球的制备和应用，作者们通过一步合成方法制备了含有V的多孔硅胶固体(VOX-SiO2)，并在本文中对此进行了详细研究。这种方法环保，不会损失VOX前体。通过对不同凝胶温度和煅烧温度的影响进行了深入研究，对VOX-SiO2催化剂的性质和PDH反应性能进行了全面表征和评估。这些催化剂通过非氧化性丙烷脱氢反应进行了测试。结果表明，在60°C以下的凝胶温度范围内，提高凝胶温度对催化剂性能的影响较小，但可以明显缩短一步合成过程的时间。在接近或超过乙醇沸点（78.3°C）的温度下，VOX-SiO2固体结构和VOX物种的分散性可能会受到严重的影响。

PDH技术相对于传统方法的主要优势包括解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性的问题。具体体现在以下几个方面：

1. **原料供应**：与依赖有限的化石资源如天然气或原油的传统方法相比，PDH技术能够利用更丰富、更广泛可用的原料——丙烷。这不仅增加了原料来源的多样性，还减少了对传统油气资源的依赖。

2. **过程效率**：PDH工艺设计旨在高效率运行，通常能实现更高的丙烷到丙烯的转化率，相比传统的裂解方法具有更高的能量利用效率和更高产能。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH过程提供了更好的产品选择控制，能够更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副产品的产生。这提高了所产丙烯的纯度和质量，对于下游化工过程至关重要。

通过使用包含V的多孔硅胶固体(VOX-SiO2)作为催化剂系统，PDH技术进一步提升，展现出优异的性能和稳定性，使其成为有前景的商业PDH过程候选材料。
