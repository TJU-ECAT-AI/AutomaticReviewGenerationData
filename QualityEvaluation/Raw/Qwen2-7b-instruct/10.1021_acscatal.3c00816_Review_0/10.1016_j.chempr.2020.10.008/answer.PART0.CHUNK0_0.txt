In the context of the growing demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing light alkanes, which are abundant in the global energy mix due to the widespread availability of shale gas and natural gas. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on naphtha, which is more limited in supply. 

Secondly, PDH technology enhances process efficiency. Unlike conventional production methods that require high temperatures to achieve the necessary chemical reactions, PDH operates at more moderate temperatures, thereby reducing the energy requirements and potentially lowering operational costs. This efficiency is crucial given the high enthalpy of propylene production reactions, which necessitate high temperatures and can lead to energy-intensive processes.

Thirdly, PDH offers improved product selectivity. Traditional methods can suffer from cracking and coking, which not only decrease propylene selectivity but also lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. PDH, however, enables a high degree of propylene selectivity, even across a broad temperature range, without compromising on yield. This selectivity is critical for maintaining product purity and maximizing the value of the output.

Furthermore, the PDH process is designed to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions, which are common in conventional methods. By isolating active metal components into single atoms, the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) can significantly reduce the likelihood of cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability. This is exemplified in the development of the [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst, which not only achieves high propylene selectivity across a wide temperature range but also exhibits exceptional stability over prolonged periods of operation.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more sustainable, efficient, and selective approach to propylene production compared to traditional methods. Its ability to utilize abundant feedstocks, operate at lower temperatures, and maintain high selectivity and stability makes it a preferred choice in the evolving landscape of propylene manufacturing.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，有几个关键优势。首先，它解决了原料可用性的问题，由于页岩气和天然气的广泛可用性，轻烷烃在能源组合中十分丰富。相比之下，传统方法往往依赖于有限供应的石脑油。

其次，PDH技术提高了工艺效率。与传统方法需要高温度来实现必要的化学反应不同，PDH在较低的温度下运行，从而减少了能量需求并可能降低了运营成本。这种效率对于需要高热值的丙烯生产反应至关重要。

第三，PDH提供了更高的产品选择性。传统方法可能会遭受裂解和结焦，这不仅降低了丙烯的选择性，而且导致生成不希望的副产品。然而，PDH能够实现广泛的温度范围内高程度的丙烯选择性，而不会损害产量。这种选择性对于保持产品质量和最大化产出价值至关重要。

此外，PDH过程设计用于抑制结构敏感的副反应，这是传统方法常见的问题。通过将活性金属成分隔离成单原子，最终得到的单原子催化剂（SACs）可以显著减少裂解和深度脱氢的可能性，从而提高选择性和稳定性。以[PtZn4]互金属催化剂为例，不仅实现了宽温区内的高丙烯选择性，而且在长时间运行过程中表现出极佳的稳定性。

综上所述，PDH技术在可持续性、效率和稳定性的方面提供了与传统方法相比更优的丙烯生产方法。利用丰富原料、在较低温度下运行以及维持高选择性和稳定性的能力使它成为当前丙烯制造领域中的首选方法。
