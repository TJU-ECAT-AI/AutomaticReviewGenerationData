<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.</p>
<p>This paper describes a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) as a selective and ultrastable PDH catalyst. The catalyst enables more than 95% of propylene selectivity from 520C to 620C. No obvious deactivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts.</p>
<p>We reveal that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improves the stability by prohibiting coke side reactions.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to produce propylene efficiently and address challenges in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically tackles issues by utilizing high-quality feedstocks, optimizing the production process, and ensuring high selectivity, thus surpassing conventional methods.

2. The key advantage of PDH technology lies in its capability to enable more than 95% propylene selectivity across a broad temperature range of 520°C to 620°C. This is superior to existing technologies, ensuring high efficiency and productivity. 

3. The [PtZn4] catalyst assembled from atomically ordered intermetallic alloys (IMAs) acts as a selective and ultrastable PDH catalyst. Its superior performance, with no evident deactivation within 160 hours of testing, surpasses that of commercial catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. This highlights the effectiveness of single-site catalysts in enhancing propylene production stability and selectivity.

4. The active site structures, specifically the [PtZn4] ensembles, play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst and improving propylene selectivity. The geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in these ensembles facilitates the desorption of surface-bound propylene, thereby preventing coke formation and enhancing the overall stability of the PDH process.

1. PDH技术因其能够高效地生产丙烯并解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等方面的问题而脱颖而出。它通过利用高质量的原料、优化生产流程以及确保高选择性，超越了传统方法，解决了相关挑战。

2. PDH技术的关键优势在于其能够在520°C到620°C的宽泛温度范围内实现超过95%的丙烯选择性。这一性能优于现有技术，确保了高效性和生产力。

3. 由原子有序互金属合金（IMA）组装而成的单个站点催化剂作为PDH催化剂表现出色，具有选择性和超稳定性。在长达160小时的测试中未出现明显的失活现象，超越了如PtSn/Al2O3和最先进的Pt基催化剂等商用催化剂的性能。这表明单站点催化剂在提高丙烯生产稳定性和选择性方面的有效性。

4. 活动站点结构，特别是[PtZn4]簇，对于稳定催化剂并提高丙烯选择性起着关键作用。在这些簇中的几何孤立且电子富集的Pt促进了表面绑定丙烯的脱附，从而防止了焦炭形成并增强了PDH过程的整体稳定性。
