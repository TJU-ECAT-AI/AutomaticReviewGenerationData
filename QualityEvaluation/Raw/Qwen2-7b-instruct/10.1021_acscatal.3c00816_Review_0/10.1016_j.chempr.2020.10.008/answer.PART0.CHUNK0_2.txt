1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that addresses the challenges of conventional methods by providing high selectivity and efficiency. It tackles the issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

2. The key advantage of PDH technology is its ability to achieve the highest propylene productivity at the lowest deactivation rate, making it more efficient compared to traditional methods.

3. By isolating active metal components into single atoms, PDH technology maximizes atomic efficiency. This leads to single-atom catalysts (SACs) that inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions, offering unprecedented selectivity.

4. PDH technology does not experience significant deactivation during the 160-hour industrial test, surpassing other catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3.

5. The surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn intermetallic materials serve as the stable active site structures, crucial for the PDH process.

6. The PtZn/SiO2 intermetallic material catalyst demonstrates superior reactivity and stability, achieving a high productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 per gram of Pt per hour with a low deactivation rate, outperforming other catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3.
