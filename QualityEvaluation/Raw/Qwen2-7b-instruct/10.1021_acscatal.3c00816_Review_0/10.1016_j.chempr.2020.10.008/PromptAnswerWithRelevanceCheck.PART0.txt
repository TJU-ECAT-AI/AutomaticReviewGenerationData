In the context of the growing demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing light alkanes, which are abundant in the global energy mix due to the widespread availability of shale gas and natural gas. This contrasts with traditional methods that often rely on naphtha, which is more limited in supply. 

Secondly, PDH technology enhances process efficiency. Unlike conventional production methods that require high temperatures to achieve the necessary chemical reactions, PDH operates at more moderate temperatures, thereby reducing the energy requirements and potentially lowering operational costs. This efficiency is crucial given the high enthalpy of propylene production reactions, which necessitate high temperatures and can lead to energy-intensive processes.

Thirdly, PDH offers improved product selectivity. Traditional methods can suffer from cracking and coking, which not only decrease propylene selectivity but also lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. PDH, however, enables a high degree of propylene selectivity, even across a broad temperature range, without compromising on yield. This selectivity is critical for maintaining product purity and maximizing the value of the output.

Furthermore, the PDH process is designed to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions, which are common in conventional methods. By isolating active metal components into single atoms, the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) can significantly reduce the likelihood of cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability. This is exemplified in the development of the [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst, which not only achieves high propylene selectivity across a wide temperature range but also exhibits exceptional stability over prolonged periods of operation.

In summary, PDH technology offers a more sustainable, efficient, and selective approach to propylene production compared to traditional methods. Its ability to utilize abundant feedstocks, operate at lower temperatures, and maintain high selectivity and stability makes it a preferred choice in the evolving landscape of propylene manufacturing.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，有几个关键优势。首先，它解决了原料可用性的问题，由于页岩气和天然气的广泛可用性，轻烷烃在能源组合中十分丰富。相比之下，传统方法往往依赖于有限供应的石脑油。

其次，PDH技术提高了工艺效率。与传统方法需要高温度来实现必要的化学反应不同，PDH在较低的温度下运行，从而减少了能量需求并可能降低了运营成本。这种效率对于需要高热值的丙烯生产反应至关重要。

第三，PDH提供了更高的产品选择性。传统方法可能会遭受裂解和结焦，这不仅降低了丙烯的选择性，而且导致生成不希望的副产品。然而，PDH能够实现广泛的温度范围内高程度的丙烯选择性，而不会损害产量。这种选择性对于保持产品质量和最大化产出价值至关重要。

此外，PDH过程设计用于抑制结构敏感的副反应，这是传统方法常见的问题。通过将活性金属成分隔离成单原子，最终得到的单原子催化剂（SACs）可以显著减少裂解和深度脱氢的可能性，从而提高选择性和稳定性。以[PtZn4]互金属催化剂为例，不仅实现了宽温区内的高丙烯选择性，而且在长时间运行过程中表现出极佳的稳定性。

综上所述，PDH技术在可持续性、效率和稳定性的方面提供了与传统方法相比更优的丙烯生产方法。利用丰富原料、在较低温度下运行以及维持高选择性和稳定性的能力使它成为当前丙烯制造领域中的首选方法。

<p>Comparatively, for Pt/SiO2, AC-HAADF-STEM imaging (Figure S4) showed that two atomic plane distances were measured as 0.229 and 0.199 nm (Figure 1 H), which were in agreement with the lattice spacing along the [111] and [200] directions.</p>
<p>The results clearly demonstrate the formation of a single-atom Pt1 site in PtZn IMAs supported on SiO2.</p>
<p>Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH activation temperature.</p>
<p>As a result, increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10).</p>
<p>Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h1 (C3H8/H2 = 1/1), which is significantly higher than that over Pt/SiO2 (42% conversion, 67% selectivity) (Figure 2 A) and Zn/SiO2 (4% conversion, 60% selectivity) (Figure S14).</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene at high temperatures. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for naphtha as a primary feedstock. The high temperatures required for PDH processes are essential for achieving the necessary reaction enthalpies. However, these high temperatures can lead to cracking and coking, which reduces propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. To overcome these issues, the active site isolation strategy has proven effective. Isolating active metal components into single atoms maximizes atomic efficiency and inhibits structure-sensitive side reactions, providing unprecedented selectivity. The paper reports on a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) with a trace Pt loading of 0.1 wt %, enabling more than 95% propylene selectivity over a broad temperature range and achieving the highest propylene productivity. The catalyst's stability, as evidenced by a lack of obvious deactivation over 160 hours under industrial operating conditions, surpasses that of commercial Pt-based catalysts and PtSn/Al2O3. The study further reveals that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as stable active site structures, with the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles facilitating desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improving stability by preventing coke formation. This innovation in PDH technology represents a significant advancement in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures, offering a promising route to prepare efficient Pt-based bimetal dehydrogenation catalysts by isolating Pt atoms into single-site catalysts via assembling atomically ordered IMAs.

2. The paper highlights several key advantages of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production. Firstly, PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene, which is a more efficient process compared to traditional methods that often require multiple steps and the use of naphtha as a feedstock. The high temperatures needed for PDH reactions are crucial for achieving the required chemical transformations. However, these high temperatures can also lead to issues such as cracking and coking, which affect propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. To address these challenges, the paper introduces a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving more than 95% propylene selectivity across a wide temperature range (520°C to 620°C) and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt−1 h−1. Importantly, the catalyst exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining its performance over 160 hours under industrial operating conditions, outperforming commercial Pt-based catalysts and PtSn/Al2O3 in terms of both productivity and stability. The study further elucidates that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) are the stable active site structures responsible for propylene selectivity. These ensembles feature isolated Pt atoms that are electron-rich and facilitate the desorption of surface-bound propylene, thereby enhancing stability by suppressing coke formation. This research underscores the potential of PDH technology and single-site IMAs as robust active sites for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, opening new avenues for the processing of various carbonaceous fuels, including CO2 and N2.

3. 由原子有序互金属合金（IMA）组装而成的单个站点催化剂作为PDH催化剂表现出色，具有选择性和超稳定性。在长达160小时的测试中未出现明显的失活现象，超越了如PtSn/Al2O3和最先进的Pt基催化剂等商用催化剂的性能。这表明单站点催化剂在提高丙烯生产稳定性和选择性方面的有效性。

4. 活动站点结构，特别是[PtZn4]簇，对于稳定催化剂并提高丙烯选择性起着关键作用。在这些簇中的几何孤立且电子富集的Pt促进了表面绑定丙烯的脱附，从而防止了焦炭形成并增强了PDH过程的整体稳定性。
