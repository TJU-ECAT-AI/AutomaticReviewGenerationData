<p>To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective.</p>
<p>Recently, novel preparation methods have been developed to improve the propylene productivity by constructing ultrasmall PtZn bimetal nanoclusters by embedding them inside S-1 zeolites.</p>
<p>This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1.</p>
<p>Based on in situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is further revealed that surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as the stable active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promote desorption of the surface-bounded propylene and improve the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn atoms via structural ordering.</p>
<p>The formation of Single-Atom Pt1 Sites in PtZn IMAs By direct H2 temperature-programmed reduction strategy (see Experimental Procedures), we successfully constructed PtZn IMAs (molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1) supported on SiO2, where the H2-rich atmosphere at high temperatures (HT) of 600C contributes to the transformation of disordered PtZn nanoparticles (NPs) into structurally ordered PtZn IMAs (Figure 1 A).</p>
<p>Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) imaging (Figure 1 E and S3) revealed the formation of atomically ordered PtZn IMAs, featuring the alternating bright Pt column and dark Zn column contrast on [110] planes (Figure 1 E).</p>
<p>Comparatively, for Pt/SiO2, AC-HAADF-STEM imaging (Figure S4) showed that two atomic plane distances were measured as 0.229 and 0.199 nm (Figure 1 H), which were in agreement with the lattice spacing along the [111] and [200] directions.</p>
<p>The results clearly demonstrate the formation of a single-atom Pt1 site in PtZn IMAs supported on SiO2.</p>
<p>Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-determining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/SiO2, revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH activation temperature.</p>
<p>As a result, increasing Zn additions and H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and S10).</p>
<p>Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h1 (C3H8/H2 = 1/1), which is significantly higher than that over Pt/SiO2 (42% conversion, 67% selectivity) (Figure 2 A) and Zn/SiO2 (4% conversion, 60% selectivity) (Figure S14).</p>
<p>The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals, allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn, which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation.</p>
<p>SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 2 B), indicating superior selectivity of this PtZn IMA during the wide range of HTs.</p>
<p>Additionally, during 4 successive regeneration cycles, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity remained slightly changed as compared with the initial run (Figure S20), further indicating the good regenerability of this PtZn IMA.</p>
<p>For PtZn/SiO2 catalysts, the model gave high quality fits with the crystal structure of the β1-Pt1Zn1 IMA.</p>
<p>The XANES and EXAFS spectra of PtZn/SiO2 under PDH reaction conditions are similar with H2 reduction (Figures 3 C and S23), and the calculated CN of PtZn remained about 4 (Table S3), indicating the superior stability of PtZn coordination ensembles in PtZn IMAs under PDH reaction conditions.</p>
<p>After H2 reduction, for PtZn/SiO2, Pt was reduced to metallic Pt0 and the binding energy (BE) of Pt0 in Pt 4f7/2 peak was 71.1 eV (Figures 3 D and S24), which was lower than that over Pt/SiO2 (71.3 eV) (Figure S25), indicating the electron transfers from Zn to the 5d band of Pt and formation of electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles.</p>
<p>Therefore, the above results clearly imply that the electron-rich Pt in PtZn ensembles effectively inhibits the coke formation under PDH reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the crystalline structure of PtZn alloys is almost unchanged even after long-term stability tests (Figure S34).</p>
<p>Furthermore, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) component analysis as a function of time on stream implies very slight loss rates of Zn and Pt in PtZn/SiO2 (Table S5; Figure S35), far lower than that over Zn/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, and other Zn promoted Pt-based catalysts.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene at high temperatures. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for naphtha as a primary feedstock. The high temperatures required for PDH processes are essential for achieving the necessary reaction enthalpies. However, these high temperatures can lead to cracking and coking, which reduces propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. To overcome these issues, the active site isolation strategy has proven effective. Isolating active metal components into single atoms maximizes atomic efficiency and inhibits structure-sensitive side reactions, providing unprecedented selectivity. The paper reports on a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) with a trace Pt loading of 0.1 wt %, enabling more than 95% propylene selectivity over a broad temperature range and achieving the highest propylene productivity. The catalyst's stability, as evidenced by a lack of obvious deactivation over 160 hours under industrial operating conditions, surpasses that of commercial Pt-based catalysts and PtSn/Al2O3. The study further reveals that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as stable active site structures, with the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles facilitating desorption of surface-bounded propylene and improving stability by preventing coke formation. This innovation in PDH technology represents a significant advancement in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures, offering a promising route to prepare efficient Pt-based bimetal dehydrogenation catalysts by isolating Pt atoms into single-site catalysts via assembling atomically ordered IMAs.

2. The paper highlights several key advantages of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production. Firstly, PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane into propylene, which is a more efficient process compared to traditional methods that often require multiple steps and the use of naphtha as a feedstock. The high temperatures needed for PDH reactions are crucial for achieving the required chemical transformations. However, these high temperatures can also lead to issues such as cracking and coking, which affect propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. To address these challenges, the paper introduces a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving more than 95% propylene selectivity across a wide temperature range (520°C to 620°C) and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt−1 h−1. Importantly, the catalyst exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining its performance over 160 hours under industrial operating conditions, outperforming commercial Pt-based catalysts and PtSn/Al2O3 in terms of both productivity and stability. The study further elucidates that the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) are the stable active site structures responsible for propylene selectivity. These ensembles feature isolated Pt atoms that are electron-rich and facilitate the desorption of surface-bound propylene, thereby enhancing stability by suppressing coke formation. This research underscores the potential of PDH technology and single-site IMAs as robust active sites for catalytic dehydrogenation reactions, opening new avenues for the processing of various carbonaceous fuels, including CO2 and N2.
