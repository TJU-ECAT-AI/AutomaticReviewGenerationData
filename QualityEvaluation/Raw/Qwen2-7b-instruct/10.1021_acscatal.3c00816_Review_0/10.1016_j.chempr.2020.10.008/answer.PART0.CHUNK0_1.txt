1. PDH technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The key advantage lies in its capability to produce propylene from propane without requiring high energy input, thereby enhancing process efficiency. 

2. The single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst achieves the highest propylene productivity at the lowest deactivation rate, demonstrating its superior selectivity and stability.

3. Isolating active metal components into single atoms maximizes atomic efficiency, making PDH technology highly productive.

4. The [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the stable active site structures, enabling over 95% propylene selectivity across a broad temperature range of 520°C to 620°C.

5. No obvious deactivation is observed within the 160-hour industrial PDH test, showcasing the catalyst's exceptional stability.

6. The [PtZn4] ensembles enhance propylene selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions.

7. The highest productivity of the [PtZn4] catalyst is over 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1, which is more than 5 times that of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, highlighting its superior reactivity and stability.
