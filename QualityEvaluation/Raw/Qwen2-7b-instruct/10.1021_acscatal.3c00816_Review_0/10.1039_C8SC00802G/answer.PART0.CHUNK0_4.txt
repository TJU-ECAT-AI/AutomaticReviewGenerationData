<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.</p>
<p>Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>With the developments of density functional theory (DFT), the computational screening procedure for heterogeneous catalyst design has become an important technique in recent years.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the recently developed Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) will generate a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, which can be used to assess the reliability of our screening results.</p>
<p>Previous studies by Honkala et al. and De Chen et al. have suggested that the relative magnitude between propylene dehydrogenation and propylene desorption can be used to understand the selectivity.</p>
<p>Based on the strategy mentioned above, we tested nearly 30 different bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction and the results of our screening are illustrated in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, according to the two above-discussed linear relationships, the activity (X axis in Fig. 1) and selectivity (Y axis in Fig. 1) were constrained by a new approximately linear relationship.</p>
<p>For example, YPt3X < YPt < 0.2 and kPt3X > kPt × 0.1 (Y: the difference between propylene desorption free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation step free energy barrier of Pt3X, kPt3X: the rate constants of Pt3X) in Fig. 3 mean Pt3X shows better selectivity and acceptable activity.</p>
<p>Note that the higher conversion of PtSn and PtIn alloys might due to the increased number of exposed Pt atoms compared with the Pt only catalyst, although the activity of individual sites is lower on the PtSn or PtIn alloy according to DFT calculations.</p>
<p>The free energy barriers of the first dehydrogenation step over Pt(211), Pt3In(211)_Pt and Pt3In(211)_ In (1.84 eV, 2.08 eV and 2.05 eV) are almost the same.</p>
<p>The situation of (100) facets is almost the same as that of (211) facets (Fig. S5b and Table S8).</p>
<p>The propylene formation turnover frequency (TOF) of Pt3In(211)_In is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of pure Pt(211).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the surface was gradually covered by coke with the increase of the model coke precursor adsorption energy, which indicates Pt3In(211)_In might exhibit a better propylene formation performance than pure Pt(211) under real catalysis conditions due to the slower coke formation over Pt3In(211)_In, which enhances the catalyst stability consistent with our experimentally observed enhanced stability of PtIn alloy shown in Fig. 4.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It utilizes abundant propane from shale gas, unlike traditional methods that often rely on scarce fossil fuels. PDH offers a sustainable and efficient alternative for propylene production.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing a more readily available feedstock (shale gas), improving process efficiency through advanced catalysts, and enhancing product selectivity, particularly for propylene, through optimized reaction pathways and catalyst design.

3. In the context of PDH, the key advantages include the utilization of abundant propane, which reduces dependency on fossil fuels; enhanced efficiency in propylene production, thanks to the development of advanced catalysts and reaction mechanisms; and improved selectivity for propylene, ensuring a cleaner and more targeted product output.

4. PDH technology tackles the issue of feedstock scarcity by leveraging the abundance of natural gas resources, particularly those found in shale formations. This makes the process more sustainable and economically viable, especially in regions where natural gas is plentiful.

5. Process efficiency in PDH is significantly improved through the use of optimized catalysts and reaction pathways. These advancements allow for faster and more effective conversion of propane to propylene, reducing energy consumption and operational costs.

6. Product selectivity in PDH is enhanced by the careful selection and design of catalysts. This ensures that the primary product is propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as coke, which improves yield and purity of the final propylene.

7. The PDH process benefits from the use of advanced computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) and Bayesian error estimation (BEEF-vdW) for catalyst screening and optimization. These tools enable the identification of catalysts with superior performance, balancing activity and selectivity.

8. The PDH process showcases the importance of catalyst design in achieving high propylene selectivity. By tailoring catalyst components and structures, researchers can significantly reduce unwanted byproducts like coke, thereby enhancing catalyst stability and overall process efficiency.

9. The PDH process involves a detailed mechanism that includes the first dehydrogenation step as the rate-controlling step, which is crucial for understanding and optimizing the reaction kinetics. This insight guides the development of more effective catalysts that can improve both activity and selectivity.

10. The introduction of main group metals, such as In in the PtIn alloy, plays a significant role in enhancing propylene selectivity. The electronic effects of these metals contribute to a better balance between activity and selectivity, making the PtIn catalyst an optimal choice for PDH.
