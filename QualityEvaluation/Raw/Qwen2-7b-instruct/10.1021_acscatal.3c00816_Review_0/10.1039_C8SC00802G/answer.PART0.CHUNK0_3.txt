<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.1 Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene.2,3</p>
<p>Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly. However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene. The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects.</p>
<p>With the developments of density functional theory (DFT), the computational screening procedure for heterogeneous catalyst design has become an important technique in recent years.1315 By incorporating linear scaling relationships, e.g. BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, the reaction rates and product selectivity can be mapped from a high dimension space including information of all elementary steps to a simple descriptor space. Then, a volcano plot can be generated for a direct guide to locate the optimal catalyst.1315</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing the abundant shale gas as a feedstock source, which is more readily available than traditional fossil fuels. It improves process efficiency through optimized catalyst design, allowing for higher yields and stability. Additionally, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, particularly in producing propylene, by improving the anti-coking ability and selectivity of the catalysts used, such as Pt-based catalysts alloyed with elements like In, which reduces coke formation and increases propylene yield.
