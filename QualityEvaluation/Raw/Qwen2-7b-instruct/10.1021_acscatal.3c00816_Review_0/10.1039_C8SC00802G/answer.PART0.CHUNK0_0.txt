<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.</p>
<p>Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene.</p>
<p>Pt-based catalysts are currently used in commercial PDH processes and deliver comparably high initial yields and stability.</p>
<p>Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene.</p>
<p>The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7etc.</p>
<p>With the developments of density functional theory (DFT), the computational screening procedure for heterogeneous catalyst design has become an important technique in recent years.</p>
<p>By incorporating linear scaling relationships, e.g. BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, the reaction rates and product selectivity can be mapped from a high dimension space including information of all elementary steps to a simple descriptor space.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the recently developed Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) will generate a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, which can be used to assess the reliability of our screening results.</p>
<p>Therefore, we successfully identified that In is potentially better than Sn as an alloy component to improve the PDH performance of pure Pt, and our synthesized PtIn catalyst does show enhanced PDH performance just like the PtSn catalyst.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scaling relationships between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and propylene desorption free energy barrier, between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation free energy barrier still hold for the 2000 sets of data in the BEEF error ensemble.</p>
<p>In order to confirm our screening study, we synthesized SiO2 supported Pt, PtIn alloy and PtSn alloy (Section S3).</p>
<p>Note that the higher conversion of PtSn and PtIn alloys might due to the increased number of exposed Pt atoms compared with the Pt only catalyst, although the activity of individual sites is lower on the PtSn or PtIn alloy according to DFT calculations.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 4, the propylene selectivity was dramatically increased after alloying Pt with In or Sn.</p>
<p>At the same time, a better stability has been observed for the PtIn alloy compared with the Pt or PtSn alloy, consistent with our screening results discussed above.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing abundant shale gas resources as a feedstock, offering a more sustainable and efficient process compared to traditional methods that rely heavily on fossil fuels. This technology enhances environmental friendliness, reduces carbon footprint, and improves product selectivity towards propylene, making it a promising method for propylene production that meets the increasing global demand.
