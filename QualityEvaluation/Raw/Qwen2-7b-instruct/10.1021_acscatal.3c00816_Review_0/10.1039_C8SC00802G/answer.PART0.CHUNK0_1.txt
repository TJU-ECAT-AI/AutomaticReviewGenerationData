[1] "Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc."
[2] "Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene."
[3] "Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly."
[4] "However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene."
[5] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."
[6] "By combining the scaling relationship with the reliability analysis, we predicted the probability that candidate catalysts display better performance than Pt."
[7] "We successfully identified that In is potentially better than Sn as an alloy component to improve the PDH performance of pure Pt."
[8] "The first dehydrogenation step was found to be the rate-controlling step on most of the facets."
[9] "A tiny loss in catalytic activity and an excellent improvement in selectivity were found when the ratio of PtIn was 3:1."
[10] "When it comes to higher PtIn ratios, Pt1In1 and PtIn2 will suffer great loss in activity."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes readily available propane from natural gas sources, bypassing the need for expensive and scarce fossil fuels traditionally used in propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to enhance efficiency, reducing energy consumption and improving yield compared to conventional methods. The use of optimized catalysts, like the PtIn alloy identified in this study, ensures high activity and selectivity, minimizing byproducts like coke and maximizing propylene output.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH processes are engineered to selectively produce propylene with high purity, avoiding unwanted byproducts. Alloying Pt with In improves selectivity, offering a more efficient route to propylene production that minimizes the formation of other compounds like acrylonitrile or propylene oxide.

In summary, PDH offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective approach to propylene production, leveraging advancements in catalyst design and optimization to meet the growing demand for propylene in various industrial applications.
