<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.1 Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene.2,3</p>
<p>Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are currently used in commercial PDH processes and deliver comparably high initial yields and stability.2 Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly. However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene. The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects. From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective.8,9 With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation.10 Besides, the surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation.3 In addition, the electron density of Pt atoms was observed to increase which is induced by charge transfer from Sn to Pt atom.11 The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity.12</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods are as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes abundant natural gas resources, particularly shale gas, which is more readily available than traditional fossil fuels. This addresses the scarcity issue of conventional feedstocks.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient way to produce propylene, with the capability to deliver high yields and stability, comparable to current commercial processes using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The use of Pt-based catalysts, especially through alloying with elements like Sn, Ge, In, and others, enhances their anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity, improving overall process efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology, through strategic alloying, can significantly boost the selectivity towards propylene, reducing unwanted byproducts like coke formation. This is achieved by modifying the surface properties of the catalysts, such as altering the d-band center of surface Pt atoms to facilitate propylene desorption and reduce its binding strength.

PDH thus represents a promising method for propylene production, offering solutions to challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, particularly in the context of sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices.

针对传统生产方法面临的挑战，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势如下：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH 技术利用丰富的天然气资源，尤其是页岩气，这比传统化石燃料更容易获取。这解决了常规原料的稀缺问题。

2. **工艺效率**：PDH 提供了一种更高效的丙烯生产方式，能够提供与当前商业过程中使用的铂和铬基催化剂相似的高产率和稳定性。通过合金化铂与其他元素（如锡、锗、铟等），可以增强其抗结焦能力和丙烯选择性，从而提高整体工艺效率。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH 技术通过策略性合金化，可以显著提升丙烯的选择性，减少不希望的副产物如焦炭形成。这是通过改变催化剂表面性质实现的，例如调整表面铂原子的d带中心，以促进丙烯的脱附并降低其结合强度。

因此，PDH 代表了一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，提供了解决与原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性相关挑战的解决方案，尤其是在可持续和环保制造实践的背景下。
