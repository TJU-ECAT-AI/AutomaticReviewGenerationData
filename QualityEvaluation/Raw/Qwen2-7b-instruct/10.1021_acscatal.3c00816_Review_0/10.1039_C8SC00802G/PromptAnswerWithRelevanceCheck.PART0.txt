<quotes>
<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.</p>
<p>Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene.</p>
<p>Pt-based catalysts are currently used in commercial PDH processes and deliver comparably high initial yields and stability.</p>
<p>Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene.</p>
<p>The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7etc.</p>
<p>With the developments of density functional theory (DFT), the computational screening procedure for heterogeneous catalyst design has become an important technique in recent years.</p>
<p>By incorporating linear scaling relationships, e.g. BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationships and scaling the relationship between adsorption energies of surface intermediates/transition states, the reaction rates and product selectivity can be mapped from a high dimension space including information of all elementary steps to a simple descriptor space.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the recently developed Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) will generate a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, which can be used to assess the reliability of our screening results.</p>
<p>Therefore, we successfully identified that In is potentially better than Sn as an alloy component to improve the PDH performance of pure Pt, and our synthesized PtIn catalyst does show enhanced PDH performance just like the PtSn catalyst.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scaling relationships between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and propylene desorption free energy barrier, between the first dehydrogenation free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation free energy barrier still hold for the 2000 sets of data in the BEEF error ensemble.</p>
<p>In order to confirm our screening study, we synthesized SiO2 supported Pt, PtIn alloy and PtSn alloy (Section S3).</p>
<p>Note that the higher conversion of PtSn and PtIn alloys might due to the increased number of exposed Pt atoms compared with the Pt only catalyst, although the activity of individual sites is lower on the PtSn or PtIn alloy according to DFT calculations.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 4, the propylene selectivity was dramatically increased after alloying Pt with In or Sn.</p>
<p>At the same time, a better stability has been observed for the PtIn alloy compared with the Pt or PtSn alloy, consistent with our screening results discussed above.</p>

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes readily available propane from natural gas sources, bypassing the need for expensive and scarce fossil fuels traditionally used in propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to enhance efficiency, reducing energy consumption and improving yield compared to conventional methods. The use of optimized catalysts, like the PtIn alloy identified in this study, ensures high activity and selectivity, minimizing byproducts like coke and maximizing propylene output.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH processes are engineered to selectively produce propylene with high purity, avoiding unwanted byproducts. Alloying Pt with In improves selectivity, offering a more efficient route to propylene production that minimizes the formation of other compounds like acrylonitrile or propylene oxide.

In summary, PDH offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective approach to propylene production, leveraging advancements in catalyst design and optimization to meet the growing demand for propylene in various industrial applications.

<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.1 Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene.2,3</p>
<p>Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are currently used in commercial PDH processes and deliver comparably high initial yields and stability.2 Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly. However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene. The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects. From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective.8,9 With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation.10 Besides, the surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation.3 In addition, the electron density of Pt atoms was observed to increase which is induced by charge transfer from Sn to Pt atom.11 The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity.12</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods are as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes abundant natural gas resources, particularly shale gas, which is more readily available than traditional fossil fuels. This addresses the scarcity issue of conventional feedstocks.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient way to produce propylene, with the capability to deliver high yields and stability, comparable to current commercial processes using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The use of Pt-based catalysts, especially through alloying with elements like Sn, Ge, In, and others, enhances their anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity, improving overall process efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology, through strategic alloying, can significantly boost the selectivity towards propylene, reducing unwanted byproducts like coke formation. This is achieved by modifying the surface properties of the catalysts, such as altering the d-band center of surface Pt atoms to facilitate propylene desorption and reduce its binding strength.

PDH thus represents a promising method for propylene production, offering solutions to challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, particularly in the context of sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices.

<p>The propylene formation turnover frequency (TOF) of Pt3In(211)_In is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of pure Pt(211).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the surface was gradually covered by coke with the increase of the model coke precursor adsorption energy, which indicates Pt3In(211)_In might exhibit a better propylene formation performance than pure Pt(211) under real catalysis conditions due to the slower coke formation over Pt3In(211)_In, which enhances the catalyst stability consistent with our experimentally observed enhanced stability of PtIn alloy shown in Fig. 4.</p>
