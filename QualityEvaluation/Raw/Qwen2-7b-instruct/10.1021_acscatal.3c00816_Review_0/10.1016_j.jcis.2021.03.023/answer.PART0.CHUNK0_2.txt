[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[4] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[5] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[6] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed."
[7] "However, the propane conversion was severely decreased due to the high surface free energy of the isolated Co sites."
[8] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis."
[9] "Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process."
[10] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH allows for the conversion of abundant propane from shale-gas deposits into propene, bypassing the need for potentially scarce and expensive feedstocks. It operates at lower temperatures compared to traditional processes, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. The use of cobalt-based catalysts makes the process economically viable due to the earth abundance of cobalt. Moreover, the active site isolation strategy enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to higher propene yields and better product quality. The developed CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst demonstrates superior performance with a propane conversion of 40% and a propene selectivity of 97%, maintaining stability even after prolonged operation at high temperatures.
