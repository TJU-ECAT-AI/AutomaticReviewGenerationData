[1] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[4] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[5] "Li et al. reported that the surface Co spinel formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction."
[6] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed."
[7] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis."
[8] "Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process."
[9] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
[10] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering higher process efficiency and product selectivity. It allows for more efficient conversion of propane into propylene, reducing the reliance on costly and toxic catalysts like chromium and platinum used in traditional methods. The use of cobalt-based catalysts, particularly those supported on silica and aluminum oxide, promises a sustainable and economically viable alternative for propylene production. Moreover, the development of active site isolation strategies ensures that only the desired sites are active, preventing the formation of unwanted byproducts and improving the overall selectivity of the process.

1. 直接脱氢化（PDH）技术通过提供更高的过程效率和产品选择性来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。它允许更高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，减少了对成本高昂且有毒的催化剂如铬和铂的依赖。基于钴的催化剂，特别是那些支持在硅酸盐和铝氧化物上的催化剂，为丙烯生产提供了可持续和经济可行的替代方案。此外，活性位点隔离策略确保只有所需的位置是活跃的，防止形成不需要的副产品，并提高整个过程的选择性。
