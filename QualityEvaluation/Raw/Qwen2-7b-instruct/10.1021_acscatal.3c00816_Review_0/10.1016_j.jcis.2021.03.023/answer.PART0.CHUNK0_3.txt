[1] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[4] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[5] "Li et al. reported that the surface Co spinel formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction."
[6] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed."
[7] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."
[8] "This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses several key challenges faced by conventional production methods, primarily related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers a more direct pathway to produce propylene from propane, bypassing the need for cracking heavier hydrocarbons. This makes it particularly advantageous in regions with abundant propane reserves, such as those derived from shale gas. Compared to traditional methods that rely on chromium and platinum catalysts, PDH using cobalt-based catalysts presents an economically viable alternative, as cobalt is more abundant and potentially cheaper. The use of cobalt in PDH processes, especially when supported on specific materials like silicalite-1, allows for enhanced selectivity towards propene, thereby improving the overall efficiency and product purity. Moreover, the active site isolation strategy ensures that the catalyst maintains its performance over time, even at high temperatures, thus addressing the issue of deactivation commonly encountered in conventional processes.

1. 直接脱氢（PDH）技术在处理传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战方面具有优势，主要涉及原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性。PDH提供了一种更直接的方法来从丙烷生产丙烯，无需经过重质烃裂解的步骤。这使其特别适用于富含丙烷的地区，如页岩气产生的地区。与依赖铬和铂催化剂的传统方法相比，使用钴基催化剂的PDH过程提供了经济可行的选择，因为钴更为丰富且可能更便宜。当将钴支持在特定材料如硅铝酸盐上时，使用钴在PDH过程中可以提高丙烯的选择性，从而提高整体效率和产品纯度。此外，活性位点隔离策略确保催化剂在高温下也能保持其性能，从而解决了传统过程中常见的失活问题。
