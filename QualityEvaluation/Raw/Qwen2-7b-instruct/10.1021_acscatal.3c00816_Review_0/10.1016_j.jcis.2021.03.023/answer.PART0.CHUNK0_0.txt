In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. These advantages specifically address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

Firstly, PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This contrasts with conventional methods that often rely on scarce resources like natural gas or coal, which may face limitations due to depletion or geopolitical issues.

Secondly, PDH processes are designed for higher efficiency, allowing for more effective conversion of propane into propylene. This results in better yields and reduced waste compared to traditional methods, which might suffer from lower conversion rates or produce unwanted byproducts.

Lastly, PDH technology ensures high selectivity for propylene production. By isolating active cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite, the catalyst CoOx@NC/S-1 achieves an impressive propene selectivity of over 97%. This selective property prevents the formation of other undesirable products, enhancing the overall economic viability and environmental impact of the PDH process.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing abundant feedstocks, improving process efficiency, and ensuring high product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production.

鉴于全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在满足这一需求方面具有多项优势，这些优势特别解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。

首先，PDH技术使用丙烷作为原料，该原料丰富且广泛可用。相比之下，传统方法往往依赖于稀缺资源如天然气或煤炭，这些资源可能由于枯竭或地缘政治问题而面临限制。

其次，PDH过程设计用于更高的效率，允许更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。这与传统方法相比，后者可能具有较低的转化率或产生不希望得到的副产品，从而提高整体产出效率并减少浪费。

最后，PDH技术确保了高选择性以生产丙烯。通过在硅铝酸盐-1沸石上支持的氮掺杂碳层内的孤立钴氧化物位点中隔离活性位点，催化剂CoOx@NC/S-1实现了超过97％的丙烯选择性。这种选择性的特性防止了其他不希望得到的产品的形成，从而增强了PDH过程的整体经济可行性和环境影响。

总之，PDH技术通过利用丰富的原料、提高工艺效率以及确保高产品选择性来解决传统生产方法的挑战，使其成为丙烯生产的最有可能的方法。
