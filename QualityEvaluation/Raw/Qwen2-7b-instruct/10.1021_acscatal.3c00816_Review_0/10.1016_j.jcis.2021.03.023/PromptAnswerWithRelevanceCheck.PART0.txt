In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. These advantages specifically address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

Firstly, PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This contrasts with conventional methods that often rely on scarce resources like natural gas or coal, which may face limitations due to depletion or geopolitical issues.

Secondly, PDH processes are designed for higher efficiency, allowing for more effective conversion of propane into propylene. This results in better yields and reduced waste compared to traditional methods, which might suffer from lower conversion rates or produce unwanted byproducts.

Lastly, PDH technology ensures high selectivity for propylene production. By isolating active cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite, the catalyst CoOx@NC/S-1 achieves an impressive propene selectivity of over 97%. This selective property prevents the formation of other undesirable products, enhancing the overall economic viability and environmental impact of the PDH process.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing abundant feedstocks, improving process efficiency, and ensuring high product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods rely on Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, which are toxic and expensive respectively. PDH uses cobalt-based catalysts, which are abundant and more environmentally friendly. This makes PDH more sustainable and economically viable.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and selective way to produce propylene. It utilizes cobalt species on silica and aluminum oxide supports, which are active for propane dehydrogenation. However, the selectivity for propene production is often low. The active site isolation strategy enhances the selectivity and stability of the catalysts, making PDH more promising.

3. The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst developed in the study demonstrates an impressive 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity at 600°C. This indicates that the catalyst maintains its activity over time without significant deactivation, making it suitable for industrial applications.

4. The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, which are critical attributes for a PDH process. This is achieved by spatially isolating cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

5. The active sites of the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst for PDH were verified through various techniques, including H2 temperature-programmed reduction, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These methods confirmed the presence of isolated cobalt oxide sites responsible for the catalytic activity.

6. The study also investigates the reaction mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst by examining both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation using in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. This provides insights into the reverse reaction process and helps in understanding the catalytic pathways involved in PDH.

1.PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。传统的工艺依赖于毒性大的Cr/Al2O3和价格高昂的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。而PDH使用的是基于钴的催化剂，这些催化剂资源丰富且更加环保。这使得PDH更加可持续和经济可行。

2.PDH技术通过提供一种更高效、选择性更高的丙烯生产方式，解决了传统工艺面临的挑战。它利用了二氧化硅和氧化铝支持的钴物种，这些物种对于丙烷脱氢反应是活性的。然而，丙烯产率的选择性往往较低。活性位点隔离策略提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，使PDH更具前景。

3.研究中开发的CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂显示出40%的丙烷转化率和97%的丙烯选择性，在600°C下运行10小时后，其活性并未显著降低，这表明该催化剂适用于工业应用。

4.CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂展现出卓越的丙烯选择性和催化稳定性，这是PDH过程的关键属性。这得益于在硅酸铝上支撑的氮掺杂碳层中空间隔离的钴氧化物位点，从而增强了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

5.通过H2温度程序还原、差分反射紫外可见光谱和X射线光电子能谱等方法验证了CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂的活性位点。这些方法证实了负责催化活性的孤立钴氧化物位点的存在。

6.通过原位FT-IR光谱法研究了PDH在CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂上的反应机制，包括丙烷脱氢和丙烯氢化两个过程。这提供了对逆反应过程的理解，并有助于理解PDH的催化途径。

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses several key challenges faced by conventional production methods, primarily related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers a more direct pathway to produce propylene from propane, bypassing the need for cracking heavier hydrocarbons. This makes it particularly advantageous in regions with abundant propane reserves, such as those derived from shale gas. Compared to traditional methods that rely on chromium and platinum catalysts, PDH using cobalt-based catalysts presents an economically viable alternative, as cobalt is more abundant and potentially cheaper. The use of cobalt in PDH processes, especially when supported on specific materials like silicalite-1, allows for enhanced selectivity towards propene, thereby improving the overall efficiency and product purity. Moreover, the active site isolation strategy ensures that the catalyst maintains its performance over time, even at high temperatures, thus addressing the issue of deactivation commonly encountered in conventional processes.
