[1] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."
[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility."
[4] "In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic."
[5] "Li et al. reported that the surface Co spinel formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction."
[6] "The active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed."
[7] "Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis."
[8] "Nevertheless, there is no report on the N-doped carbon materials encaged isolated metal sites catalyst applied for PDH with excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, not mention to the study of the active sites and reaction mechanism of Co species for PDH reaction."
[9] "The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."
[10] "The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[11] "In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods rely on Cr/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, which are toxic and expensive respectively. PDH uses cobalt-based catalysts, which are abundant and more environmentally friendly. This makes PDH more sustainable and economically viable.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and selective way to produce propylene. It utilizes cobalt species on silica and aluminum oxide supports, which are active for propane dehydrogenation. However, the selectivity for propene production is often low. The active site isolation strategy enhances the selectivity and stability of the catalysts, making PDH more promising.

3. The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst developed in the study demonstrates an impressive 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity at 600°C. This indicates that the catalyst maintains its activity over time without significant deactivation, making it suitable for industrial applications.

4. The CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, which are critical attributes for a PDH process. This is achieved by spatially isolating cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

5. The active sites of the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst for PDH were verified through various techniques, including H2 temperature-programmed reduction, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These methods confirmed the presence of isolated cobalt oxide sites responsible for the catalytic activity.

6. The study also investigates the reaction mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst by examining both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation using in situ FT-IR spectroscopy. This provides insights into the reverse reaction process and helps in understanding the catalytic pathways involved in PDH.

1.PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。传统的工艺依赖于毒性大的Cr/Al2O3和价格高昂的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。而PDH使用的是基于钴的催化剂，这些催化剂资源丰富且更加环保。这使得PDH更加可持续和经济可行。

2.PDH技术通过提供一种更高效、选择性更高的丙烯生产方式，解决了传统工艺面临的挑战。它利用了二氧化硅和氧化铝支持的钴物种，这些物种对于丙烷脱氢反应是活性的。然而，丙烯产率的选择性往往较低。活性位点隔离策略提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性，使PDH更具前景。

3.研究中开发的CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂显示出40%的丙烷转化率和97%的丙烯选择性，在600°C下运行10小时后，其活性并未显著降低，这表明该催化剂适用于工业应用。

4.CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂展现出卓越的丙烯选择性和催化稳定性，这是PDH过程的关键属性。这得益于在硅酸铝上支撑的氮掺杂碳层中空间隔离的钴氧化物位点，从而增强了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

5.通过H2温度程序还原、差分反射紫外可见光谱和X射线光电子能谱等方法验证了CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂的活性位点。这些方法证实了负责催化活性的孤立钴氧化物位点的存在。

6.通过原位FT-IR光谱法研究了PDH在CoOx@NC/S-1催化剂上的反应机制，包括丙烷脱氢和丙烯氢化两个过程。这提供了对逆反应过程的理解，并有助于理解PDH的催化途径。
