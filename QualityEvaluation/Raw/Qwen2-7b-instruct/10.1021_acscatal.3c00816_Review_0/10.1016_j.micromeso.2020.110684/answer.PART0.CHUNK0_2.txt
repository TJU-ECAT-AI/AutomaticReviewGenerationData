[1] "To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The added Sn obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to decreased strong acid sites, Cr sites density and Cr3+ content on the surface of the catalysts."
[3] "Comparing with unmodified CrOx/alumina catalyst, the CrOx supported on modified alumina presents high activity of propane dehydrogenation and good catalyst stability."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By utilizing PDH technology, the method effectively tackles the scarcity of conventional feedstocks, enhances process efficiency through optimized conversion rates, and improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene with reduced byproducts. Additionally, the use of modified supports, such as foamed alumina modified by tin, leads to enhanced catalyst stability and activity, which are critical factors in maintaining consistent and efficient propylene production.
