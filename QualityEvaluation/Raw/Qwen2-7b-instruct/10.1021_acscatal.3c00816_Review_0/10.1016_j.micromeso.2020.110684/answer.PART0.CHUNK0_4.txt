<p>Highlights • Foamed alumina modified by tin is prepared for supporting Cr-based catalysts. • The adding tin increases the pore size and develops more complex cavity structure. • Doped and dispersed tin on surface change interaction between Cr and support. • Propane dehydrogenation performance is enhanced by using modified alumina as support. • Tin obviously inhibits formation of coke and increases catalyst stability.</p>
<p>To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The Sn doped into alumina framework and dispersed on support surface changes the surface properties, such as surface hydroxyl group and isoelectric point, promoting the formation of more active polymeric chromate on the surface.</p>

The key advantages of using tin-modified foamed alumina as a support for chromium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation technology include the enhancement of pore size and the development of a more complex cavity structure, which leads to improved interaction between chromium and the support. This modification results in higher activity for propane dehydrogenation and better catalyst stability compared to unmodified chromium oxide on alumina. Additionally, the incorporation of tin effectively inhibits the formation of coke deposits, which increases the overall stability of the catalyst.
