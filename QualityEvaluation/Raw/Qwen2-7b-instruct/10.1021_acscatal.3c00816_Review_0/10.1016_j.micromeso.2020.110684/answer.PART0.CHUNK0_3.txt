[1] "To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The added Sn obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to decreased strong acid sites, Cr sites density and Cr3+ content on the surface of the catalysts."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional production methods are its ability to address challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than traditional sources used in conventional methods. It also enhances process efficiency through optimized reaction conditions and catalyst design, leading to higher yields of propylene. Additionally, PDH technology improves product selectivity, producing a higher proportion of propylene compared to other byproducts, making it a more efficient and environmentally friendly method for propylene production.
