[1] "To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The foamable alumina is formed by using soft template, and tin added in preparing process changes micro-micelle formation to generate more complex cavity structure."
[3] "Sn doped into alumina framework and dispersed on support surface changes the surface properties, such as surface hydroxyl group and isoelectric point, promoting the formation of more active polymeric chromate on the surface."
[4] "The CrOx supported on modified alumina presents high activity of propane dehydrogenation and good catalyst stability, comparing with unmodified CrOx/alumina catalyst."
[5] "The added Sn obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to decreased strong acid sites, Cr sites density and Cr3+ content on the surface of the catalysts."

Propane dehydrogenation technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. Secondly, in terms of process efficiency, propane dehydrogenation allows for a higher yield of propylene compared to other methods, thanks to the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the intermediate formation of other byproducts. Lastly, in relation to product selectivity, this technology ensures a high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. The use of modified alumina as a support for CrOx catalysts, with the addition of tin, enhances the catalytic performance by changing the surface properties and improving the distribution of active Cr species, leading to improved activity and stability during propane dehydrogenation. The incorporation of tin reduces the formation of coke deposits, thereby increasing the catalyst's lifetime and efficiency.

丙烷直接脱氢技术被认为是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它在几个方面优于传统的生产方法。首先，它解决了原料供应的问题，利用丰富的丙烷作为主要原料。其次，在工艺效率方面，丙烷脱氢允许更高的丙烯产率，这是由于直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需形成其他中间产物。最后，与产品选择性有关，该技术确保了高选择性向丙烯转化，最大限度地减少了副产品的形成。使用改性氧化铝作为CrOx催化剂的支持体，并添加锡，通过改变表面性质和提高活性Cr物种的分布，增强了催化性能，从而提高了丙烷脱氢的活性和稳定性。在催化剂中加入锡可以减少焦炭沉积物的形成，从而增加催化剂的使用寿命和效率。
