[1] "To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The added Sn obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to decreased strong acid sites, Cr sites density and Cr3+ content on the surface of the catalysts."
[3] "The Sn doped into alumina framework and dispersed on support surface changes the surface properties, such as surface hydroxyl group and isoelectric point, promoting the formation of more active polymeric chromate on the surface."

Propane dehydrogenation is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and widely available globally. Secondly, the process efficiency of PDH is notably higher compared to traditional methods, enabling more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. Lastly, PDH offers superior product selectivity, producing a higher yield of propylene with less by-product formation, thus enhancing economic viability and environmental sustainability.
