[1] "To better understand influences of surface properties of supports on distributed Cr active sites of Cr-based catalysts with high Cr loading, foamed alumina modified by Sn was prepared to support CrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The foamable alumina is formed by using soft template, and tin added in preparing process changes micro-micelle formation to generate more complex cavity structure."
[3] "Sn doped into alumina framework and dispersed on support surface changes the surface properties, such as surface hydroxyl group and isoelectric point, promoting the formation of more active polymeric chromate on the surface."
[4] "The CrOx supported on modified alumina presents high activity of propane dehydrogenation and good catalyst stability, comparing with unmodified CrOx/alumina catalyst."
[5] "The added Sn obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to decreased strong acid sites, Cr sites density and Cr3+ content on the surface of the catalysts."

Propane dehydrogenation technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to several advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. Secondly, in terms of process efficiency, propane dehydrogenation allows for a higher yield of propylene compared to other methods, thanks to the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the intermediate formation of other byproducts. Lastly, in relation to product selectivity, this technology ensures a high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. The use of modified alumina as a support for CrOx catalysts, with the addition of tin, enhances the catalytic performance by changing the surface properties and improving the distribution of active Cr species, leading to improved activity and stability during propane dehydrogenation. The incorporation of tin reduces the formation of coke deposits, thereby increasing the catalyst's lifetime and efficiency.
