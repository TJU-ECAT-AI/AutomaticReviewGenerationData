The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability. PDH technology also enhances process efficiency by utilizing a direct conversion pathway, which reduces energy consumption and operational costs compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, PDH technology improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene, which is crucial for meeting the growing global demand for this chemical. This method specifically addresses the limitations of conventional production methods by offering a more sustainable, cost-effective, and selective route to propylene synthesis.
