<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology lies in its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the issues of feedstock availability by utilizing a more abundant and less expensive feedstock compared to traditional methods. In terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a streamlined conversion pathway that reduces energy consumption and operational costs. Product selectivity is improved due to the direct conversion process, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts and enhancing the purity of the propylene output.
