The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are as follows:

1. PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and readily available, especially from shale gas revolution where ethane prices are low. This makes PDH economically competitive compared to traditional methods that rely on oil or coal feedstocks.
2. PDH technology improves process efficiency by converting propane directly to propylene, bypassing the need for intermediate olefin production stages. This reduces energy consumption and simplifies the production process.
3. PDH technology enhances product selectivity, as it efficiently converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts, offering a cleaner and more efficient production route for propylene compared to conventional methods that might produce additional compounds like methane or ethylene as byproducts.

By incorporating Zr into the MCM-41 framework, the study aims to optimize the formation and dispersion of PtSn catalysts, thereby enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency and stability, which are crucial factors in achieving better alkane dehydrogenation performance. This approach also opens up potential for applying similar strategies with Ti and V to improve alkane dehydrogenation capabilities.
