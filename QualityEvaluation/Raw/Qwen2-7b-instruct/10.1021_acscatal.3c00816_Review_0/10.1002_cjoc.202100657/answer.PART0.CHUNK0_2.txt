<p>Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods. Shale gas revolution results in low price of ethane, making the production of ethene from ethane economically competitive.</p>
<p>Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route for that the products are valuable ethene and hydrogen (Eq. 1). The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically controlled, thus high temperature is required (>550C) to achieve efficient conversion of ethane to ethene.</p>
<p>Supported PtSn catalysts are widely applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Strong acidity and strong interaction between PtSn species and ZrO2 deteriorate the catalytic stability for PtSn/Zr/M. Acidity of PtSn/ZrM is weak and remains stable during the reduction process, meanwhile moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr is generated, which benefits the formation, dispersion and stabilization of highly active and selective Pt3Sn/Pt particles.</p>
<p>The incorporation of framework Zr to the MCM-41 support enhances the initial activity and stability of the PtSn catalyst in ethane dehydrogenation.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology capitalizes on the abundance and low cost of ethane, derived from shale gas, making ethene production economically viable. The process is thermodynamically controlled and requires high temperatures for efficient ethane conversion to ethene, ensuring high selectivity for the desired product. Supported PtSn catalysts are commonly used in PDH processes, offering active sites for alkane dehydrogenation. By incorporating framework Zr into the support material, the stability and efficiency of these catalysts are improved, leading to better initial activity and prolonged stability. The weak acidity and moderate interaction between PtSn species and Si-O-Zr in the presence of framework Zr contribute to the formation of highly active and selective Pt3Sn/Pt particles, enhancing the overall performance of the catalyst system.
