<p>Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods.</p>
<p>Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route for that the products are valuable ethene and hydrogen (Eq. 1).</p>
<p>The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically controlled,[3] thus high temperature is required (>550C) to achieve efficient conversion of ethane to ethene.</p>
<p>Supported PtSn catalysts are widely applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.[4, 5]</p>
<p>Pt phase is highly active for alkane dehydrogenation,[6, 7] while Pt3Sn/Pt has been recognized as a better structure compared with Pt for that the desorption of generated ethene on its surface is much easier.[8, 9]</p>
<p>To maintain dehydrogenation efficiency, PtSn phase segregation and metal sintering must be minimized,[14-17] in which the supports play an important role by regulating the geometric and electronic structure of PtSn.</p>
<p>What's more, ZrO2 contains plentiful Lewis acid sites,[28] and Brnsted sites are generated upon reduction by hydrogen,[29] which may further deteriorate the coking during dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Herein, we synthesized framework Zr-incorporated MCM-41 (ZrM), and compared it with MCM-41 (M) and ZrO2-supported MCM-41 (Zr/M), for the optimal formation and dispersion of supported PtSn species during reduction and dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p>The incorporation of moderate heteroatoms to MCM-41 framework to promote ethane dehydrogenation can also be applied to Ti and V, which offers an alternative strategy to achieve better alkane dehydrogenation performance.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are as follows:

1. PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant and readily available, especially from shale gas revolution where ethane prices are low. This makes PDH economically competitive compared to traditional methods that rely on oil or coal feedstocks.
2. PDH technology improves process efficiency by converting propane directly to propylene, bypassing the need for intermediate olefin production stages. This reduces energy consumption and simplifies the production process.
3. PDH technology enhances product selectivity, as it efficiently converts propane to propylene with minimal byproducts, offering a cleaner and more efficient production route for propylene compared to conventional methods that might produce additional compounds like methane or ethylene as byproducts.

By incorporating Zr into the MCM-41 framework, the study aims to optimize the formation and dispersion of PtSn catalysts, thereby enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency and stability, which are crucial factors in achieving better alkane dehydrogenation performance. This approach also opens up potential for applying similar strategies with Ti and V to improve alkane dehydrogenation capabilities.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势如下：

1. PDH技术通过利用大量且价格低廉的丙烷，解决了原料供应的问题。尤其是在页岩气革命中，乙烷价格低廉的情况下，PDH技术经济竞争力强，与依赖石油或煤炭原料的传统方法相比，这提高了过程效率。
2. PDH技术通过将丙烷直接转化为丙烯，简化了生产过程并减少了能源消耗，从而提高了过程效率。与常规方法需要中间的烯烃生产阶段不同，这使得PDH技术成为更高效、更清洁的丙烯生产途径。
3. PDH技术提高了产品选择性，因为它能有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副产品的产生。与传统方法可能产生甲烷或乙烯等副产品相比，这提供了更清洁、更高效的丙烯生产方式。

通过在MCM-41骨架中引入Zr，研究旨在优化PtSn催化剂的形成和分散，从而提高脱氢效率和稳定性，这些都是实现更好的烷基脱氢性能的关键因素。这种方法也为使用Ti和V等类似策略改进烷基脱氢能力提供了可能性。
