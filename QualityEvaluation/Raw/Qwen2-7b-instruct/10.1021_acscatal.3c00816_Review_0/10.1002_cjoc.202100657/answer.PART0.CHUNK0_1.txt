[1] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route to produce ethene."
[2] "Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods."
[3] "Ethene is a key building block of petrochemical industry for production of plastics, fibers, rubbers, and so on, which is mainly obtained from steam cracking of oil, coal to olefins and methanol to olefins."
[4] "Shale gas revolution results in low price of ethane, making the production of ethene from ethane economically competitive."
[5] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route for that the products are valuable ethene and hydrogen (Eq. 1)."
[6] "The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically controlled, thus high temperature is required (>550C) to achieve efficient conversion of ethane to ethene."
[7] "Supported PtSn catalysts are widely applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[8] "Pt phase is highly active for alkane dehydrogenation, while Pt3Sn/Pt has been recognized as a better structure compared with Pt for that the desorption of generated ethene on its surface is much easier."
[9] "However, the melting point of Sn is merely 232C, while Pt's melting point is as high as 1755C and its Httig temperature is 335C."
[10] "Aggregated particles with less active sites exposed on the surface and phases like PtSn3 that are low-active for dehydrogenation of alkanes may generate during reduction and reaction, due to the high operation temperature and different mobility of Pt and Sn."
[11] "To maintain dehydrogenation efficiency, PtSn phase segregation and metal sintering must be minimized."
[12] "ZrO2 is well known for strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) with Pt."
[13] "Considering that the surface area of bulk ZrO2 is very low, supports have been recommended for better dispersion and performance."
[14] "What's more, ZrO2 contains plentiful Lewis acid sites, and Brnsted sites are generated upon reduction by hydrogen, which may further deteriorate the coking during dehydrogenation reaction."
[15] "Therefore, modulation of Zr species on porous non-acidic support to achieve highly dispersed and stable PtSn catalyst, as well as to decrease the acidity and prevent rapid deactivation, is of importance."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

Firstly, PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and readily available due to the shale gas revolution, leading to economic competitiveness compared to traditional methods that often rely on oil, coal, or methanol. This makes PDH a viable and potentially cheaper source for propylene production.

Secondly, PDH is a highly efficient process, capable of converting propane directly into propylene without the need for intermediate products, unlike traditional steam cracking processes which require additional steps and energy consumption. This direct conversion reduces the overall process complexity and energy requirements, enhancing both the sustainability and economic viability of propylene production.

Lastly, PDH technology demonstrates superior product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts or co-products. This selectivity ensures a cleaner, more efficient production process, reducing waste and increasing the yield of the desired propylene, which is essential for various industries including petrochemicals, plastics, fibers, and rubbers.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective solution for propylene production, addressing the limitations of conventional methods and aligning with the growing demand for propylene in various industrial sectors.
