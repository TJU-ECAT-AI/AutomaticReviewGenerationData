[1] "Considering the fluctuation of oil price and the complexity to produce ethene from coal, it's necessary to develop more production methods."
[2] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation is a promising route for that the products are valuable ethene and hydrogen (Eq. 1)."
[3] "Ethene is a key building block of petrochemical industry for production of plastics, fibers, rubbers, and so on, which is mainly obtained from steam cracking of oil, coal to olefins and methanol to olefins."
[4] "Shale gas revolution results in low price of ethane, making the production of ethene from ethane economically competitive."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock. Conventional production methods often rely on oil or coal, which can be more limited in supply and subject to price fluctuations. Secondly, PDH technology improves process efficiency by directly converting propane into propylene through a single-step process, unlike multi-stage processes in traditional methods. Lastly, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, producing a high yield of propylene with minimal byproducts, optimizing the use of resources and reducing environmental impact.
