<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several advantages over conventional methods, including addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically, PDH technology allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for cracking processes which can lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts such as ethylene and methane. This makes PDH particularly appealing for propylene production due to its higher selectivity and purity of propylene output.</p>
<p>The selective and stable activity of the single-site CoII on SiO2 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen highlights the potential of PDH technology. The catalyst exhibits >95% selectivity at 550°C and >90% selectivity at 650°C with stable activity over 24 hours. This stability and high selectivity contribute to the efficiency and economic viability of the process.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations with hybrid density functional theory support a non-redox mechanism for activation of CH and HH bonds by CoII, which differs from the common redox pathway observed in other cobalt-based catalysts. This non-redox mechanism may offer a unique approach to PDH, potentially leading to improved catalyst performance and longevity.</p>
