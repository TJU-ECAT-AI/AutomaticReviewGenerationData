1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing readily available propane as a feedstock, ensuring efficient conversion processes, and offering high selectivity towards propylene production, minimizing byproduct formation.

2. PDH technology directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate steps, making it more efficient compared to conventional methods. It addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by using a widely accessible resource, propane, which is abundant and cost-effective.

3. Process efficiency is enhanced in PDH technology due to the direct conversion of propane, reducing energy consumption and operational costs. This makes the process more economical and sustainable.

4. Product selectivity is improved in PDH technology, leading to higher yields of propylene with minimal formation of byproducts such as ethylene and methane. This selective conversion ensures a cleaner and more efficient production process.

5. By directly converting propane into propylene, PDH technology avoids the need for complex refining processes, simplifying the overall manufacturing process and potentially reducing environmental impact.

6. The high temperatures required for PDH processes provide a stringent challenge for catalyst selectivity and stability. The use of well-defined, single-site Co2+/SiO2 catalysts helps overcome these challenges by maintaining high selectivity and stability even at high temperatures.

7. The non-redox mechanism employed by the Co2+/SiO2 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation ensures that the oxidation state of cobalt remains unchanged, contributing to the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

8. The ability to activate CH bonds without undergoing β-hydride elimination, as seen in previous studies with single-site Zn2+/SiO2 catalysts, indicates the promising catalytic potential of the Co2+/SiO2 catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation.
