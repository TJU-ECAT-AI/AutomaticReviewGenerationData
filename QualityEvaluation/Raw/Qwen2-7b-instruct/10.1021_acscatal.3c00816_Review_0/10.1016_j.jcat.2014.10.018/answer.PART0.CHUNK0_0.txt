The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as discussed in the document, are its ability to produce propylene efficiently and selectively from propane feedstock. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: Unlike traditional methods that often rely on expensive and limited fossil fuels, PDH utilizes abundant propane as its primary feedstock. This makes the process more sustainable and economically feasible, especially considering the growing global demand for propylene.

2. Process Efficiency: The document highlights the high selectivity of the CoII on SiO2 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, achieving over 95% propene yield at 550°C and over 90% at 650°C. This high selectivity reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts such as ethylene and methane, enhancing the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

3. Product Selectivity: The single-site CoII on SiO2 catalyst is designed to maintain its activity and selectivity over long periods (up to 24 hours), ensuring consistent production of propene without compromising on the yield. This stability is crucial for industrial applications where prolonged operation is necessary.

4. Catalyst Stability: The document mentions that the catalyst does not undergo oxidation or reduction under operating conditions (up to 650°C in hydrogen), indicating its robustness against degradation due to exposure to high temperatures and reducing atmospheres. This stability ensures the longevity of the catalyst and minimizes the need for frequent replacements or regeneration.

5. Theoretical Support: The non-redox mechanism proposed for the activation of CH and HH bonds by CoII suggests a pathway that is distinct from conventional redox mechanisms. This theoretical foundation provides insights into the unique catalytic properties of CoII-based catalysts and supports their potential for efficient propylene production.

文档中讨论的丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于其能够高效且选择性地从丙烷原料生产丙烯。PDH技术通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：与依赖昂贵且有限的化石燃料的传统方法不同，PDH过程主要利用丰富的丙烷作为原料。这使其更具可持续性和经济可行性，特别是考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长。

2. 过程效率：文献强调了CoII在SiO2表面作为催化剂时在丙烷脱氢中的高选择性，550°C时超过95%，650°C时超过90%，同时保持稳定的活性长达24小时。这种高选择性减少了乙烷和甲烷等副产品的生成，提高了PDH过程的整体效率。

3. 产品选择性：单个CoII在SiO2催化剂设计用于在长期内保持其活性和选择性（长达24小时），确保稳定地产生丙烯，而不牺牲产量。这种稳定性对于工业应用至关重要，这些应用需要长时间运行。

4. 催化剂稳定性：文献提到，在操作条件下（高达650°C的氢气中），催化剂不会发生氧化或还原，表明其抵抗高温和还原大气下降解的能力强大。这种稳定性确保了催化剂的寿命，并减少了频繁更换或再生的需要。

5. 理论支持：提出的非红氧化合物机制对于CH和HH键的激活提供了独特的途径，与传统的红氧化合物机制不同。这一理论基础为CoII基催化剂的独特催化特性提供了见解，并支持其有效生产丙烯的潜力。
