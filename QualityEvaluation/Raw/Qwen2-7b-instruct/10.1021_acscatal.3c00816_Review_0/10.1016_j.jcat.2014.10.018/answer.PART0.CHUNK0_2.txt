<p>The high temperatures required for high conversion in the dehydrogenation reaction therefore provide a stringent challenge for catalyst selectivity and stability.</p>
<p>We recently reported that a single-site Zn2+ on silica catalyst is catalytically active for propane dehydrogenation, exhibiting 95% selectivity at 550 C [37] .</p>
<p>In contrast with zinc, transition metals with partially filled d orbitals normally undergo facile β-hydride elimination and might be superior catalysts if the CH over CC activation selectivity remains high.</p>
<p>Moreover, cobalt is a redox-active metal which could possibly catalyze propane dehydrogenation in a different (redox) mechanism and reaction intermediates than that previously observed on the Zn2+/silica catalyst.</p>
<p>Catalyst performance testing was conducted in a vertical, quartz tube reactor.</p>

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing challenges such as feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH directly converts propane to propylene without the need for cracking, which reduces energy consumption and environmental impact compared to conventional methods that rely on crude oil. It offers flexibility in feedstock, as propane can be derived from natural gas, coal, and biomass, providing a more sustainable and diverse source of propylene compared to traditional oil-based processes. Additionally, PDH allows for better control over product selectivity, producing higher purity propylene, which is crucial for downstream chemical processes. The high temperatures required for PDH pose a challenge for catalyst selectivity and stability, which the study addresses by developing a single-site Co2+/SiO2 catalyst that exhibits high selectivity and stable activity.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的优势包括解决诸如原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。PDH可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需裂化，与依赖于原油的传统方法相比，这降低了能耗和环境影响。它提供了更大的灵活性，因为丙烷可以从天然气、煤炭和生物质中获取，提供了一个比传统基于石油的过程更可持续和多样的丙烯来源。此外，PDH允许对产品选择性进行更好的控制，产生更高纯度的丙烯，这对于下游化学过程至关重要。PDH所需的高度温度为催化剂的选择性和稳定性提出了挑战，研究通过开发单个钴离子/二氧化硅催化剂解决了这一问题，该催化剂显示出高选择性和稳定的活性。
