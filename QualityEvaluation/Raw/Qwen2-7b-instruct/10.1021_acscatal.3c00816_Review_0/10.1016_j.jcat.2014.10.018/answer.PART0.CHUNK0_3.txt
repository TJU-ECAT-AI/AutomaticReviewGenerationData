<p>Propane is the simplest molecule capable of undergoing both dehydrogenation and monomolecular cracking, allowing facile comparison between the relative rates of CH and CC bond activation, and while thermal cracking to form ethylene and methane becomes thermodynamically favorable below 250 C, propane dehydrogenation remains thermodynamically disfavored below about 550 C. The high temperatures required for high conversion in the dehydrogenation reaction therefore provide a stringent challenge for catalyst selectivity and stability.</p>
<p>We recently reported that a single-site Zn2+ on silica catalyst is catalytically active for propane dehydrogenation, exhibiting 95% selectivity at 550 C [37] . A density functional theory study indicates the rate-limiting step is beta-hydride elimination, which is consistent with the known stability of zinc alkyls. The active site was a low-coordinate Zn2+ ion that did not undergo a change in oxidation state during the catalytic cycle.</p>
<p>Moreover, cobalt is a redox-active metal which could possibly catalyze propane dehydrogenation in a different (redox) mechanism and reaction intermediates than that previously observed on the Zn2+/silica catalyst. Thus, a well-defined cobalt-on-silica catalyst is of interest as a possible propane dehydrogenation catalyst.</p>
<p>Catalyst performance testing was conducted in a vertical, quartz tube reactor. Gas flow was controlled using mass flow controllers, and product distribution was determined via online gas chromatography (J&W Scientific) equipped with a 50 m GS-Alumina capillary column and a flame ionization detector to which H2 (99.999%, Airgas USA) and air (<2 ppm H2O, Airgas) were also supplied. Approximately 1 g of catalyst was supported on quartz wool with an internal thermocouple placed at the top of the catalyst bed.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the document, include:

1. **High Product Selectivity**: The document mentions that the single-site CoII on SiO2 catalyst shows highly selective (>95%) catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. This demonstrates the technology's ability to efficiently convert propane into propene without substantial side reactions to ethylene and methane.

2. **Stable Activity Over Time**: The catalyst exhibits stable activity over 24 hours, indicating its robustness and reliability in industrial applications where long-term operation is necessary.

3. **Non-Redox Mechanism**: The document emphasizes the non-redox mechanism involved in the catalysis, which is consistent with previous reports on single-site ZnII catalysts. This suggests a different approach to dehydrogenation compared to redox mechanisms, potentially offering a more efficient or safer route.

4. **High Conversion at High Temperatures**: The catalyst is active at high temperatures (550°C and above), which is crucial for achieving high conversion rates in the dehydrogenation process. This addresses the challenge posed by the thermodynamic disfavorability of propane dehydrogenation at lower temperatures.

5. **Well-Defined Catalyst**: The use of a well-defined single-site catalyst allows for the development of structure-function relationships, revealing the molecular origins of catalytic activity and selectivity. This not only enhances our understanding of the process but also facilitates the design of new, potentially more efficient catalysts.

6. **Controlled Synthesis**: The document outlines the controlled synthetic techniques used to prepare the single-site catalyst, highlighting the importance of precise manufacturing processes in achieving high-performance catalysts.

7. **Versatility in Hydrocarbon Processing**: The technology is positioned as a key step in hydrocarbon processing, underlying the production of fuels and petrochemicals. This underscores its relevance in addressing the broader needs of the chemical industry.

The document further notes that while conventional production methods face challenges such as limited feedstock availability, inefficient processes, and poor product selectivity, PDH technology specifically addresses these issues by offering high selectivity, stable activity, and the potential for high conversion rates at high temperatures. This makes it a promising method for propylene production, particularly in scenarios where these challenges are critical factors.
