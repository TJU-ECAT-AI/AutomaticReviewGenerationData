[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid, and the market demand for propylene increases in recent years [1] ."
[2] "The propane dehydrogenation technology has received great attentions, because it provides an alternative way for the production of propylene [2] ,[3] ."
[3] "However, there are still some problems in Pt-based catalysts [5] ,[6] ,[7] . The propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, which requires a high temperature of above 550 C to achieve a feasible propane conversion."
[4] "Under such harsh condition, the growth of Pt particle always takes place, which leads to both a rapid deactivation and a significant decrease in selectivity [8] ."
[5] "Therefore, how to stabilize Pt particles on the oxide substrate under the reaction condition remains a substantial challenge."
[6] "The stability of the Pt particles at the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by the manipulation of metal-support interaction [9] ,[10] ."
[7] "The Pt particles can be tightly stabilized on the heteroatoms in the lattice of oxide substrate [11] ."
[8] "Small Pt particles stabilized in the lattice-confined Sn (IV/II) produces a highly selective and stable Pt-Sn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation [12] ."
[9] "Pt particles confined at the Sn single-site in zeolite framework show high catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation, and the enhanced performance of Pt/Sn-Beta catalysts is mainly attributed to the strong interaction between the Pt particles and the framework of Sn-zeolite [13] ."
[10] "Recently, the encapsulation of Pt clusters into the micropore of zeolite becomes an attractive approach for the synthesis of sintering-resistant Pt@zeolite."
[11] "The fabrication of Pt@zeolite is achieved via one-pot synthesis [14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ."
[12] "These Pt@zeolite catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction to form propylene [18] ."
[13] "Although Pt@zeolite shows high performance in propane dehydrogenation, the straightforward synthesis of Pt@zeolite remains a difficult task."
[14] "The hydrothermal zeolite crystallization is carried out in alkaline condition at high temperature, and the precipitation of Pt species always takes place which leads to a phase separation between Pt particles and zeolite crystal."
[15] "Herein, a series of PtSnx/hierarchical ZSM-5 were developed via the loading of Pt and Sn species into mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5."
[16] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 was synthesized by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition [19] ."
[17] "The PtSn bimetallic particles are confined in the mesopores, which allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane, a readily available feedstock, which is abundant and widely distributed globally. This contrasts with traditional methods that may rely on more scarce or geographically limited resources.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH processes operate at lower temperatures compared to other methods, such as steam cracking. This reduces energy consumption and operating costs. Additionally, the use of bimetallic catalysts like PtSn in PDH enhances efficiency by stabilizing Pt particles, preventing their agglomeration, and improving selectivity.

3. **Product Selectivity**: By confining PtSn bimetallic particles within the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, the PDH process achieves higher conversion rates of propane to propylene with minimal side reactions. This results in superior product selectivity, yielding more propylene per unit of propane processed.

4. **Stability and Regenerability**: The PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts show remarkable stability and regenerability, maintaining high catalytic activity even after prolonged use and regeneration through simple calcination, thus reducing operational costs.

In summary, PDH technology leverages the advantages of readily available feedstocks, energy-efficient processes, improved selectivity, and durable catalysts to offer a sustainable and economically viable method for propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by traditional methods.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它在以下几个关键方面解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，包括原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH 技术使用的是大量分布且丰富的丙烷作为原料。相比之下，传统方法可能依赖于稀缺或地理位置受限的资源。

2. **工艺效率**：与其它方法（如蒸汽裂解）相比，PDH 过程在较低温度下运行，从而降低了能耗和运营成本。通过使用如 PtSn 这样的双金属催化剂，PDH 过程提高了效率，通过稳定铂颗粒并防止其聚集来提高选择性。

3. **产品选择性**：通过将 PtSn 双金属颗粒限制在层级沸石-5（ZSM-5）多孔结构中的微孔中，PDH 过程实现了高转化率的丙烷到丙烯，同时最大限度地减少了副反应，从而获得了更高的产品选择性，每单位丙烷处理后产生更多的丙烯。

4. **稳定性和再生性**：PtSn/层级 ZSM-5 催化剂表现出出色的稳定性和再生性，即使经过长时间使用和简单煅烧再生后也能保持高度的催化活性，从而降低了操作成本。

综上所述，PDH 技术利用了容易获得的原料、节能高效的工艺、提高的选择性和耐用的催化剂等优势，提供了一种可持续和经济有效的丙烯生产方法，解决了传统方法面临的问题。
