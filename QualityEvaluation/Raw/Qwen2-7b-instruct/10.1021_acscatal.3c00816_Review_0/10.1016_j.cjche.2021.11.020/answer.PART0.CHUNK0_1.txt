[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid, and the market demand for propylene increases in recent years [1]."
[2] "However, there are still some problems in Pt-based catalysts [5], [6], [7]. The propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, which requires a high temperature of above 550 C to achieve a feasible propane conversion."
[3] "Under such harsh condition, the growth of Pt particle always takes place, which leads to both a rapid deactivation and a significant decrease in selectivity [8]. Therefore, how to stabilize Pt particles on the oxide substrate under the reaction condition remains a substantial challenge."
[4] "Recently, the encapsulation of Pt clusters into the micropore of zeolite becomes an attractive approach for the synthesis of sintering-resistant Pt@zeolite."
[5] "A series of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 were developed via the loading of Pt and Sn species into mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5. The hierarchical ZSM-5 was synthesized by a treatment of ZSM-5 in the NaOH solution under a mild condition [19]."
[6] "The PtSn bimetallic particles are confined in the mesopores, which allow them to become a stable catalyst in propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."
[7] "Significantly, when the NaOH concentration is increased to 0.8 mol·L-1, the obtained PtSn1.00/hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8) shows excellent catalytic performance with a high initial propane conversion of 47% and propylene selectivity of 97%."
[8] "Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimized NaOH concentration for the synthesis of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts should be around 0.8 mol·L-1, and the PtSn1.00/hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst delivers the highest efficiency for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation."
[9] "The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses the following challenges:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally. This contrasts with conventional methods that might require more scarce or expensive feedstocks, such as naphtha or ethane.

2. **Process Efficiency**: The PDH process is designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, a valuable chemical intermediate, under high temperatures. By optimizing the reaction conditions, particularly through the use of advanced catalysts like PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5, the process achieves high propane conversion rates. For instance, the PtSn1.00/hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst, optimized at a NaOH concentration of 0.8 mol·L-1, demonstrates exceptional efficiency with an initial propane conversion of 47% and a propylene selectivity of 97%.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The high selectivity of PDH processes, especially when employing the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, ensures that the majority of the converted propane is transformed into propylene rather than other byproducts. This is crucial for maximizing yield and minimizing waste.

4. **Stability and Regenerability**: The PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts show remarkable stability and regenerability, allowing for prolonged operation periods without significant loss in performance. This is particularly advantageous in industrial settings where continuous operation is essential.

In conclusion, PDH technology, particularly through the use of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, offers a sustainable, efficient, and economically viable solution for propylene production, addressing the increasing demand for this critical chemical while overcoming limitations posed by traditional production methods.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产领域脱颖而出，成为最具有前景的方法，主要得益于以下几点优势，针对传统生产方法所面临的挑战：

1. **原料获取**：PDH技术以丙烷为主要原料，该原料丰富且在全球范围内广泛可用。相比之下，传统方法可能需要更稀缺或成本更高的原料，如石脑油或乙烷。

2. **过程效率**：PDH过程旨在高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，尤其是在高温条件下。通过优化反应条件，特别是使用先进的催化剂如PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5，过程能够实现高丙烷转化率。例如，优化至NaOH浓度为0.8 mol·L-1的PtSn1.00/hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8)催化剂，展现出卓越的效率，初始丙烷转化率为47%，丙烯选择性为97%。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH过程，尤其是通过使用PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂，表现出极高的选择性，确保大部分转化的丙烷转化为丙烯，而其他副产品的生成量较少。这对于最大化产出并减少浪费至关重要。

4. **稳定性和再生能力**：PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂显示出出色的稳定性和再生能力，允许长时间运行而不显著降低性能。这对于工业环境中的连续操作极为有利。

综上所述，PDH技术，尤其是通过使用PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂，提供了一种可持续、高效且经济的丙烯生产解决方案，满足这一关键化学品日益增长的需求，同时克服了传统生产方法的局限性。
