1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. It tackles issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity effectively. PDH technology offers an alternative way to produce propylene, which enhances the stability of the process and ensures a high yield of propylene, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the production line.

2. The key advantages of PDH technology include addressing the challenges posed by conventional production methods. It specifically addresses the scarcity of traditional feedstocks by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is widely available and abundant. This ensures a steady supply of raw material, reducing the dependency on limited resources. Additionally, PDH technology improves process efficiency by enabling a more controlled and selective reaction, leading to higher yields and reduced waste. Product selectivity is enhanced as PDH technology focuses on producing propylene, minimizing the formation of other byproducts that require additional processing steps.

3. The confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite is a crucial factor contributing to the high efficiency of these catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The mesopores serve as a protective environment that stabilizes the PtSn particles, preventing their sintering and degradation at high temperatures. This confinement effect ensures that the particles remain active and stable throughout the reaction, leading to a high initial conversion rate and selectivity for propylene production. Furthermore, the presence of mesopores facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the overall catalytic performance and efficiency of the PDH process.
