In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include issues with feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: Unlike traditional methods that often rely on naphtha as a primary feedstock, PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and widely available globally. This makes the process more sustainable and accessible in regions where naphtha resources may be limited.

2. Process Efficiency: Conventional methods can suffer from high energy consumption and inefficiencies, particularly due to the formation of byproducts like coke and the potential for catalyst deactivation. PDH technology, by confining PtSn particles within the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, enhances stability and activity, leading to improved process efficiency and lower energy consumption.

3. Product Selectivity: Traditional processes may produce a mix of hydrocarbons, including ethylene and propylene, which can complicate downstream processing. PDH technology, with its optimized catalyst design, allows for a higher selectivity towards propylene, reducing the need for additional purification steps and improving overall yield and profitability.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战。这些挑战包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性问题。PDH技术通过以下方式具体解决了这些挑战：

1. 原料可用性：与依赖于资源有限的石脑油的传统方法不同，PDH技术利用的丙烷是一种全球广泛可用的丰富原料。这使得该过程在资源可能有限的地区更加可持续和可获取。

2. 过程效率：传统方法可能会遇到高能耗和效率低下的问题，尤其是由于副产品的形成和催化剂失活的可能性。通过将PtSn颗粒限制在层级沸石-5型分子筛的介孔中，PDH技术增强了稳定性和活性，从而提高了过程效率并降低了能源消耗。

3. 产品选择性：传统过程可能会产生混合的碳氢化合物，包括乙烯和丙烯，这可能使下游加工复杂化。PDH技术通过优化催化剂设计，允许更高的丙烯选择性，减少了额外精制步骤的需要，并提高了整体产量和盈利能力。
