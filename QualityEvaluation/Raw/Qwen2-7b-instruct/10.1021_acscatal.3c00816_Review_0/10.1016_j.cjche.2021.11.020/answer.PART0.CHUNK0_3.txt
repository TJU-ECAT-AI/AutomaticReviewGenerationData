[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid, and the market demand for propylene increases in recent years [1]."
[2] "The propane dehydrogenation technology has received great attentions, because it provides an alternative way for the production of propylene [2], [3]."
[3] "However, there are still some problems in Pt-based catalysts [5], [6], [7]. The propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, which requires a high temperature of above 550 C to achieve a feasible propane conversion."
[4] "Therefore, how to stabilize Pt particles on the oxide substrate under the reaction condition remains a substantial challenge."
[5] "The stability of the Pt particles at the surface of supports can be greatly enhanced by the manipulation of metal-support interaction [9], [10]."
[6] "The PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts developed for propane dehydrogenation show the highest efficiency, with an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570 C [1]."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include providing an alternative and efficient method for propylene production. This technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The main challenges for conventional methods involve high temperatures required for propane conversion, which can lead to rapid deactivation and a significant decrease in selectivity. PDH technology, particularly when using PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts, offers higher stability and efficiency. It allows for the stabilization of Pt particles at the surface of the substrate, enabling high conversion rates and selectivity even at high temperatures, thus optimizing the process and improving product quality.
