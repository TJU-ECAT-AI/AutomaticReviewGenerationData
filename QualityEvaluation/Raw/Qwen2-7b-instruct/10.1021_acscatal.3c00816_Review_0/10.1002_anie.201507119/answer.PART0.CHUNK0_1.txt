[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."
[3] "Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst."
[4] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."
[5] "Therefore, the use of smaller Pt particles can effectively inhibit coke formation."
[6] "Alternatively, increasing the electron density on the Pt atoms can also effectively weaken the adsorption of alkene molecules and coke precursors, thus reducing coke deposition."
[7] "From a kinetics point of view, thin, sheet-like nanoarchitectures are an ideal choice for improving the mass-transfer and diffusion kinetics."
[8] "However, owing to the structural complexity and our poor understanding of the crystalline structures of Al2O3, it is still challenging to precisely tailor the structure of Al2O3 for optimizing the catalyst performance."
[9] "The synthesis of a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the DHP reaction has been achieved using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions."
[10] "The PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst showed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and did not suffer from coke formation or sintering processes."
[11] "The sheet construction of the catalyst facilitated mass-transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its economic and environmental benefits. It offers a more efficient and cleaner alternative to traditional crude oil naphtha processing methods, which are energy-intensive and produce significant CO2 emissions.
2. Platinum (Pt) catalysts are crucial for the PDH process because they excel at activating paraffinic CH bonds while minimizing the cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds, which is essential for propylene production.
3. Adding tin (Sn) as a promoter enhances the catalyst's performance, achieving optimal results in propylene production.
4. One of the significant challenges in PDH technology is the rapid deactivation of the catalyst, which occurs through coke deposition or platinum (Pt) sintering.
5. Smaller Pt particles can effectively prevent coke formation by inhibiting unwanted side reactions.
6. Increasing the electron density on the Pt atoms also weakens the adsorption of alkene molecules and coke precursors, reducing coke deposition.
7. Thin, sheet-like nanostructures are ideal for improving mass transfer and diffusion rates, enhancing the PDH process.
8. The precise design of Al2O3 catalyst supports remains a challenge due to their complex structures and limited understanding of their crystalline properties.
9. A highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst has been successfully synthesized, utilizing γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions as the support material.
10. The synthesized catalyst demonstrated exceptional propylene production efficiency, with over 99% selectivity, and effectively resisted coke formation and sintering issues.
11. The sheet-like architecture of the catalyst significantly improved mass transfer and kinetic control of diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation, enhancing overall process efficiency.
