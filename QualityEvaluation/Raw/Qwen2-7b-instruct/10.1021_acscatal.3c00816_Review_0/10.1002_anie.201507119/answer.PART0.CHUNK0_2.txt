[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."
[3] "The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."
[4] "These results nicely confirm the promoting role of this nanosheet catalyst in the DHP reaction."
[5] "In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and did not suffer from coke formation or sintering processes."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology over conventional production methods include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is economically and environmentally friendly compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which demands significant energy and produces substantial CO2 emissions. The catalyst used in PDH reactions shows excellent activity and selectivity, forming propylene with over 99% selectivity, and it efficiently prevents coke formation and sintering processes. The sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes, enhancing the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation.
