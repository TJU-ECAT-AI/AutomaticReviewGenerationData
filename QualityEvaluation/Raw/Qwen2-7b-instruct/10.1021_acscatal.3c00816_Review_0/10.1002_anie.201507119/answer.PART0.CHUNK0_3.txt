[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and environmental benefits. Compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, PDH requires less energy input and produces significantly fewer CO2 emissions. It specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by ensuring better feedstock availability, enhancing process efficiency, and maintaining high product selectivity.
