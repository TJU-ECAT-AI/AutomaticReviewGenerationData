1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and environmental benefits. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as the availability of feedstock, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes a direct conversion of propane to propylene, which requires less energy and generates fewer CO2 emissions compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha.

2. The alumina-supported platinum catalyst is a critical component in the PDH process because it efficiently activates paraffinic CH bonds while showing low activity in CC bond cleavage. The addition of tin (Sn) as a promoter enhances the catalyst's performance, but issues like coke deposition and platinum sintering remain significant concerns.

3. The support material plays a crucial role in shaping the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal phase, optimizing catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) supports, with their coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms, are particularly effective in anchoring platinum atoms and maintaining high stability.

4. Sheet-like nanoarchitectures offer advantages in mass transfer and diffusion kinetics, enhancing the catalytic process. However, tailoring the structure of Al2O3 for optimal performance remains challenging due to the complexity of its crystalline structures.

5. The PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst exhibits outstanding reactivity and stability, converting propane into propylene with over 99% selectivity while minimizing coke formation and sintering processes. Its performance surpasses other catalysts in terms of specific activity and lifetime under high space velocities.

6. The optimized catalyst design, including the use of a high percentage of pentacoordinate aluminum ions in the Al2O3 support, improves the dispersion and stabilization of Pt-Sn clusters, leading to an increase in electron density on the Pt sites. This results in efficient activation of propane molecules and high propylene selectivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PDH technology in propylene production.

1. 烷丙直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它在经济性和环保性方面具有优势。它解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，相较于传统的原油衍生石脑油热裂解或催化裂解，其所需的能量更少，产生的二氧化碳排放也更少。

2. 铝氧化物支持的铂催化剂是PDH过程的关键组成部分，因为它能高效激活烷基CH键，并表现出对CC键断裂的低活性。添加锡（Sn）作为促进剂可以提高催化剂性能，但焦炭沉积和铂合金化仍然是主要问题。

3. 支撑材料在调整活性金属相的几何和电子结构中起着关键作用，以优化催化活性、选择性和稳定性。铝氧化物（Al2O3）支撑，特别是其协调不饱和铝原子，在锚定铂原子并保持高稳定性方面表现良好。

4. 层状纳米架构在提高质量传输和扩散动力学方面提供了优势，从而增强了催化过程。然而，由于对其结晶结构理解不足，精确调整Al2O3结构以实现最佳性能仍然具有挑战性。

5. PtSn/Al2O3层状催化剂展现出出色的反应性和稳定性，以超过99%的选择性将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时最小化焦炭形成和合金化过程。在超高的空间速度下，该催化剂的特定活性和使用寿命均优于其他催化剂。

6. 通过在Al2O3支持中使用高比例的五配位铝离子，优化催化剂设计提高了Pt-Sn簇的分散和稳定性，增加了Pt位点上的电子密度。这导致了丙烷分子的有效激活和高丙烯选择性，证明了PDH技术在丙烯生产中的有效性。
