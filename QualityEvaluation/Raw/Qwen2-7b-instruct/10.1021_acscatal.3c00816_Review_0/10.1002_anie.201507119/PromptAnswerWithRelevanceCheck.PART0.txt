In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic benefits and environmental friendliness. Unlike conventional methods, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is readily available and abundant in many regions. This makes it more flexible in terms of feedstock sourcing compared to methods requiring crude oil or other less accessible resources.

2. **Process Efficiency**: The direct dehydrogenation process is more efficient in converting propane to propylene, minimizing energy consumption and waste production. This efficiency translates into cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The PDH process yields propylene with high selectivity, exceeding 99%. This high yield is crucial for industries relying on propylene as a key feedstock, ensuring a reliable and pure product supply.

4. **Environmental Impact**: By avoiding the need for thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil, PDH technology significantly reduces energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This aligns with global efforts to mitigate climate change and enhance sustainability.

5. **Stability and Anti-Coking Properties**: The catalysts used in PDH technology, like the one described in the literature, exhibit excellent stability and anti-coking properties. This ensures prolonged operation with minimal deactivation, contributing to long-term efficiency and reduced maintenance costs.

The combination of these factors makes PDH technology a preferred solution for propylene production, offering a sustainable and economically viable pathway in response to the escalating demand for this critical chemical commodity.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic and environmental benefits. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as the availability of feedstock, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes a direct conversion of propane to propylene, which requires less energy and generates fewer CO2 emissions compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha.

2. The alumina-supported platinum catalyst is a critical component in the PDH process because it efficiently activates paraffinic CH bonds while showing low activity in CC bond cleavage. The addition of tin (Sn) as a promoter enhances the catalyst's performance, but issues like coke deposition and platinum sintering remain significant concerns.

3. The support material plays a crucial role in shaping the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal phase, optimizing catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) supports, with their coordinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms, are particularly effective in anchoring platinum atoms and maintaining high stability.

4. Sheet-like nanoarchitectures offer advantages in mass transfer and diffusion kinetics, enhancing the catalytic process. However, tailoring the structure of Al2O3 for optimal performance remains challenging due to the complexity of its crystalline structures.

5. The PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst exhibits outstanding reactivity and stability, converting propane into propylene with over 99% selectivity while minimizing coke formation and sintering processes. Its performance surpasses other catalysts in terms of specific activity and lifetime under high space velocities.

6. The optimized catalyst design, including the use of a high percentage of pentacoordinate aluminum ions in the Al2O3 support, improves the dispersion and stabilization of Pt-Sn clusters, leading to an increase in electron density on the Pt sites. This results in efficient activation of propane molecules and high propylene selectivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PDH technology in propylene production.
