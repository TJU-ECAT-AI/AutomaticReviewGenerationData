In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic benefits and environmental friendliness. Unlike conventional methods, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is readily available and abundant in many regions. This makes it more flexible in terms of feedstock sourcing compared to methods requiring crude oil or other less accessible resources.

2. **Process Efficiency**: The direct dehydrogenation process is more efficient in converting propane to propylene, minimizing energy consumption and waste production. This efficiency translates into cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The PDH process yields propylene with high selectivity, exceeding 99%. This high yield is crucial for industries relying on propylene as a key feedstock, ensuring a reliable and pure product supply.

4. **Environmental Impact**: By avoiding the need for thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil, PDH technology significantly reduces energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This aligns with global efforts to mitigate climate change and enhance sustainability.

5. **Stability and Anti-Coking Properties**: The catalysts used in PDH technology, like the one described in the literature, exhibit excellent stability and anti-coking properties. This ensures prolonged operation with minimal deactivation, contributing to long-term efficiency and reduced maintenance costs.

The combination of these factors makes PDH technology a preferred solution for propylene production, offering a sustainable and economically viable pathway in response to the escalating demand for this critical chemical commodity.
