Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods for propylene. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as its primary reactant, which is abundant and widely available globally. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to operate efficiently under conditions that closely approach the thermodynamic limit, enhancing yield and selectivity towards propylene. Lastly, PDH allows for improved product selectivity, producing propylene with high purity, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring high-quality propylene.
