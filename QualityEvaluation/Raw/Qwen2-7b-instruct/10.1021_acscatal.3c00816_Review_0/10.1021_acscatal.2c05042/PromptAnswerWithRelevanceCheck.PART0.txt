<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods for propylene. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as its primary reactant, which is abundant and widely available globally. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to operate efficiently under conditions that closely approach the thermodynamic limit, enhancing yield and selectivity towards propylene. Lastly, PDH allows for improved product selectivity, producing propylene with high purity, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring high-quality propylene.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often face difficulties in accessing high-quality propane feedstocks due to their high cost and scarcity. In contrast, PDH technology can utilize a wider range of feedstocks, including lower-grade propane, reducing reliance on expensive raw materials. Moreover, PDH technology demonstrates higher conversion rates and yields of propylene compared to traditional methods, resulting in increased productivity and reduced energy consumption. Additionally, PDH offers enhanced selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which improves economic viability and environmental performance.
