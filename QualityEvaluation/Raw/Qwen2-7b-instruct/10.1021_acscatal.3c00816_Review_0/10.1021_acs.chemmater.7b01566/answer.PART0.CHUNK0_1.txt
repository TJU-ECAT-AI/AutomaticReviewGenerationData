The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This contrasts with conventional methods that may rely on less accessible or more expensive feedstocks. Moreover, PDH processes are designed to enhance the efficiency of the conversion, leading to higher yields of propylene. Additionally, PDH offers improved product selectivity, meaning it produces propylene with reduced byproducts, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.
