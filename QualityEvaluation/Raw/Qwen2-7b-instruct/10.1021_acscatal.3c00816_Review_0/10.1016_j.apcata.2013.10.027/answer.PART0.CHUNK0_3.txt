[1] "According to the study, the introduction of hydrothermal treatment (HTT) step leads to differences in the chemical composition of the adsorbed metal complex precursor, the mechanism of its anchoring and the conditions of platinum sites formation."
[2] "As follows from the analysis of adsorption and spectral data, HTT decreases the amount of adsorption sites on the alumina surface, primarily those that provide coordination anchoring of platinum complexes."
[3] "The most important result is that the introduction of HTT step leads to differences in the chemical composition of the adsorbed metal complex precursor, the mechanism of its anchoring and the conditions of platinum sites formation."
[4] "It is essential that introduction of the HTT step (even under relatively mild conditions, for example, 150 C and 3 h) affects not only the metal complexsupport interaction and formation of supported platinum particles, but also the catalytic performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "In the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation there is increase in the propylene selectivity over 10 wt% at similar propane conversion."
[6] "Besides, in the reaction of n-hexane conversion there are changes in the products distribution toward the increased weight ratios of arenes/isomerization products and benzene/methylcyclopentane."

1. The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for expensive and limited feedstocks like naphtha or natural gas. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a more reliable and cost-effective source of propylene, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. PDH technology ensures better process efficiency and product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production.

2. The hydrothermal treatment (HTT) step significantly alters the adsorption mechanism of the metal complex precursor, leading to an increase in the fraction of outer-sphere complexes anchored via electrostatic interaction. This change affects the dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum, thereby impacting the catalytic properties of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

3. The hydrothermal treatment (HTT) step modifies the alumina surface, resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of the support towards the metal complex. This alteration affects not only the interaction between the metal complex and the support but also the formation of supported platinum particles, ultimately influencing the catalytic performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

4. In the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation, the introduction of hydrothermal treatment leads to an increase in the propylene selectivity by more than 10 weight percent while maintaining similar propane conversion levels. This enhancement demonstrates the effectiveness of the HTT step in improving the efficiency of the PDH process.

5. In the reaction of n-hexane conversion, the hydrothermal treatment results in changes to the distribution of the products. Specifically, there is an increase in the weight ratios of arenes to isomerization products and benzene to methylcyclopentane. These changes indicate that the HTT step impacts the catalytic properties of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, potentially leading to improved selectivity for certain product distributions.
