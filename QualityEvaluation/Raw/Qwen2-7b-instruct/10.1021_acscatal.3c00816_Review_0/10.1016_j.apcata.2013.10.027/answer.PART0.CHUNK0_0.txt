<p>As follows from the results of adsorption experiments (Fig. 5 a), elevation of the temperature of alumina HTT, which increases the amount of boehmite phase, is accompanied by a decrease in adsorption capacity of the support with respect to [PtCl6]2. Even under mild HTT conditions (100150 C, 3 h), the maximum amount of adsorbed platinum diminishes appreciably, from 0.24 to 0.200.17 mmol Pt/g, which corresponds to a decrease in the platinum content of the sample from 4.7 to 3.9-3.3 wt%. The elevation of HTT temperature to 200 C, which leads to the formation of hydroxide phase and, accordingly, to an increase in the relative content of bridging OH groups on the support surface, decreases nearly 10-fold the value of adsorption capacity am.</p>
<p>Within the concept of chloroplatinate anchoring mechanism involving OH groups of the alumina surface [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] , the observed decrease in the adsorption capacity can be attributed to a diminishing effect of HTT on the content of OH groups, which are necessary for chemisorption anchoring of the platinum chloride complexes. The FTIR spectroscopy data allow a conclusion that such hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are represented by the most basic terminal OH groups and by the bridging AlO(OH)AlO group, their amount on the alumina surface decreasing due to introduction of the hydrothermal step.</p>
<p>The effect of HTT on the metal complexsupport interaction was investigated by 195Pt MAS NMR. It is known that the interaction of metal complex with support can affect the type of signals in 195Pt NMR spectrum. Thus, the adsorption of chloroplatinate via electrostatic interaction with the surface (the formation of outer-sphere complexes) is not accompanied by a symmetry distortion of the metal complex polyhedra. In such case, the NMR spectrum contains a signal from adsorbed [PtCl6]2with a chemical shift in the region of their absorption in a solution. Exchange interactions of the complexes with hydroxyl groups of the oxide surface (the formation of inner-sphere complexes) can result in a considerable broadening or vanishing of the signal from the nuclei of adsorbed ions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[13] ,[14] .</p>
<p>Fig. 7 shows the 195Pt NMR spectra characterizing platinum complexes adsorbed on the initial γ-Al2O3 and on the alumina subjected to HTT. In the first case, even with a maximum amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 4.5 wt%), there is a weak signal in the region of 40 ppm corresponding to adsorbed [PtCl6]2, which virtually vanishes during the long-term drying of the sample at room temperature. Hydrolyzed forms of the complexes are more prone to coordination anchoring; there are no signals in the region of chemical shifts typical of the aqua or hydroxo complexes [7] ,[14] . As a result of HTT of the support at 180 C, even for a half amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 2.0 wt%) a resonance is observed with the same position of chemical shift at 40 ppm, which intensity is much higher and does not change for a long time (Fig. 7 , spectrum 2).</p>
<p>According to the 195Pt NMR data, changes occur also in the anchoring mechanism of the complexes: there is an increase in the fraction of complexes adsorbed via electrostatic interaction (the formation of outer-sphere complexes): (6)</p>

1. Hydrothermal treatment of alumina reduces its adsorption capacity for platinum complexes, particularly under conditions that increase the content of the boehmite phase. This is due to the decrease in hydroxyl groups, which are crucial for anchoring the complexes.

2. The decrease in adsorption capacity of the support is associated with a reduction in the amount of basic hydroxyl groups and bridging AlO(OH)AlO groups on the alumina surface, which are necessary for anchoring platinum complexes.

3. Hydrothermal treatment leads to an increase in the fraction of complexes that are anchored through electrostatic interactions, forming outer-sphere complexes. This change in anchoring mechanism is evidenced by the 195Pt NMR spectroscopy data.

4. The introduction of hydrothermal treatment alters the interaction between metal complexes and the support, influencing the formation of supported platinum particles and potentially affecting the electronic state of the supported platinum.

1. 热水处理降低了氧化铝对铂络合物的吸附能力，特别是在增加沸石相含量的情况下。这是由于基本羟基组分和桥接AlO(OH)AlO组分数量的减少，这些是锚定铂络合物所必需的。

2. 吸附能力的降低与铝表面基本羟基组分和桥接AlO(OH)AlO组分的数量减少有关，这些是锚定铂络合物所必需的。

3. 热水处理导致通过静电相互作用增加络合物的锚定比例，形成外层复合物。这种锚定机制的变化在195Pt NMR光谱数据中得到了证实。

4. 引入热水处理改变了金属络合物和支撑体之间的相互作用，可能影响支持铂颗粒的形成以及支撑铂的电子状态。
