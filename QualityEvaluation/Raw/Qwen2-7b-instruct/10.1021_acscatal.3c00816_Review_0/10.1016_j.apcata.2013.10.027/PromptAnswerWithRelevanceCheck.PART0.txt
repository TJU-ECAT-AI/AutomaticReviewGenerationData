<p>As follows from the results of adsorption experiments (Fig. 5 a), elevation of the temperature of alumina HTT, which increases the amount of boehmite phase, is accompanied by a decrease in adsorption capacity of the support with respect to [PtCl6]2. Even under mild HTT conditions (100150 C, 3 h), the maximum amount of adsorbed platinum diminishes appreciably, from 0.24 to 0.200.17 mmol Pt/g, which corresponds to a decrease in the platinum content of the sample from 4.7 to 3.9-3.3 wt%. The elevation of HTT temperature to 200 C, which leads to the formation of hydroxide phase and, accordingly, to an increase in the relative content of bridging OH groups on the support surface, decreases nearly 10-fold the value of adsorption capacity am.</p>
<p>Within the concept of chloroplatinate anchoring mechanism involving OH groups of the alumina surface [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] , the observed decrease in the adsorption capacity can be attributed to a diminishing effect of HTT on the content of OH groups, which are necessary for chemisorption anchoring of the platinum chloride complexes. The FTIR spectroscopy data allow a conclusion that such hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface are represented by the most basic terminal OH groups and by the bridging AlO(OH)AlO group, their amount on the alumina surface decreasing due to introduction of the hydrothermal step.</p>
<p>The effect of HTT on the metal complexsupport interaction was investigated by 195Pt MAS NMR. It is known that the interaction of metal complex with support can affect the type of signals in 195Pt NMR spectrum. Thus, the adsorption of chloroplatinate via electrostatic interaction with the surface (the formation of outer-sphere complexes) is not accompanied by a symmetry distortion of the metal complex polyhedra. In such case, the NMR spectrum contains a signal from adsorbed [PtCl6]2with a chemical shift in the region of their absorption in a solution. Exchange interactions of the complexes with hydroxyl groups of the oxide surface (the formation of inner-sphere complexes) can result in a considerable broadening or vanishing of the signal from the nuclei of adsorbed ions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[13] ,[14] .</p>
<p>Fig. 7 shows the 195Pt NMR spectra characterizing platinum complexes adsorbed on the initial γ-Al2O3 and on the alumina subjected to HTT. In the first case, even with a maximum amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 4.5 wt%), there is a weak signal in the region of 40 ppm corresponding to adsorbed [PtCl6]2, which virtually vanishes during the long-term drying of the sample at room temperature. Hydrolyzed forms of the complexes are more prone to coordination anchoring; there are no signals in the region of chemical shifts typical of the aqua or hydroxo complexes [7] ,[14] . As a result of HTT of the support at 180 C, even for a half amount of adsorbed complexes (the platinum content of 2.0 wt%) a resonance is observed with the same position of chemical shift at 40 ppm, which intensity is much higher and does not change for a long time (Fig. 7 , spectrum 2).</p>
<p>According to the 195Pt NMR data, changes occur also in the anchoring mechanism of the complexes: there is an increase in the fraction of complexes adsorbed via electrostatic interaction (the formation of outer-sphere complexes): (6)</p>

1. Hydrothermal treatment of alumina reduces its adsorption capacity for platinum complexes, particularly under conditions that increase the content of the boehmite phase. This is due to the decrease in hydroxyl groups, which are crucial for anchoring the complexes.

2. The decrease in adsorption capacity of the support is associated with a reduction in the amount of basic hydroxyl groups and bridging AlO(OH)AlO groups on the alumina surface, which are necessary for anchoring platinum complexes.

3. Hydrothermal treatment leads to an increase in the fraction of complexes that are anchored through electrostatic interactions, forming outer-sphere complexes. This change in anchoring mechanism is evidenced by the 195Pt NMR spectroscopy data.

4. The introduction of hydrothermal treatment alters the interaction between metal complexes and the support, influencing the formation of supported platinum particles and potentially affecting the electronic state of the supported platinum.

<p>According to the accumulated data provided substantial advances not only in understanding the main transformations of a precursor compound during the synthesis of supported catalysts, but also in the deliberate synthesis of this catalytic system with specified properties by introducing changes into a certain step.</p>
<p>The adsorption sites of γ-Al2O3 are represented both by the hydroxyl groups and the Lewis acid sites (LAS). The relative content of certain functional groups on the oxide surface is determined to a great extent by phase homogeneity of the support. Changes in the phase composition of support may occur due to uncontrolled effect of water during the catalyst synthesis and storage.</p>
<p>As a result, dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum are changed. Influence of γ-Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 in n-hexane transformations and propane dehydrogenation was demonstrated. The revealed effect of γ-Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the formation of platinum sites in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can be of fundamental importance for the steps of supported system synthesis where solid phase is contacting with water and aqueous solutions (impregnation and drying).</p>

The hydrothermal treatment of γ-Al2O3 can significantly alter the surface properties of the alumina, including the fraction of bridging OH groups and the concentration of Lewis acid sites. This leads to changes in the dispersion and electronic state of the supported platinum, affecting the catalytic properties of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in reactions like propane dehydrogenation and n-hexane transformation. The hydrothermal treatment introduces a selective formation of outer-sphere complexes, which are characterized by a lower reduction temperature. This results in a decrease in the dispersion of supported platinum particles, potentially improving the selectivity of propylene formation during propane dehydrogenation. In n-hexane transformations, the changes might lead to an increased weight ratio of arenes and benzene products, suggesting a joint effect of metallic and acidic sites on the catalytic performance.

[1] "According to the results of the study, the action of water on γ-Al2O3 under hydrothermal conditions (up to 200 C) produces considerable changes in the texture characteristics and acid-base properties of the alumina surface, and subsequent high-temperature treatment at 550 C does not provide a complete restoration of the properties of initial support."
[2] "As follows from the analysis of adsorption and spectral data, HTT decreases the amount of adsorption sites on the alumina surface, primarily those that provide coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. This changes the strength of the interaction between metal complex and support, which may further affect the formation conditions and properties of supported platinum particles."
[3] "According to FTIR spectroscopy data, hydrothermal modification consists in changing the relative content of different types of functional groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface: there occurs an increase in the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups (absorption bands at 36703710 cm1) and in the concentration of LAS. Accordingly, the anchoring of platinum(IV) chloride complexes on the support surface is accompanied by an increase in the fraction of outer-sphere complexes that are characterized by a lower reduction temperature (below 200 C)."
[4] "It is essential that introduction of the HTT step (even under relatively mild conditions, for example, 150 C and 3 h) affects not only the metal complex-support interaction and formation of supported platinum particles, but also the catalytic performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. It was shown that in the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation there is increase in the propylene selectivity over 10 wt% at similar propane conversion."

1. The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for expensive and limited feedstocks like naphtha or natural gas. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a more reliable and cost-effective source of propylene, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. PDH technology ensures better process efficiency and product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production.

2. The hydrothermal treatment (HTT) step significantly alters the adsorption mechanism of the metal complex precursor, leading to an increase in the fraction of outer-sphere complexes anchored via electrostatic interaction. This change affects the dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum, thereby impacting the catalytic properties of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

3. The hydrothermal treatment (HTT) step modifies the alumina surface, resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of the support towards the metal complex. This alteration affects not only the interaction between the metal complex and the support but also the formation of supported platinum particles, ultimately influencing the catalytic performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.

4. In the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation, the introduction of hydrothermal treatment leads to an increase in the propylene selectivity by more than 10 weight percent while maintaining similar propane conversion levels. This enhancement demonstrates the effectiveness of the HTT step in improving the efficiency of the PDH process.

5. In the reaction of n-hexane conversion, the hydrothermal treatment results in changes to the distribution of the products. Specifically, there is an increase in the weight ratios of arenes to isomerization products and benzene to methylcyclopentane. These changes indicate that the HTT step impacts the catalytic properties of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, potentially leading to improved selectivity for certain product distributions.

<p>It is known that the adsorption stoichiometry H/Pt may be greater than unity due to multiple adsorption of hydrogen on certain Pt sites [34] ,[35] . However, the use of stoichiometry H/Pt = 1 when calculating the metal dispersion is justified [35] . Carbon monoxide can be chemisorbed in various forms, and adsorption stoichiometry CO/Pt may differ from unity [35] ,[36] . A CO/Pt stoichiometry of 1 has commonly been used, although bridged carbon monoxide coexists with the predominant linear form [35] .
