[1] "According to the results of the study, the action of water on γ-Al2O3 under hydrothermal conditions (up to 200 C) produces considerable changes in the texture characteristics and acid-base properties of the alumina surface, and subsequent high-temperature treatment at 550 C does not provide a complete restoration of the properties of initial support."
[2] "As follows from the analysis of adsorption and spectral data, HTT decreases the amount of adsorption sites on the alumina surface, primarily those that provide coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. This changes the strength of the interaction between metal complex and support, which may further affect the formation conditions and properties of supported platinum particles."
[3] "According to FTIR spectroscopy data, hydrothermal modification consists in changing the relative content of different types of functional groups on the γ-Al2O3 surface: there occurs an increase in the fraction of low-frequency bridging OH groups (absorption bands at 36703710 cm1) and in the concentration of LAS. Accordingly, the anchoring of platinum(IV) chloride complexes on the support surface is accompanied by an increase in the fraction of outer-sphere complexes that are characterized by a lower reduction temperature (below 200 C)."
[4] "It is essential that introduction of the HTT step (even under relatively mild conditions, for example, 150 C and 3 h) affects not only the metal complex-support interaction and formation of supported platinum particles, but also the catalytic performance of the final Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. It was shown that in the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation there is increase in the propylene selectivity over 10 wt% at similar propane conversion."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Specifically:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally. This contrasts with traditional methods that often require more scarce or expensive raw materials.

2. Process efficiency: The PDH process is designed to maximize propylene yield and minimize byproduct formation. It achieves this through optimized reaction conditions and catalyst design, leading to higher overall process efficiency compared to conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology enables the selective production of propylene, with high purity and minimal co-products. This is crucial for downstream applications where the quality of propylene is critical.

By focusing on these aspects, PDH technology stands out as a more sustainable and economically viable option for propylene production in the future.
