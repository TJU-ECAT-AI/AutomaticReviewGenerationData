<p>According to the accumulated data provided substantial advances not only in understanding the main transformations of a precursor compound during the synthesis of supported catalysts, but also in the deliberate synthesis of this catalytic system with specified properties by introducing changes into a certain step.</p>
<p>The adsorption sites of γ-Al2O3 are represented both by the hydroxyl groups and the Lewis acid sites (LAS). The relative content of certain functional groups on the oxide surface is determined to a great extent by phase homogeneity of the support. Changes in the phase composition of support may occur due to uncontrolled effect of water during the catalyst synthesis and storage.</p>
<p>As a result, dispersion and electronic state of supported platinum are changed. Influence of γ-Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 in n-hexane transformations and propane dehydrogenation was demonstrated. The revealed effect of γ-Al2O3 hydrothermal treatment on the formation of platinum sites in Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can be of fundamental importance for the steps of supported system synthesis where solid phase is contacting with water and aqueous solutions (impregnation and drying).</p>

The hydrothermal treatment of γ-Al2O3 can significantly alter the surface properties of the alumina, including the fraction of bridging OH groups and the concentration of Lewis acid sites. This leads to changes in the dispersion and electronic state of the supported platinum, affecting the catalytic properties of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in reactions like propane dehydrogenation and n-hexane transformation. The hydrothermal treatment introduces a selective formation of outer-sphere complexes, which are characterized by a lower reduction temperature. This results in a decrease in the dispersion of supported platinum particles, potentially improving the selectivity of propylene formation during propane dehydrogenation. In n-hexane transformations, the changes might lead to an increased weight ratio of arenes and benzene products, suggesting a joint effect of metallic and acidic sites on the catalytic performance.

水热处理γ-Al2O3可以显著改变氧化铝表面的性质，包括桥接OH基团的比例和Lewis酸性位点的浓度。这导致支持铂的分散性和电子状态的变化，影响Pt/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢和正己烷转化等反应中的催化性能。水热处理引入了外层复合物的选择性形成，其特征是较低的还原温度。这导致支持铂颗粒分散度的降低，可能提高了丙烷脱氢过程中丙烯的选择性。在正己烷转化中，变化可能会导致芳烃和苯产品重量比增加，暗示金属和酸性位点共同影响催化性能。
