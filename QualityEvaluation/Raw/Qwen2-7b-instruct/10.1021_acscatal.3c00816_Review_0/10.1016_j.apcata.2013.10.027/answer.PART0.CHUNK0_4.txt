<p>It is known that the adsorption stoichiometry H/Pt may be greater than unity due to multiple adsorption of hydrogen on certain Pt sites [34] ,[35] . However, the use of stoichiometry H/Pt = 1 when calculating the metal dispersion is justified [35] . Carbon monoxide can be chemisorbed in various forms, and adsorption stoichiometry CO/Pt may differ from unity [35] ,[36] . A CO/Pt stoichiometry of 1 has commonly been used, although bridged carbon monoxide coexists with the predominant linear form [35] . Thus, dispersions of the metal, DPt (H2) and DPt (CO), were calculated taking into account the sorption stoichiometry /Pt = 1 and /Pt = 1.</p>

<p>Answer: The use of stoichiometry H/Pt = 1 and CO/Pt = 1 when calculating the metal dispersion is justified despite multiple adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide on certain Pt sites due to the predominance of the linear form of carbon monoxide over the bridged form.</p>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：在计算金属分散度时，尽管氢和一氧化碳在某些铂位点上存在多吸附，但使用H/Pt = 1和CO/Pt = 1的比例值是合理的，因为线性形式的一氧化碳占主导地位，而桥接形式的一氧化碳则较少。</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<p>According to the analysis of adsorption and spectral data, HTT decreases the amount of adsorption sites on the alumina surface, primarily those that provide coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. This changes the strength of the interaction between metal complex and support, which may further affect the formation conditions and properties of supported platinum particles.</p>

<p>Answer: Hydrothermal treatment (HTT) reduces the number of adsorption sites on alumina surfaces, particularly those that facilitate coordination anchoring of platinum complexes. This modification affects the strength of the interaction between metal complexes and the support, influencing the conditions and characteristics of supported platinum particles.</p>

<p>The effect of alumina HTT on the metal complex-support interaction was investigated by 195Pt MAS NMR. It is known that the interaction of metal complex with support can affect the type of signals in 195Pt NMR spectrum. Thus, the adsorption of chloroplatinate via electrostatic interaction with the surface (the formation of outer-sphere complexes) is not accompanied by a symmetry distortion of the metal complex polyhedra. In such case, the NMR spectrum contains a signal from adsorbed anions [PtCl6]2 with a chemical shift in the region of their absorption in a solution. Exchange interactions of the complexes with hydroxyl groups of the oxide surface (the formation of inner-sphere complexes) can result in a considerable broadening or vanishing of the signal from the nuclei of adsorbed ions [7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[13] ,[14] .</p>

<p>Answer: The influence of alumina HTT on the interaction between metal complexes and the support was studied using 195Pt MAS NMR. It was found that adsorption through electrostatic interaction (formation of outer-sphere complexes) does not distort the symmetry of the metal complex polyhedra. Instead, exchange interactions with hydroxyl groups on the oxide surface (formation of inner-sphere complexes) can significantly broaden or eliminate the signal from the nuclei of adsorbed ions.</p>

答案：通过195Pt MAS NMR研究了热等静压处理对金属复合物-支持相互作用的影响。发现通过静电相互作用（形成外层复合物）吸附不会破坏金属复合物多面体的对称性。相反，与氧化物表面上的羟基团的交换相互作用（形成内层复合物）可以显著扩展或消除吸附离子核的信号。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
