Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production, addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, unlike some other feedstocks used in traditional processes that may be more limited or expensive. This ensures a stable supply chain and reduces dependency on fluctuating markets. In terms of process efficiency, PDH processes typically have higher yields and lower energy consumption compared to traditional methods, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits. Product selectivity in PDH is also superior, with a higher conversion rate of propane to propylene, resulting in less waste and a more efficient production cycle. These advantages collectively make PDH technology the most promising method for propylene production in the face of growing global demand.
