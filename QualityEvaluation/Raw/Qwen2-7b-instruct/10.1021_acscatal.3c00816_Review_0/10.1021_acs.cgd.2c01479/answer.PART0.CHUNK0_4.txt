The selective incorporation of iron sites into MFI zeolite framework through one-pot synthesis offers several advantages over conventional methods. Firstly, the MFI zeolite framework provides an ideal platform for the selective incorporation of iron sites due to its well-defined pore structure and high surface area. This enables precise control over the distribution and orientation of iron sites within the zeolite framework. The incorporation of iron sites enhances the activity and stability in various catalytic applications, particularly in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
