[1] "The shale gas revolution has led to a new era of methane-to-organic chemicals renaissance."
[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate ethane or ethylene stages."
[3] "PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods, such as limited feedstock availability and high energy consumption, by utilizing readily available propane as a feedstock and potentially reducing the overall process steps."
[4] "This technology offers improved process efficiency and higher product selectivity, making it a competitive alternative for propylene production."
