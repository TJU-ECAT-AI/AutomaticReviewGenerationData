[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."
[2] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the former is costly and the latter is noxious. Moreover, both of them are prone to deactivate in a very short time."
[3] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH, which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[4] "Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH."
[5] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways. The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."
[6] "Dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
[7] "This study may open a new way to design and synthesize highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing abundant propane feedstocks efficiently, achieving high process selectivity, and producing propylene with minimal byproducts, unlike traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) that rely on scarce crude oil resources and produce a variety of hydrocarbons.

2. PDH technology stands out among novel catalyst systems for its cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic performance. Materials like zinc (Zn), tin (Sn), cobalt (Co), gallium (Ga), and carbon-based catalysts have been developed for PDH, offering alternatives to expensive and hazardous catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) typically used in conventional processes. Zinc-based catalysts, in particular, are considered promising due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and effectiveness in PDH reactions.

3. Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is viewed as the most effective method for propylene production. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and FCC, struggle to meet the growing market demand for propylene due to the depletion of crude oil reserves, which are the primary sources for these conventional production techniques. PDH offers a viable solution by utilizing readily available propane as a feedstock, thereby addressing the supply constraints of traditional methods.

4. Dealuminated β zeolite catalysts enhance PDH performance by suppressing side reactions through the absence of strong acid sites. This feature ensures high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and operational stability, making dealuminated β zeolite a valuable tool in the design of highly active PDH catalysts with desirable properties for commercial applications.

1. 烯丙直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中具有几个关键优势，能够解决传统生产方法面临的原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性等挑战。PDH技术通过有效利用丰富的丙烷原料、实现高过程选择性和减少副产物的产生，解决了传统方法如蒸汽裂化和流化床催化裂化（FCC）依赖稀缺石油资源、生产多种烃类化合物的问题。

2. PDH技术在新型催化剂系统中以其成本效益、环境友好性和高效催化性能脱颖而出。锌(Zn)、锡(Sn)、钴(Co)、镓(Ga)和碳基催化剂等材料已被开发用于PDH，作为铂(Pt)和铬氧化物(CrOx)这类传统过程中昂贵且有害催化剂的替代品。特别是锌基催化剂因其低成本、环保特性以及在PDH反应中的有效性而被认为极具前景。

3. 直接将丙烷脱氢为丙烯（PDH）被视为最有效的丙烯生产方法。传统的蒸汽裂化和FCC方法由于石油资源枯竭而难以满足日益增长的丙烯市场需求。PDH通过利用易得的丙烷作为原料提供了一个可行解决方案，从而解决了传统方法的供应约束问题。

4. 去铝β沸石催化剂提高了PDH性能，通过消除强酸位点抑制副反应，确保了高催化活性、丙烯选择性和操作稳定性。这使得去铝β沸石成为设计具有理想特性的高度活性PDH催化剂的新途径。
