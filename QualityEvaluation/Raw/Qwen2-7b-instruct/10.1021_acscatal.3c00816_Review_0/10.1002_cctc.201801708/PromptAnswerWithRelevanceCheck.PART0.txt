<quotes>
[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."
[2] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."
[3] "Traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious. Moreover, both of them are prone to deactivate in a very short time."
[4] "Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH."
[5] "However, active ZnO nanoclusters are very small and unstable, especially under harsh operation conditions."
[6] "Fortunately, zeolites can provide well-ordered pore structure, as well as steady and antacid conditions for dispersing and anchoring ZnO nanoclusters."
[7] "Moreover, the microporous zeolites are able to tailor the size of ZnO nanoclusters."
[8] "It has been reported the exchanged Zn2+ ions or Zn(OH)+ species in Al-containing zeolites are active for catalyzing PDH."
[9] "However, the decrease of Si/Zn ratio of 5.32 in Znβ-3 to 2.9 in Znβ-10 (TableS2) greatly improves the catalytic performance, suggesting the formed ZnO clusters are also catalytically active sites for PDH."
[10] "Directly loading Zn species on Hβ zeolite can cause a part of Zn species form bulk ZnO, which are inactive for PDH."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, a widely available and inexpensive feedstock, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods that often rely on scarce and expensive crude oil.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH bypasses the need for multiple processing steps typically required in traditional methods such as steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), thereby enhancing overall process efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers superior product selectivity, producing high-purity propylene with minimal byproducts or waste, unlike conventional methods that may produce a mix of hydrocarbons requiring additional separation processes.

4. **Economic Viability**: Given the price gap between propane and propylene, PDH is economically advantageous as it exploits the abundant supply of propane to produce a valuable commodity with high market demand.

5. **Environmental Benefits**: Zn-based catalysts, being cost-effective and environmentally friendly, offer a sustainable alternative to traditional catalysts like Pt and CrOx, which are costly and can be toxic or prone to deactivation.

6. **Catalyst Stability**: By using ZnO nanoclusters anchored in zeolite supports, the PDH process benefits from stable and highly active catalysts that maintain their effectiveness under harsh operating conditions, ensuring long-term productivity.

7. **Zeolite Utilization**: Zeolites, with their ordered pore structures and antacid properties, enable the precise control of ZnO nanocluster size, optimizing catalytic activity and stability.

8. **Active Sites**: The active ZnO clusters in zeolite supports, whether isolated Zn2+ ions or Zn(OH)+ species, contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance in PDH, demonstrating the potential of Zn-based materials in the industry.

9. **Improved Catalytic Performance**: Adjusting the Si/Zn ratio in zeolite supports leads to improved catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of the interaction between Zn species and the zeolite framework in PDH.

10. **Dispersed ZnO Clusters**: The use of zeolite supports facilitates the dispersion of ZnO clusters, preventing their aggregation and maintaining their catalytic potential, which is crucial for efficient PDH reactions.

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles these issues by utilizing abundant propane feedstocks efficiently, achieving high process selectivity, and producing propylene with minimal byproducts, unlike traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) that rely on scarce crude oil resources and produce a variety of hydrocarbons.

2. PDH technology stands out among novel catalyst systems for its cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and high catalytic performance. Materials like zinc (Zn), tin (Sn), cobalt (Co), gallium (Ga), and carbon-based catalysts have been developed for PDH, offering alternatives to expensive and hazardous catalysts like platinum (Pt) and chromium oxide (CrOx) typically used in conventional processes. Zinc-based catalysts, in particular, are considered promising due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and effectiveness in PDH reactions.

3. Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is viewed as the most effective method for propylene production. Traditional methods, such as steam cracking and FCC, struggle to meet the growing market demand for propylene due to the depletion of crude oil reserves, which are the primary sources for these conventional production techniques. PDH offers a viable solution by utilizing readily available propane as a feedstock, thereby addressing the supply constraints of traditional methods.

4. Dealuminated β zeolite catalysts enhance PDH performance by suppressing side reactions through the absence of strong acid sites. This feature ensures high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and operational stability, making dealuminated β zeolite a valuable tool in the design of highly active PDH catalysts with desirable properties for commercial applications.
