[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."
[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."
[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."
[4] "Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH."
[5] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious."
[6] "Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts."
[7] "It is reported that ZnO supported on Al2O3 could serve as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which can efficiently catalyze PDH."
[8] "Moreover, the issue of this kind of catalysts is that a large proportion of Zn species is prone to form macrocrystalline ZnO on the external zeolite surface, and thus SN ZnO with catalytic potential are hard to be obtained."
[9] "Therefore, it can be speculated that the dealuminated β zeolite as support might obtain highly-dispersed and small-sized ZnO species."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons:

1. Addressing feedstock availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane feedstock, which is cheaper compared to propylene. This addresses the challenge of limited and expensive propylene sources faced by traditional methods.

2. Enhancing process efficiency: PDH offers a more efficient process for propylene production compared to conventional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), which often suffer from lower propylene yields and energy inefficiencies.

3. Improving product selectivity: PDH provides high selectivity for propylene production, reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This is particularly advantageous over traditional methods that often require additional purification steps to isolate propylene from complex mixtures.

These advantages make PDH technology a significant advancement in propylene production, offering cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and environmental benefits compared to conventional methods.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是生产丙烯最具前景的方法，原因如下：

1. 解决原料供应问题：PDH利用丰富且成本低廉的丙烷作为原料，解决了传统方法面临的价格高昂、丙烯供应有限的问题。

2. 提高工艺效率：与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）等方法相比，PDH提供了更高效的丙烯生产过程，能有效提高丙烯的产率和能源利用效率。

3. 改善产品选择性：PDH在生产丙烯方面具有高选择性，能减少副产品的生成。相比之下，传统方法往往需要额外的精炼步骤来分离出纯净的丙烯。

这些优势使PDH技术成为丙烯生产领域的一项重大进步，相比传统方法，它提供了成本效益、高效性和环境友好性。
