In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources, which is particularly advantageous given the scarcity of petroleum, traditionally the primary source of propylene. This method exploits the price disparity between propane and propylene to economically produce propylene, making it a viable alternative for propylene production.

Compared to conventional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), PDH offers improved process efficiency and product selectivity. Traditional catalysts like Pt and CrOx-based catalysts are costly and potentially hazardous, whereas Zn-based materials emerge as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and highly efficient alternative for PDH. The utilization of Zn in PDH not only reduces costs but also ensures a sustainable production process.

Moreover, PDH benefits from the development of novel catalyst systems, including Zn, Sn, Co, Ga, and carbon-based catalysts, which mitigate the drawbacks of commercial CrOx and Pt-based catalysts. These catalysts enable efficient PDH reactions without the need for expensive metals or compromising on product purity. 

PDH technology leverages the ability of ZnO supported on Al2O3 to act as Lewis acid sites (LAS), enhancing the catalytic efficiency of PDH. Additionally, the use of dealuminated β zeolite as a support material ensures the absence of strong acid sites, significantly reducing unwanted side reactions and improving propylene selectivity. The Zn catalyst supported on dealuminated β zeolite demonstrates high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity, showcasing the effectiveness of PDH technology in propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为生产丙烯最具前景的方法。首先，PDH技术通过利用丰富的丙烷资源解决了原料供应问题，鉴于石油稀缺性导致丙烯需求难以满足，这一点尤为重要。这种方法利用丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差距经济地生产丙烯，使其成为丙烯生产的一个可行替代方案。

与传统的裂解方法如蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）相比，PDH在过程效率和产品选择性方面具有优势。传统催化剂如Pt和CrOx基催化剂既昂贵又可能有害，而Zn基材料作为PDH的低成本、环保且高效替代品，展现出巨大的潜力。利用Zn进行PDH不仅降低了成本，还确保了可持续的生产过程。

此外，PDH得益于新型催化剂体系的发展，包括Zn、Sn、Co、Ga和碳基催化剂，它们消除了商业CrOx和Pt基催化剂的缺点。这些催化剂使PDH反应得以有效进行，同时不牺牲产品的纯度。 

PDH技术利用了ZnO支持在Al2O3上作为Lewis酸中心的能力，提高了PDH的催化效率。此外，使用去铝β沸石作为支撑材料确保了不存在强酸中心，极大地减少了副反应并提高了丙烯选择性。在去铝β沸石上支持的Zn催化剂显示出高催化活性和出色的丙烯选择性，证明了PDH技术在丙烯生产中的有效性。
