[1] "The support and surrounding environment play a key role in the electronic state and catalytic performance of metal clusters and nanoparticles in metal-based catalysts."
[2] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[3] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[4] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."
[5] "This study provides a deep understanding of the effect of the surrounding zeolite framework on the catalytic performance of metal clusters, revealing that enclosing metal clusters in zeolites may not be beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions, deepening the understanding for this type of catalyst."

PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate stages, which enhances process efficiency. It also offers flexibility in feedstock use, as it can utilize a wider range of hydrocarbon sources, including naphtha, natural gas liquids, and refinery gases, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. Moreover, PDH technology improves product selectivity, leading to higher yields of propylene, which is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for this chemical in industries such as plastics manufacturing and petrochemical processing. The ability to optimize the catalytic performance of metal clusters within zeolitic frameworks, as demonstrated in this study, can further refine the PDH process, potentially leading to more efficient and selective propylene production. By manipulating the electronic state of the metal clusters through the surrounding zeolitic environment, researchers can enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst, which is essential for maintaining high yield and selectivity over extended operational periods.

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology directly converts propane to propylene without requiring expensive and scarce feedstocks like naphtha or ethane. This makes it more sustainable and potentially more accessible. Additionally, PDH offers higher process efficiency, as it typically involves fewer steps and energy-intensive operations compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, PDH enhances product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene with minimal byproducts, which aligns better with market demands for high-purity propylene.

2. The zeolitic framework around Pt clusters significantly modulates the d-band center, shifting it to a lower value. This negatively impacts the activation of propane, leading to a lower conversion rate of propane to propylene. The surrounding zeolite framework also restrains the desorption of propylene, which reduces its selectivity and increases coke deposition during the reaction. This demonstrates that the zeolitic environment around metal clusters in this type of structure might not be advantageous for certain specific catalytic reactions.

[1] "In conclusion, the significant passivation effect of the surrounding zeolitic framework on Pt clusters for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was clearly displayed for the first time. It was determined that the d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes propane as a direct feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, unlike traditional methods that rely on naphtha or other hydrocarbons. This makes PDH more flexible and responsive to market demands and price fluctuations.

2. PDH technology improves process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene, bypassing intermediate stages such as cracking. This reduces energy consumption and operational costs compared to conventional methods that involve multiple stages of refining and processing. Additionally, the direct conversion process minimizes the potential for degradation or loss of feedstock, leading to higher yields and more efficient use of resources.

3. PDH technology enhances product selectivity by optimizing the catalytic conditions to selectively convert propane into propylene, minimizing byproducts such as carbon dioxide or methane. This selective conversion results in a higher purity of propylene, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring high-purity propylene.

4. The study reveals that the surrounding zeolitic framework significantly affects the catalytic performance of Pt clusters for the dehydrogenation of propane. The passivation effect on the d-band center of the Pt clusters decreases their activation ability for propane, thereby reducing the selectivity for propylene and increasing coke deposition. This highlights that the zeolitic environment surrounding metal clusters can have detrimental effects on specific catalytic reactions, providing deeper insights into the design and optimization of such catalysts.

In the context of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, the document highlights several key advantages and specific improvements over conventional methods. Firstly, the use of Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite (X-zeolite) in the Pt/NaX catalyst shows a remarkable 1100% increase in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly enhanced selectivity for propylene production compared to a similar catalyst where the Pt clusters were trapped inside the zeolite. This suggests that the arrangement of Pt clusters outside the zeolite improves the catalytic efficiency and product quality for PDH. Secondly, the document notes that the Pt/NaX catalyst exhibits less coke deposition and maintains high stability after 18 hours of reaction, indicating improved operational reliability and reduced side reactions. Lastly, the document explains that the surrounding zeolitic framework negatively impacts the Pt clusters, shifting their d-band center to a lower value, which impedes the activation of propane and thus prevents the efficient desorption of propylene, thereby lowering propylene selectivity and increasing coke formation. These findings suggest that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of catalyst design may not be advantageous for specific catalytic reactions, offering deeper insights into the design and application of metal-based catalysts in PDH processes.
