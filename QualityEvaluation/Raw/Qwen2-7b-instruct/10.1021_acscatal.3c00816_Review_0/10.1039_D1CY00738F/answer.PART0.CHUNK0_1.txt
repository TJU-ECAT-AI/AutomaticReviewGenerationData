[1] "In this type of catalyst, the catalytic performance of metal clusters can be promoted by the zeolitic environment, such as the surrounding zeolitic framework can protect the active sites against sintering and poisoning,1315 and also endows the metal species shape selectivity based on the size of the zeolitic cages.1618"
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "The Pt species in Pt@NaX showed a white line with the highest intensity among these samples. This result indicates that the Pt species in Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX are electron deficient, and the Pt species in Pt@NaX art the more electron-deficient Ptδ++ than Ptδ+ over Pt/NaX for charge compensation in the negative 3D grids of the X-zeolite."
[4] "This study provides a deep understanding of the effect of the surrounding zeolite framework on the catalytic performance of metal clusters, revealing that enclosing metal clusters in zeolites may not be beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions, and deeps the understanding for this type of catalyst."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology directly converts propane to propylene without requiring expensive and scarce feedstocks like naphtha or ethane. This makes it more sustainable and potentially more accessible. Additionally, PDH offers higher process efficiency, as it typically involves fewer steps and energy-intensive operations compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, PDH enhances product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene with minimal byproducts, which aligns better with market demands for high-purity propylene.

2. The zeolitic framework around Pt clusters significantly modulates the d-band center, shifting it to a lower value. This negatively impacts the activation of propane, leading to a lower conversion rate of propane to propylene. The surrounding zeolite framework also restrains the desorption of propylene, which reduces its selectivity and increases coke deposition during the reaction. This demonstrates that the zeolitic environment around metal clusters in this type of structure might not be advantageous for certain specific catalytic reactions.

1. 烷基直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势包括解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，如原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性。PDH技术可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需昂贵且稀缺的原料，如石脑油或乙烷，这使其更具可持续性和潜在可获取性。此外，PDH提供了更高的工艺效率，通常涉及更少的步骤和能量密集型操作，与传统的传统方法相比。此外，PDH提高了产品选择性，确保了高纯度丙烯的较高产率，几乎没有副产品，这更好地符合市场对高纯度丙烯的需求。

2. 周围的沸石框架显着调节铂簇的d带中心，将其移动到较低值。这不利于丙烷的活化，导致丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率降低。周围的沸石骨架也限制了丙烯的脱附，这降低了其选择性并增加了反应期间的焦炭沉积。这表明这种结构中金属簇周围沸石环境可能不适合某些特定的催化反应。
