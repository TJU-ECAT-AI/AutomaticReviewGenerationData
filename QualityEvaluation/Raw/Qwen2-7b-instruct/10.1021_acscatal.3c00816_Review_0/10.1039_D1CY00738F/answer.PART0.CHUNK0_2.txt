[1] "In conclusion, the significant passivation effect of the surrounding zeolitic framework on Pt clusters for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was clearly displayed for the first time. It was determined that the d-band center of the Pt clusters confined in the zeolite are significantly modulated by the surrounding negative framework of the zeolite to a lower value and the Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane. The zeolitic framework surrounding the enclosed Pt clusters suppressed the desorption of propylene, reducing its selectivity and increasing the deposition of coke during the reaction."

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. PDH technology specifically addresses challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By utilizing propane as a feedstock, PDH technology ensures a stable supply of raw material, as propane is widely available and easy to transport. This contrasts with traditional methods that might rely on more volatile or less accessible feedstocks. 

In terms of process efficiency, PDH technology offers a streamlined approach to producing propylene, potentially reducing energy consumption and operational costs compared to conventional methods. The direct conversion of propane to propylene eliminates intermediate steps, leading to a more efficient use of resources and a lower environmental impact.

Regarding product selectivity, PDH technology is designed to optimize the yield of propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts such as coke. This selective catalytic process ensures a higher purity of propylene, which is crucial for applications requiring high-quality propylene, such as in the petrochemical industry. The passivation effect of the surrounding zeolitic framework on Pt clusters plays a critical role in enhancing the selectivity for propylene production, thereby improving the overall efficiency and environmental sustainability of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势在于其能够解决传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战。PDH技术特别针对与原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性相关的问题。通过利用丙烷作为原料，PDH技术确保了稳定的原材料供应，因为丙烷广泛可用且易于运输。这与依赖更不稳定或难以获取的原料的传统方法形成对比。

在过程效率方面，PDH技术提供了一种更加高效的方法来生产丙烯，可能降低了能源消耗和运营成本，与传统方法相比。直接将丙烷转化为丙烯消除了中间步骤，从而更有效地利用资源并降低环境影响。

关于产品选择性，PDH技术旨在优化丙烯的产出，最大限度地减少副产品的生成，如焦炭。这种选择性的催化过程确保了丙烯的高纯度，这对于需要高质量丙烯的应用（如石化工业）至关重要。周围沸石框架对铂簇的钝化效果在提高丙烯生产选择性方面发挥着关键作用，从而提高了PDH过程的整体效率和环境可持续性。
