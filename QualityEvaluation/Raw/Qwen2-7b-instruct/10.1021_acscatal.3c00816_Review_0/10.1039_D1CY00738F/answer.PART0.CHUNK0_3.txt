[1] "In this type of catalyst, the catalytic performance of metal clusters can be promoted by the zeolitic environment, such as the surrounding zeolitic framework can protect the active sites against sintering and poisoning,1315 and also endows the metal species shape selectivity based on the size of the zeolitic cages.1618"
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."
[4] "It was found that the different locations of the Pt clusters on the zeolite led to tremendous differences in their catalytic performance."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes propane as a direct feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, unlike traditional methods that rely on naphtha or other hydrocarbons. This makes PDH more flexible and responsive to market demands and price fluctuations.

2. PDH technology improves process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene, bypassing intermediate stages such as cracking. This reduces energy consumption and operational costs compared to conventional methods that involve multiple stages of refining and processing. Additionally, the direct conversion process minimizes the potential for degradation or loss of feedstock, leading to higher yields and more efficient use of resources.

3. PDH technology enhances product selectivity by optimizing the catalytic conditions to selectively convert propane into propylene, minimizing byproducts such as carbon dioxide or methane. This selective conversion results in a higher purity of propylene, which is crucial for downstream applications requiring high-purity propylene.

4. The study reveals that the surrounding zeolitic framework significantly affects the catalytic performance of Pt clusters for the dehydrogenation of propane. The passivation effect on the d-band center of the Pt clusters decreases their activation ability for propane, thereby reducing the selectivity for propylene and increasing coke deposition. This highlights that the zeolitic environment surrounding metal clusters can have detrimental effects on specific catalytic reactions, providing deeper insights into the design and optimization of such catalysts.
