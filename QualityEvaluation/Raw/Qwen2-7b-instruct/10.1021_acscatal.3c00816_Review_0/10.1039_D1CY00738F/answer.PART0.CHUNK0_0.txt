[1] "The support and surrounding environment play a key role in the electronic state and catalytic performance of metal clusters and nanoparticles in metal-based catalysts."
[2] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[3] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[4] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."
[5] "This study provides a deep understanding of the effect of the surrounding zeolite framework on the catalytic performance of metal clusters, revealing that enclosing metal clusters in zeolites may not be beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions, deepening the understanding for this type of catalyst."

In the context of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include its potential to address challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate stages, which enhances process efficiency. It also offers flexibility in feedstock use, as it can utilize a wider range of hydrocarbon sources, including naphtha, natural gas liquids, and refinery gases, addressing the issue of feedstock availability. Moreover, PDH technology improves product selectivity, leading to higher yields of propylene, which is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for this chemical in industries such as plastics manufacturing and petrochemical processing. The ability to optimize the catalytic performance of metal clusters within zeolitic frameworks, as demonstrated in this study, can further refine the PDH process, potentially leading to more efficient and selective propylene production. By manipulating the electronic state of the metal clusters through the surrounding zeolitic environment, researchers can enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst, which is essential for maintaining high yield and selectivity over extended operational periods.
