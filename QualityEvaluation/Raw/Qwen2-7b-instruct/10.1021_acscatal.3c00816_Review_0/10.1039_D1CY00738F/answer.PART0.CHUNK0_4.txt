[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "The surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."
[4] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."

In the context of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, the document highlights several key advantages and specific improvements over conventional methods. Firstly, the use of Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite (X-zeolite) in the Pt/NaX catalyst shows a remarkable 1100% increase in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly enhanced selectivity for propylene production compared to a similar catalyst where the Pt clusters were trapped inside the zeolite. This suggests that the arrangement of Pt clusters outside the zeolite improves the catalytic efficiency and product quality for PDH. Secondly, the document notes that the Pt/NaX catalyst exhibits less coke deposition and maintains high stability after 18 hours of reaction, indicating improved operational reliability and reduced side reactions. Lastly, the document explains that the surrounding zeolitic framework negatively impacts the Pt clusters, shifting their d-band center to a lower value, which impedes the activation of propane and thus prevents the efficient desorption of propylene, thereby lowering propylene selectivity and increasing coke formation. These findings suggest that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of catalyst design may not be advantageous for specific catalytic reactions, offering deeper insights into the design and application of metal-based catalysts in PDH processes.

在丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的背景下，文献强调了几个关键优势和对传统方法的具体改进。首先，在Pt/NaX催化剂中使用位于X沸石外部的Pt簇，与类似催化剂相比，其中的Pt簇被困在X沸石内部，显示了TOF提高1100%和显著提高了丙烯产率的选择性。这表明，Pt簇在外部的布置可以提高PDH过程的催化效率和产品质量。其次，文献指出，Pt/NaX催化剂表现出较少的焦炭沉积，并在18小时的反应后保持高稳定性，表明操作可靠性提高并减少了副反应。最后，文献解释说，围绕着金属簇的沸石框架对Pt簇产生了负面影响，使它们的d能级中心向更低值移动，阻碍了丙烷的激活并阻止了丙烯的有效脱附，从而降低了丙烯选择性和增加了焦炭形成。这些发现表明，这种类型催化剂设计中周围沸石环境中的金属簇可能不利于某些特定催化反应，提供了对PDH过程中基于金属催化剂设计的更深入理解。
