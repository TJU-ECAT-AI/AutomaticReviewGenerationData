[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), employing Pt- or Cr-based catalysts, represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production."
[2] "However, the scarcity of platinum and the environmental toxicity of chromium remain key drawbacks of the current commercial PDH catalysts, which trigger great interest in exploring alternative non-noble metal and environment-friendly active components for PDH catalysts."
[3] "Zeolites are commonly used as support materials and their well-ordered porous structure enables the efficient stabilization as well as the good distribution of zinc species."
[4] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions."
[5] "Typically, propylene STY of 24 and selectivity of 97% can be achieved at 853 K, demonstrating the great potential of such catalyst for industrial PDH process."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily accessible and abundant resource. Secondly, PDH technology enhances process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene, bypassing intermediate steps typically found in competing production routes. Lastly, PDH offers superior product selectivity, yielding propylene with minimal byproducts, which improves economic viability and reduces environmental impact compared to traditional methods that often involve more complex and less selective processes.
