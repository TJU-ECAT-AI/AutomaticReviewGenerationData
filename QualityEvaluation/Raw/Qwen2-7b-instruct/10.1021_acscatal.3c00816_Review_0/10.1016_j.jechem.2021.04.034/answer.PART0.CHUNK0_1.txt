[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), employing Pt- or Cr-based catalysts, represents an emerging industrial route for propylene production."
[2] "Due to the scarcity of platinum and the environmental toxicity of chromium, alternative PDH catalysts are being pursued."
[3] "Zinc, an earth-abundant (75 ppm in crust) and non-toxic metal, has been investigated as a promising promoter in Pt-based PDH catalysts."
[4] "However, the scarcity of platinum and the environmental toxicity of chromium remain key drawbacks of the current commercial PDH catalysts, which trigger great interest in exploring alternative non-noble metal and environment-friendly active components for PDH catalysts."
[5] "Typically, propylene STY of 24 and selectivity of 97% can be achieved at 853 K, demonstrating the great potential of such catalyst for industrial PDH process."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers an alternative route for propylene production that does not rely on scarce or environmentally toxic metals like platinum and chromium. This makes PDH a promising method for propylene production, especially considering the growing global demand for propylene. By utilizing earth-abundant metals like zinc, PDH can offer a cost-effective, sustainable, and efficient process for propylene production.

2. The PDH process using zinc-containing zeolite catalysts achieves a propylene STY of 24 and selectivity of 97% at 853 K, showcasing the industrial potential of this method. This high STY and selectivity indicate that the PDH process can be highly efficient, producing propylene with minimal waste products and energy usage.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于其能够解决传统生产方法面临的主要挑战，特别是在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面。PDH为丙烯生产提供了一条替代途径，无需依赖稀缺或环境有害的金属如铂和铬。这使得PDH成为丙烯生产的一个有前景的方法，尤其是在全球对丙烯需求日益增长的情况下。通过利用地球丰富的金属如锌，PDH可以提供一个成本效益高、可持续性和高效性的丙烯生产过程。

2. 使用含锌沸石催化剂的PDH过程在853 K时可达到24的丙烯时空产率（STY）和97%的选择性，这表明该方法具有工业应用潜力。这种高的STY和选择性表明，PDH过程可以高度有效，产生丙烯的同时产生极少的副产品和能源消耗。
