1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers an alternative route to produce propylene without the need for petroleum-based feedstocks, which is crucial given the scarcity of platinum and the environmental concerns associated with chromium. Earth-abundant metals like zinc, which are non-toxic, are being explored as viable alternatives to precious metals in PDH catalysts, thus improving sustainability and reducing costs. Zeolites, with their well-ordered porous structures, enable efficient stabilization and distribution of zinc species, enhancing the catalyst's performance. The Zn@S-1 catalysts developed in this study demonstrate high dehydrogenation activity, excellent propylene selectivity, and robust regeneration capabilities, indicating their potential for commercial PDH processes. At an operating temperature of 853 K, these catalysts can achieve a propylene spacetime yield (STY) of 24 and a selectivity of 97%, showcasing their industrial viability.
