The synthesis of nano-flower sheet-like Al2O3 with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active sites of Ru-CeOx, thereby enhancing the performance of propane total oxidation. The presence of Al3+penta in NF-Al2O3 stabilizes the electronic valence state of Ru, contributing to the better propane total oxidation performance. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of propane total oxidation over Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 follows the Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, involving two distinct reaction pathways.

合成具有丰富未饱和五配位Al3+的纳米花状Al2O3在稳定Ru-CeOx活性位点中起关键作用，从而提高了丙烷总氧化性能。NF-Al2O3中的Al3+penta稳定了Ru的电子价态，有助于提高丙烷总氧化性能。此外，丙烷总氧化过程在Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3上遵循Mars-van-Krevelen（MvK）机制，涉及两种不同的反应途径。
