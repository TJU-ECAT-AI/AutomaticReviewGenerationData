1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the conversion of propane into propylene, which is a more valuable chemical product. Unlike conventional methods, PDH does not require heavy oil as a feedstock, which is scarce and often expensive. This makes PDH a more sustainable and cost-effective option.

2. Nano-flower sheet-like alumina spheres (NF-Al2O3) with rich unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites were synthesized. These spheres were used to stabilize ruthenium-ceria (Ru-CeOx) active sites, enhancing the propane total oxidation performance of the catalyst. The presence of Al3+penta sites in NF-Al2O3 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the electronic valence state of Ru, contributing to the superior performance of the catalyst.

3. The Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst showed enhanced performance in the total oxidation of propane, demonstrating that the design of NF-Al2O3 with rich Al3+penta sites is beneficial for the stabilization of active sites and improving the catalytic activity.

4. The introduction of Al3+penta sites in NF-Al2O3 supports the dispersion of ruthenium species, which is essential for maintaining the electronic valence state of Ru0. This is critical for the catalytic activity of the Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 system.

5. The total oxidation of propane over the Ru-CeOx/NF-Al2O3 catalyst conformed to the Mars-van-Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which is a well-established theoretical framework for understanding the oxidative degradation of organic compounds. This mechanism describes the sequential formation and consumption of various reactive intermediates during the oxidation process.
