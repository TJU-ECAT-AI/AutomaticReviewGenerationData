[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1] ."
[2] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3],[4] ."
[3] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [4] ,[5] ,[6] . Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns."
[4] "On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5] ."
[5] "High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."
[6] "Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives."
[7] "Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [5] ,[7] ,[8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ."
[8] "Isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2 were also reported to be active in the PDH reaction [16] ,[17] ,[18] ."
[9] "In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 [20] ."
[10] "In comparison with usually applied supported materials, surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) were suggested to play an important role in alkane dehydrogenation over the above unconventional catalysts."
[11] "We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20] ."
[12] "Further comprehensive studies are required to prove the dehydrogenation role of Zrcus and to understand how its concentration can be tuned to affect the catalyst activity."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on naphtha steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions, which struggle to meet the continuously increasing demand for propylene. PDH, on the other hand, offers an alternative route that is particularly advantageous. 

Secondly, PDH utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This contrasts with the need for specific types of crude oil fractions in traditional processes, which can be limited by regional availability. 

Thirdly, PDH processes are designed to be highly efficient, capable of producing propylene directly from propane without the need for additional conversion steps. This reduces energy consumption and enhances overall process efficiency.

Fourthly, PDH processes can offer better product selectivity compared to conventional methods. The ability to directly produce propylene from propane allows for a more precise control over the final product quality and purity.

Finally, PDH processes can potentially offer economic advantages due to lower capital costs and operational simplicity. By avoiding the need for expensive upgrading steps and the use of potentially hazardous catalysts, PDH can reduce both upfront investment and ongoing operating expenses.

The key advantages of PDH technology in addressing these challenges include its reliance on abundant feedstocks, enhanced efficiency, improved selectivity, and potential cost savings. These attributes make PDH a compelling choice for propylene production in today's dynamic petrochemical market.
