[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production."
[2] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[3] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts."
[4] "Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns."
[5] "On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly."
[6] "High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."
[7] "Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates."
[8] "Isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2 were also reported to be active in the PDH reaction."
[9] "In comparison with usually applied supported materials, surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) were suggested to play an important role in alkane dehydrogenation over the above unconventional catalysts."
[10] "Reductibility of ZrO2 can also be improved when depositing hydrogenation-active metals on the surface of zirconia."
[11] "Further comprehensive studies are required to prove the dehydrogenation role of Zrcus and to understand how its concentration can be tuned to affect the catalyst activity."
[12] "In particular, we focused on (i) the kind of catalytically active sites as well as (ii) factors affecting their formation and, in particular, activity."
[13] "To investigate the effect of dopant on catalytic activity, ZrO2 was promoted by either La2O3 or Y2O3."
[14] "Finally, the catalysts were tested under alternating C3H8 and O2 feeds in the temperature range from 550 to 625 C to check their activity, selectivity, and durability in comparison with an industrially relevant K-CrOx/Al2O3 material."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods are:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology does not rely on scarce resources like ethylene and 2-butenes, which are typically derived from petrochemical sources. Instead, it uses propane, a widely available feedstock. This ensures a more sustainable and abundant supply chain.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a streamlined process for producing propylene, potentially reducing energy consumption and costs compared to conventional methods. The direct conversion of propane to propylene avoids the need for complex secondary reactions and purification steps.

3. **Product Selectivity**: By focusing solely on propane, PDH technology can produce propylene with high selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This enhances the purity of the final product, which is crucial for polymer manufacturing.

4. **Environmental Considerations**: While Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly, PDH technology has the potential to offer an even cleaner production route. By avoiding the use of toxic Cr-containing compounds and optimizing the use of catalysts, PDH can reduce environmental impact and comply with stricter regulations on chemical production.

5. **Cost Efficiency**: Although Pt is expensive, PDH technology can leverage alternative catalyst materials like GaOx, VOx, or InOx, which are cost-effective and suitable for large-scale production. Additionally, the use of ZrO2-based catalysts with dopants like La2O3 or Y2O3 can enhance activity and selectivity, potentially lowering overall costs.

6. **Durability and Stability**: PDH catalysts, especially those based on ZrO2, demonstrate high activity and durability, allowing for continuous operation and minimal degradation over time. This reduces maintenance costs and downtime, contributing to a more efficient and reliable production process.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising method for propylene production, offering a sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional processes.

针对传统生产方法面临的挑战，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势如下：

1. **原料供应**：PDH技术不依赖稀缺资源如乙烯和2-丁烯，这些通常来源于石油化学来源。相反，它使用广泛可用的原料丙烷。这确保了更可持续且充足的供应链。

2. **过程效率**：PDH提供了生产丙烯的高效流程，可能与传统方法相比减少能源消耗和成本。通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了复杂二次反应和精炼步骤，提高了流程效率。

3. **产品选择性**：专注于丙烷，PDH技术可以高选择性地生产丙烯，最大限度地减少副产品的形成。这对于聚合物制造至关重要，因为需要高度纯净的产品。

4. **环境考虑**：虽然Pt基催化剂是环境友好的，但PDH技术有可能提供更清洁的生产途径。通过避免使用毒性Cr化合物并优化催化剂的使用，PDH可以减少环境影响，并符合更严格的化学品生产法规。

5. **成本效益**：尽管Pt昂贵，但PDH技术可以利用像GaOx、VOx或InOx这样的低成本替代催化剂材料。此外，基于ZrO2的催化剂，通过添加La2O3或Y2O3等掺杂剂，可以增强活性和选择性，从而降低整体成本。

6. **耐用性和稳定性**：PDH催化剂，尤其是基于ZrO2的催化剂，显示出高活性和耐久性，允许连续运行且随着时间的推移最小化降解。这减少了维护成本和停机时间，有助于提高生产过程的效率和可靠性。

这些优势共同使PDH技术成为丙烯生产的一个有前景的方法，提供了一种可持续、高效且环境友好的替代传统工艺的选择。
