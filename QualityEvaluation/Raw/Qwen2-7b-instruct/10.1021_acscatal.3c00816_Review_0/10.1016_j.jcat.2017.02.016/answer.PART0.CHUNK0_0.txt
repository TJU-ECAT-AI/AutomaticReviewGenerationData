[3] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3],[4]."

[12] "The metals were not assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2."
[13] "High activity, selectivity, and durability of our catalysts were verified by comparing their performance under industrially relevant conditions with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material in a series of 60 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550, 600, and 625 C."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane to propylene without the need for cracking processes that rely on naphtha or heavy oil fractions, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability. Secondly, PDH offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods. Additionally, PDH avoids the use of toxic chromium compounds, unlike conventional methods, making it more environmentally friendly. While platinum-based catalysts are effective, their high cost poses a significant drawback. To tackle these issues, research groups have explored alternative catalysts such as gallium oxide (GaOx), vanadium oxide (VOx), indium oxide (InOx), and surface ions of zinc (Zn2+), cobalt (Co2+), and iron (Fe2+) on silicon dioxide (SiO2). These alternatives have shown promise in PDH reactions. In particular, zirconia (ZrO2) promoted with lanthanum oxide (La2O3) has been found to enhance PDH activity when combined with hydrogenation-active metals like ruthenium (Ru), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co). The metals do not directly contribute to activity but rather increase the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) through reduction of ZrO2. The enhanced catalysts demonstrated high activity, selectivity, and durability, comparable to a conventional chromium oxide-alumina (K-CrOx/Al2O3) reference material, as evidenced by their performance in industrial conditions across multiple cycles at varying temperatures.

面对全球聚丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术凭借其独特优势成为最有可能实现大规模生产丙烯的方法。首先，PDH能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需依赖石脑油或重质油馏分的裂解过程，有效解决了原料供应的挑战。其次，PDH在工艺效率和产品选择性方面相比传统方法具有更高的优势。此外，PDH避免了使用对健康和环境有害的铬化合物，使其比常规方法更加环保。虽然铂基催化剂效果显著，但其高昂的成本是一个重要缺点。为解决这些问题，研究小组探索了替代催化剂，如镓氧化物（GaOx）、钒氧化物（VOx）、铟氧化物（InOx）以及硅氧化物（SiO2）表面的锌（Zn2+）、钴（Co2+）和铁（Fe2+）。这些替代品在PDH反应中表现出潜力。特别是，通过镧氧化物（La2O3）促进的氧化锆（ZrO2）与氢化活性金属如钌（Ru）、铜（Cu）、镍（Ni）和钴（Co）结合时，PDH活性得到了增强。这些金属并非直接贡献于活性，而是通过减少ZrO2来增加表面络合不饱和锆离子（Zrcus）的浓度。增强的催化剂显示出高活性、高选择性和耐久性，在工业条件下，其性能与一种典型的钾-铬氧化物-氧化铝（K-CrOx/Al2O3）参考材料相当，这体现在它们在不同温度下的多次循环测试中。
