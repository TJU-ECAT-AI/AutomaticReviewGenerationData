    "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1] . The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2] . Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] ,[4] ."

    "From a structural viewpoint, such surface sites are located at anion vacancies. The latter can be created upon doping of ZrO2 with oxides of metal with oxidation state of lower than 4+ as a result of charge compensation [21] ."

    "It is also well known that the ability of dopants for the substitution of Zr cations and formation of homogeneous binary solid solutions strongly depend on the ionic radius of dopant metal cation, which should be close to that of Zr4+ (0.79 Å)."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production. It is designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for high-temperature oxidation reactions, making it a safer and potentially more environmentally friendly option compared to traditional methods. Additionally, PDH allows for on-purpose large-scale production, ensuring a steady supply of propylene that meets the continuously increasing demand.

2. PDH technology addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in several ways. First, it tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available. This contrasts with conventional methods that often require expensive and scarce resources like naphtha or heavy oil fractions. Furthermore, PDH enhances process efficiency by providing a streamlined, single-step conversion process, reducing the complexity and cost associated with multiple stages of refining. Lastly, in terms of product selectivity, PDH is designed to maximize propylene yield, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as ethylene, which can occur in competing processes.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中提供了几个关键优势。它旨在通过无需高温氧化反应高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，使其相对于传统方法更安全且可能更加环保。此外，PDH允许进行目的性大规模生产，确保了满足不断增长需求的稳定丙烯供应。

2. PDH技术通过几种方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。首先，它解决了原料可用性问题，以丙烷为主要原料，该原料丰富且易于获取。这与传统方法需要昂贵且稀缺资源如石脑油或重油碎片形成鲜明对比。此外，PDH通过提供一个简化的一步转化过程提高了工艺效率，减少了复杂性和成本。最后，在产品选择性方面，PDH设计用于最大化丙烯产量，同时减少在竞争过程中产生的不希望的副产物，如乙烯，其产生量可能会超出预期。
