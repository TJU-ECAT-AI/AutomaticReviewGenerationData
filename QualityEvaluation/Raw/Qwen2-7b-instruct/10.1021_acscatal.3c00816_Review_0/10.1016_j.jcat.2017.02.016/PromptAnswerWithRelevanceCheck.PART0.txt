In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, PDH directly converts propane to propylene without the need for cracking processes that rely on naphtha or heavy oil fractions, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability. Secondly, PDH offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods. Additionally, PDH avoids the use of toxic chromium compounds, unlike conventional methods, making it more environmentally friendly. While platinum-based catalysts are effective, their high cost poses a significant drawback. To tackle these issues, research groups have explored alternative catalysts such as gallium oxide (GaOx), vanadium oxide (VOx), indium oxide (InOx), and surface ions of zinc (Zn2+), cobalt (Co2+), and iron (Fe2+) on silicon dioxide (SiO2). These alternatives have shown promise in PDH reactions. In particular, zirconia (ZrO2) promoted with lanthanum oxide (La2O3) has been found to enhance PDH activity when combined with hydrogenation-active metals like ruthenium (Ru), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co). The metals do not directly contribute to activity but rather increase the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) through reduction of ZrO2. The enhanced catalysts demonstrated high activity, selectivity, and durability, comparable to a conventional chromium oxide-alumina (K-CrOx/Al2O3) reference material, as evidenced by their performance in industrial conditions across multiple cycles at varying temperatures.

[ZrO2-based unconventional catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation: Factors determining catalytic activity]

Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3],[4].

Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5].

Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [5],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15]. Isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2 were also reported to be active in the PDH reaction [16],[17],[18].

In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 [20]. In comparison with usually applied supported materials, surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) were suggested to play an important role in alkane dehydrogenation over the above unconventional catalysts. We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20]. The metals were not assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2.

Answer: The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods include:

1. Environmental friendliness: Unlike Cr-containing compounds, PDH processes using Pt-based catalysts do not pose significant health and environmental concerns, as Pt catalysts are environmentally friendly.

2. Improved dispersion of Pt species: Pt-based catalysts require treatment under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits to ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is crucial for high activity and selectivity. 

3. Development of alternative catalysts: Research groups in industry and academia have developed alternative catalysts containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species, as well as isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2, to overcome the limitations of conventional catalysts.

4. Use of ZrO2-based unconventional catalysts: The introduction of alternative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, such as Al2O3 and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3, has suggested that surface defects like coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) play a significant role in alkane dehydrogenation. These unconventional catalysts offer potential improvements in activity and selectivity compared to traditionally used materials.

These advantages highlight PDH technology's potential to provide a sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the limitations of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on naphtha steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions, which struggle to meet the continuously increasing demand for propylene. PDH, on the other hand, offers an alternative route that is particularly advantageous. 

Secondly, PDH utilizes propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This contrasts with the need for specific types of crude oil fractions in traditional processes, which can be limited by regional availability. 

Thirdly, PDH processes are designed to be highly efficient, capable of producing propylene directly from propane without the need for additional conversion steps. This reduces energy consumption and enhances overall process efficiency.

Fourthly, PDH processes can offer better product selectivity compared to conventional methods. The ability to directly produce propylene from propane allows for a more precise control over the final product quality and purity.

Finally, PDH processes can potentially offer economic advantages due to lower capital costs and operational simplicity. By avoiding the need for expensive upgrading steps and the use of potentially hazardous catalysts, PDH can reduce both upfront investment and ongoing operating expenses.

The key advantages of PDH technology in addressing these challenges include its reliance on abundant feedstocks, enhanced efficiency, improved selectivity, and potential cost savings. These attributes make PDH a compelling choice for propylene production in today's dynamic petrochemical market.
