[ZrO2-based unconventional catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation: Factors determining catalytic activity]

Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3],[4].

Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5].

Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [5],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15]. Isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2 were also reported to be active in the PDH reaction [16],[17],[18].

In our recent short communications, we introduced alternative type of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, which have typically been used as supports, i.e. Al2O3 [19] and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 [20]. In comparison with usually applied supported materials, surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) were suggested to play an important role in alkane dehydrogenation over the above unconventional catalysts. We also reported that PDH activity of ZrO2 promoted with La2O3 could be increased after depositing hydrogenation-active metals such as Ru, Cu, Ni, and Co [20]. The metals were not assumed to be directly responsible for the increase in the activity but helped to increase the concentration of Zrcus sites through reaction-induced reduction of ZrO2.

Answer: The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods include:

1. Environmental friendliness: Unlike Cr-containing compounds, PDH processes using Pt-based catalysts do not pose significant health and environmental concerns, as Pt catalysts are environmentally friendly.

2. Improved dispersion of Pt species: Pt-based catalysts require treatment under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits to ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is crucial for high activity and selectivity. 

3. Development of alternative catalysts: Research groups in industry and academia have developed alternative catalysts containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species, as well as isolated ions of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ on the surface of SiO2, to overcome the limitations of conventional catalysts.

4. Use of ZrO2-based unconventional catalysts: The introduction of alternative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, such as Al2O3 and ZrO2 promoted with La2O3, has suggested that surface defects like coordinatively unsaturated surface metal cations (Alcus or Zrcus) play a significant role in alkane dehydrogenation. These unconventional catalysts offer potential improvements in activity and selectivity compared to traditionally used materials.

These advantages highlight PDH technology's potential to provide a sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the limitations of conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

回答：丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战方面的关键优势包括：

1. 环境友好性：与含Cr化合物相比，使用Pt基催化剂的PDH过程不会引发显著的健康和环境问题，因为Pt催化剂是环境友好的。

2. Pt物种的改进分散：Pt基催化剂需要在去除碳沉积物后在氯气气氛下处理以确保Pt物种的高分散，这对活性和选择性至关重要。

3. 开发替代催化剂：工业和学术界的研究小组已开发出替代催化剂，包括支持的GaOx、VOx或InOx物种，以及表面SiO2上的孤立Zn2+、Co2+或Fe2+离子，以克服传统催化剂的局限性。

4. 使用ZrO2基非传统催化剂：通过引入其他类型的烷烃脱氢催化剂，如Al2O3和La2O3促进的ZrO2，表明表面缺陷如协调不饱和表面金属离子（Alcus或Zrcus）在烷烃脱氢中扮演重要角色。这些非传统的催化剂可能与传统材料相比提供改善的活性和选择性。

这些优势凸显了PDH技术提供可持续、高效和选择性的丙烯生产方法的潜力，从而解决了传统方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的问题。
