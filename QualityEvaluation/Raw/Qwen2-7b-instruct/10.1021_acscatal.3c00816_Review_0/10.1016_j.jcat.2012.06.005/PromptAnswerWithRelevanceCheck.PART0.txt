Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out for its potential to efficiently produce propylene from propane, addressing several key challenges faced by traditional production methods. Its main advantages include:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and widely available as a natural byproduct of natural gas processing and as a refined petrochemical feedstock. This makes PDH a more sustainable alternative to traditional methods that often rely on crude oil, which is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a higher energy efficiency compared to traditional methods. It requires lower energy inputs for propylene production, making it potentially more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. The process can be optimized to reduce waste and improve yield, enhancing overall efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology enables high selectivity towards propylene, minimizing the formation of byproducts like carbon deposits and other unwanted chemicals. This results in a cleaner process with fewer emissions and easier separation of propylene from other products, improving purity and reducing environmental impact.

4. **Flexibility and Scalability**: PDH plants can be designed to adapt to varying feedstock qualities and volumes, offering flexibility in operation and scalability to meet fluctuating demand. This is particularly advantageous in regions where natural gas resources are abundant and easily accessible.

5. **Economic Viability**: With advancements in catalyst technology and process optimization, PDH has the potential to become economically competitive with traditional methods, especially as the cost of renewable energy sources decreases and feedstock prices stabilize.

In summary, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing a sustainable, efficient, and flexible method for propylene production that is well-suited to current and future market demands.

[2] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature. This approach, however, suffers from the low olefin selectivity at industrially relevant alkane conversions due to successive propene oxidation to carbon oxides."

[3] "Vanadium-based catalysts were also studied in DH of C3C4 alkanes in the absence of gas-phase O2 [22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] . Under such conditions, the alkanes were oxidatively dehydrogenated with participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species."

[4] "Compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts used in [22] ,[23] ,[26] for DH of butanes, significantly lower amount of coke was formed. Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 3060 min for VOx/Al2O3."

[5] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."

Answer: The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is widely accessible and abundant. Unlike traditional processes that often rely on expensive and limited resources such as naphtha or heavy oil fractions, PDH can efficiently convert propane into propylene. Secondly, PDH demonstrates high process efficiency, allowing for the production of propylene at lower temperatures compared to conventional methods, which can significantly reduce energy consumption and operational costs. Additionally, PDH exhibits superior product selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon oxides, which can lead to higher yields of propylene. This is particularly beneficial considering the high demand for propylene in various industries. The use of vanadium-based catalysts, especially when supported on mesoporous SiO2 like MCM-41, enhances the stability and selectivity of the PDH process, enabling longer on-stream operation without significant degradation in performance. The integration of in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation techniques provides valuable insights into the deactivation mechanisms of the catalysts, allowing for optimization of the process and the development of more durable catalyst formulations.

Comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts: Time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation Abstract Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles.
Graphical abstract V- and Cr oxide-based catalysts with highly dispersed metal oxide species were prepared using MCM-41 as a support and tested in propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41 retained its activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles thanks to high stability of VOx species, whereas CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost activity as aggregation of CrOx species occurred.

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology lies in its ability to produce propylene efficiently and selectively without the need for oxygen, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for high propane conversions and propene selectivities, reaching up to 28% propene yield at 70% propene selectivity over vanadium-based catalysts. This method is particularly advantageous as it utilizes non-oxidative conditions, thereby avoiding the formation of coke and the associated deactivation issues commonly encountered in traditional processes. Additionally, the use of vanadium-based catalysts on mesoporous supports like MCM-41 ensures high surface area and dispersion, leading to stable performance over multiple cycles without the need for reductive activation. This makes PDH technology more efficient and sustainable compared to conventional methods, especially in terms of energy usage and product purity.
