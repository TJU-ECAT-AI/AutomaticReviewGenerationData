Comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts: Time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation Abstract Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles.
Graphical abstract V- and Cr oxide-based catalysts with highly dispersed metal oxide species were prepared using MCM-41 as a support and tested in propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41 retained its activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles thanks to high stability of VOx species, whereas CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost activity as aggregation of CrOx species occurred.

The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology lies in its ability to produce propylene efficiently and selectively without the need for oxygen, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for high propane conversions and propene selectivities, reaching up to 28% propene yield at 70% propene selectivity over vanadium-based catalysts. This method is particularly advantageous as it utilizes non-oxidative conditions, thereby avoiding the formation of coke and the associated deactivation issues commonly encountered in traditional processes. Additionally, the use of vanadium-based catalysts on mesoporous supports like MCM-41 ensures high surface area and dispersion, leading to stable performance over multiple cycles without the need for reductive activation. This makes PDH technology more efficient and sustainable compared to conventional methods, especially in terms of energy usage and product purity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势在于其能够在无氧条件下高效和选择性地生产丙烯，从而解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH技术能够实现高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，最高达到28%丙烯产率和70%丙烯选择性，这主要得益于以范德华催化剂为主导的工艺。与传统过程相比，PDH技术避免了形成焦炭及其导致的催化剂失活问题，提高了生产效率。此外，使用范德华催化剂在介孔支持材料如MCM-41上，确保了高比表面积和分散性，使得催化剂在多个周期内保持稳定性能，无需进行还原激活。这使得PDH技术在能源利用和产品质量方面相较于传统方法更为高效和可持续。
