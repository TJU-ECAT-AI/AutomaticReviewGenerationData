[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry."
[2] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
[3] "Vanadium-based catalysts showed the best performance. In particular, highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[4] "The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability."
[5] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature."
[6] "In the studies on non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation over V- and Cr-based catalysts published up-to-date, the nature of the active sites is not uniquely defined..."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Firstly, PDH utilizes propane, which is abundantly available as a natural byproduct of natural gas processing, as its feedstock, thus offering a consistent supply source unlike naphtha or liquid petroleum gas used in conventional methods. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to be more energy-efficient, allowing for higher conversion rates at lower temperatures, which reduces energy costs and minimizes environmental impact. Lastly, PDH technologies are known for their high propene selectivity, producing a cleaner, more concentrated propene output compared to conventional methods that often require additional purification steps. These advantages collectively make PDH a more sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative for propylene production.
