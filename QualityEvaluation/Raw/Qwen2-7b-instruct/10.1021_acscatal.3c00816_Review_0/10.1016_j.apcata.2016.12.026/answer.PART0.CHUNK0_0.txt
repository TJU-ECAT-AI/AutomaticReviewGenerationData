<p>Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts. Therefore, the development of new types of catalysts with high efficiency under these severe reaction conditions is an important subject in this field.</p>
<p>Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield.</p>
<p>The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of olefins product and extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.</p>
<p>Improved propene yield can be achieved by adding alkaline or alkaline earth metals to the catalyst formulation for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Magnesium incorporation into the catalyst structure improves the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles and facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from the active metal to the support surface.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene under high temperature and low pressure conditions, addressing the limitations of traditional production methods. It allows for greater flexibility in feedstock usage, making it more adaptable to the evolving market demands for propylene.
   
2. The challenges faced by conventional production methods include the availability of suitable feedstocks, maintaining high process efficiency, and achieving optimal product selectivity. Propane dehydrogenation specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a versatile feedstock, optimizing reaction conditions for efficient propylene production, and minimizing unwanted side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, which can lead to catalyst deactivation.
   
3. Propane dehydrogenation requires higher temperatures and lower pressures to achieve a significant yield of propene, which can facilitate side reactions like cracking and coke deposition. These side reactions can deplete the catalyst's efficiency over time. The presence of alkaline or alkaline earth metals in the catalyst formulation can enhance the selectivity of propene production by suppressing these side reactions.
   
4. Incorporating magnesium into the catalyst structure can improve the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles, which is beneficial for the dehydrogenation of propane. This modification helps in facilitating the transfer of carbon deposits from the active metal sites to the support surface, reducing the risk of catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition. Additionally, magnesium can strengthen the interactions between the platinum, tin species, and the support, leading to better catalytic performance.

1. 丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，在高温和低压条件下进行，解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的限制。它允许使用更灵活的原料来源，适应市场对丙烯的不断增长需求。

2. 传统的生产方法面临的主要挑战包括合适的原料供应、保持高过程效率以及实现最佳的产品选择性。丙烷脱氢通过利用丙烷作为多用途原料、优化反应条件以实现高效的丙烯生产，并减少可能导致催化剂失效的副反应（如裂解和焦炭沉积），从而针对性地解决了这些挑战。

3. 丙烷脱氢需要更高的温度和更低的压力来实现丙烯的显著产率，这可能会促进裂解和焦炭沉积等副反应的发生，进而耗尽催化剂的效率。通过在催化剂配方中添加碱性或碱土金属，可以增强丙烯的选择性生产，抑制这些副反应。

4. 在催化剂结构中引入镁可以改善金属纳米颗粒的分散，这对于丙烷的脱氢非常有益。这种修改有助于促进碳沉积从活性金属位点转移到支撑表面，从而降低由于碳沉积导致的催化剂失效的风险。此外，镁还可以加强铂、锡物种与支撑之间的相互作用，提高催化性能。
