<p>Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>The acidity on the PtSn catalyst hinders the desorption of olefins product and extend the retention time on catalyst surface, leading to the further conversion and carbon deposition due to secondary dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions.</p>
<p>A series of high-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 (xMg-SBA-15, x = 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6) was prepared using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method.</p>
<p>Compared with the sample synthesized by the impregnation method, the xMg-SBA-15 materials showed a better Mg species distribution and higher specific surface area.</p>
<p>It was found that incorporation of appropriate amounts of Mg promoted the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles and facilitated the transfer of the carbon deposits from the active metal to the support.</p>
<p>Such a modification of support not only enhanced the interaction of the Sn-support, but also stabilized the oxidation state of Sn species, leading to the improvement of catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>The best catalytic performances were obtained on PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt.% of magnesium, showing a higher than 98% selectivity toward propene at a 38.0% conversion of propane even after 6 h reaction.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. This method offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods, particularly in terms of avoiding the production of unwanted by-products like coke and improving the conversion of propane to propylene. The incorporation of magnesium into the SBA-15 support material enhances the dispersion of metallic nanoparticles, facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from active metal sites to the support, and stabilizes the oxidation state of tin species, thereby improving catalytic activity and stability. The optimal catalyst, PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15, demonstrates superior performance, achieving a high propene selectivity and maintaining activity even after prolonged reaction times.
