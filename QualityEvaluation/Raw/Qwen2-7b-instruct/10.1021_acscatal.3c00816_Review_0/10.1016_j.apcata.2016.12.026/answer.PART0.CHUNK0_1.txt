Propane dehydrogenation using Mg-SBA-15 catalysts provides several key advantages. Firstly, the incorporation of magnesium modifies the metallic phase and enhances the interactions between Pt, Sn species, and the support. Secondly, magnesium stabilizes the oxidation states of tin, which facilitates the migration of coke from the active metal to the support. Thirdly, catalysts with appropriate magnesium content exhibit notable enhancements in catalytic activity and stability.
