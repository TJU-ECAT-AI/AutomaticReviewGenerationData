Facile one-pot synthesized ordered mesoporous Mg-SBA-15 supported PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation Highlights • High-surface area and well-ordered mesoporous Mg-incorporated SBA-15 was prepared by a facile one-pot synthesis method. • The incorporation of Mg modified the metallic phase and strengthened the interactions of Pt, Sn species and support. • The existence of Mg stabilized the oxidation states of Sn and facilitated the migration of coke from active metal to support. • Catalyst with appropriate magnesium incorporated showed significant improvements in catalytic activity and stability.

As far as catalytic deactivation was concerned, coke deposition was an inevitable issue. The deposited coke could be easily identified and quantified under the help of TG analysis. As shown in Fig. 12 , there were two successive weight loss regions on the spent Mg-modified catalysts, representing two different coke deposits. The first weight loss at around 250 C was assigned to the coke deposited on the metal surface, while the weight loss at high temperature (520 C) corresponded to the coke located on the support [50] .

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources, which are more widely available than the traditional naphtha used in steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking processes. Secondly, PDH improves process efficiency by operating under higher temperatures and lower pressures, which facilitates the production of propylene without the side reactions that are common in conventional methods, such as cracking and coke deposition. Lastly, PDH enhances product selectivity by reducing the formation of byproducts, which leads to higher yields of propylene. These advantages collectively make PDH a more economic and sustainable route for propylene production compared to traditional methods.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法。首先，PDH通过利用更广泛可用的丙烷资源解决了原料供应问题，这些资源比传统的用于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解过程的石脑油更为丰富。其次，PDH通过在更高的温度和更低的压力下运行来提高工艺效率，这有助于在不产生传统方法中常见的副反应（如裂解和焦炭沉积）的情况下生产丙烯。最后，PDH通过减少副产品的形成提高了产物选择性，从而导致丙烯产量更高。这些优势综合起来使PDH成为与传统方法相比更加经济和可持续的丙烯生产途径。
