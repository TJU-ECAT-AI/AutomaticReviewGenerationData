[1] "Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[2] "Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity2,3,4."
[3] "Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream."
[4] "Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of CH bonds while limiting the extent of CC bond cleavage through hydrogenolysis5."
[5] "Nonetheless, a second metal is typically incorporated together with Pt to further improve the selectivity and/or stability of the process, particularly when the reaction temperature needs to be high (for example, endothermic reactions)."
[6] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activation temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions8."
[7] "However, the resulting large alloyed PtM particles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanometric bimetallic catalysts9,10,11,12."
[8] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[9] "To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[10] "As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient use of feedstocks. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on crude oil and natural gas, PDH can utilize lighter hydrocarbons, such as propane, which are more abundant and less expensive. This flexibility enhances the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of propylene production. Additionally, PDH offers improved product selectivity. It selectively converts propane into propylene without significantly producing byproducts like methane, ethane, ethylene, and aromatics, which can be costly to separate or dispose of. This not only reduces waste but also maximizes the yield of the desired propylene, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, PDH processes can operate under milder conditions compared to other methods, reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering operational costs. Overall, PDH technology provides a competitive edge in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a preferred choice for propylene production.

In the context of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, the key advantages include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. This technology specifically tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock. Process efficiency is improved through the use of advanced catalysts, such as the subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolites, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability. Product selectivity is enhanced as the technology optimizes the conversion of propane to propylene with minimal hydrogenolysis and aromatic formation, leading to higher purity propylene output.

The document highlights that the introduction of a second metal, such as tin, into the catalyst can significantly modulate the electronic structure of the primary metal, platinum, influencing its catalytic behavior. This modulation leads to improved selectivity and stability in the PDH process. The PtSn clusters, when confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, are found to be stable under high temperatures and capable of efficiently converting propane to propylene with reduced hydrogenolysis and aromatic formation. The results demonstrate that the use of these bimetallic clusters leads to an increase in the initial conversion rate, selectivity to propylene, and a slower deactivation rate over time, compared to traditional catalysts. This suggests that the optimized PtSn clusters are a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

In the context of the global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several significant challenges faced by traditional production methods. The PDH process specifically addresses issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By converting propane directly into propylene without the intermediate step of cracking, PDH offers a more efficient route to propylene production. This method reduces the need for extensive refining processes, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the production chain. Moreover, PDH can utilize a broader range of propane sources, including those derived from unconventional feedstocks, which may not be suitable for conventional cracking processes. This flexibility in feedstock selection enhances the sustainability and economic viability of propylene production, making PDH a key advancement in the industry.

The introduction of a second metal, such as tin (Sn), into the platinum (Pt) clusters through the precise modulation of their interaction within the zeolite structure leads to enhanced catalytic performance for PDH. This is evidenced by the optimization of the deactivation rate and the preservation of high initial selectivity to propylene, even as the catalyst ages. The ability to control the deactivation rate by adjusting the reduction time of the PtSn clusters suggests a mechanism for extending the lifetime of the catalyst without compromising its efficiency. This is particularly advantageous in industrial applications where maintaining high performance over extended periods is crucial.

Furthermore, the stabilization of PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite contributes to the longevity and stability of the catalyst. The high stability of these clusters, as demonstrated by the lack of sintering and the preservation of their location within the zeolite structure even after multiple reaction cycles, underscores the robustness of this approach. This stability ensures consistent performance over time, which is essential for industrial-scale operations.

In summary, PDH technology, combined with the strategic use of bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolite structures, offers a sustainable, efficient, and versatile solution for propylene production. This approach not only optimizes the use of available feedstocks but also extends the operational lifespan of the catalyst, contributing to a more economically viable and environmentally friendly manufacturing process.

通过精确调节铂（Pt）簇中第二金属锡（Sn）的相互作用，引入到纳米颗粒金属催化剂中，可以增强催化性能并影响其催化行为。这一策略特别体现在调整铂锡簇的活性位点，以最大限度地减少碳碳键断裂，同时最小化对目标反应（如脱氢）的活性位点损失。结果表明，在不同预还原处理时间下，每摩尔铂的基础初始活性几乎相同，而降解常数则发生了显著变化。这表明，可以通过控制预还原时间来优化铂锡簇的稳定性，从而延长催化剂的使用寿命，同时保持高初始丙烯选择性。

此外，将铂锡簇稳定在MFI沸石的螺旋形通道内，为催化剂提供了高度的稳定性和耐用性。这些簇的高稳定性，体现在多次反应周期后仍能保持其位置不变，没有发生聚集或聚集，突显了这种方法的稳健性。这种稳定性确保了催化剂性能的持续性，这对于工业规模操作至关重要。

综上所述，结合PDH技术和在沸石结构中定位的铂锡双金属簇，提供了一种可持续、高效且灵活的丙烯生产解决方案。这种方法不仅优化了可用原料的使用，而且通过延长催化剂的使用寿命，提高了生产过程的经济性和环境友好性。
