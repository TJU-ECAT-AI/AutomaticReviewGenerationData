[1] "Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[2] "For instance, tin is introduced as a second metal for propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the UOP Oleflex process6,7."
[3] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[4] "However, the resulting large alloyed PtM particles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanometric bimetallic catalysts9,10,11,12."
[5] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[6] "As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics."

In the context of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, the key advantages include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. This technology specifically tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock. Process efficiency is improved through the use of advanced catalysts, such as the subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolites, which exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability. Product selectivity is enhanced as the technology optimizes the conversion of propane to propylene with minimal hydrogenolysis and aromatic formation, leading to higher purity propylene output.

The document highlights that the introduction of a second metal, such as tin, into the catalyst can significantly modulate the electronic structure of the primary metal, platinum, influencing its catalytic behavior. This modulation leads to improved selectivity and stability in the PDH process. The PtSn clusters, when confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, are found to be stable under high temperatures and capable of efficiently converting propane to propylene with reduced hydrogenolysis and aromatic formation. The results demonstrate that the use of these bimetallic clusters leads to an increase in the initial conversion rate, selectivity to propylene, and a slower deactivation rate over time, compared to traditional catalysts. This suggests that the optimized PtSn clusters are a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

在丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的背景下，其关键优势包括解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性的问题。该技术通过利用易于获得且丰富的丙烷作为原料，有效解决了原料供应问题。通过使用先进的催化剂，如限制在沸石结构中的亚纳米双金属铂锡簇，提高了过程效率。产品选择性得到增强，因为该技术优化了丙烷到丙烯的转化率，同时减少了氢解和芳烃的形成，从而产生更高纯度的丙烯输出。

文献强调，向纳米颗粒金属催化剂中引入第二种金属（如锡）可以显著调节原始金属的电子结构，并进一步影响其催化性能。这种调节导致PDH过程中选择性和稳定性的提高。当这些双金属簇被限制在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石的正弦通道中时，发现它们在高温下具有高活性和稳定性，能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少氢解和芳香族化合物的形成。结果表明，使用这些双金属簇可增加初始转化率、丙烯选择性以及催化剂在长时间内的降解速率，与传统催化剂相比，这表明优化后的铂锡簇是PDH过程中提高效率和选择性的有前景解决方案。
