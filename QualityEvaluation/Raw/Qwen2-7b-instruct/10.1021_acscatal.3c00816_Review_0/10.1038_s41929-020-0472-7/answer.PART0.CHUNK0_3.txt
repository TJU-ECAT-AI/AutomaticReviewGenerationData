<p>Despite the complexity of the structures of the PtSn clusters, the models proposed in this Figure could be over simplified.</p>
<p>Pt clusters are probably reduced first by H2, consistent with previous work showing full Pt reduction at <200C.</p>
<p>The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction was analysed by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 66-71, the amount of coke in all the samples remained below 1wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke was found.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods are as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology can utilize propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock, as opposed to conventional methods that might rely on less accessible or more expensive raw materials. This enhances the scalability and economic viability of propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more streamlined process compared to traditional methods, which often involve multiple steps and energy-intensive transformations. By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH minimizes the number of steps, potentially reducing costs and environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH is designed to maximize the production of propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and aromatics. This high selectivity ensures a cleaner output and reduces the need for additional purification processes.

4. **Energy and Cost Savings**: The direct conversion process in PDH technology requires less energy compared to conventional methods, which often involve significant energy inputs for cracking or reforming processes. This leads to cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

5. **Environmental Impact**: By minimizing the number of steps and optimizing the process, PDH technology reduces greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants compared to traditional methods, making it a more sustainable choice for propylene production.

These advantages position PDH as the most promising method for propylene production, offering solutions to the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the conventional methods.

以下是丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的关键优势：

1. **原料可用性**：PDH技术可以利用丙烷作为原料，这是一种易于获取且数量充足的原料。相比之下，传统方法可能依赖于更难以获得或成本更高的原材料。这提高了丙烯生产的大规模应用和经济可行性。

2. **过程效率**：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更精简的过程。通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，PDH减少了步骤的数量，可能降低了成本并减少了环境影响。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH旨在最大限度地提高丙烯的生产，同时减少不希望的副产品的形成，如甲烷、乙烷、乙烯和芳烃。这种高的选择性确保了输出更清洁，并减少了额外净化过程的需求。

4. **能源和成本节约**：与传统方法相比，PDH技术所需的能量较少，因为传统方法往往需要大量能量进行裂解或重整过程。这导致成本节省并提高了操作效率。

5. **环境影响**：通过减少步骤的数量和优化过程，PDH技术减少了温室气体排放和其他污染物，使其成为丙烯生产的一种更具可持续性的选择。

这些优势使PDH技术成为最有可能的丙烯生产方法，它解决了传统方法面临的挑战，包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。
