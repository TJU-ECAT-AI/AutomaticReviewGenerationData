<p>However, a second metal is typically incorporated together with Pt to further improve the selectivity and/or stability of the process, particularly when the reaction temperature needs to be high (for example, endothermic reactions).</p>
<p>For instance, tin is introduced as a second metal for propane dehydrogenation to propylene in the UOP Oleflex process6,7.</p>
<p>The optimal catalyst is achieved when CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the active sites responsible for the reaction of interest (for example, dehydrogenation).</p>
<p>Although PtSn alloys notably promote the selectivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation, they also reduce and/or modulate the active Pt sites, decreasing the catalytic activity5.</p>
<p>In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics.</p>
<p>A fast decay of the activity was observed over 15h of time on stream, caused by the blockage of the Pt sites by coke.</p>
<p>When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work17; see Fig. 7b), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to propylene increased to 93%.</p>
<p>More importantly, the deactivation rate was lower than that of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to efficiently produce propylene from propane feedstock, particularly addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology enables high conversion rates and selectivity, making it a promising method for propylene production. Specifically, it addresses the following challenges:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available worldwide. This ensures a stable supply of feedstock for propylene production, unlike some other processes that might require more scarce or expensive raw materials.

2. **Process Efficiency**: The process is designed to maximize the yield of propylene, minimizing waste and energy consumption. By carefully controlling reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, PDH can achieve high efficiency with low energy input, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology is optimized to minimize unwanted side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, which can produce undesirable byproducts like methane, ethane, and ethylene. By incorporating a second metal like tin (Sn) into the catalyst, the process can be tuned to selectively produce propylene with minimal hydrogenolysis, enhancing product purity and marketability.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective means of producing propylene, addressing key challenges in the industry by utilizing abundant feedstocks, optimizing the process for high yields and selectivity, and minimizing environmental impacts.
