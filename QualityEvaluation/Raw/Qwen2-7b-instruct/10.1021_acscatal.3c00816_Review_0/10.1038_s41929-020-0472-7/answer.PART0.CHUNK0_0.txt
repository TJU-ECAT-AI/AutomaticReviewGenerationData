[1] "Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[2] "Furthermore, the electronic structures and surface properties of bimetallic nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the spatial distribution of the two elements. By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity2,3,4."
[3] "Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream."
[4] "Platinum-based materials are widely used for reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts in numerous industrial processes due to their excellent properties for the activation of CH bonds while limiting the extent of CC bond cleavage through hydrogenolysis5."
[5] "Nonetheless, a second metal is typically incorporated together with Pt to further improve the selectivity and/or stability of the process, particularly when the reaction temperature needs to be high (for example, endothermic reactions)."
[6] "The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). High Sn content and high activation temperature favour the formation of alloyed structures that substantially promote catalyst selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions8."
[7] "However, the resulting large alloyed PtM particles are suboptimal from an activity standpoint, and there is an interest in designing more active, selective and stable subnanometric bimetallic catalysts9,10,11,12."
[8] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[9] "To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[10] "As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient use of feedstocks. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on crude oil and natural gas, PDH can utilize lighter hydrocarbons, such as propane, which are more abundant and less expensive. This flexibility enhances the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of propylene production. Additionally, PDH offers improved product selectivity. It selectively converts propane into propylene without significantly producing byproducts like methane, ethane, ethylene, and aromatics, which can be costly to separate or dispose of. This not only reduces waste but also maximizes the yield of the desired propylene, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, PDH processes can operate under milder conditions compared to other methods, reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering operational costs. Overall, PDH technology provides a competitive edge in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a preferred choice for propylene production.
