[1] "Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[2] "The optimal catalyst is achieved when CC bond cleavage is shut down with no or minimal loss of the active sites responsible for the reaction of interest (for example, dehydrogenation)."
[3] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[4] "As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically."

In the context of the global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several significant challenges faced by traditional production methods. The PDH process specifically addresses issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By converting propane directly into propylene without the intermediate step of cracking, PDH offers a more efficient route to propylene production. This method reduces the need for extensive refining processes, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the production chain. Moreover, PDH can utilize a broader range of propane sources, including those derived from unconventional feedstocks, which may not be suitable for conventional cracking processes. This flexibility in feedstock selection enhances the sustainability and economic viability of propylene production, making PDH a key advancement in the industry.

The introduction of a second metal, such as tin (Sn), into the platinum (Pt) clusters through the precise modulation of their interaction within the zeolite structure leads to enhanced catalytic performance for PDH. This is evidenced by the optimization of the deactivation rate and the preservation of high initial selectivity to propylene, even as the catalyst ages. The ability to control the deactivation rate by adjusting the reduction time of the PtSn clusters suggests a mechanism for extending the lifetime of the catalyst without compromising its efficiency. This is particularly advantageous in industrial applications where maintaining high performance over extended periods is crucial.

Furthermore, the stabilization of PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite contributes to the longevity and stability of the catalyst. The high stability of these clusters, as demonstrated by the lack of sintering and the preservation of their location within the zeolite structure even after multiple reaction cycles, underscores the robustness of this approach. This stability ensures consistent performance over time, which is essential for industrial-scale operations.

In summary, PDH technology, combined with the strategic use of bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolite structures, offers a sustainable, efficient, and versatile solution for propylene production. This approach not only optimizes the use of available feedstocks but also extends the operational lifespan of the catalyst, contributing to a more economically viable and environmentally friendly manufacturing process.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够解决传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战而成为丙烯生产的最理想方法。PDH技术通过以下方式解决了与原料可用性、过程效率和产物选择性相关的问题。与传统的裂解过程相比，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需中间步骤，从而提高了生产流程的整体效率。这种方法可以利用更广泛的丙烷来源，包括那些不适合常规裂解过程的非常规原料。这种原料选择的灵活性增强了丙烯生产的可持续性和经济可行性，使PDH成为行业的重要进步。

通过精确调节铂（Pt）簇中第二金属锡（Sn）的相互作用，引入到纳米颗粒金属催化剂中，可以增强催化性能并影响其催化行为。这一策略特别体现在调整铂锡簇的活性位点，以最大限度地减少碳碳键断裂，同时最小化对目标反应（如脱氢）的活性位点损失。结果表明，在不同预还原处理时间下，每摩尔铂的基础初始活性几乎相同，而降解常数则发生了显著变化。这表明，可以通过控制预还原时间来优化铂锡簇的稳定性，从而延长催化剂的使用寿命，同时保持高初始丙烯选择性。

此外，将铂锡簇稳定在MFI沸石的螺旋形通道内，为催化剂提供了高度的稳定性和耐用性。这些簇的高稳定性，体现在多次反应周期后仍能保持其位置不变，没有发生聚集或聚集，突显了这种方法的稳健性。这种稳定性确保了催化剂性能的持续性，这对于工业规模操作至关重要。

综上所述，结合PDH技术和在沸石结构中定位的铂锡双金属簇，提供了一种可持续、高效且灵活的丙烯生产解决方案。这种方法不仅优化了可用原料的使用，而且通过延长催化剂的使用寿命，提高了生产过程的经济性和环境友好性。
