[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite A PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst with very high activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation is reported in this paper."
[2] "The excellent properties of the catalyst originate from the strong interaction of the Ti existing in the zeolite framework with Zn and Pt."
[3] "Thanks to the interaction of the Ti with Zn and Pt, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst exhibited a very high initial specific rate of 58.09 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and a quite low deactivation constant of 0.0158 h1 in the 96.8 h time on stream at 600 C."
[4] "The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface."
[5] "As a result, it greatly enhanced the activity and the catalytic durability of the catalyst."
[6] "The important roles of TS-1 as the support could be ascribed to the framework titanium, which localizes Pt and Zn together, increasing the dispersion degree of Pt and improving its modification by Zn, as indicated by CO adsorption IR spectra as well as C3H6-TPD."
[7] "On the other hand, non-framework titanium species have a negative effect on the activity of the catalyst."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH makes use of readily available propane feedstocks, unlike the traditional steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil methods, which rely on less abundant resources. The PDH process is designed to efficiently convert propane into propylene, offering improved process efficiency compared to conventional methods. Moreover, PDH ensures high product selectivity, ensuring that the majority of the output is the desired propylene, minimizing waste and increasing economic viability.

2. The PDH process specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in several ways. Firstly, it utilizes a more abundant and inexpensive feedstock, propane, which is widely available globally. This contrasts with the need for expensive and scarce naphtha or heavy oil for traditional methods. Secondly, PDH offers a more efficient conversion process, leading to higher yields of propylene with less energy consumption and waste production. Lastly, PDH ensures high product selectivity, meaning that the majority of the output is propylene, which is essential for the production of polymers and a variety of chemical products. This high selectivity reduces the need for additional refining processes, making the PDH method more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.
