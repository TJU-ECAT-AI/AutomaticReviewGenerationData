[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite A PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst with very high activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation is reported in this paper."
[2] "The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface."
[3] "The important roles of TS-1 as the support could be ascribed to the framework titanium, which localizes Pt and Zn together, increasing the dispersion degree of Pt and improving its modification by Zn, as indicated by CO adsorption IR spectra as well as C3H6-TPD."
[4] "On the other hand, non-framework titanium species have a negative effect on the activity of the catalyst."
[5] "The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst is not only very highly active, selective, and catalytically durable, but also economically applicable for industrial DHP applications, as the catalyst could be obtained via a simple impregnation process and TS-1 zeolite synthesis is easy and low-cost."

In the context of the escalating global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. PDH technology addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional methods often rely on expensive and scarce feedstocks such as naphtha and heavy oil. PDH utilizes abundant and inexpensive shale gas reserves, providing a more sustainable and economical source of raw materials.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH offers a more efficient process for propylene production, capable of converting propane directly into propylene at high temperatures. This process bypasses the need for multiple steps typically required in traditional methods, resulting in streamlined operations and lower energy consumption.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH technology demonstrates a high selectivity for propylene production, minimizing the formation of byproducts and reducing waste. This leads to a cleaner and more environmentally friendly manufacturing process, aligning with global sustainability goals.

PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by leveraging the properties of the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst, which is anchored to the TS-1 zeolite support. The incorporation of titanium into the zeolite framework facilitates a synergistic effect between platinum (Pt) and zinc (Zn), enhancing dispersion, modifying the electronic density of Pt, and significantly reducing the undesirable residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. This results in a catalyst with exceptional activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability, making it highly suitable for industrial applications. The simplicity of the impregnation process for catalyst preparation and the ease of TS-1 zeolite synthesis contribute to the economic viability of PDH technology, making it an attractive choice for propylene production in the industrial sector.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其以下优势而成为丙烯生产最具前景的方法：

1. **原料可用性**：传统方法通常依赖昂贵且稀缺的原料如石脑油和重油。PDH技术利用丰富的页岩气资源作为原料，提供更可持续和经济的原材料来源。

2. **过程效率**：PDH技术提供了一种更为高效的丙烯生产流程，能够将丙烷直接转化为丙烯，无需多步骤的传统方法，实现流程简化和能源消耗降低。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术展示了高选择性进行丙烯生产的能力，最大限度地减少了副产品的形成，减少了浪费。这符合全球可持续发展目标，实现了更清洁、更环保的制造过程。

PDH技术通过利用PtZn/0.02TS-170催化剂，锚定在TS-1沸石支持上，解决了这些挑战。钛的存在于沸石骨架中促进了铂（Pt）和锌（Zn）之间的协同作用，提高了分散度，修改了Pt的电子密度，并显著减少了催化剂表面的有害残余硅醇基团。这导致催化剂具有出色的活性、选择性和催化稳定性，使其非常适合工业应用。催化剂制备过程的简便性和TS-1沸石合成的易得性和低成本性共同推动了PDH技术的经济可行性，使其成为工业领域丙烯生产的有吸引力的选择。
