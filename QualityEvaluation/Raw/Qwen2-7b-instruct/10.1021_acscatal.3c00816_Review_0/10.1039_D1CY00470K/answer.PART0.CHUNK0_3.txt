[1] "Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals."
[2] "Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally."
[3] "Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand."
[4] "On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane."
[5] "Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry."
[6] "However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow."
[7] "High dispersion of Pt is not only the basis of high catalyst activity, but also brings about a better sintering resistance of the catalyst, as it must be the result of strong interactions between the metal and the support (SMSI)."
[8] "Additionally, as reported by Han et al., titanium oxide is beneficial for dispersing active zinc on ZrO2 for the DHP."
[9] "Therefore, the catalyst would be expected to show high activity and durability if the framework Ti atoms could anchor the Pt and Zn atoms to them via possible chemical forces and localize them together."
[10] "Clearly, the much higher catalytic durability of the PtZn/0.02TS-95 should originate from a possible cooperation effect of Ti with Zn on the Pt dispersion and/or on the electronic modification of Pt."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: With the continuous exploration of ample shale gas reserves worldwide, propane becomes a cheap and abundant feedstock. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for cracking processes that require naphtha or heavy oil, thus providing a more sustainable and readily available feedstock source.

2. Process Efficiency: Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking have limitations in terms of productivity, especially in meeting the increasing global demand for propylene. PDH offers a potentially more efficient process since it directly converts propane to propylene, bypassing intermediate stages that can lead to energy loss and complexity.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH has the potential to offer better product selectivity compared to traditional methods, as it specifically targets the production of propylene, reducing the need for further refining or separation processes.

4. Catalyst Durability and Activity: The development of catalysts that incorporate titanium (Ti) within the zeolite framework, such as PtZn/0.02TS-95, demonstrates improved dispersion and electronic modification of platinum (Pt) through the interaction with zinc (Zn) and Ti. This results in high activity, selectivity, and durability for the PDH process, overcoming issues like sintering of active metals and coke deposition.

5. Economic Viability: The simplicity of the impregnation process for catalyst preparation and the ease and low cost of synthesizing TS-1 zeolite contribute to the economic viability of PDH technology, making it more attractive for industrial applications.

These advantages highlight the potential of PDH technology to become a leading method for propylene production, offering benefits over traditional methods in terms of sustainability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
