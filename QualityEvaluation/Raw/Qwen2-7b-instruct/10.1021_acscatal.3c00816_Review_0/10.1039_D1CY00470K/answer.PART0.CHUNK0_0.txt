[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite A PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst with very high activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation is reported in this paper."
[2] "The excellent properties of the catalyst originate from the strong interaction of the Ti existing in the zeolite framework with Zn and Pt."
[3] "The crucial functions of the Ti in constructing the structure and for modifying the reaction were evidenced by the CO adsorption capacity, CO adsorption IR spectroscopy and C3H6-TPD of the related catalysts."
[4] "Thanks to the interaction of the Ti with Zn and Pt, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst exhibited a very high initial specific rate of 58.09 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and a quite low deactivation constant of 0.0158 h1 in the 96.8 h time on stream at 600 C."
[5] "For the DHP, the various research groups around the world have investigated the catalysts under quite different reaction conditions."
[6] "Over the total reaction period of 96.8 hours, the selectivity towards C3H6 was maintained at about 96%, and substantial deactivation of the catalyst began after the reaction had been conducted for a time on stream of about 25 hours."
[7] "Clearly, these should be associated with the surface silanol groups of the silicalite-1 zeolite."
[8] "The initial C3H8 conversion over the PtZn/0.02TS-170 at a WHSV of 48 h1 is 47.3%, which is considerably higher than those reported in the literature."

In the context of growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. It specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. 

Firstly, PDH offers a viable solution to the scarcity of traditional feedstocks used in conventional propylene production processes, such as steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. With the exploration of ample shale gas reserves around the globe, PDH provides access to cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane, which can be directly converted into propylene through this process. This not only diversifies feedstock sources but also aligns with the growing demand for propylene globally.

Secondly, PDH boasts a higher process efficiency compared to traditional methods. By converting propane directly into propylene, PDH eliminates the intermediate steps required in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, thus reducing energy consumption and costs. This streamlined process also minimizes the formation of byproducts, making PDH a more efficient route for propylene production.

Lastly, PDH ensures superior product selectivity. The high conversion rates achieved in PDH lead to a higher yield of propylene with minimal formation of byproducts, such as coke deposition, which is a common issue in conventional methods. This selectivity is crucial for maintaining the purity of the propylene product, which is essential for downstream polymer production processes.

Moreover, the use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the support for preparing the PDH catalyst enhances the activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability of the catalyst. This is attributed to the strong interaction of the Ti existing in the zeolite framework with Zn and Pt, which increases the dispersion of Pt, modifies its electronic properties, and decreases undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. As a result, the catalyst becomes highly active, selective, and durable, making it economically applicable for industrial PDH applications.

In summary, PDH technology offers a promising alternative to conventional propylene production methods by addressing issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Its integration with the use of TS-1 zeolite as a catalyst support further enhances its performance, making it a valuable tool for meeting the increasing global demand for propylene in a sustainable and efficient manner.

在对全球丙烯需求不断增长的背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法。它特别解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。

首先，PDH为解决传统丙烯生产过程中的稀缺原料问题提供了可行解决方案。随着全球范围内大量页岩气资源的勘探，PDH通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，提供了一种获取廉价且丰富的原料来源，包括丙烷，从而满足全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。

其次，PDH在过程效率方面具有更高优势。通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，PDH消除了蒸汽裂解或重油催化裂化等传统方法中所需的中间步骤，从而降低能耗和成本。这一简化的过程也减少了副产品的形成，使PDH成为更高效的丙烯生产途径。

最后，PDH确保了更高的产品选择性。PDH实现的高转化率导致丙烯产量更高，同时形成了较少的副产品，如焦炭沉积。这种选择性对于保持丙烯产品的纯度至关重要，这对于下游聚合物生产过程非常重要。

此外，使用钛硅沸石TS-1作为催化剂载体，可以增强PDH催化剂的活性、选择性和催化稳定性。这归因于TS-1框架中Ti与Zn和Pt之间的强烈相互作用，增加了Pt的分散，修改了其电子性质，并减少了催化剂表面的不良残余硅醇基团。因此，催化剂变得更加活跃、选择性和耐用，使其经济上适用于工业PDH应用。

综上所述，PDH技术通过解决与原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性相关的问题，为传统丙烯生产方法提供了有前景的替代方案。与使用TS-1沸石作为催化剂载体的集成相结合，进一步提高了其性能，使其成为以可持续和高效方式满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的重要工具。
