[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite A PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst with very high activity, selectivity, and catalytic durability for propane dehydrogenation is reported in this paper."
[2] "The excellent properties of the catalyst originate from the strong interaction of the Ti existing in the zeolite framework with Zn and Pt."
[3] "The crucial functions of the Ti in constructing the structure and for modifying the reaction were evidenced by the CO adsorption capacity, CO adsorption IR spectroscopy and C3H6-TPD of the related catalysts."
[4] "Thanks to the interaction of the Ti with Zn and Pt, the PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst exhibited a very high initial specific rate of 58.09 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and a quite low deactivation constant of 0.0158 h1 in the 96.8 h time on stream at 600 C."

Answer: The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the literature, are its ability to directly convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods. These conventional methods, such as steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil, struggle to meet the increasing global demand for propylene. PDH offers a more efficient and versatile solution by utilizing abundant shale gas reserves to produce propylene from propane. The process is designed to overcome issues with fast catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition, which are major hurdles in conventional methods. By employing a catalyst system with high activity, selectivity, and durability, PDH ensures a stable and efficient production process. The use of a specific catalyst formulation, such as PtZn localized at Ti sites on TS-1 zeolite, demonstrates the potential for PDH to offer a sustainable and economically viable alternative for propylene production.

答案：文献中提到，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。传统的生产方法，如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油催化裂化，难以满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求。PDH提供了一种更高效、更灵活的解决方案，利用丰富的页岩气资源从丙烷生产丙烯。该过程旨在克服传统方法中催化剂快速失活和焦炭沉积等主要障碍。通过采用具有高活性、选择性和耐久性的催化剂系统，PDH确保了稳定且高效的生产过程。使用特定的催化剂配方，例如在TS-1沸石上以Ti位点局部化的PtZn，表明PDH有可能提供一种可持续和经济可行的丙烯生产替代方案。
