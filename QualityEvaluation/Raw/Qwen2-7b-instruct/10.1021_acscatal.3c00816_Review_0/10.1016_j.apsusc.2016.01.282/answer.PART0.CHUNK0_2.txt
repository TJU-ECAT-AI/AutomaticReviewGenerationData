<p>The effects of two Al2O3 phases, γ- and θ-Al2O3, and Cl component on the performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane were investigated in this work.</p>
<p>The characterizations and catalytic results show that: (i) the pore structures and acid properties of the two Al2O3 phases can change the quantity, location and property of the carbon deposition, (ii) the existence of Cl plays a significant role on the agglomeration of Pt particles and carbon deposition, which further influence the catalytic performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts with different support phases for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Highlights • Comparative study of Al2O3 phase on dehydrogenation of propane was implemented. • Pore structures and acid properties of Pt-Al2O3 are correlated to the activities. • Pt-θ-Al2O3 with abundant Cl content shows the highest activity and stability.</p>

The study highlights that the use of two different aluminum oxide phases, γ- and θ-Al2O3, along with the inclusion of chlorine (Cl) component, significantly affects the performance of platinum-alumina catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane. Specifically, the pore structure and acidic properties of the alumina phases alter the quantity, location, and properties of carbon deposition. Moreover, the presence of Cl has a crucial role in the aggregation of platinum particles and carbon deposition, impacting the catalytic performance of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts with various support phases for propane dehydrogenation. The results indicate that the θ-Al2O3 phase with a high Cl content demonstrates the highest activity and stability.

研究强调，使用两种不同的铝氧化物相γ-和θ-Al2O3，以及氯（Cl）成分，在丙烷脱氢过程中对铂-氧化铝催化剂的性能有显著影响。具体来说，氧化铝相的孔结构和酸性性质改变了碳沉积的数量、位置和特性。此外，氯的存在在铂颗粒的聚集和碳沉积中起着关键作用，进而影响不同支持相的Pt-Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的催化性能。结果表明，含高Cl量的θ-Al2O3相表现出最高的活性和稳定性。
