[1] "The effects of two Al2O3 phases, γ- and θ-Al2O3, and Cl component on the performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane were investigated in this work."
[2] "The characterizations and catalytic results show that: (i) the pore structures and acid properties of the two Al2O3 phases can change the quantity, location and property of the carbon deposition, (ii) the existence of Cl plays a significant role on the agglomeration of Pt particles and carbon deposition, which further influence the catalytic performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts with different support phases for propane dehydrogenation."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods for propylene include its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, thereby potentially alleviating issues related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. This technology specifically addresses these challenges by optimizing the conversion process through the use of specific catalysts, namely those with Al2O3 phases and chlorine components. These catalysts influence the structure and acidity of the support materials, affecting the location, quantity, and properties of carbon deposition. Additionally, the presence of chlorine significantly impacts the aggregation of platinum particles and carbon deposition, enhancing the overall catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.
