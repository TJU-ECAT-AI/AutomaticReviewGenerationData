1. The research investigates the impact of two forms of aluminum oxide (γ- and θ-Al2O3) and the chloride component on the performance of platinum-alumina catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane. The study reveals that the pore structures and acidic properties of these aluminum oxide phases alter the quantity, location, and characteristics of carbon deposition. Moreover, the presence of chloride significantly affects the aggregation of platinum particles and carbon deposition, thereby influencing the catalytic performance of platinum-alumina catalysts with different support phases for propane dehydrogenation.
