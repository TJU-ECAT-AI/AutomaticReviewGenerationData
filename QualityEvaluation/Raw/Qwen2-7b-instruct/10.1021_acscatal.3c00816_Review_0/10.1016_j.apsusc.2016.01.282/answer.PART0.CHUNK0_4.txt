[1] "The effects of two Al2O3 phases, γ- and θ-Al2O3, and Cl component on the performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane were investigated in this work."
[2] "The catalysts were systematically characterized by various techniques, such as scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), temperature-programmed desorption with ammonia as probe molecules (NH3-TPD) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)."
[3] "The characterizations and catalytic results show that: (i) the pore structures and acid properties of the two Al2O3 phases can change the quantity, location and property of the carbon deposition, (ii) the existence of Cl plays a significant role on the agglomeration of Pt particles and carbon deposition, which further influence the catalytic performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts with different support phases for propane dehydrogenation."

1. This study investigates the impact of two alumina phases (γ- and θ-Al2O3) and chlorine component on the performance of platinum-alumina catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques, including scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), temperature-programmed desorption with ammonia as a probe molecule (NH3-TPD), and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The research highlights how these factors affect carbon deposition and catalytic activity.
