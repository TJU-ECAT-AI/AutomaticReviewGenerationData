[1] "The effects of two Al2O3 phases, γ- and θ-Al2O3, and Cl component on the performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane were investigated in this work."
[2] "The characterizations and catalytic results show that: (i) the pore structures and acid properties of the two Al2O3 phases can change the quantity, location and property of the carbon deposition, (ii) the existence of Cl plays a significant role on the agglomeration of Pt particles and carbon deposition, which further influence the catalytic performances of Pt-Al2O3 catalysts with different support phases for propane dehydrogenation."

The study examines the impact of two alumina phases (γ- and θ-Al2O3) and the chloride component on the performance of platinum-alumina catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It reveals that the pore structures and acidic properties of these alumina phases affect the quantity, location, and characteristics of carbon deposition. Moreover, the presence of chloride significantly influences the aggregation of platinum particles and carbon deposition, thus impacting the catalytic activities of the Pt-Al2O3 catalysts with varying support phases.
