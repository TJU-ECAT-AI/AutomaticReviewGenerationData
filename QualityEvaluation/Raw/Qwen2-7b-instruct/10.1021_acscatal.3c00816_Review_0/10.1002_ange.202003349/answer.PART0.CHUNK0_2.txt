In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize readily available feedstock, notably propane derived from shale gas, without relying on scarce fossil fuels. This method directly addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more sustainable solution with respect to feedstock availability, enhancing process efficiency through selective conversion, and optimizing product selectivity to maximize propylene yield. The PDH process achieves high propane conversion through the use of high temperatures, typically above 500°C, which is essential for the thermodynamically limited and endothermic nature of the PDH reaction. Moreover, the development of advanced catalysts, such as those incorporating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters encapsulated within zeolites, has significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability, leading to enhanced propylene selectivity and long-term stability, surpassing traditional Pt-based catalysts. The introduction of Cs+ ions further enhances the catalyst's regeneration stability, ensuring consistent performance after multiple cycles of activation and deactivation, thus addressing the limitations of conventional catalysts in terms of durability and efficiency.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具前景的方法，因为它能够高效地利用易于获取的原料，尤其是来自页岩气的丙烷，而无需依赖稀缺的化石燃料。这种方法通过优化工艺效率和选择性转化，以及最大化丙烯产率，有效解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。PDH过程通过使用高于500°C的高温来实现高丙烷转化率，这是PDH反应热力学限制和强吸热性质所必需的。此外，开发先进的催化剂，如将亚纳米双金属PtZn簇封装在沸石中的催化剂，显著提高了催化活性和稳定性，从而提高了丙烯选择性和长期稳定性，超过了传统的铂基催化剂。引入Cs+离子进一步提高了催化剂的再生性能，确保了经过多次激活和失活循环后性能的一致性，从而解决了传统催化剂在耐用性和效率方面的局限性。
