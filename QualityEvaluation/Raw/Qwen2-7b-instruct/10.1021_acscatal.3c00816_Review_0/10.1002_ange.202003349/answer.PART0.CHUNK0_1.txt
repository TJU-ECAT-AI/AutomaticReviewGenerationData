[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy and is crucial to the production of various valuable chemicals, commodities, and fuels."
[2] "Despite high initial propylene yields, Pt-based catalysts often encounter problems in the term of fast deactivation and poor propylene selectivity."
[3] "Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry."
[4] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions can remarkably improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike conventional production methods that rely heavily on scarce fossil fuels, PDH utilizes abundant propane, making it more sustainable. In terms of process efficiency, PDH enables high propane conversions while maintaining high propylene selectivity, offering better economic and environmental benefits. The selectivity and stability of the PDH process are particularly advantageous, as they ensure consistent propylene yields without significant byproduct formation, enhancing overall process efficiency.
