[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy and is crucial to the production of various valuable chemicals, commodities, and fuels."
[2] "Despite high initial propylene yields, Pt-based catalysts often encounter problems in the term of fast deactivation and poor propylene selectivity."
[3] "The PDH reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, so high reaction temperature (>500C) is essential to achieve a high propane conversion."
[4] "However, the small Pt species are subjected to severe sintering during the process of PDH conversions at high temperatures due to the considerable increase in surface free energy at smaller sizes and the lack of the confinement effect of supports or/and strong metal-support interactions."
[5] "The design of supported bimetallic catalysts by alloying Pt with various metallic elements, such as Sn, Ga, Cu, Fe, and Zn, is also considered an effective strategy to enhance the stability of Pt species and propylene selectivity in PDH conversions, but the stability and catalytic efficiency of these catalysts remain to be improved."
[6] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."
[7] "The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C."
[8] "Strikingly, after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), the propane conversion remained at 40.4% with 99.2% selectivity for propylene, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH allows for efficient utilization of abundant feedstocks such as propane, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on scarce fossil fuels, PDH can leverage readily available natural gas sources. Secondly, PDH demonstrates improved process efficiency. By converting propane directly to propylene, it bypasses intermediate stages that are typically required in other production routes, potentially reducing energy consumption and costs. Thirdly, PDH showcases enhanced product selectivity. The use of advanced catalysts, as discussed in the literature, enables the PDH process to selectively convert propane into propylene with high efficiency, achieving propylene selectivities of up to 99.3%. This level of selectivity is crucial for maximizing the yield of propylene, a critical component in the global chemical industry. Lastly, the literature highlights the development of novel catalysts that exhibit exceptional stability and long-term performance. These catalysts maintain high levels of propylene yield and selectivity even after extensive use, with deactivation constants that are significantly lower than those of conventional catalysts. This remarkable stability ensures reliable operation and minimizes the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement, which is particularly advantageous for industrial-scale applications.
