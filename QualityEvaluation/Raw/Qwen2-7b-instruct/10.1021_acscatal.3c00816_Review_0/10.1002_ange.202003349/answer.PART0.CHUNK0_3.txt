In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources. Secondly, it enhances process efficiency by converting propane into propylene directly, bypassing the need for intermediate stages that are typically required in other production methods. Lastly, PDH improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene compared to traditional methods, which often suffer from lower selectivity leading to the production of unwanted byproducts. The use of better supports for stabilizing platinum species, as discussed in the literature, is a critical aspect of optimizing PDH processes, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and economic viability of propylene production through this method. Additionally, the introduction of cesium ions (Cs+) into the zeolite material can significantly improve the regeneration stability of the catalyst, allowing for sustained high performance over multiple cycles without significant loss in activity.

面对全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它能够解决几个关键挑战。首先，PDH技术通过利用丰富的丙烷资源解决了原料供应问题。其次，它通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯提高了工艺效率，跳过了其他生产方法中通常需要的中间步骤。最后，PDH提高了产品的选择性，确保了与传统方法相比更高的丙烯产量，这些传统方法往往选择性较低，导致产生不希望的副产品。文献中提到的对于稳定铂族元素使用更好的支撑材料是优化PDH过程的关键方面，从而提高整体效率和经济可行性。此外，向沸石材料中引入铯离子（Cs+）可以显著改善催化剂的再生稳定性，使催化剂在多次循环中保持高性能而不会出现显著的活性损失。
