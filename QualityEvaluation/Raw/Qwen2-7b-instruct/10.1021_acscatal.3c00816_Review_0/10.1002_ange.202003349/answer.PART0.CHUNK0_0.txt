[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming popular and is regarded as a promising way to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene across the globe."
[2] "Exploring better supports to stabilize Pt species is of great significance yet remains a nontrivial target for PDH industry."
[3] "Significantly, the introduction of Zn species coupled with subnanometer Pt clusters remarkably improved the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."
[4] "Industrially, the Al2O3 has been used to support Pt species for the PDH conversions."
[5] "The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C."
[6] "Significantly, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction."
[7] "We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles."
