In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize readily available feedstock, notably propane derived from shale gas, without relying on scarce fossil fuels. This method directly addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more sustainable solution with respect to feedstock availability, enhancing process efficiency through selective conversion, and optimizing product selectivity to maximize propylene yield. The PDH process achieves high propane conversion through the use of high temperatures, typically above 500°C, which is essential for the thermodynamically limited and endothermic nature of the PDH reaction. Moreover, the development of advanced catalysts, such as those incorporating subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters encapsulated within zeolites, has significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability, leading to enhanced propylene selectivity and long-term stability, surpassing traditional Pt-based catalysts. The introduction of Cs+ ions further enhances the catalyst's regeneration stability, ensuring consistent performance after multiple cycles of activation and deactivation, thus addressing the limitations of conventional catalysts in terms of durability and efficiency.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources. Secondly, it enhances process efficiency by converting propane into propylene directly, bypassing the need for intermediate stages that are typically required in other production methods. Lastly, PDH improves product selectivity, ensuring a higher yield of propylene compared to traditional methods, which often suffer from lower selectivity leading to the production of unwanted byproducts. The use of better supports for stabilizing platinum species, as discussed in the literature, is a critical aspect of optimizing PDH processes, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and economic viability of propylene production through this method. Additionally, the introduction of cesium ions (Cs+) into the zeolite material can significantly improve the regeneration stability of the catalyst, allowing for sustained high performance over multiple cycles without significant loss in activity.
