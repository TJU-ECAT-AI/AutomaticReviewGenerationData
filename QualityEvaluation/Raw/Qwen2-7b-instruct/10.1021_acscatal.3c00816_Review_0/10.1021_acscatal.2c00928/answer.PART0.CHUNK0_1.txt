[1] "Silicalite-1 stabilizes Zn-Hydride species for efficient propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The PDH process allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, which significantly reduces energy consumption and improves process efficiency."
[3] "Compared to conventional production methods, PDH offers better product selectivity, as it avoids the formation of byproducts such as acetylene and carbon monoxide."
[4] "Propane is widely available as a feedstock, making PDH more accessible and cost-effective compared to other methods that require rarer or less abundant raw materials."
