The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include high energy efficiency, low environmental impact, and the ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges typically involve limited feedstock availability, high energy consumption, and lower product selectivity. PDH technology offers a more efficient and selective process for propylene production, potentially overcoming these limitations through the use of Silicalite-1 as a catalyst.
