<p>In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock.</p>
<p>There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the potential of ZrO2 for PDH from an applied viewpoint, we determined the space time yield of propene (STY(C3H6)) over the best performing catalyst from Fig. 1b at different temperatures and propane conversion above 25%.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity was about 90% (Supplementary Fig. 11).</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include its environmental friendliness due to utilizing natural or shale gas as feedstock, which contains fewer impurities compared to oil-based feedstocks. This makes PDH a more sustainable method for propylene production. Additionally, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability and process efficiency. By avoiding the need for oil-based feedstocks, PDH reduces reliance on fossil fuels and provides a cleaner source of propylene. In terms of process efficiency, PDH has been shown to perform well, with high propene yields and selectivities. For instance, the space time yield of propene (STY(C3H6)) over the best-performing catalyst was determined, and it demonstrated high productivity at different temperatures and propane conversions. Furthermore, the selectivity of propene reached about 90%, showcasing the technology's capability in producing propylene efficiently and with high purity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势包括其环境友好性，因为它使用天然气或页岩气作为原料，这些原料的杂质含量远少于基于石油的原料。这使得PDH成为生产丙烯的一种更可持续的方法。此外，PDH技术在解决传统生产方法面临的原料可用性和工艺效率问题方面表现出色。通过避免使用基于石油的原料，PDH减少了对化石燃料的依赖，并提供了一种更清洁的丙烯来源。从过程效率的角度来看，PDH显示出了良好的性能，具有高的丙烯产量和选择性。例如，通过对表现最佳催化剂进行了空间时间产率（STY(C3H6)）的测定，在不同的温度和丙烷转化率下，PDH显示出了高生产力。此外，丙烯的选择性达到了约90%，表明该技术能够高效并以高纯度生产丙烯。
