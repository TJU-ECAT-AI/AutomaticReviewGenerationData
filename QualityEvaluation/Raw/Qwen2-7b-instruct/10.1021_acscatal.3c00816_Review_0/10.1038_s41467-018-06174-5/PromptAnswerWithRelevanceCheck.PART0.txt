[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species."
[3] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane."
[4] "Controlling activity and selectivity of ZrO2 The scientific background for our study was the fact that the relative ratio of coordinatively unsaturated sites on the surface of metal oxides to their regular counterparts depends on the size of crystallites."
[5] "A further experimental support for the importance of the latter catalyst property for PDH is the fact that apparent activation energy of propene formation depends on the size."
[6] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[7] "As seen in Fig. 1a, the rate of propene formation in PDH decreased by a factor of up to 70 with an increase in the size from 7 to 45nm."
[8] "To this end, we performed catalytic tests with iso-butane, ethane and methane with the latter possessing the highest CH bond strength among alkanes."
[9] "Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size."
[10] "Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH utilizes natural/shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities compared to oil-based feedstock. This makes the process more environmentally friendly. Secondly, conventional methods often rely on catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species, which have drawbacks such as health risks associated with Cr(VI) and the cost and deactivation issues of Pt-based catalysts. PDH, on the other hand, has been developed using eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2. Thirdly, PDH demonstrates industrially relevant performance, surpassing state-of-the-art catalysts that contain CrOx, GaOx, VOx, or Pt species. The use of ZrO2 catalysts with optimized nanostructure allows for high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and iso-butane to produce propene. This technology also shows durability and stability over a broad range of propane conversion levels.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental benefits, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes natural or shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities compared to oil-based feedstock, making it more environmentally friendly. Additionally, PDH technology has been developed to meet the demand-supply gap for propene, which is crucial for the chemical industry. 

2. PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production that is less reliant on oil-based feedstocks, which are subject to market fluctuations and environmental concerns. The environmental friendliness of PDH stems from its utilization of cleaner feedstocks, thereby reducing the environmental impact associated with oil-based cracking technologies.

3. Conventional methods for propylene production often involve the use of chromium (Cr) or platinum (Pt) catalysts, which can pose health risks and have economic drawbacks. PDH technology, particularly when utilizing ZrO2 catalysts, offers a safer and more cost-effective solution. ZrO2-based catalysts, when properly designed, can achieve high activity in propylene production without the need for costly or hazardous metal promoters.

4. PDH technology provides an efficient means of converting propane into propylene, closing the gap between the demand and supply of this critical chemical intermediate. This efficiency is achieved through optimized catalyst design and operation, ensuring a reliable and consistent supply of propylene.

5. Commercial catalysts containing chromium oxide (CrOx), platinum (Pt), or other advanced materials often face limitations in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. In contrast, ZrO2-based catalysts, when tailored to maximize the concentration of active sites, demonstrate industrial relevance in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness. These catalysts offer a sustainable and economically viable alternative to traditional catalysts.

</quotes>

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental friendliness, efficient feedstock utilization, and high product selectivity. Unlike conventional production methods that rely on oil-based cracking, PDH utilizes natural/shale gas, which contains significantly fewer impurities, making it a more sustainable option. Propylene, being the second most important building block in the chemical industry, is produced efficiently through PDH, with an annual production of around 80 million metric tons. However, commercial catalysts often suffer from drawbacks, such as health risks associated with chromium and high deactivation costs linked to platinum. Recent advancements in eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts based on ZrO2, though requiring promoters like metal oxides and noble metals such as Ru or Rh, have shown high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, or iso-butane. This highlights the potential of PDH in addressing the challenges of conventional methods by offering a cleaner, more efficient, and selective process for propylene production.
