[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."
[3] "According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species."
[4] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane."
[5] "Bare ZrO2 designed especially to maximize the concentration of the active sites shows industrially relevant performance in comparison with commercial-like catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species and other alternative state-of-the-art catalysts."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental benefits, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes natural or shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities compared to oil-based feedstock, making it more environmentally friendly. Additionally, PDH technology has been developed to meet the demand-supply gap for propene, which is crucial for the chemical industry. 

2. PDH technology addresses the challenges of conventional methods by providing an alternative route for propylene production that is less reliant on oil-based feedstocks, which are subject to market fluctuations and environmental concerns. The environmental friendliness of PDH stems from its utilization of cleaner feedstocks, thereby reducing the environmental impact associated with oil-based cracking technologies.

3. Conventional methods for propylene production often involve the use of chromium (Cr) or platinum (Pt) catalysts, which can pose health risks and have economic drawbacks. PDH technology, particularly when utilizing ZrO2 catalysts, offers a safer and more cost-effective solution. ZrO2-based catalysts, when properly designed, can achieve high activity in propylene production without the need for costly or hazardous metal promoters.

4. PDH technology provides an efficient means of converting propane into propylene, closing the gap between the demand and supply of this critical chemical intermediate. This efficiency is achieved through optimized catalyst design and operation, ensuring a reliable and consistent supply of propylene.

5. Commercial catalysts containing chromium oxide (CrOx), platinum (Pt), or other advanced materials often face limitations in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. In contrast, ZrO2-based catalysts, when tailored to maximize the concentration of active sites, demonstrate industrial relevance in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness. These catalysts offer a sustainable and economically viable alternative to traditional catalysts.

1. PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它在环境上更为友好，并解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。与基于石油的裂解技术相比，PDH利用天然气或页岩气作为原料，这些原料的杂质含量远少于基于石油的原料，因此更环保。此外，PDH技术已经发展起来以解决丙烯需求与供应之间的差距，这对化学工业至关重要。

2. PDH技术通过提供一种替代途径来生产丙烯，这种途径依赖于清洁的原料，从而减少了与基于石油的裂解技术相关的环境影响。与传统的基于石油的裂解方法相比，PDH技术提供了替代的选择，它不需要依赖油基原料，这些原料容易受到市场波动和环境问题的影响。

3. 传统方法用于丙烯生产的催化剂通常包含铬（Cr）或铂（Pt），这可能带来健康风险和经济缺点。而基于ZrO2的催化剂，特别是当正确设计时，可以实现高活性的丙烯生产，无需昂贵或有害的金属促进剂。ZrO2基催化剂在丙烯生产中提供了更安全和成本效益的解决方案。

4. PDH技术提供了一种高效的方法将丙烷转化为丙烯，以缩小对这一关键化学中间体的需求与供应之间的差距。这种效率通过优化催化剂设计和操作得以实现，确保了丙烯的可靠和稳定的供应。

5. 商业催化剂含有铬氧化物（CrOx）、铂（Pt）或其他先进材料，往往面临着活动性、选择性和耐用性方面的限制。相比之下，通过特别设计以最大化活性位点浓度的ZrO2基催化剂，在性能和成本效益方面显示出工业相关性。这些催化剂为传统催化剂提供了可持续和经济可行的替代方案。
