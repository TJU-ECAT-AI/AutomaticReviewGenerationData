[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "This olefin is second to ethene as an important building block of the chemical industry with an annual production of about 80 million metric tons."
[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species."
[4] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane."
[5] "The present study elucidates at molecular level the effects of nanostructure of bare ZrO2 on the activity and selectivity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane or iso-butane to the corresponding olefins."

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental friendliness, efficient feedstock utilization, and high product selectivity. Unlike conventional production methods that rely on oil-based cracking, PDH utilizes natural/shale gas, which contains significantly fewer impurities, making it a more sustainable option. Propylene, being the second most important building block in the chemical industry, is produced efficiently through PDH, with an annual production of around 80 million metric tons. However, commercial catalysts often suffer from drawbacks, such as health risks associated with chromium and high deactivation costs linked to platinum. Recent advancements in eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts based on ZrO2, though requiring promoters like metal oxides and noble metals such as Ru or Rh, have shown high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, or iso-butane. This highlights the potential of PDH in addressing the challenges of conventional methods by offering a cleaner, more efficient, and selective process for propylene production.

1.PDH技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它更环保、利用原料效率高且产品选择性高。与依赖于含杂质较少的石油基裂解的传统生产方法不同，PDH使用天然气或页岩气作为原料，这些气体含有较少的杂质，因此更可持续。作为化学工业中第二重要的基础化学品，每年约有8亿吨的丙烯通过PDH生产出来。然而，商业催化剂存在一些问题，如铬可能引起健康风险，以及铂导致的成本高昂且活性降低。最近在基于ZrO2的环保和低成本催化剂方面取得的进展，虽然需要金属氧化物等促进剂和贵金属如Ru或Rh，但在非氧化性丙烷、正丁烷或异丁烷脱氢反应中显示出高活性，这表明PDH在应对传统方法面临的挑战方面的潜力，提供了一个更清洁、更高效、更具选择性的丙烯生产过程。
