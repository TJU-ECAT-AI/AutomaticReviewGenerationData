[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species."
[3] "To this end, we performed catalytic tests with iso-butane, ethane and methane with the latter possessing the highest CH bond strength among alkanes."
[4] "Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size."
[5] "All traditional catalysts with supported species of different metal oxides including chromium are less active than ZrO2."
[6] "Such positive effect holds over a broad range of propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 6)."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH utilizes natural/shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities compared to oil-based feedstock. This makes the process more environmentally friendly. Secondly, conventional methods often rely on catalysts containing CrOx or Pt species, which have drawbacks such as health risks associated with Cr(VI) and the cost and deactivation issues of Pt-based catalysts. PDH, on the other hand, has been developed using eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts based on ZrO2. Thirdly, PDH demonstrates industrially relevant performance, surpassing state-of-the-art catalysts that contain CrOx, GaOx, VOx, or Pt species. The use of ZrO2 catalysts with optimized nanostructure allows for high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, and iso-butane to produce propene. This technology also shows durability and stability over a broad range of propane conversion levels.

为了应对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具前景的方法，因为它具有几个关键优势，能够解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。首先，PDH使用天然气作为原料，其杂质含量远少于基于石油的原料，这使得该过程更加环保。其次，传统方法往往依赖于含CrOx或Pt物种的催化剂，这些催化剂存在与Cr(VI)相关的健康风险和Pt基催化剂的成本及失活问题。然而，PDH已发展出环保且成本效益高的基于ZrO2的催化剂。第三，PDH在工业相关性能方面表现出色，超过了包含CrOx、GaOx、VOx或Pt物种的最先进的催化剂。通过优化纳米结构使用ZrO2催化剂，在丙烷、乙烷和异丁烷的脱氢过程中产生丙烯时，能实现高活性和选择性。此外，这种技术在广泛的丙烷转化水平上也显示出持久性和稳定性。
