[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."
[2] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species."
[3] "Recently, we developed eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which had, however, to be promoted with metal oxides and contain supported Ru or Rh NP to show high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane or iso-butane."
[4] "Controlling activity and selectivity of ZrO2 The scientific background for our study was the fact that the relative ratio of coordinatively unsaturated sites on the surface of metal oxides to their regular counterparts depends on the size of crystallites."
[5] "A further experimental support for the importance of the latter catalyst property for PDH is the fact that apparent activation energy of propene formation depends on the size."
[6] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size."
[7] "As seen in Fig. 1a, the rate of propene formation in PDH decreased by a factor of up to 70 with an increase in the size from 7 to 45nm."
[8] "To this end, we performed catalytic tests with iso-butane, ethane and methane with the latter possessing the highest CH bond strength among alkanes."
[9] "Regardless of the size of ZrO2 crystallites, the activity order did not change, while the dehydrogenation rate of C2H6, C3H8 and iso-C4H10 increased with a decrease in the size."
[10] "Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is more environmentally friendly compared to oil-based cracking technologies due to the use of natural/shale gas as feedstock, which contains significantly fewer impurities. This makes it a more sustainable method for propylene production.

2. Commercial catalysts using CrOx or Pt species have flaws in terms of environmental impact and economic efficiency.

3. Eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts based on ZrO2 have been developed for PDH, though they require promotion with metal oxides to achieve high activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, or iso-butane.

4. The size of crystallites in ZrO2 affects its activity and selectivity in PDH, with smaller crystallites leading to increased activity and selectivity.

5. Controlling the activity of ZrO2 involves adjusting the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated sites on its surface, which depends on the size of crystallites.

6. The apparent activation energy of propene formation varies with the size of crystallites, supporting the importance of crystallite size in controlling PDH activity.

7. Smaller crystallites of ZrO2 lead to higher propene selectivity, as evidenced by increased selectivity with decreasing crystallite size.

8. The rate of propene formation in PDH decreases significantly with an increase in the size of ZrO2 crystallites, as shown in Fig. 1a.

9. Catalytic tests with various alkanes demonstrate that regardless of the alkane type, the activity order remains consistent, but the dehydrogenation rate of specific alkanes increases with smaller crystallite size.

10. Carbon deposits formed during PDH are not ideal, but they contribute to cost minimization by releasing heat upon combustion during catalyst regeneration, which can be used to offset the endothermic PDH reaction.

1. 相比于基于石油基裂解技术，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在化学工业中提供了大量C2C4烯烃，由于它们以天然/页岩气为原料，该原料的杂质含量远少于石油基原料。这使得它成为一种更环保的丙烯生产方法。

2. 商业催化剂使用CrOx或Pt物种存在环境影响和经济效率的问题。

3. 基于ZrO2的环保且成本效益高的催化剂已经开发出来，用于PDH，尽管它们需要通过添加金属氧化物来促进，以在非氧化性丙烷、正丁烷或异丁烷脱氢反应中显示出高活性。

4. ZrO2晶粒大小影响其PDH活性和选择性，较小的晶粒导致更高的活性和选择性。

5. 控制ZrO2的活性涉及调整表面协同未配位点的浓度，这依赖于晶粒大小。

6. 表观丙烯形成活化能随晶粒大小变化，支持晶粒大小对PDH活性的重要性。

7. 较小的晶粒尺寸导致更高的丙烯选择性，如图1a所示，丙烯形成速率随晶粒尺寸的减小而增加。

8. 不管烷烃类型如何，活动顺序保持一致，但特定烷烃的脱氢速率随晶粒尺寸减小而增加。

9. PDH过程中形成的碳沉积物虽然不是理想产物，但在催化剂再生阶段燃烧释放的热量可以用来抵消PDH反应的吸热过程，从而实现成本最小化。

10. 在PDH过程中形成的碳沉积物并非理想产物，但它们通过燃烧期间释放的热量对催化剂再生过程产生贡献，这种热量可用于抵消PDH反应的吸热过程，从而实现成本最小化。
