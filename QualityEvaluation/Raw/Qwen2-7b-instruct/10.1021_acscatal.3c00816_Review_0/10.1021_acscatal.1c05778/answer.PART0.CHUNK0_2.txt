Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for oxygen. This method addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, which often rely on fossil fuels as feedstocks, in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers a more sustainable solution by utilizing a wider range of hydrocarbons, including natural gas liquids, as feedstocks, thereby reducing dependence on traditional, finite resources. Moreover, PDH processes typically exhibit higher product selectivity, leading to a cleaner production of propylene with lower byproduct formation compared to conventional methods.
