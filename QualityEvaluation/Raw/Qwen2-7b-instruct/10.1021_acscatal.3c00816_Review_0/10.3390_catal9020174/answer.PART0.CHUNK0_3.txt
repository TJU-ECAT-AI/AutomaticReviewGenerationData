[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "In the present technology, the majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[3] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[4] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[5] "This behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
[6] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[7] "A Cr-based alumina supported catalyst is considered as one of the most important catalysts for this reaction due to their promising catalytic activity [6,8] however, the Cr is rather hazardous."
[8] "An alternative way is to replace by the Pt-based catalysts [10,11,12] and other non-noble metals, including Cu, Fe, Zn and VOx [13,14,15,16,17,18]."
[9] "Although the Pt-based catalysts exhibit an excellent activity, they still also suffer from disadvantages, such as a short catalyst lifetime due to the coke formation and the sintering of Pt clusters [19]."
[10] "Several strategies have been applied to improve the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts, including the addition of a second metal (e.g., Sn, Zn, Cu, Ce) as promoters [17,20,21,22,23], the development of the synthesis method to obtain small Pt nanoclusters such as the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique [24] and the development of metal-support interactions to change the electron density of Pt, which eventually leads to reducing the propylene adsorption, and then suppressing the further catalytic cracking [22,25,26,27,28]."
[11] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]."
[12] "However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]."
[13] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]."
[14] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."
[15] "Indeed, the acidity of supports also affects the propylene selectivity because of the interferences of the catalytic cracking and alkene oligomerization."
[16] "Therefore, an alternative way is to apply the concept of using the neutralized surface acidity with basic molecules [41] or the siliceous zeolite with a weak acid."
[17] "However, the lack of alumina in the zeolite framework results in the weak metal-support interaction, eventually leading to the aggregation of metal species [42,43]."
[18] "Thus, the development of alternative PDH catalysts, which exhibit the interplay between minimizing the acidity and increasing the surface interaction of support and metal species, is still a great challenge."
[19] "In the present study, we report the example of a highly selective propane dehydrogenation over monometallic nanoparticles supported on weakly acidic siliceous MFI-type zeolite having the hierarchical nanosheet structure."
[20] "This catalyst has been chosen since it not only benefits to the shape-selectivity of MFI structure that is preferable to propylene, but also suppresses the side catalytic cracking on acidic surfaces and prevents the aggregation of metal species owing to the presence of silanol defect sites, resulting in increasing the metal-support interaction."
[21] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."
[22] "In addition, its catalytic performance will be discussed in terms of the roles of metal-support interaction and acidity."
[23] "Finally, the degree of propylene selectivity can be easily adjusted by changing the loading content of metal and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional methods for propylene production. It addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

    - **Feedstock Availability**: PDH utilizes propane as the feedstock, which is abundant and readily available. This contrasts with conventional methods that rely on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons, which can be resource-intensive and less efficient in terms of propylene yield.

    - **Process Efficiency**: PDH is considered the most economical and shortest route for propylene production, offering a streamlined process that minimizes energy consumption and operational costs compared to alternative methods.

    - **Product Selectivity**: PDH produces propylene with high selectivity, avoiding the side reactions that occur in conventional methods. This results in a higher purity of propylene and reduced formation of byproducts like coke and methane, leading to enhanced efficiency and environmental sustainability.

    - **Catalyst Stability and Activity**: PDH employs advanced catalysts designed to maintain high activity and selectivity over prolonged operation times, mitigating the issues of catalyst deactivation seen in conventional processes. The use of Pt-based catalysts, particularly those supported on hierarchical silicalite-1 nanosheets, allows for improved metal-support interaction, reduced acidity, and minimized metal aggregation, contributing to longer catalyst life and better performance.

    - **Regulatory Compliance and Safety**: By reducing the reliance on hazardous materials like chromium (Cr) typically used in alumina-based catalysts, PDH technologies adhere to stricter environmental regulations and offer safer operations compared to traditional methods.

    - **Adaptability and Scalability**: The PDH process can be adapted to various scales, from pilot plants to commercial-scale facilities, offering flexibility in meeting market demands for propylene without significant modifications to existing infrastructure.
