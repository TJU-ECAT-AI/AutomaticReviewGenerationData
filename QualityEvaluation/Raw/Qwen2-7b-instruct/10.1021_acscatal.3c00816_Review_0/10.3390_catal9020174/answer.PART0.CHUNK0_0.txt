[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "This behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
[4] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."
[5] "The majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[6] "The relative high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[7] "Although the Pt-based catalysts exhibit an excellent activity, they still also suffer from disadvantages, such as a short catalyst lifetime due to the coke formation and the sintering of Pt clusters [19]."
[8] "Several strategies have been applied to improve the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts, including the addition of a second metal (e.g., Sn, Zn, Cu, Ce) as promoters [17,20,21,22,23], the development of the synthesis method to obtain small Pt nanoclusters such as the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique [24] and the development of metal-support interactions to change the electron density of Pt, which eventually leads to reducing the propylene adsorption, and then suppressing the further catalytic cracking [22,25,26,27,28]."
[9] "In the present study, we report the example of a highly selective propane dehydrogenation over monometallic nanoparticles supported on weakly acidic siliceous MFI-type zeolite having the hierarchical nanosheet structure."
[10] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its economic efficiency and shorter process duration compared to conventional production methods. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes propane, a readily available feedstock, to produce propylene, which is not dependent on the increasingly scarce and expensive crude oil feedstocks used in traditional methods.

2. Process Efficiency: The PDH process requires relatively high temperatures (above 550°C) to promote catalytic activity, which is efficient and avoids the need for multiple stages or additional reactions as in other methods.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH produces propylene with high selectivity, avoiding unwanted side-reactions such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation. This results in better product quality and higher yields of propylene.

4. Catalyst Performance: The use of Pt-based catalysts in PDH offers excellent activity, but challenges remain in maintaining catalyst lifetime and stability. Strategies such as adding promoters, developing synthesis methods for small Pt clusters, and improving metal-support interactions aim to enhance these aspects.

5. Hierarchical Structure: Incorporating a hierarchical nanosheet structure in the catalyst supports, as demonstrated in this study, improves metal dispersion and interaction, prevents aggregation of Pt clusters, and reduces side reactions, thereby increasing overall propylene selectivity and stability.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的主要优势包括其经济性和过程周期短。PDH通过以下方式具体解决传统生产方法面临的原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料来生产丙烯，这种原料比传统方法使用的稀缺且昂贵的原油更易于获取。

2. 过程效率：PDH过程需要较高的温度（超过550°C）来促进催化活性，这既高效又避免了其他方法中所需的多个阶段或额外反应。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH以高选择性生产丙烯，避免了热/催化裂解和焦炭形成等副反应，从而提高了产品质量和丙烯产量。

4. 催化剂性能：PDH中使用的铂基催化剂表现出优异的活性，但维持催化剂寿命和稳定性仍存在挑战。通过添加促进剂、开发合成小铂簇的方法以及改进金属支持相互作用等策略旨在增强这些方面。

5. 分级结构：在催化剂支撑材料中引入分级纳米片结构，如本研究中所示，可以改善金属分散度和相互作用，防止铂簇聚集，并减少副反应，从而提高整体丙烯选择性和稳定性。
