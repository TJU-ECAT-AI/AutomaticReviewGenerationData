[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "This behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
[4] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."
[5] "The majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[6] "The relative high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[7] "Although the Pt-based catalysts exhibit an excellent activity, they still also suffer from disadvantages, such as a short catalyst lifetime due to the coke formation and the sintering of Pt clusters [19]."
[8] "Several strategies have been applied to improve the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts, including the addition of a second metal (e.g., Sn, Zn, Cu, Ce) as promoters [17,20,21,22,23], the development of the synthesis method to obtain small Pt nanoclusters such as the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique [24] and the development of metal-support interactions to change the electron density of Pt, which eventually leads to reducing the propylene adsorption, and then suppressing the further catalytic cracking [22,25,26,27,28]."
[9] "In the present study, we report the example of a highly selective propane dehydrogenation over monometallic nanoparticles supported on weakly acidic siliceous MFI-type zeolite having the hierarchical nanosheet structure."
[10] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include its economic efficiency and shorter process duration compared to conventional production methods. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. Feedstock Availability: PDH utilizes propane, a readily available feedstock, to produce propylene, which is not dependent on the increasingly scarce and expensive crude oil feedstocks used in traditional methods.

2. Process Efficiency: The PDH process requires relatively high temperatures (above 550°C) to promote catalytic activity, which is efficient and avoids the need for multiple stages or additional reactions as in other methods.

3. Product Selectivity: PDH produces propylene with high selectivity, avoiding unwanted side-reactions such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation. This results in better product quality and higher yields of propylene.

4. Catalyst Performance: The use of Pt-based catalysts in PDH offers excellent activity, but challenges remain in maintaining catalyst lifetime and stability. Strategies such as adding promoters, developing synthesis methods for small Pt clusters, and improving metal-support interactions aim to enhance these aspects.

5. Hierarchical Structure: Incorporating a hierarchical nanosheet structure in the catalyst supports, as demonstrated in this study, improves metal dispersion and interaction, prevents aggregation of Pt clusters, and reduces side reactions, thereby increasing overall propylene selectivity and stability.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most economical and efficient method for propylene production due to its shorter process duration and lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane as a direct feedstock, requiring a high temperature to promote catalytic activity, and focusing on developing catalysts with high selectivity and stability in harsh operating conditions.

2. PDH technology overcomes the limitations of conventional production methods by utilizing propane as the feedstock, which offers a more abundant and diverse supply compared to the limited availability of hydrocarbons typically used in traditional processes. The high efficiency of PDH stems from its optimized process conditions that maximize propylene yield while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. Furthermore, PDH catalysts are designed to maintain high selectivity, ensuring that the majority of the reactants are converted into propylene rather than byproducts, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.

3. The use of promoter-free hierarchical Pt/Silicalite-1 nanosheets in PDH processes exemplifies an innovative approach that addresses the challenges of conventional catalysts by improving metal-support interactions, reducing the risk of metal aggregation, and suppressing unwanted side reactions. The hierarchical structure of the catalysts allows for better dispersion of active metal sites, thereby enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. Additionally, the presence of silanol defect sites within the silicalite-1 framework contributes to stronger metal-support interactions, preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters and maintaining a high level of selectivity for propylene production. This approach effectively mitigates the issues of coke formation and sintering associated with Pt-based catalysts, ensuring a longer catalyst lifetime and more efficient propylene production.

4. The PDH process employing Pt/Silicalite-1 nanosheets demonstrates improved catalytic performance by achieving a high activity with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1112.2 h\(^{-1}\) and maintaining a high selectivity of propylene above 95%, even after 12 hours of operation. This is in stark contrast to conventional silicalite-1 or alumina-based catalysts, which show lower activity and selectivity, as well as a faster deactivation rate. The ability to tune the degree of propylene selectivity by adjusting the metal loading and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) further underscores the flexibility and adaptability of this PDH technology. By optimizing these parameters, the process can be tailored to meet specific operational requirements and maximize propylene production efficiency.

5. The benefits of PDH technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods are multifaceted. Firstly, it utilizes a readily available feedstock, propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from natural gas, providing a sustainable and economically viable raw material. Secondly, the technology employs advanced catalyst design principles, such as the use of hierarchical structures and metal-support interactions, to enhance the efficiency of the process. This results in a more selective and stable catalyst that minimizes unwanted side reactions, such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which are common in conventional processes. Lastly, the ability to adjust the degree of propylene selectivity through operational parameters ensures that the process can be optimized for maximum efficiency and yield, making PDH technology a promising solution for the future of propylene production.

[9] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."
[10] "Considering the siliceous zeolite, the silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."
[11] "All H2-TPR results confirmed that the different nature of supports can alter the behaviors of reduced Pt species."
[12] "In strong contrast to this, the conventional silicalite-1 showed the significantly lower ratio of Q3 to Q4 (1.14) in the absence of Q2 characteristic (see Figure 2B)."
[13] "The decomposition of such Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 XPS peaks were used to analyze the predominant species in catalysts (Figure S4 and Table S1)."
[14] "Unfortunately, the binding energy (B.E.) of Pt 4f5/2 was very close to that of Al 2p in case of γ-alumina support [50]."
[15] "The reason of this higher negatively charge over the Pt4/Q3-MFI compared to the Pt4/Q4-MFI related to the improved charge-transfer from defects or silanol surfaces of zeolites to the Pt4 cluster."
[16] "This eventually leads to an increase in overall propylene selectivity over Pt supported silicalite-1 nanosheets."
[17] "In strong contrast to this, the conventional silicalite-1 (Pt/Si-MFI-CON) showed a much lower activity of the propane conversion with the TOF of 157.6 h1 with the propylene selectivity of 50%."
[18] "These results indicated that the nature of supports plays an important role in the selective production of light cracked hydrocarbons."
[19] "In addition, the lower adsorption energy of propylene on the Pt4/Q3-MFI model (29.5 kcal·mol1) compared to that of the Pt4/Q4-MFI model (36.1 kcal·mol1) indicated to a weaken adsorption strength of propylene from active site."
[20] "Obviously, at the low WHSV, the selectivity of propylene was decreased to 89% and the selectivity of cracked products was rather high (11%, Figure 4B)."
[21] "In strong contrast to this, the Pt supported catalyst exhibited the selectivity of propylene about 95.2%, although the low Pt loading of 0.5 wt.% was used."
[22] "Such an observation suggested that the Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheets containing 1 wt.% of Pt exhibited the superior performance in terms of propane activity and propylene selectivity."
[23] "In particular, they preferentially facilitate the side-reactions, such as catalytic cracking due to the presence of large Pt clusters and high acidity of supports for the Pt supported conventional silicalite-1 and commercial Pt/Al2O3, respectively."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic efficiency and the shortest route for propylene production. This method addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, making it a viable alternative to the traditional oil-based methods that rely on scarce resources like crude oil.
   
2. Process efficiency: By converting propane directly into propylene, PDH minimizes energy consumption and reduces the number of steps involved in propylene production compared to methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This results in a more efficient process that is less prone to energy-intensive side reactions.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technologies, such as those utilizing promoter-free hierarchical Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheets, offer high propylene selectivity, typically above 95%, even at moderate propane conversion levels. This high selectivity is crucial for maintaining purity and quality in propylene production, reducing the need for post-production purification processes.

PDH technology overcomes the limitations of conventional methods by providing a sustainable and economically viable route for propylene production that relies on abundant feedstocks, operates efficiently, and produces high-quality propylene with minimal waste and byproducts.

[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "This reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[4] "However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene."
[5] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites."
[6] "This catalyst has been chosen since it not only benefits to the shape-selectivity of MFI structure that is preferable to propylene, but also suppresses the side catalytic cracking on acidic surfaces and prevents the aggregation of metal species owing to the presence of silanol defect sites, resulting in increasing the metal-support interaction."
[7] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."
[8] "In addition, its catalytic performance will be discussed in terms of the roles of metal-support interaction and acidity."
[9] "In the present study, we report the example of a highly selective propane dehydrogenation over monometallic nanoparticles supported on weakly acidic siliceous MFI-type zeolite having the hierarchical nanosheet structure."
[10] "Therefore, the development of alternative PDH catalysts, which exhibit the interplay between minimizing the acidity and increasing the surface interaction of support and metal species, is still a great challenge."
