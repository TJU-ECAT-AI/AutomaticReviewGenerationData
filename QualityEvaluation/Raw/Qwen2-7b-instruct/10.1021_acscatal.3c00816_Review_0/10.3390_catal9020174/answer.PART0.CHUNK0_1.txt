[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity."
[3] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."
[4] "A Cr-based alumina supported catalyst is considered as one of the most important catalysts for this reaction due to their promising catalytic activity [6,8] however, the Cr is rather hazardous. An alternative way is to replace by the Pt-based catalysts [10,11,12] and other non-noble metals, including Cu, Fe, Zn and VOx [13,14,15,16,17,18]."
[5] "Although the Pt-based catalysts exhibit an excellent activity, they still also suffer from disadvantages, such as a short catalyst lifetime due to the coke formation and the sintering of Pt clusters [19]."
[6] "Several strategies have been applied to improve the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts, including the addition of a second metal (e.g., Sn, Zn, Cu, Ce) as promoters [17,20,21,22,23], the development of the synthesis method to obtain small Pt nanoclusters such as the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique [24] and the development of metal-support interactions to change the electron density of Pt, which eventually leads to reducing the propylene adsorption, and then suppressing the further catalytic cracking [22,25,26,27,28]."
[7] "A zeolite is one of the most interesting materials to be widely used as a support owing to its outstanding properties, such as a high surface area and a high thermal/hydrothermal stability [29,30]."
[8] "However, it often suffers from the metal aggregation on outer surfaces after the thermal treatment, resulting in a very low catalytic selectivity to propylene [31,32]."
[9] "To prevent the metal aggregation, the introduction of a mesoporous system into the microporous zeolite network can greatly improve the dispersion of metal species due to a large increasing number of defect sites [33]."
[10] "With the benefits of mesoporous or hierarchical structures [34,35], an improved catalytic efficiency has been observed in some reactions, in particular the processes involving bulky molecules, such as hydroisomerization, aromatization and hydrodesulfurization, as compared to a conventional zeolite [36,37,38,39,40]."
[11] "Indeed, the acidity of supports also affects the propylene selectivity because of the interferences of the catalytic cracking and alkene oligomerization."
[12] "Therefore, an alternative way is to apply the concept of using the neutralized surface acidity with basic molecules [41] or the siliceous zeolite with a weak acid."
[13] "However, the lack of alumina in the zeolite framework results in the weak metal-support interaction, eventually leading to the aggregation of metal species [42,43]."
[14] "In the present study, we report the example of a highly selective propane dehydrogenation over monometallic nanoparticles supported on weakly acidic siliceous MFI-type zeolite having the hierarchical nanosheet structure."
[15] "This catalyst has been chosen since it not only benefits to the shape-selectivity of MFI structure that is preferable to propylene, but also suppresses the side catalytic cracking on acidic surfaces and prevents the aggregation of metal species owing to the presence of silanol defect sites, resulting in increasing the metal-support interaction."
[16] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."
[17] "In addition, its catalytic performance will be discussed in terms of the roles of metal-support interaction and acidity."
[18] "Finally, the degree of propylene selectivity can be easily adjusted by changing the loading content of metal and the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most economical and efficient method for propylene production due to its shorter process duration and lower cost compared to traditional methods. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by utilizing propane as a direct feedstock, requiring a high temperature to promote catalytic activity, and focusing on developing catalysts with high selectivity and stability in harsh operating conditions.

2. PDH technology overcomes the limitations of conventional production methods by utilizing propane as the feedstock, which offers a more abundant and diverse supply compared to the limited availability of hydrocarbons typically used in traditional processes. The high efficiency of PDH stems from its optimized process conditions that maximize propylene yield while minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. Furthermore, PDH catalysts are designed to maintain high selectivity, ensuring that the majority of the reactants are converted into propylene rather than byproducts, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.

3. The use of promoter-free hierarchical Pt/Silicalite-1 nanosheets in PDH processes exemplifies an innovative approach that addresses the challenges of conventional catalysts by improving metal-support interactions, reducing the risk of metal aggregation, and suppressing unwanted side reactions. The hierarchical structure of the catalysts allows for better dispersion of active metal sites, thereby enhancing the selectivity and stability of the catalysts. Additionally, the presence of silanol defect sites within the silicalite-1 framework contributes to stronger metal-support interactions, preventing the aggregation of Pt clusters and maintaining a high level of selectivity for propylene production. This approach effectively mitigates the issues of coke formation and sintering associated with Pt-based catalysts, ensuring a longer catalyst lifetime and more efficient propylene production.

4. The PDH process employing Pt/Silicalite-1 nanosheets demonstrates improved catalytic performance by achieving a high activity with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1112.2 h\(^{-1}\) and maintaining a high selectivity of propylene above 95%, even after 12 hours of operation. This is in stark contrast to conventional silicalite-1 or alumina-based catalysts, which show lower activity and selectivity, as well as a faster deactivation rate. The ability to tune the degree of propylene selectivity by adjusting the metal loading and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) further underscores the flexibility and adaptability of this PDH technology. By optimizing these parameters, the process can be tailored to meet specific operational requirements and maximize propylene production efficiency.

5. The benefits of PDH technology in addressing the challenges of conventional propylene production methods are multifaceted. Firstly, it utilizes a readily available feedstock, propane, which is abundant and can be sourced from natural gas, providing a sustainable and economically viable raw material. Secondly, the technology employs advanced catalyst design principles, such as the use of hierarchical structures and metal-support interactions, to enhance the efficiency of the process. This results in a more selective and stable catalyst that minimizes unwanted side reactions, such as thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, which are common in conventional processes. Lastly, the ability to adjust the degree of propylene selectivity through operational parameters ensures that the process can be optimized for maximum efficiency and yield, making PDH technology a promising solution for the future of propylene production.
