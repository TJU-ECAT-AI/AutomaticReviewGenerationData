[1] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."
[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."
[3] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity. Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."
[4] "It is, therefore, a great challenge to develop this process, especially in terms of increasing the efficiency of catalysts exhibiting high selectivity and stability in such severe operating conditions for the industrial production of propylene."
[5] "The majority of propylene production is obtained as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons [1,2]."
[6] "Although the Pt-based catalysts exhibit an excellent activity, they still also suffer from disadvantages, such as a short catalyst lifetime due to the coke formation and the sintering of Pt clusters [19]."
[7] "Several strategies have been applied to improve the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts, including the addition of a second metal (e.g., Sn, Zn, Cu, Ce) as promoters [17,20,21,22,23], the development of the synthesis method to obtain small Pt nanoclusters such as the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique [24] and the development of metal-support interactions to change the electron density of Pt, which eventually leads to reducing the propylene adsorption, and then suppressing the further catalytic cracking [22,25,26,27,28]."
[8] "This catalyst has been chosen since it not only benefits to the shape-selectivity of MFI structure that is preferable to propylene, but also suppresses the side catalytic cracking on acidic surfaces and prevents the aggregation of metal species owing to the presence of silanol defect sites, resulting in increasing the metal-support interaction."
[9] "Compared to the conventional Pt supported zeolite, another side reaction such as an oligomerization is also suppressed in the presence of hierarchical structures due to shorten diffusion path lengths."
[10] "Considering the siliceous zeolite, the silicalite-1 nanosheets showed a relatively higher total pore volume (0.56 cm3·g1) than that of the conventional one (0.25 cm3·g1), while the micropore volume was in the same range (0.120.13 cm3·g1), indicating the presence of a large amount of meso- and macroporosity."
[11] "All H2-TPR results confirmed that the different nature of supports can alter the behaviors of reduced Pt species."
[12] "In strong contrast to this, the conventional silicalite-1 showed the significantly lower ratio of Q3 to Q4 (1.14) in the absence of Q2 characteristic (see Figure 2B)."
[13] "The decomposition of such Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 XPS peaks were used to analyze the predominant species in catalysts (Figure S4 and Table S1)."
[14] "Unfortunately, the binding energy (B.E.) of Pt 4f5/2 was very close to that of Al 2p in case of γ-alumina support [50]."
[15] "The reason of this higher negatively charge over the Pt4/Q3-MFI compared to the Pt4/Q4-MFI related to the improved charge-transfer from defects or silanol surfaces of zeolites to the Pt4 cluster."
[16] "This eventually leads to an increase in overall propylene selectivity over Pt supported silicalite-1 nanosheets."
[17] "In strong contrast to this, the conventional silicalite-1 (Pt/Si-MFI-CON) showed a much lower activity of the propane conversion with the TOF of 157.6 h1 with the propylene selectivity of 50%."
[18] "These results indicated that the nature of supports plays an important role in the selective production of light cracked hydrocarbons."
[19] "In addition, the lower adsorption energy of propylene on the Pt4/Q3-MFI model (29.5 kcal·mol1) compared to that of the Pt4/Q4-MFI model (36.1 kcal·mol1) indicated to a weaken adsorption strength of propylene from active site."
[20] "Obviously, at the low WHSV, the selectivity of propylene was decreased to 89% and the selectivity of cracked products was rather high (11%, Figure 4B)."
[21] "In strong contrast to this, the Pt supported catalyst exhibited the selectivity of propylene about 95.2%, although the low Pt loading of 0.5 wt.% was used."
[22] "Such an observation suggested that the Pt supported on silicalite-1 nanosheets containing 1 wt.% of Pt exhibited the superior performance in terms of propane activity and propylene selectivity."
[23] "In particular, they preferentially facilitate the side-reactions, such as catalytic cracking due to the presence of large Pt clusters and high acidity of supports for the Pt supported conventional silicalite-1 and commercial Pt/Al2O3, respectively."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its economic efficiency and the shortest route for propylene production. This method addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available, making it a viable alternative to the traditional oil-based methods that rely on scarce resources like crude oil.
   
2. Process efficiency: By converting propane directly into propylene, PDH minimizes energy consumption and reduces the number of steps involved in propylene production compared to methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This results in a more efficient process that is less prone to energy-intensive side reactions.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technologies, such as those utilizing promoter-free hierarchical Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheets, offer high propylene selectivity, typically above 95%, even at moderate propane conversion levels. This high selectivity is crucial for maintaining purity and quality in propylene production, reducing the need for post-production purification processes.

PDH technology overcomes the limitations of conventional methods by providing a sustainable and economically viable route for propylene production that relies on abundant feedstocks, operates efficiently, and produces high-quality propylene with minimal waste and byproducts.

在丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它在经济效率和最短的丙烯生产路径方面表现出色。这种方法以几种方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，该原料丰富且广泛可用，使其成为与依赖稀缺资源如原油的传统方法相比更可行的替代方案。

2. 工艺效率：通过将丙烷直接转化为丙烯，PDH减少了丙烯生产的步骤数量，与蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解等方法相比，这导致了一个更高效的工艺，其不太可能涉及能源密集型的副反应。

3. 产品选择性：使用无促进剂的分级Pt /硅酸盐-1纳米片等PDH技术可以提供高丙烯选择性，通常超过95%，即使在适度的丙烷转化水平上也是如此。这种高选择性对于保持丙烯生产的纯度和质量至关重要，从而减少了后处理过程对纯化的需求。

通过克服传统方法的局限性，PDH技术提供了一种可持续且经济的丙烯生产途径，依赖于丰富的原料、高效操作，并产生高质量的丙烯，同时产生的副产品和废物最少。
