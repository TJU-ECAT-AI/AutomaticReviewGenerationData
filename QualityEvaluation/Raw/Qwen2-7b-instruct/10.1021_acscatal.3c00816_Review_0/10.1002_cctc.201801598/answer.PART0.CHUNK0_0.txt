[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "Since the product of propene is an important feedstock in the manufacture of many chemicals, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."
[4] "Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."
[5] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."
[6] "In general, dehydrogenation reaction can be classified into oxidative and non-oxidative processes."
[7] "In fact, Cr supported on MCM-41 catalyst has been tested and proved to be a highly active catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[8] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing readily available propane feedstock, ensuring efficient conversion to propylene, and offering high product selectivity. Conventional methods often face issues with feedstock availability, especially as demand for propylene increases. PDH technology, by focusing on direct conversion of propane, ensures a stable supply chain. Process efficiency is enhanced as PDH technologies aim to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation, such as coke, which can hinder production in oxidative processes. Product selectivity is crucial for chemical manufacturing, and PDH offers the ability to produce propylene with high purity, optimizing downstream processes for specific chemical production needs.
