[1] "Growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "Since the product of propene is an important feedstock in the manufacture of many chemicals, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[3] "Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."
[4] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."
[5] "Cr-based catalysts are mainly tested in process."
[6] "On the one hand, various Cr catalysts with supports of Al2O3,6 ZrO2,7 and SiO28 have been studied."
[7] "It is accepted that the type of the support can influence the PDH catalytic activity, and mesoporous silica-based material, MCM-41, with high surface area and uniform pore size is preferentially used as support for a preparation of different kinds of catalysts."
[8] "Cr supported on MCM-41 catalyst has been tested and proved to be a highly active catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,9 and its application for dehydrogenation of isobutane and ethane has also been reported."
[9] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[10] "Moreover, the presence of oxidized surface Cr species with higher-valence state (e.g. Cr(VI)) seems to be necessary for the production of active Cr sites, and could be generally regarded as active centers."
[11] "It is considered that active Cr(VI) species predominate at low Cr loadings, while high loadings result in the formation of inactive Cr(III) species, as clusters and/or crystalline Cr2O3,9b,12 on which not all Cr sites are accessible to the reactants and producing negative effect on the catalytic activity."
[12] "Surprisingly, it is found that at high Cr loading, not all the Cr(VI) species are expectantly converted to inactive Cr(III) species."
[13] "Instead, some of the inactive Cr(VI) species regarded as isolated Cr(VI) species are observed on 15%Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[14] "These isolated Cr(VI) species, which exhibits difficulty to be reduced, cause the decreased activity for PDH process."
[15] "As far as we know, few reports are focused on investigating the presence of isolated Cr(VI) species and their effects on the catalytic activity of PDH reaction."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible propane, which is abundant in natural gas resources. This makes PDH a more sustainable and economical option compared to traditional methods that rely on scarce oil-based feedstocks. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to enhance process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene without the need for intermediate oxidation steps, which can introduce unwanted byproducts and inefficiencies. This streamlined process reduces energy consumption and waste production, contributing to higher yields and lower environmental impact. Lastly, PDH technology improves product selectivity, as it specifically targets the formation of propylene, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts such as coke. This selective conversion is crucial for optimizing the yield of valuable chemical feedstocks, making PDH a preferred method for propylene production in industries that require high-quality propylene for downstream chemical synthesis.
