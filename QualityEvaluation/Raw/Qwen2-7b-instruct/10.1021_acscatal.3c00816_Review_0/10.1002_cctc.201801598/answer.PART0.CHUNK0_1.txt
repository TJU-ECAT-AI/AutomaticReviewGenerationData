[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "Since the product of propene is an important feedstock in the manufacture of many chemicals, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."
[4] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."
[5] "Cr-based catalysts are mainly tested in process. On the one hand, various Cr catalysts with supports of Al2O3,6 ZrO2,7 and SiO28 have been studied."
[6] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[7] "Understanding the exact nature of active Cr species under PDH condition is critically important and seem to be the fundamental for controlling the catalyst properties."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. Feedstock availability: By utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, PDH offers access to a reliable and abundant resource. The recent conversion of propane from shale gas not only ensures a steady supply but also reduces costs and enhances the commercial viability of propylene production.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is gaining attention due to its potential for achieving higher efficiency in propylene production compared to oxidative processes. Oxidative processes can lead to safety issues and lower propene yields due to difficulty in controlling the oxidation degree. PDH, being a non-oxidative process, avoids these limitations and improves the overall efficiency of propylene production.

3. Product selectivity: The non-oxidative nature of PDH ensures better control over the selectivity of the desired product, propene, compared to oxidative processes. This leads to higher yields of propene, which is crucial for the production of downstream chemicals such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile.

1.PDH技术在与传统生产方法相比时的关键优势包括解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。PDH通过以下方式解决了这些挑战：

1. 原料可用性：利用丙烷作为主要原料，PDH提供了可靠且丰富的资源来源。从页岩气中转化丙烷不仅确保了稳定的供应，而且降低了成本，并提高了丙烯生产商业上的可行性。

2. 过程效率：PDH由于其在与氧化过程相比时可能实现更高的效率而受到关注。氧化过程可能会导致安全问题和较低的丙烯产量，这是由于难以控制氧化程度造成的。PDH作为非氧化过程，避免了这些限制，提高了丙烯生产的整体效率。

3. 产品选择性：与氧化过程相比，PDH能够更好地控制所需产品的选择性——丙烯，这导致了更高比例的丙烯产出。这对于下游化学品如丙烯氧化物、聚丙烯和丙烯腈的生产至关重要。
