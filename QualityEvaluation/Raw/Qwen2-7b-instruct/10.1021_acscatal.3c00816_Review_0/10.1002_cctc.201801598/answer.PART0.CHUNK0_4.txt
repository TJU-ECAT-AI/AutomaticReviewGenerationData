[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "Since the product of propene is an important feedstock in the manufacture of many chemicals, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."
[4] "Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."
[5] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."
[6] "In general, dehydrogenation reaction can be classified into oxidative and non-oxidative processes."
[7] "On the one hand, various Cr catalysts with supports of Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 have been studied."
[8] "It is accepted that the type of the support can influence the PDH catalytic activity, and mesoporous silica-based material, MCM-41, with high surface area and uniform pore size is preferentially used as support for a preparation of different kinds of catalysts."
[9] "Cr supported on MCM-41 catalyst has been tested and proved to be a highly active catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and its application for dehydrogenation of isobutane and ethane has also been reported."
[10] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."
[11] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."
[12] "But high Cr loadings are expected to cause the formation less active polymeric Cr(III) species."
[13] "The formation of inactive Cr(III) species is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups, which can provide anchoring sites for the stabilization of Cr(VI) species."
[14] "Consequently, some of the Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species, accompanied by the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups at higher Cr loadings."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, as it utilizes propane, which is increasingly sourced from abundant shale gas reserves, thus potentially lowering production costs. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to enhance process efficiency, particularly by avoiding the formation of coke, a byproduct of oxidative processes, which can introduce safety risks and reduce propene yields. Thirdly, PDH processes aim to improve product selectivity, making propylene production more efficient and cost-effective. Non-oxidative PDH processes have garnered significant attention and have been successfully commercialized, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.
