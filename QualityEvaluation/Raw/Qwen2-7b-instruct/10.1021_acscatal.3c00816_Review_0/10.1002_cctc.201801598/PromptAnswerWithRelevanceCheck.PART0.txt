The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing readily available propane feedstock, ensuring efficient conversion to propylene, and offering high product selectivity. Conventional methods often face issues with feedstock availability, especially as demand for propylene increases. PDH technology, by focusing on direct conversion of propane, ensures a stable supply chain. Process efficiency is enhanced as PDH technologies aim to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation, such as coke, which can hinder production in oxidative processes. Product selectivity is crucial for chemical manufacturing, and PDH offers the ability to produce propylene with high purity, optimizing downstream processes for specific chemical production needs.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. Feedstock availability: By utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, PDH offers access to a reliable and abundant resource. The recent conversion of propane from shale gas not only ensures a steady supply but also reduces costs and enhances the commercial viability of propylene production.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is gaining attention due to its potential for achieving higher efficiency in propylene production compared to oxidative processes. Oxidative processes can lead to safety issues and lower propene yields due to difficulty in controlling the oxidation degree. PDH, being a non-oxidative process, avoids these limitations and improves the overall efficiency of propylene production.

3. Product selectivity: The non-oxidative nature of PDH ensures better control over the selectivity of the desired product, propene, compared to oxidative processes. This leads to higher yields of propene, which is crucial for the production of downstream chemicals such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile.

1.PDH技术在与传统生产方法相比时的关键优势包括解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的挑战。PDH通过以下方式解决了这些挑战：

1. 原料可用性：利用丙烷作为主要原料，PDH提供了可靠且丰富的资源来源。从页岩气中转化丙烷不仅确保了稳定的供应，而且降低了成本，并提高了丙烯生产商业上的可行性。

2. 过程效率：PDH由于其在与氧化过程相比时可能实现更高的效率而受到关注。氧化过程可能会导致安全问题和较低的丙烯产量，这是由于难以控制氧化程度造成的。PDH作为非氧化过程，避免了这些限制，提高了丙烯生产的整体效率。

3. 产品选择性：与氧化过程相比，PDH能够更好地控制所需产品的选择性——丙烯，这导致了更高比例的丙烯产出。这对于下游化学品如丙烯氧化物、聚丙烯和丙烯腈的生产至关重要。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a widely available and abundant resource, especially from shale gas conversion. This makes PDH a more commercial and attractive option, leveraging the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide.

Secondly, PDH technology offers enhanced process efficiency compared to oxidative methods, particularly in avoiding the formation of coke, which can hinder the operation of reactors and require costly cleanup procedures. While oxidative processes are known for their ability to reduce coke formation, they face the challenge of difficulty in controlling the oxidation degree, leading to potential safety issues and lower propene yields.

Non-oxidative PDH processes have garnered significant attention and have been successfully implemented in commercial applications. Chromium (Cr)-based catalysts are prominently utilized in these processes due to their proven effectiveness in catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions. Research indicates that the redox cycle involving Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species plays a critical role in the activity of dehydrogenation reactions, highlighting the necessity of oxidized surface Cr species with higher valence states for the production of active Cr sites.

At low Cr loadings, active Cr(VI) species predominate, whereas at higher loadings, inactive Cr(III) species form, often as clusters or crystalline Cr2O3, which can negatively impact catalytic activity. The presence of inactive Cr(III) species, alongside the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups, is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups required for stabilizing Cr(VI) species. This results in a reduction of active Cr(VI) sites and a subsequent decrease in the overall catalytic performance.

However, a surprising finding is that at high Cr loadings, not all Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species. Instead, some inactive Cr(VI) species, termed as isolated Cr(VI) species, are observed on the catalyst. These isolated Cr(VI) species exhibit difficulty in being reduced, leading to a decrease in the activity for PDH processes. Understanding and investigating the characteristics of these isolated Cr(VI) species are crucial for optimizing the performance of Cr-based PDH catalyst systems.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它有几个关键优势。首先，PDH技术通过利用丙烷这一广泛可用且产量持续增长的资源，解决了传统生产方法在原料供应方面的挑战。特别是从页岩气转化而来，这使得PDH成为更具商业吸引力的选择，充分利用了全球大量和持续增长的页岩气产量。

其次，与氧化过程相比，PDH技术在效率方面更胜一筹，尤其是避免了形成焦炭的问题，这可以阻碍反应器的操作并需要昂贵的清理程序。虽然氧化过程因其减少焦炭形成的优点而受到青睐，但它们面临难以控制氧化程度的挑战，从而导致可能的安全问题和较低的丙烯产量。

非氧化PDH过程已经引起了广泛关注，并在商业应用中实现了成功实施。由于其在催化脱氢反应中的有效性，铬（Cr）基催化剂在这些过程中得到了突出使用。研究表明，Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的还原循环在脱氢反应活性中起着关键作用，表明更高价态表面Cr物种对于产生活性Cr位点的必要性，并且通常被视为活性中心。

在低Cr负载下，活性Cr(VI)物种占主导地位，而在高负载下，则形成不活跃的Cr(III)物种，通常为簇或结晶Cr2O3，这会负面影响催化性能。无法稳定Cr(VI)物种的硅表面羟基消耗会导致活性Cr(VI)位点减少和整体催化性能下降。

然而，令人惊讶的是，在高Cr负载下，并非所有Cr(VI)物种都转化为不活跃的Cr(III)物种。相反，在15%Cr/MCM-41催化剂上观察到一些不活跃的Cr(VI)物种，称为孤立的Cr(VI)物种。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种在被还原时表现出困难，导致PDH过程的活性降低。理解和调查这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种的特性对于优化Cr基PDH催化剂系统至关重要。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing readily accessible propane, which is abundant in natural gas resources. This makes PDH a more sustainable and economical option compared to traditional methods that rely on scarce oil-based feedstocks. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to enhance process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene without the need for intermediate oxidation steps, which can introduce unwanted byproducts and inefficiencies. This streamlined process reduces energy consumption and waste production, contributing to higher yields and lower environmental impact. Lastly, PDH technology improves product selectivity, as it specifically targets the formation of propylene, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts such as coke. This selective conversion is crucial for optimizing the yield of valuable chemical feedstocks, making PDH a preferred method for propylene production in industries that require high-quality propylene for downstream chemical synthesis.
