          [1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
          [2] "Since the product of propene is an important feedstock in the manufacture of many chemicals, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
          [3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."
          [4] "Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."
          [5] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."
          [6] "In general, dehydrogenation reaction can be classified into oxidative and non-oxidative processes."
          [7] "On the one hand, various Cr catalysts with supports of Al2O3, ZrO2, and SiO2 have been studied."
          [8] "However, to our best knowledge, few works are available in the literatures concerning PDH reaction over Cr/MCM-41 catalyst."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, ensuring efficient conversion to propylene, and offering high product selectivity. Conventional methods often face issues with feedstock availability, especially as demand for propylene increases. PDH offers access to a reliable and abundant resource through the utilization of propane, particularly from shale gas conversion. This not only ensures a steady supply but also reduces costs and enhances the commercial viability of propylene production. Process efficiency is enhanced as PDH technologies aim to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation, such as coke, which can hinder production in oxidative processes. Product selectivity is crucial for chemical manufacturing, and PDH offers the ability to produce propylene with high purity, optimizing downstream processes for specific chemical production needs.

          In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, it addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, as it utilizes propane, which is increasingly sourced from abundant shale gas reserves, potentially lowering production costs. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to enhance process efficiency, particularly by avoiding the formation of coke, a byproduct of oxidative processes, which can introduce safety risks and reduce propene yields. Thirdly, PDH processes aim to improve product selectivity, making propylene production more efficient and cost-effective. Non-oxidative PDH processes have garnered significant attention and have been successfully commercialized, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.
