[1] "Growing demand for propylene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."
[2] "Since the product of propene is an important feedstock in the manufacture of many chemicals, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."
[4] "Dehydrogenation reaction can be classified into oxidative and non-oxidative processes. Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."
[5] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."
[6] "Cr-based catalysts are mainly tested in process."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a widely available and abundant resource, especially from shale gas conversion. This makes PDH a more commercial and attractive option, leveraging the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide.

Secondly, PDH technology offers enhanced process efficiency compared to oxidative methods, particularly in avoiding the formation of coke, which can hinder the operation of reactors and require costly cleanup procedures. While oxidative processes are known for their ability to reduce coke formation, they face the challenge of difficulty in controlling the oxidation degree, leading to potential safety issues and lower propene yields.

Non-oxidative PDH processes have garnered significant attention and have been successfully implemented in commercial applications. Chromium (Cr)-based catalysts are prominently utilized in these processes due to their proven effectiveness in catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions. Research indicates that the redox cycle involving Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species plays a critical role in the activity of dehydrogenation reactions, highlighting the necessity of oxidized surface Cr species with higher valence states for the production of active Cr sites.

At low Cr loadings, active Cr(VI) species predominate, whereas at higher loadings, inactive Cr(III) species form, often as clusters or crystalline Cr2O3, which can negatively impact catalytic activity. The presence of inactive Cr(III) species, alongside the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups, is attributed to the consumption of silica surface hydroxyl groups required for stabilizing Cr(VI) species. This results in a reduction of active Cr(VI) sites and a subsequent decrease in the overall catalytic performance.

However, a surprising finding is that at high Cr loadings, not all Cr(VI) species are converted to inactive Cr(III) species. Instead, some inactive Cr(VI) species, termed as isolated Cr(VI) species, are observed on the catalyst. These isolated Cr(VI) species exhibit difficulty in being reduced, leading to a decrease in the activity for PDH processes. Understanding and investigating the characteristics of these isolated Cr(VI) species are crucial for optimizing the performance of Cr-based PDH catalyst systems.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它有几个关键优势。首先，PDH技术通过利用丙烷这一广泛可用且产量持续增长的资源，解决了传统生产方法在原料供应方面的挑战。特别是从页岩气转化而来，这使得PDH成为更具商业吸引力的选择，充分利用了全球大量和持续增长的页岩气产量。

其次，与氧化过程相比，PDH技术在效率方面更胜一筹，尤其是避免了形成焦炭的问题，这可以阻碍反应器的操作并需要昂贵的清理程序。虽然氧化过程因其减少焦炭形成的优点而受到青睐，但它们面临难以控制氧化程度的挑战，从而导致可能的安全问题和较低的丙烯产量。

非氧化PDH过程已经引起了广泛关注，并在商业应用中实现了成功实施。由于其在催化脱氢反应中的有效性，铬（Cr）基催化剂在这些过程中得到了突出使用。研究表明，Cr(VI)和Cr(III)物种之间的还原循环在脱氢反应活性中起着关键作用，表明更高价态表面Cr物种对于产生活性Cr位点的必要性，并且通常被视为活性中心。

在低Cr负载下，活性Cr(VI)物种占主导地位，而在高负载下，则形成不活跃的Cr(III)物种，通常为簇或结晶Cr2O3，这会负面影响催化性能。无法稳定Cr(VI)物种的硅表面羟基消耗会导致活性Cr(VI)位点减少和整体催化性能下降。

然而，令人惊讶的是，在高Cr负载下，并非所有Cr(VI)物种都转化为不活跃的Cr(III)物种。相反，在15%Cr/MCM-41催化剂上观察到一些不活跃的Cr(VI)物种，称为孤立的Cr(VI)物种。这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种在被还原时表现出困难，导致PDH过程的活性降低。理解和调查这些孤立的Cr(VI)物种的特性对于优化Cr基PDH催化剂系统至关重要。
