[1] "Despite the growing global demand for propylene, the conventional production methods face challenges in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity."
[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production."
[3] "PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more efficient use of feedstocks, particularly natural gas liquids (NGLs), which are abundant and readily available."
[4] "Compared to conventional methods, PDH technology improves process efficiency, allowing for higher yields of propylene and lower energy consumption."
[5] "PDH technology also enhances product selectivity, leading to a more consistent and higher-quality propylene output."
[6] "By directly converting propane into propylene, PDH bypasses the need for additional processing steps, simplifying the overall manufacturing process and reducing costs."
[7] "This technology is especially advantageous as it can utilize a wider range of feedstocks, including lighter hydrocarbons, which are more sustainable and less costly than traditional fossil fuels."
