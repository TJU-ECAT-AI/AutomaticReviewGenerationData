[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without the formation of coke, which is a common byproduct in conventional methods."
[2] "PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing a readily available and abundant resource—propane. This reduces the need for oil refining or coal gasification, which are more energy-intensive and less sustainable processes."
[3] "Compared to conventional production methods, PDH technology improves process efficiency by avoiding the formation of coke, which reduces the need for costly and energy-consuming regeneration steps. This leads to lower operating costs and a more streamlined production process."
[4] "PDH technology enhances product selectivity by specifically targeting the conversion of propane into propylene. This is achieved through optimized catalysts and reaction conditions, which minimize unwanted side reactions and maximize the desired product yield."
