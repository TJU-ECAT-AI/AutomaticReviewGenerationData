1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene without the formation of coke, addressing a key challenge of conventional methods. It also tackles the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available hydrocarbon, and enhances process efficiency by avoiding the energy-intensive steps required in traditional production methods.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over oxygen (ODH-O2) offers a pathway that sidesteps the formation of coke, which is a major concern in conventional dehydrogenation processes. This characteristic makes it particularly appealing for propylene production, as it ensures a cleaner and more efficient process.

3. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) has garnered academic interest due to its potential for utilizing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in a way that could lead to carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative propylene production processes. This approach addresses the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly methods of propylene production.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen dioxide (ODH-N2O) is the least studied reaction among the four processes reviewed. Progress in this area has not been significant in recent years, indicating that there is still room for innovation and improvement in this field.

1. 直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯而避免形成焦炭，解决了传统方法中的关键挑战，并且利用丙烷作为可获取的碳氢化合物，提高了过程效率，成为丙烯生产最具有前景的方法。

2. 丙烷氧脱氢（ODH-O2）提供了一条途径，可以完全避免焦炭的形成，这在传统的脱氢过程中是一个主要问题。这种特性使其特别吸引人，因为这确保了清洁和更高效的生产过程。

3. 丙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）已经引起了学术界的兴趣，因为它有可能利用二氧化碳，一种温室气体，在实现碳中性或甚至碳负向的丙烯生产过程中。这种方法满足了可持续和环保的丙烯生产方法的需求。

4. 丙烷与氮氧化物的氧化脱氢（ODH-N2O）是四类过程中研究最少的反应。近年来在此领域的进展并不显著，表明在这个领域仍然有改进和创新的空间。
