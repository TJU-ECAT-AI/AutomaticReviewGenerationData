[1] "Currently, the majority of propane is sourced from non-renewable feedstocks, but the industry has recognised the need to change and steps have been taken to develop processes for renewable propane to be generated."
[2] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially."
[3] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts."
[4] "ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia, due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes."
[5] "ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a pathway to produce propylene from renewable propane sources, thereby addressing issues related to feedstock availability and contributing to sustainability goals. PDH also aims to improve process efficiency and product selectivity, making it the most promising method for propylene production in the face of growing global demand.

2. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is currently the only commercially operated process for propylene production, indicating its practicality and effectiveness in meeting industrial needs.

3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over oxygen (ODH-O2) offers an advantage in avoiding coke formation, but until recently, the space-time yield (STY) of catalysts for this process was significantly lower than that of the direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDH) catalysts. This suggests that while ODH-O2 has potential benefits, it faces technical limitations that need to be addressed for commercial viability.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) has garnered academic interest due to its potential for utilizing carbon dioxide and enabling carbon-neutral or carbon-negative processes. This highlights its role in addressing environmental concerns associated with traditional propylene production methods.

5. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrogen oxide (ODH-N2O) is the least studied reaction among the processes reviewed. Its limited progress in recent years indicates that further research and development are needed to unlock its potential for propylene production.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术通过提供从可再生丙烷来源生产丙烯的途径，解决了传统生产方法面临的问题，如原料供应和可持续性目标。PDH旨在提高过程效率和产品选择性，使其成为满足全球增长需求的丙烯生产的最有可能的方法。

2. 目前，烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术是唯一实现商业运营的丙烯生产过程，表明其在满足工业需求方面的实用性和有效性。

3. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）过程避免了焦炭形成，但直到最近，用于此过程的催化剂的时空产率（STY）通常比直接脱氢烷烃（DDH）催化剂低一个数量级。这表明尽管ODH-O2具有潜在优势，但仍需要解决技术限制以实现商业化。

4. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）已引起学术界的关注，因为它利用二氧化碳并可能实现碳中和或碳负排放过程。这突显了它在解决传统丙烯生产过程中与环境有关的问题方面的作用。

5. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-N2O）是审查过程中研究最少的反应。近年来其进展有限，表明需要进一步的研究和发展来解锁其作为丙烯生产的潜力。
