[1] "The environmental and economic aspects of different existing propene production technologies are important considerations when reviewing the feasibility of newer technologies based on dehydrogenation."
[2] "In the case of SC a wide range of chemicals are made, and while these are ultimately utilised in the production of other chemicals, the % of propene formed from such a process is low. Equally, in the MTO process from coal or natural gas, the atom economy is limited by the generation of H2O as a by-product."
[3] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly process. It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is non-toxic and non-hazardous, and is highly atom-economic, meaning it maximizes the yield of propylene with minimal waste. This process can be adapted to use renewable feedstocks, such as bio-propane derived from biomass, thus addressing sustainability concerns.

2. Conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking have limitations in terms of atom economy and the use of toxic reactants. Steam cracking, for instance, involves high temperatures that produce a wide range of products, including propene, but also emits significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants. Methanol to olefins (MTO) processes, which utilize coal or natural gas as feedstocks, also have limited atom economy due to the generation of H2O as a by-product.

3. Propane direct dehydrogenation aligns with green chemistry principles by offering a highly atom-economic process that doesn't use toxic reactants or generate toxic by-products. It has the potential to utilize renewable feedstocks, which makes it more sustainable compared to conventional methods. However, the efficiency and selectivity of the process, particularly in terms of propylene yield, will determine its practicality as a viable alternative in the near and long term.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢方法通过提供更高效和环境友好的工艺来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。它使用无毒且非危险的丙烷作为原料，并具有高度的原子经济性，最大限度地提高了丙烯的产率，同时减少了废物。该过程可以适应使用可再生原料，如生物质来源的生物丙烷，从而解决可持续发展问题。

2. 传统的裂解方法和流化催化裂化在原子经济性和使用有毒反应物方面存在局限性。例如，蒸汽裂解涉及高温产生多种产品，包括丙烯，但也会排放大量CO2和其他污染物。煤或天然气为原料的甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程也由于生成水副产品而原子经济性有限。

3. 烷烃直接脱氢符合绿色化学原则，提供了一种高度原子经济的过程，不使用有毒反应物或产生有毒副产物。它有可能利用可再生能源，使其比传统方法更具可持续性。然而，过程的效率和选择性，特别是丙烯产率，将决定其作为替代品的实用性，在短期内和长期内。
