[1] "Despite SiO2 having a large surface area, and that many different types of silica supports have been tested, the low reactivity of silanol groups towards V precursors means that a relatively low loading of isolated V sites are reported."
[2] "This early work highlighted the importance of the VO bond in producing effective ODH-O2 catalysts."
[3] "It was shown that with increasing V content, the V environments went from isolated VO4 species to Mg3V2O8, and no crystalline V2O5 was detected, even with V loading levels of 25 wt% when using co-impregnation of V and Mg."
[4] "The increased dispersion led to an increased selectivity when compared to similar catalysts."
[5] "It was hypothesised that Na+ ions provide a source of SiONa+ surface species, which facilitate increased monomeric vanadia species, boosting the propane conversion."

1. The low reactivity of silanol groups on SiO2 towards vanadia precursors limits the loading of isolated vanadia sites, resulting in relatively low densities of such sites.

2. The presence of the VO bond in vanadia catalysts was crucial for their effectiveness in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

3. By co-impregnating vanadia and magnesium, a transition from isolated VO4 species to Mg3V2O8 occurred without the formation of crystalline V2O5, even at high vanadia loadings.

4. Increased dispersion of vanadia on the catalyst surface led to higher selectivity compared to similar catalysts.

5. Sodium ions were believed to provide a source of SiONa+ surface species, which facilitated the formation of more monomeric vanadia species, enhancing propane conversion.

1. SiO2上硅醇基团的低活性限制了向钒前体的反应，导致孤立钒位点的相对较低负载。

2. 钒催化剂中存在VO键对于丙烷氧化脱氢至关重要。

3. 在共浸渍钒和镁的情况下，从孤立的VO4物种过渡到Mg3V2O8发生，即使在高达25%的钒负载下也没有检测到结晶V2O5。

4. 钒在催化剂表面的分散性增加导致与相似催化剂相比更高的选择性。

5. 硫酸钠离子被认为是提供SiONa+表面物种的来源，这促进了更多单体钒物种的形成，提高了丙烷转化率。
