[1] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane can be catalysed by a broad range of metal oxides."
[2] "However, improvements in this sub-field of catalyst research has been incremental for some time and it is unlikely that a step-change in activity will be realised by further investigation."
[3] "Despite very impressive catalyst performance, investigations into Zn and Zr catalysts are very few."
[4] "More often than not, the origin of coke formation is due to strong acid/base sites on the support, or specific structures of the active component."
[5] "Careful preparations and appropriate promotors can help to neutralise coke formation, but this can come at the expense of propene selectivity or propane conversion."

The direct dehydrogenation of propane is catalysed by a variety of metal oxides, but advancements in this field have been gradual. There is potential for catalysts based on zinc (Zn) and zirconium (Zr) to perform exceptionally well, but there is a scarcity of research into these elements. Coke formation in dehydrogenation reactions often stems from acidic or basic sites on the catalyst's support or the structure of the active component. Countermeasures against coke formation can compromise propene selectivity or propane conversion.

直接丙烷脱氢作用于多种金属氧化物，但在这一领域的进步一直较为缓慢。锌(Zn)和锆(Zr)基催化剂展现出非常出色的性能，但对这两种元素的研究相对较少。在脱氢反应中，焦炭的形成通常归因于催化剂支撑上的酸性或碱性部位，或是活性成分的结构。对抗焦炭生成的措施可能会损害丙烯的选择性或丙烷的转化率。
