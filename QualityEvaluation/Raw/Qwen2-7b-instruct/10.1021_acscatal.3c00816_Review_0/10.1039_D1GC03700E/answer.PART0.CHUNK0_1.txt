[1] "Direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane: from catalyst design to industrial application The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."
[2] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."
[3] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."
[4] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[5] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."
[6] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[7] "However, in practice dehydrogenation will only be desirable as a means of producing propene if the reaction can operate efficiently, with minimal side-products and maximum yield. These factors are governed by the choice of catalyst, the main focus of the current review."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its environmental benefits, specifically lower energy consumption compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. It addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by enabling the use of renewable sources of propane, which is particularly relevant given the rise in interest in sustainable production methods. PDH also offers better process efficiency and product selectivity, making it an attractive alternative for propylene production.

2. The key advantages of PDH include its alignment with green chemistry principles, such as high atom economy, non-use of toxic reactants, and potential utilization of renewable feedstocks. These features make PDH a more sustainable option for propylene production compared to traditional methods.

3. The development of active, selective, and stable catalysts is crucial for PDH to become a viable process in the near and long term. The interest in PDH has grown due to the decreasing price of propane, driven by the discovery of shale gas reserves in North America. This has made PDH a more economically feasible process.

4. PDH satisfies many principles of green chemistry, including high atom economy and the absence of toxic reactants and by-products. However, the practical implementation of PDH requires efficient operation, minimal side-products, and maximum yield, which are largely determined by the choice of catalyst.
