[1] "Direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane: from catalyst design to industrial application The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."
[2] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
[3] "Overall, direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."
[4] "In comparison to Pt catalysts, CrOx catalysts generally exhibit lower STYs, although the most active CrOx catalysts (typically supported on Al2O3) are as active as moderate supported Pt catalysts."
[5] "Ga catalysts generally exhibit STYs that are one order of magnitude lower than Pt catalysts, and the most active CrOx catalysts, but have the advantage of being benign and inexpensive."
[6] "In summary, GaOx based catalysts are promising propane dehydrogenation candidates."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is environmentally preferred to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking due to lower energy consumption. It allows for the direct formation of propene from propane, which is used in the manufacturing of polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer. PDH satisfies principles of green chemistry, offering high atom-economy, avoiding toxic reactants and by-products, and potential utilization of renewable feedstocks.

2. The advantages of PDH technology include its environmental benefits, high atom-economy, and potential for utilizing renewable feedstocks. It addresses the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more sustainable process for propylene production. 

3. PDH technology is environmentally preferred to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking because it has lower energy consumption and avoids the production of toxic substances. It also allows for the direct formation of propene from propane, which is used in the manufacturing of polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer.

4. The most active CrOx catalysts, typically supported on Al2O3, are as active as moderate supported Pt catalysts in terms of space-time yield (STY). This indicates that PDH technology using CrOx catalysts can achieve comparable efficiency to Pt catalysts while potentially offering lower cost and environmental impact.

5. Ga catalysts, while not as active as Pt catalysts, offer the advantage of being benign and inexpensive, making them a promising candidate for propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that PDH technology using Ga catalysts can provide a cost-effective solution while addressing environmental concerns.

6. In summary, PDH technology is promising due to its ability to offer a sustainable and efficient process for propylene production, leveraging the advantages of renewable feedstocks, high atom-economy, and the potential use of benign catalysts like Ga.
