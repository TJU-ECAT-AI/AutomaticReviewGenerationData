[1] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially."
[2] "The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."
[3] "ODH-O2 offers a pathway that avoids the formation of coke entirely, but until recently, the STY typically reported in ODH-O2 catalysts such as supported vanadia were, with few exceptions, an order of magnitude below that of DDH catalysts."
[4] "ODH-CO2 has attracted interest, mostly in academia, due to the prospect of utilising CO2 and developing carbon neutral or carbon-negative processes."
[5] "ODH-N2O is the least studied reaction and progress has not been substantial in recent years."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses key challenges faced by conventional production methods. The main advantages are feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and widely available. The process is efficient, as it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for energy-intensive cracking or reforming steps. Product selectivity is high, ensuring a high yield of propylene with minimal byproducts.

2. Commercially, PDH technology relies heavily on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide catalysts. These catalysts are highly active but require frequent regeneration due to the formation of coke, a byproduct of deep dehydrogenation reactions. Coke formation necessitates costly and energy-intensive regeneration processes, impacting the overall efficiency and economic viability of PDH.

3. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using molecular oxygen (ODH-O2) presents an appealing alternative by avoiding coke formation entirely. Recent advancements have led to the development of boron-based catalysts that offer competitive selectivity and stability, particularly in comparison to traditional chromium or gallium-based catalysts. These catalysts can potentially achieve similar space time yields to those of conventional PDH methods, offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production route.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODH-CO2) represents a sustainable approach for propylene production. It utilizes CO2 as an oxidant, aligning with the pursuit of carbon-neutral or carbon-negative processes. Although catalyst performance is still evolving, the ability to utilize CO2 as a feedstock holds significant potential for reducing the carbon footprint of propylene production. However, the challenges in achieving high propene selectivity and efficient CO2 activation remain areas of active research.

5. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide (ODH-N2O) is the least explored among the four processes. Despite the potential for utilizing N2O as an oxidant, the economic feasibility is limited by the high cost and availability of N2O. Moreover, catalyst development has not progressed significantly in recent years, indicating that substantial advancements are required to make ODH-N2O a viable and economically attractive option for propylene production.

1.PDH技术在丙烯生产中脱颖而出，因为它解决了传统生产方法面临的关键挑战。主要优势在于原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。PDH使用丙烷作为原料，该原料丰富且广泛可用。该过程高效，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需进行能量密集型的裂解或重整步骤。产品的选择性很高，确保了高产率的丙烯，同时产生很少的副产品。

2. 商业化的PDH技术主要依赖于铬氧化物或铂与锡氧化物共促的催化剂。这些催化剂活性很高，但需要频繁再生以应对焦炭形成的问题。焦炭形成导致了昂贵且耗能的再生过程，影响了PDH的整体效率和经济可行性。

3. 使用分子氧的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-O2）提供了完全避免焦炭形成的途径。最近的发展导致了硼基催化剂的开发，这些催化剂相对于传统的铬或镓基催化剂具有竞争性的选择性和稳定性，特别是在与传统的PDH方法相比时。这些催化剂可能能够实现与传统PDH方法类似的时空产量，提供更有效且环境友好的丙烯生产途径。

4. 使用二氧化碳的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）代表了一种可持续的丙烯生产方法。它利用CO2作为氧化剂，符合追求碳中和或碳负排放过程的目标。尽管催化剂性能仍在发展中，利用CO2作为原料的能力为降低丙烯生产碳足迹提供了重大潜力。然而，实现高丙烯选择性和有效的CO2激活仍然是研究的重点领域。

5. 使用硝酸盐的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH-N2O）是四种过程中最不成熟的一种。尽管N2O作为氧化剂的潜力存在，但由于N2O的成本和可用性较高，其经济可行性受到限制。此外，近年来催化剂发展进展不大，表明需要显著的技术进步才能使ODH-N2O成为丙烯生产的一个可行且经济上有吸引力的选择。
