[1] "In view of catalyst design, the nature of the support is an essential consideration, due to the importance of metalsupport interactions and the influence of acid sites on the formation of different surface VOx species."
[2] "Despite SiO2 having a large surface area, and that many different types of silica supports having been tested, the low reactivity of silanol groups towards V precursors means that a relatively low loading of isolated V sites are reported."
[3] "It was shown that increasing the Mg content led to a decrease in strong acid sites, decreasing activity, consistent with the fact that strong acid sites can activate propene."
[4] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[5] "The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts."
[6] "The incorporation of a hydrogenation component (Pd) can improve the stability of this catalyst, however, loss of Sn metal under reaction conditions, as a consequence of its low melting point, requires further investigation into more suitable supports than SiO2."
[7] "A catalyst performance of V/SiO2 catalyst (with mass ratio of 1:12) displayed the optimal catalytic performance, achieving a superior initial propene yield of 59.5% and a stable propene selectivity of 90% over 6 h at 580 C."
[8] "The authors attributed this to increased dispersion of Co metal species, a consequence of the mild reoxidation conditions resulting in markedly smaller (6 nm) Co metal nanoparticles, contrary to those observed in the fresh (34 nm) and reduced counterparts (25 nm)."
[9] "The highest STY yield was observed over 10 wt% ZnO/ZSM-5 where the SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio was 280, which produced 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1."
[10] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."

1. The nature of the support plays a crucial role in the design of catalysts due to its impact on metal-support interactions and the formation of various VOx species on the surface.

2. Silica supports, despite their high surface area, are not ideal for vanadium catalysts due to the low reactivity of their silanol groups towards vanadium precursors.

3. Increasing magnesium content reduces strong acid sites, which in turn decreases the overall activity of the catalyst, as these sites can activate propene.

4. A V/Si-beta catalyst with 3 wt% vanadium loading showed a high initial propene yield and retained its activity over multiple dehydrogenation cycles.

5. Acidic supports enhance the activity of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.

6. Incorporating a hydrogenation component into the catalyst can improve its stability, but the low melting point of tin metal requires finding a more suitable support than silica.

7. A silica-supported vanadium catalyst with a 1:12 vanadium to silica mass ratio demonstrated the highest catalytic performance, yielding a superior initial propene output of 59.5% and maintaining a stable selectivity of 90% over 6 hours at 580°C.

8. The use of mild reoxidation conditions resulted in the formation of smaller cobalt nanoparticles (6 nm) with increased dispersion, compared to the fresh (34 nm) and reduced (25 nm) counterparts.

9. The highest space-time yield (STY) of 6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 was achieved over a 10 wt% zinc oxide on ZSM-5 catalyst with a SiO2:Al2O3 molar ratio of 280.

10. At an optimal vanadium loading of 12 wt%, the catalyst showed a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, affecting the proportions of V3+, V4+, and V5+ species on the surface.

1. 支持的性质在催化剂设计中至关重要，因为它影响金属-支持相互作用和表面VOx物种的形成。

2. 尽管硅酸盐具有高比表面积，但由于其硅醇基团对钒前体的低反应性，它们不是理想的钒催化剂支持。

3. 增加镁含量会减少强酸位点，从而降低催化剂的整体活性，因为这些位点可以激活丙烯。

4. 具有3 wt%钒负载的V/Si-beta催化剂显示出高的初始丙烯产率，并且在多次脱氢再生循环后保持其活性。

5. 酸性支持可以增强氧化脱氢化催化剂的活性。

6. 在催化剂中引入氢化成分可以提高其稳定性，但锡金属的低熔点要求找到一个比二氧化硅更合适的支撑材料。

7. 具有1:12钒与二氧化硅质量比的硅酸盐支持的钒催化剂显示出了最高的催化性能，实现了59.5%的最优初始丙烯产率，并在580°C下维持了90%的稳定选择性长达6小时。

8. 使用温和的氧化还原条件导致形成了6 nm的小颗粒钴（相比原始的34 nm和还原后的25 nm）并提高了分散度。

9. 通过在10 wt%锌氧化物/ZSM-5催化剂上使用SiO2:Al2O3摩尔比为280，获得了最高的空间时间产率（STY）6.3 molC3H6 kg1cat h1。
