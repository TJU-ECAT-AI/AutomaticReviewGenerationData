[1] "Direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane: from catalyst design to industrial application The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."
[2] "The majority of propene is used to manufacture polypropene, a recyclable thermoplastic polymer which is second only to polyethene in the scale of production."
[3] "The use of propane as a feedstock for PDH is advantageous because it is non-hazardous and easily separable from shale gas, offering a non-renewable source of propane."
[4] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[5] "The scarcity of some common catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on more abundant chemical elements."
[6] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. These advantages specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is easily separable from shale gas. This offers a non-renewable source of propane, unlike the fossil fuels used in conventional methods. The availability of propane as a feedstock ensures a steady supply for propylene production.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH is considered more energy-efficient compared to conventional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This is due to the direct formation of propene from propane, which reduces energy consumption and lowers CO2 emissions. The process is also less susceptible to the formation of byproducts like coke, which requires additional steps for regeneration.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH allows for the production of propene with high selectivity, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. This enhances the purity and quality of the propene, making it more suitable for various applications in the chemical industry.

The scarcity of certain catalytic elements is also discussed, with recommendations focusing on utilizing more abundant chemical elements. This addresses the sustainability of the PDH process by potentially reducing the dependency on rare and expensive materials.

Regardless of the dehydrogenation method used—non-oxidative PDH, oxidative PDH with oxygen, or oxidative PDH with CO2—the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance. This ensures optimal selectivity and efficiency in the dehydrogenation process, contributing to the overall viability of PDH technology in both the near and long term.

在全球对丙烯需求日益增长的背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了多项关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产最具前景的方法。这些优势专门解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。

1. **原料可用性**：PDH技术使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料可以从页岩气中轻易分离，提供了一种非可再生能源来源的丙烷。与传统方法使用的化石燃料相比，这确保了丙烯生产过程中的稳定供应。

2. **过程效率**：与蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解等传统过程相比，PDH被认为更节能，因为它是直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而减少了能源消耗并降低了二氧化碳排放量。该过程还较少产生如焦炭之类的副产品，后者需要额外步骤进行再生。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH允许以高选择性生产丙烯，最大限度地减少不希望产生的副产品的形成。这提高了丙烯的纯度和质量，使其更适合化学工业的各种应用。

也讨论了某些催化剂元素的稀缺性，建议使用更丰富的化学元素。这通过可能减少对稀有和昂贵材料的依赖来解决PDH过程的可持续性问题。

无论采用何种脱氢方法——无氧化PDH、氧气氧化PDH或二氧化碳氧化PDH——催化剂表面酸性和碱性位点的平衡至关重要。这确保了脱氢过程的最佳选择性和效率，为PDH技术在近期和长期的可行性做出了贡献。
