[1] "In light of the growing global demand for propylene, what are the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production, and how does it specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity?"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products. This technology specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is widely available and abundant. Process efficiency is improved because PDH directly converts propane into propylene, reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering costs. Product selectivity is enhanced as PDH produces high-purity propylene, meeting the stringent requirements of various industries. Additionally, PDH offers environmental benefits, such as reduced emissions compared to traditional methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需中间产物。这种技术通过利用广泛可用且丰富的丙烷，解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应问题。在过程效率方面，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，减少了能源消耗并可能降低了成本。产品选择性得到了提高，因为PDH产生高纯度的丙烯，满足各种行业的严格要求。此外，PDH还提供了环境优势，与传统方法相比，其排放量较低。
