<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products. This technology specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is widely available and abundant. Process efficiency is improved because PDH directly converts propane into propylene, reducing energy consumption and potentially lowering costs. Product selectivity is enhanced as PDH produces high-purity propylene, meeting the stringent requirements of various industries. Additionally, PDH offers environmental benefits, such as reduced emissions compared to traditional methods.
