<p>Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases.</p>
<p>Current, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process.</p>
<p>However, such catalysts still yet suffer from rapid deactivation easily.</p>
<p>To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx [9] ,[10] ,[11] , VOx [4] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] , GaOx [15] , and SnOx [16] , etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such catalysts still yet suffer from rapid deactivation easily.</p>
<p>Through analysis in-depth, the catalytic stabilities of catalysts strongly rely on the structural properties of metal active phases on the supports.</p>
<p>For instance, large Co3O4 crystallites formed over the CoOx/Al2O3 are easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of propane cracking reactions.</p>
<p>However, if the CoOx species are confined into the silanols of SiBeta support, the ultrasmall metallic Co formed in situ during the PDH reaction can become dehydrogenation active sites.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon is also reflected in the VOx-based catalysts.</p>
<p>Yan's group [18] has found that low-polymerized V(IV) species in the γ-Al2O3 support are more active than isolated V species in PDH reaction.</p>
<p>However, David et al. [19] has reported that the isolated VOx species in the MCM-41 perform superior activity than the oligomeric species.</p>
<p>To sum up, the complexity and uncontrollability in the chemical speciations of active phases (from isolated species, polymeric species to nanoclusters) on different supports have been always a roadblock for the further exploration of PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Based on the above status quo, some scholars' attention has turned to single-site catalysts in recent years, which play Lewis acid site role in the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>This strategy not only can realize the precise design of active sites in the catalysts, but also can allow to easily elucidate the PDH reaction route.</p>
<p>Miller et al. [20] ,[21] ,[22] has fabricated single-site Zn(II), Fe(II) and Co(II) on silica catalysts, which perform excellent propylene selectivity above 95%.</p>
<p>Further calculations with hybrid density functional theory support a non-redox mechanism for activation of CH and H-H bonds.</p>
<p>Yang et al. [23] also has reported γ-Al2O3 sheet-stabilized isolate Co2+ for catalytic PDH.</p>
<p>The catalyst has exhibited the catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction (propylene selectivity > 97%), owing to the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site stabilized on the γ-Al2O3, promoting propylene desorption to inhibit coke deposition and other byproducts and to free the active Co site.</p>
<p>Recently, Xiao's group [24] has designed single-site Fe(II) incorporated into silicalite-1 zeolite catalyst (FeS-1-EDTA), which performs high conversion of 26.3 %, high stability of 200 h and C2H4 selectivity of 97.5 % for ethane dehydrogenation, while it's not very effective for PDH (a conversion of 17.2% and C3H6 selectivity of 52.2%).</p>
<p>Seen from the reported studies, although both the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity are improved to some extent, the (intrinsic) catalytic activities of single-site catalysts are undesirable.</p>
<p>Stimulated by the aforementioned researches, Ni-based catalysts seem expected to solve the foregoing issue, mainly due to the superior ability in activating CH and HH bonds.</p>
<p>Such catalysts have been widely applied in dry reforming of methane and perform excellent catalytic performance.</p>
<p>While, few literatures have studied the supported Ni catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, mainly ascribed to be easily reduced to zerovalent Ni nanoparticles that usually exhibit poor stability, rapid coke deposition and low alkene selectivity.</p>
<p>To change this actuality, the Ni-based catalyst with a promoter (e.g., NiSn [29] , NiS [30] and NiP [31] , etc.) has been studied for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. It addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Unlike traditional methods that depend on expensive Pt and toxic Cr(VI) catalysts, PDH utilizes readily available and cheaper feedstocks, such as natural gas and shale, making it more sustainable and economically viable. Additionally, PDH offers higher process efficiency and product selectivity, particularly in producing propylene, compared to conventional routes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are energy-intensive and generate significant emissions.

2. PDH technology specifically tackles the issues of conventional production methods by providing an alternative route to propylene production that relies on more abundant and less expensive feedstocks. This approach not only reduces the dependency on high-cost materials like platinum and chromium but also minimizes the environmental impact associated with conventional methods. The enhanced selectivity for propylene in PDH processes contributes to more efficient use of resources and reduced waste generation, making it a more environmentally friendly option.

3. The complexity and variability in the chemical speciations of active phases (isolated species, polymeric species, and nanoclusters) on different supports pose a challenge to the development of PDH catalysts. These factors affect the stability and activity of catalysts, leading to difficulties in achieving optimal performance. The use of single-site catalysts, which can precisely control the active sites and elucidate the PDH reaction pathways, represents a promising direction to overcome these limitations. Single-site catalysts have demonstrated high propylene selectivity and stability, offering a viable solution to the challenges encountered in PDH technology.

4. Ni-based catalysts hold potential to address the issues in PDH technology, primarily due to their exceptional ability in activating C-H and H-H bonds. These catalysts have proven successful in applications such as dry reforming of methane, showcasing their robust catalytic performance. However, the lack of extensive research on the application of supported Ni catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation is attributed to the tendency of Ni nanoparticles to form, which exhibit poor stability, rapid coke deposition, and low alkene selectivity. By incorporating promoters into Ni-based catalysts, researchers aim to improve the stability and activity of these catalysts, making them more suitable for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
