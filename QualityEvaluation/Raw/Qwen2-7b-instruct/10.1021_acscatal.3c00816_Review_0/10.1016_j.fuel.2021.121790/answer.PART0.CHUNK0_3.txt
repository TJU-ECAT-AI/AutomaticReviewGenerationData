<p>Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] . Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] . In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] ,[5] ,[6] , etc., for propylene production are desirable.</p>

<p>Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases [4] ,[5] . Currently, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process [1] ,[7] ,[8] . Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions. Thus, developing alternative PDH catalysts with low-cost and eco-friendly are imperative.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production compared to traditional methods. These advantages include:

   - **Efficient use of feedstock**: PDH technology utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and inexpensive, particularly with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gas resources. This contrasts with conventional methods that typically require more expensive and less readily available feedstocks like naphtha and crude oil.

   - **Energy efficiency**: PDH processes are more energy-efficient than traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which require significant energy inputs. This makes PDH a more sustainable option for propylene production.

   - **Reduced environmental impact**: Traditional methods lead to higher CO2 and NOx emissions, whereas PDH processes aim to be more environmentally friendly by minimizing these pollutants. This aligns with the growing demand for cleaner industrial processes.

2. PDH specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods in several ways:

   - **Feedstock availability**: PDH uses propane, which is readily available and cost-effective, unlike the more expensive and scarce feedstocks required by traditional methods.

   - **Process efficiency**: PDH processes are designed to be more energy-efficient, reducing the overall energy consumption and associated costs compared to conventional methods.

   - **Product selectivity**: PDH processes offer better control over product selectivity, allowing for the targeted production of propylene with minimal by-products. This enhances the economic viability of the process and reduces waste.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的几个关键优势包括：

   - **高效利用原料**：PDH技术使用丙烷作为原料，这得益于对廉价页岩和天然气资源的日益探索。相比之下，传统方法通常需要更昂贵且难以获取的原料如石脑油和原油。

   - **能源效率**：PDH过程比传统的裂解和流化催化裂化等方法更加节能，减少了总体能源消耗和相关成本。

   - **降低环境影响**：传统方法导致更高的二氧化碳和氮氧化物排放，而PDH过程旨在通过减少这些污染物来实现更加环保。这符合对更清洁工业过程的需求。

2. PDH针对传统生产方法的挑战具体体现在以下几点：

   - **原料供应**：PDH使用丙烷，这是一种易于获取且成本低廉的原料，而传统方法通常需要更昂贵且稀缺的原料。

   - **过程效率**：PDH过程设计为更节能，与传统方法相比减少了总体能源消耗和相关成本。

   - **产品选择性**：PDH过程提供了更好的产品选择性控制，允许有针对性地生产丙烯，同时尽量减少副产品。这提高了过程的经济可行性并减少了浪费。
