[1] "Propyne as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.) [1] ."
[2] "Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand [2] ."
[3] "Not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes."
[4] "In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins [3] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [4] , etc., for propylene production are desirable."
[5] "Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions."

Answer: 

1. Propyne, used as a basic chemical raw material, is widely applied to produce downstream products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. PDH technology offers a promising method for propylene production.

2. Traditional methods, like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, derived from naphtha and crude oil, are facing challenges in meeting the increasing demand for propylene due to high energy consumption and increased emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants. PDH technology addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative.

答案：

1. 作为基本化学原料的丙炔被广泛应用于生产下游产品，如聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物和丙烯腈。PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了一种有前景的方法。

2. 传统的裂解方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）从石脑油和原油中提取丙烯，面临着无法满足日益增长的需求的问题，因为这些过程需要高能耗，并且会显著增加二氧化碳和氮氧化物等污染物的排放。PDH技术通过提供一种更节能和环保的替代方案来解决这些问题。
