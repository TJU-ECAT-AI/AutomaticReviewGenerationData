[1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases [4] ,[5] ."
[2] "Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions."
[3] "To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx [9] ,[10] ,[11] , VOx [4] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] , GaOx [15] , and SnOx [16] , etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction."
[4] "Nevertheless, such catalysts still yet suffer from rapid deactivation easily. Through analysis in-depth, the catalytic stabilities of catalysts strongly rely on the structural properties of metal active phases on the supports."
[5] "To change this actuality, the Ni-based catalyst with a promoter (e.g., NiSn [29] , NiS [30] and NiP [31] , etc.) has been studied for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "Stimulated by the aforementioned researches, Ni-based catalysts seem expected to solve the foregoing issue, mainly due to the superior ability in activating CH and HH bonds."
[7] "While, few literatures have studied the supported Ni catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, mainly ascribed to be easily reduced to zerovalent Ni nanoparticles that usually exhibit poor stability, rapid coke deposition and low alkene selectivity [27] ,[28] ."

[9] "Herein, we facilely fabricate the bimetallic Ni-Zn site anchored in the siliceous zeolite framework (silicalite-1, S-1) by ligand-protected method."
[10] "Under comparable conditions, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) exhibits superior catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with low deactivation rate (0.0778 h1) and great propylene selectivity (>90%) after 30 h on stream."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges faced by conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology utilizes cheap shale and natural gases, providing a more sustainable and abundant feedstock compared to traditional methods that often rely on limited resources like naphtha and crude oil. This makes PDH a more environmentally friendly option, reducing the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants associated with conventional processes. 

2. PDH technology specifically addresses the limitations of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient and cost-effective route to propylene. Unlike methods that depend on high-priced Pt and toxic Cr(VI) catalysts, PDH utilizes cheaper alternatives, reducing costs and enhancing economic viability. Moreover, PDH avoids the issues of rapid catalyst deactivation and the need for successive regeneration, which can lead to activity loss and increased CO2 emissions. By employing a variety of supported catalysts, such as those with active metal oxides, PDH demonstrates high activity and selectivity in propylene production, making it a promising alternative to conventional processes.

3. Despite the progress in PDH technology, challenges remain, particularly concerning catalyst stability. Traditional catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to metal sintering and coke deposition, which can compromise process efficiency. The document highlights the use of Ni-based catalysts as a potential solution, leveraging their superior ability to activate CH and HH bonds. These catalysts offer a way to overcome the limitations of conventional methods by maintaining high activity and selectivity, even under challenging conditions.

4. However, studies indicate that supported Ni catalysts face difficulties due to the ease of reduction to unstable nanoparticles, leading to poor stability, rapid coke deposition, and low alkene selectivity. The introduction of promoters like NiSn, NiS, and NiP has been explored to improve the stability and performance of Ni-based catalysts. These additives help maintain the catalyst's structure, enhancing its ability to resist sintering and coke formation, thus contributing to more efficient and reliable alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The document showcases a novel approach to PDH catalyst development through the synthesis of a bimetallic Ni-Zn site anchored in silicalite-1 (NiZn-S-1) via a ligand-protected method. This innovative design aims to leverage the synergistic effects between Ni and Zn to boost PDH performance. The catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic activity, stability, and propylene selectivity, highlighting the potential of bimetallic sites in enhancing the efficiency of PDH processes. This development opens new avenues for the creation of alternative, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly PDH catalysts that can compete with traditional methods while addressing their shortcomings.
