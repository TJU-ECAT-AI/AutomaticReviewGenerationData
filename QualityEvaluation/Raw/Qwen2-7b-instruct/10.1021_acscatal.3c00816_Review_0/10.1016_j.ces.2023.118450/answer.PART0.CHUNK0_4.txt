<p>The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene (Chen et al., 2021, Monai et al., 2021, Qu and Sun, 2022, Wang et al., 2022).</p>
<p>In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness (Dai et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022, Nakaya et al., 2020).</p>
<p>But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites (Jesper et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2021).</p>
<p>To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites (Motagamwala et al., 2021).</p>
<p>However, the harsh PDH reaction conditions are still a great challenge to the thermal stability of the catalysts (Wu et al., 2021, Ren et al., 2022), mainly manifested as the sintering of the active metals.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include efficient activation of CH bonds rather than CC bonds, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing a more sustainable and efficient way to produce propylene from propane, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods which may involve higher energy consumption, lower selectivity, and environmental concerns. The use of Pt catalysts in PDH offers significant advantages in terms of reactivity, but the issue of metal sintering and coke poisoning limits their effectiveness. The introduction of bimetallic catalysts through the addition of a second metal species helps to mitigate these issues, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the process. The harsh reaction conditions required for PDH pose challenges to catalyst stability, particularly concerning the sintering of active metals, which can lead to rapid deactivation and reduced product selectivity. PDH thus represents an innovative approach to propylene production that aims to optimize these aspects.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中被认为是极具前景的方法，其主要优势包括高效的CH键激活而非CC键激活、更长的反应寿命以及环境友好性。PDH能够通过提供一种从丙烷生产丙烯的更加可持续和高效的方式，解决传统生产方法面临的原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性等挑战。铂催化剂在PDH中的应用提供了显著优势，但金属聚集和焦碳污染的问题限制了其效果。通过引入二元催化剂并添加相邻铂位点的第二种金属元素，有助于缓解这些问题，增强过程的稳定性和选择性。PDH反应条件的苛刻性对催化剂稳定性构成了挑战，尤其是活性金属的聚集会导致快速失活和产品选择性的降低。因此，PDH代表了一种旨在优化这些方面的新颖的丙烯生产途径。
