<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene.</p>
<p>The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene (Chen et al., 2021, Monai et al., 2021, Qu and Sun, 2022, Wang et al., 2022).</p>
<p>In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness (Dai et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022, Nakaya et al., 2020).</p>
<p>To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites (Motagamwala et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500–700 °C) (Dai et al., 2021, Jesper et al., 2014, Zhu et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Moreover, the dispersion of active metal species also should be taken into consideration during the design of PDH catalysts. Lately, the bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts for its unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving the high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction (Zhang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2021, Camacho-Bunquin et al., 2018).</p>
<p>The emerging pre-transition metal elements (e.g., Ce, La, Y, etc.) as co-catalysts are also investigated due to their specific catalytic properties and a simple regeneration process (Park et al., 2021, Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020, Li et al., 2018, Zhu Chen et al., 2021).</p>
<p>The role of minimum Ga remained in the framework still to be investigated.</p>
<p>However, the development is hindered by the fact of synthetic challenges.</p>
<p>Specifically, the low chemical potential energy of the pre-transition metal oxides requires a high reduction temperature to enable alloy formation, as well as necessitating atomistic migration of rare-earth elements (REE) by the silanol nests inside the channels of the siliceous zeolite.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production include addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is particularly promising due to the heavy demand for propylene in the feedstock market. It offers efficient activation of CH bonds rather than CC bonds, longer reactive longevity, and environmental benefits compared to conventional production methods. Constructing bimetallic catalysts, especially by introducing pre-transition metal elements like cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), and yttrium (Y), enhances the catalytic properties and facilitates a simple regeneration process. These elements can form alloys with platinum (Pt) to improve stability and activity, addressing the need for high-energy activation processes typically required for propane dehydrogenation. The unique pore structure of bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts enables the creation of high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interactions, optimizing the PDH process. The use of cerium as a co-catalyst is advantageous due to its specific catalytic properties and ease of regeneration, although synthetic challenges remain in achieving optimal dispersion and alloy formation at low reduction temperatures.
