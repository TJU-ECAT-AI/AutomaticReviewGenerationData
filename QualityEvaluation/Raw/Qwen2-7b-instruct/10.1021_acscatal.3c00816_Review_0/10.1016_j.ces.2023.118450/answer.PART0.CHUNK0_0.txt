<p>Due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene, the on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years.</p>
<p>In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness.</p>
<p>But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites.</p>
<p>To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites.</p>
<p>The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C).</p>
<p>The harsh reaction conditions put forward a great requirement for catalyst performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important in terms of avoidance of adverse reactive pathways and structural design of the catalytic sites.</p>
<p>Typically, the metal species supported on the substrates containing Al can provide a stronger metal-support interaction in comparison with pure siliceous supports.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dispersion of active metal species also should be taken into consideration during the design of PDH catalysts.</p>
<p>Lately, the bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts for its unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving the high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction.</p>
<p>Specifically, the low chemical potential energy of the pre-transition metal oxides requires a high reduction temperature to enable alloy formation, as well as necessitating atomistic migration of rare-earth elements by the silanol nests inside the channels of the siliceous zeolite.</p>
<p>Herein, we utilize high-silica BEA topology zeolites to construct a stable PtCe nanoalloy catalyst for PDH reaction.</p>
<p>The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance because the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability. Conventional methods often rely on crude oil or natural gas as primary feedstocks, which are subject to price volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. In contrast, PDH utilizes propane, a widely available and more stable feedstock, making the production process more resilient to market fluctuations. Secondly, PDH technology offers higher process efficiency. By directly converting propane to propylene without intermediate stages, the process reduces energy consumption and streamlines the production line, leading to cost savings and improved operational efficiency. Lastly, PDH ensures better product selectivity. This means that the process is optimized to maximize the yield of propylene, a highly sought-after chemical, while minimizing the formation of byproducts or waste, thus enhancing the economic viability and sustainability of the production process.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具前景的方法，因为它具有几个关键优势。首先，它解决了传统生产方法在原料供应方面的挑战。传统方法通常依赖原油或天然气作为主要原料，这些原料价格波动大且存在地缘政治不确定性。相比之下，PDH利用广泛可用且更稳定的丙烷作为原料，使生产过程更能抵御市场波动。其次，PDH技术提供更高的过程效率。通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯而无需中间步骤，该过程减少了能源消耗并简化了生产线，从而节省成本并提高运营效率。最后，PDH确保了更好的产品选择性。这意味着优化过程以最大化丙烯的产量，同时最小化副产品的形成或废物，从而增强生产过程的经济性和可持续性。
