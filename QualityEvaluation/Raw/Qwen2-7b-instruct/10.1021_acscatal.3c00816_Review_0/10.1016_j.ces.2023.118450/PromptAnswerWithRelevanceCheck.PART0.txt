<p>Due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene, the on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years.</p>
<p>In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness.</p>
<p>But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites.</p>
<p>To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites.</p>
<p>The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C).</p>
<p>The harsh reaction conditions put forward a great requirement for catalyst performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important in terms of avoidance of adverse reactive pathways and structural design of the catalytic sites.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability. Conventional methods often rely on crude oil or natural gas as primary feedstocks, which are subject to price volatility and geopolitical uncertainties. In contrast, PDH utilizes propane, a widely available and more stable feedstock, making the production process more resilient to market fluctuations. Secondly, PDH technology offers higher process efficiency. By directly converting propane to propylene without intermediate stages, the process reduces energy consumption and streamlines the production line, leading to cost savings and improved operational efficiency. Lastly, PDH ensures better product selectivity. This means that the process is optimized to maximize the yield of propylene, a highly sought-after chemical, while minimizing the formation of byproducts or waste, thus enhancing the economic viability and sustainability of the production process.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in propylene production include addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is particularly promising due to the heavy demand for propylene in the feedstock market. It offers efficient activation of CH bonds rather than CC bonds, longer reactive longevity, and environmental benefits compared to conventional production methods. Constructing bimetallic catalysts, especially by introducing pre-transition metal elements like cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), and yttrium (Y), enhances the catalytic properties and facilitates a simple regeneration process. These elements can form alloys with platinum (Pt) to improve stability and activity, addressing the need for high-energy activation processes typically required for propane dehydrogenation. The unique pore structure of bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts enables the creation of high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interactions, optimizing the PDH process. The use of cerium as a co-catalyst is advantageous due to its specific catalytic properties and ease of regeneration, although synthetic challenges remain in achieving optimal dispersion and alloy formation at low reduction temperatures.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include efficient activation of CH bonds rather than CC bonds, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness. PDH specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity by providing a more sustainable and efficient way to produce propylene from propane, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods which may involve higher energy consumption, lower selectivity, and environmental concerns. The use of Pt catalysts in PDH offers significant advantages in terms of reactivity, but the issue of metal sintering and coke poisoning limits their effectiveness. The introduction of bimetallic catalysts through the addition of a second metal species helps to mitigate these issues, enhancing the stability and selectivity of the process. The harsh reaction conditions required for PDH pose challenges to catalyst stability, particularly concerning the sintering of active metals, which can lead to rapid deactivation and reduced product selectivity. PDH thus represents an innovative approach to propylene production that aims to optimize these aspects.
