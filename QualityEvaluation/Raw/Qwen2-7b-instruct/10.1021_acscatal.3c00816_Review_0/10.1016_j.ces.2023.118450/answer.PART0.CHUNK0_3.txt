<p>The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene.</p>
<p>In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness.</p>
<p>But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites.</p>
<p>To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites.</p>
<p>However, the harsh PDH reaction conditions are still a great challenge to the thermal stability of the catalysts.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important in terms of avoidance of adverse reactive pathways and structural design of the catalytic sites.</p>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology is considered the most promising method due to its direct conversion of propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive intermediate products. This method allows for a more streamlined production process, reducing costs and environmental impact. In terms of feedstock availability, PDH utilizes propane, which is widely available and inexpensive. Process efficiency is enhanced by minimizing energy consumption and waste generation, making PDH a more sustainable option compared to conventional production methods. Product selectivity is improved because PDH selectively converts propane to propylene, with minimal formation of byproducts. This selective conversion leads to higher yields of propylene, a key component in various petrochemical applications. Overall, PDH technology offers a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient means of propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by traditional methods.
