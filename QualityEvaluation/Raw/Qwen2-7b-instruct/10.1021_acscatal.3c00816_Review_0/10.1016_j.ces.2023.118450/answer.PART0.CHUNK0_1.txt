<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene.</p>
<p>In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness.</p>
<p>But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites.</p>
<p>To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites.</p>
<p>The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C).</p>
<p>The harsh reaction conditions put forward a great requirement for catalyst performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important in terms of avoidance of adverse reactive pathways and structural design of the catalytic sites.</p>
<p>Typically, the metal species supported on the substrates containing Al can provide a stronger metal-support interaction in comparison with pure siliceous supports.</p>
<p>But the surface exposed Al sites of Brnsted (B) acid sites are beneficial to the undesired side reactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dispersion of active metal species also should be taken into consideration during the design of PDH catalysts.</p>
<p>Lately, the bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts for its unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving the high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction.</p>
<p>Specifically, the low chemical potential energy of the pre-transition metal oxides requires a high reduction temperature to enable alloy formation, as well as necessitating atomistic migration of rare-earth elements by the silanol nests inside the channels of the siliceous zeolite.</p>
<p>Herein, we utilize high-silica BEA topology zeolites to construct a stable PtCe nanoalloy catalyst for PDH reaction.</p>
<p>It reveals that the different catalytic performance is caused by the regulation of metal-support interactions between PtCe species and supports.</p>
<p>The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance because the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology include its ability to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH offers a direct conversion of propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, thus providing a more efficient use of feedstock resources. This is particularly advantageous as the demand for propylene increases, ensuring a steady supply chain.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By avoiding the traditional petrochemical routes that involve multiple stages of processing, PDH streamlines the manufacturing process, leading to higher yields and lower operational costs. This efficiency is crucial in meeting the escalating demands for propylene in various industries.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH allows for a higher selectivity in propylene production compared to conventional methods. This is due to the optimized reaction conditions and catalyst design that minimize byproducts and maximize the desired propylene output. The selective conversion of propane to propylene ensures that the end product meets stringent quality standards required in diverse applications.

Answer: PDH technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its efficient use of feedstock, streamlined manufacturing processes, and high product selectivity, effectively addressing the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of resource utilization, operational efficiency, and yield optimization.
