[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively."
[2] "The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar."
[3] "The addition of promotor In made the reaction more selective to propylene, while the addition of Fe did not bring evident improvement on the propylene selectivity."
[4] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH utilizes readily available feedstocks such as methane, ethane, and propane sourced from natural gas, unlike conventional processes that often rely on expensive naphtha from oil refining. Secondly, PDH processes require less investment and offer easier integration with existing technologies, reducing overall costs and environmental impact. Lastly, PDH produces propylene through a simpler reaction pathway and avoids the formation of thermodynamically stable byproducts like COx, enhancing product selectivity and purity.

2. The Catofin process employs chromium on aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts, operated at pressures ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 bar. The Oleflex process uses platinum and tin on aluminum oxide (PtSn/Al2O3) catalysts at pressures of 13 bar. The STAR process, developed by Uhde, utilizes a different combination of catalyst materials and operates at a higher pressure of 56 bar.

3. The inclusion of the promoter In significantly boosts the propylene selectivity of the PDH process. This means that when In is added, the reaction becomes more efficient at producing propylene from propane, compared to the addition of Fe which does not notably improve propylene selectivity.

4. Despite the benefits of using promoters like In and Fe to enhance other aspects of the PDH process, such as catalytic activity and stability, these additives do not enhance the process's ability to resist coke deposition. Coke formation remains a significant challenge that affects the long-term performance and efficiency of PDH catalysts.

1. 烯丙直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够解决传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战，被认为是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法。首先，PDH利用来自天然气的易得原料，如甲烷、乙烷和丙烷，而传统的生产方法通常依赖于昂贵的石油精炼产生的石脑油。其次，PDH过程需要较少的投资，并且更容易与现有技术集成，从而降低总体成本和环境影响。最后，PDH通过更简单的反应路径产生丙烯，并避免形成如COx等热力学稳定的副产品，提高了产品的选择性和纯度。

2. Catofin工艺采用铝氧化物上的铬催化剂（Cr/Al2O3），在压力为0.2到0.5巴之间运行。Oleflex工艺使用铂和锡在铝氧化物上的催化剂（PtSn/Al2O3），在13巴的压力下运行。由Uhde开发的STAR工艺采用不同的催化剂材料组合，并在56巴的高压下运行。

3. 添加促进剂In显著提高了PDH过程的丙烯选择性。这意味着当In被添加时，反应更高效地从丙烷产生丙烯，相比之下，Fe的添加并没有明显提高丙烯的选择性。

4. 尽管使用In和Fe等添加剂来增强PDH过程的其他方面，如催化活性和稳定性，这些添加剂并不能增强过程抵抗焦炭沉积的能力。焦炭形成仍然是影响PDH催化剂长期性能和效率的主要挑战。
