[1] "However, the recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."
[2] "It thus becomes attractive to develop highly efficient catalytic processes for the production of value-added alkenes through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes."
[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants."
[4] "On the other hand, the addition of promotor In made the reaction more selective to propylene, while the addition of Fe did not bring evident improvement on the propylene selectivity."
[5] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes from natural gas production. It provides a more efficient way to produce value-added alkenes like propylene, which is crucial for various downstream products.

2. PDH technology specifically tackles the issue of feedstock availability by converting readily available light alkanes into valuable alkenes. It enhances process efficiency and product selectivity by optimizing the catalytic processes, ensuring a higher yield of desired products.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene can be performed in the presence or absence of oxidants, offering flexibility in the production process and potentially reducing environmental impact.

4. The introduction of promoter In improves propylene selectivity, meaning that the reaction becomes more efficient in producing propylene, with less waste or unwanted products.

5. Promoter In helps to stabilize the metallic Pt surface, forming a catalyst that is more efficient in dehydrogenation reactions. This leads to better stability and higher propylene selectivity compared to other promoters like Fe.
