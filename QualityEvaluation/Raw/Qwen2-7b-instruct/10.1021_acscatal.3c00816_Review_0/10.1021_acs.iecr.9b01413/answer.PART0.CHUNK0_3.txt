[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx."
[2] "Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage. In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
[3] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively."
[4] "The results showed that the nature of support could significantly affect the catalytic activity and the catalytic stability, and the coke deposition was much easier to occur over the acidic supports rather than the neutral or basic ones."
[5] "On the other hand, the strong interaction between metal and support may play the dominating role in improving the antisintering ability of active sites. Introduction of transition metal (Zn), (38) alkaline metal (Na, K), (39,40) alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), (31,41,42) and rare earth metal (La, Ce), (43,44) etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously."
[6] "The introduction of promotors did not change significantly the porous property but affected dramatically the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, etc., which finally acted differently in determining the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene and the catalytic stability."
