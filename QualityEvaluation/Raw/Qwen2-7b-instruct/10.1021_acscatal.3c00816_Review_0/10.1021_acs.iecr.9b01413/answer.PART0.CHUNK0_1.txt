[1] "The addition of the promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene."
[3] "Concerning the catalytic stability of propane dehydrogenation reaction, Pt/SSF showed good resistance to the coke deposition, while the sintering of metallic Pt was mainly responsible for the catalytic deactivation as suggested by H2-TPD measurements."
[4] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[5] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition."
[6] "FePt/SSF showed the highest level of coke deposition which was 5 times as many as Pt/SSF, and CePt/SSF showed the lowest level but still a little bit higher than the pristine one."
[7] "In order to explore more information on the role of promotor and to understand well the key factors that could affect the catalytic stability, the change in crystallite size during the reaction determined by XRD, the number of surface Pt species associated with the TPR and XPS, the quantity of deposited coke tested by running the TG measurements in diluted oxygen over the spent samples, and the variation of propane conversion were gathered in Figure 15 for a comparison study."
[8] "The best performance on catalytic stability was not obtained over the sample CePt/SSF which showed the best ability against coke deposition but over InPt/SSF which showed the moderate level of deposited coke and the maximum level of surface Pt species."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient use of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing abundant and economical sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane, operating at lower pressures, and focusing on simpler reactant and product distribution.

2. Lattice oxygen capacity, which is determined by the hydrogen consumed in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity and propylene yield in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The Pt/SSF catalyst shows good resistance to coke deposition, but the sintering of metallic Pt particles leads to catalytic deactivation, as indicated by hydrogen temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) measurements.

4. Promotors like Ce and In exhibit exceptional capability in preventing the growth of Pt crystallites under reaction conditions, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. This contrasts with the behavior of La and Fe promotors.

5. The introduction of promotors does not enhance the catalyst's resistance to coke deposition.

6. FePt/SSF demonstrates the highest level of coke deposition, being 5 times greater than that of the base Pt/SSF. CePt/SSF, while showing the lowest level of coke deposition, is still slightly higher than the pristine catalyst.

7. To explore the impact of promotors on catalytic stability, a comparative study was conducted, analyzing changes in Pt crystallite size, surface Pt species count, coke deposition quantity, and propane conversion variations.

8. The catalyst with the best catalytic stability performance did not show the highest coke deposition resistance, but rather the InPt/SSF catalyst, which had moderate coke deposition and the highest surface Pt species count.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢(PDH)技术通过更高效地利用原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性来解决传统生产方法面临的问题。它特别通过利用大量且经济的轻烷烃（如甲烷、乙烷和丙烷）作为原料，采用较低压力操作，并专注于简单反应物和产物分布来应对这些挑战。

2. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，晶格氧容量，由温度程序还原(TPR)测量中消耗的氢确定，对催化活性和丙烯产率起着关键作用。

3. Pt/SSF催化剂显示出良好的焦炭沉积抵抗性，但金属铂颗粒的聚集导致催化剂失活，这一过程由氢气温度程序脱附(H2-TPD)测量指示。

4. 像Ce和In这样的促导体表现出阻止铂晶粒在反应条件下生长的非凡能力，这从X射线衍射(XRD)结果中可以看出。这与镧和铁促导体的行为形成对比。

5. 引入促导体并没有增强催化剂对焦炭沉积的抵抗力。

6. FePt/SSF显示出最高的焦炭沉积量，是基础Pt/SSF的5倍。CePt/SSF虽然显示最低的焦炭沉积量，但仍略高于原始催化剂。

7. 为了探索促导体对催化稳定性的影响，进行了比较研究，分析了铂晶粒尺寸的变化、表面铂物种的数量、焦炭沉积量的测试以及在稀氧气氛下对耗尽样品进行热重分析测得的焦炭量，以及丙烷转化率的变化。

8. 表现出最佳催化稳定性性能的催化剂并未表现出最高程度的焦炭沉积抵抗性，而是InPt/SSF催化剂，其焦炭沉积量适中，表面铂物种数量最高。
