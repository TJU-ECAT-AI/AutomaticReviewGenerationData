[1] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively."
[2] "The Catofin process is operated at slightly positive atmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar, and the Oleflex process is usually operated at 13 bar, while the STAR process needs a higher pressure of 56 bar."
[3] "The addition of promotor In made the reaction more selective to propylene, while the addition of Fe did not bring evident improvement on the propylene selectivity."
[4] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH utilizes readily available feedstocks such as methane, ethane, and propane sourced from natural gas, unlike conventional processes that often rely on expensive naphtha from oil refining. Secondly, PDH processes require less investment and offer easier integration with existing technologies, reducing overall costs and environmental impact. Lastly, PDH produces propylene through a simpler reaction pathway and avoids the formation of thermodynamically stable byproducts like COx, enhancing product selectivity and purity.

2. The Catofin process employs chromium on aluminum oxide (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts, operated at pressures ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 bar. The Oleflex process uses platinum and tin on aluminum oxide (PtSn/Al2O3) catalysts at pressures of 13 bar. The STAR process, developed by Uhde, utilizes a different combination of catalyst materials and operates at a higher pressure of 56 bar.

3. The inclusion of the promoter In significantly boosts the propylene selectivity of the PDH process. This means that when In is added, the reaction becomes more efficient at producing propylene from propane, compared to the addition of Fe which does not notably improve propylene selectivity.

4. Despite the benefits of using promoters like In and Fe to enhance other aspects of the PDH process, such as catalytic activity and stability, these additives do not enhance the process's ability to resist coke deposition. Coke formation remains a significant challenge that affects the long-term performance and efficiency of PDH catalysts.

1. 烯丙直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够解决传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战，被认为是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法。首先，PDH利用来自天然气的易得原料，如甲烷、乙烷和丙烷，而传统的生产方法通常依赖于昂贵的石油精炼产生的石脑油。其次，PDH过程需要较少的投资，并且更容易与现有技术集成，从而降低总体成本和环境影响。最后，PDH通过更简单的反应路径产生丙烯，并避免形成如COx等热力学稳定的副产品，提高了产品的选择性和纯度。

2. Catofin工艺采用铝氧化物上的铬催化剂（Cr/Al2O3），在压力为0.2到0.5巴之间运行。Oleflex工艺使用铂和锡在铝氧化物上的催化剂（PtSn/Al2O3），在13巴的压力下运行。由Uhde开发的STAR工艺采用不同的催化剂材料组合，并在56巴的高压下运行。

3. 添加促进剂In显著提高了PDH过程的丙烯选择性。这意味着当In被添加时，反应更高效地从丙烷产生丙烯，相比之下，Fe的添加并没有明显提高丙烯的选择性。

4. 尽管使用In和Fe等添加剂来增强PDH过程的其他方面，如催化活性和稳定性，这些添加剂并不能增强过程抵抗焦炭沉积的能力。焦炭形成仍然是影响PDH催化剂长期性能和效率的主要挑战。

[1] "The addition of the promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene."
[3] "Concerning the catalytic stability of propane dehydrogenation reaction, Pt/SSF showed good resistance to the coke deposition, while the sintering of metallic Pt was mainly responsible for the catalytic deactivation as suggested by H2-TPD measurements."
[4] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."

[6] "FePt/SSF showed the highest level of coke deposition which was 5 times as many as Pt/SSF, and CePt/SSF showed the lowest level but still a little bit higher than the pristine one."
[7] "In order to explore more information on the role of promotor and to understand well the key factors that could affect the catalytic stability, the change in crystallite size during the reaction determined by XRD, the number of surface Pt species associated with the TPR and XPS, the quantity of deposited coke tested by running the TG measurements in diluted oxygen over the spent samples, and the variation of propane conversion were gathered in Figure 15 for a comparison study."
[8] "The best performance on catalytic stability was not obtained over the sample CePt/SSF which showed the best ability against coke deposition but over InPt/SSF which showed the moderate level of deposited coke and the maximum level of surface Pt species."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more efficient use of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing abundant and economical sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane, operating at lower pressures, and focusing on simpler reactant and product distribution.

5. The introduction of promotors does not enhance the catalyst's resistance to coke deposition.

6. FePt/SSF demonstrates the highest level of coke deposition, being 5 times greater than that of the base Pt/SSF. CePt/SSF, while showing the lowest level of coke deposition, is still slightly higher than the pristine catalyst.

7. To explore the impact of promotors on catalytic stability, a comparative study was conducted, analyzing changes in Pt crystallite size, surface Pt species count, coke deposition quantity, and propane conversion variations.

8. The catalyst with the best catalytic stability performance did not show the highest coke deposition resistance, but rather the InPt/SSF catalyst, which had moderate coke deposition and the highest surface Pt species count.

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx."
[2] "Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage. In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."
[3] "As far as the commercial PDH processes are concerned, the famous ones include the Catofin process owned by CB&I Lummus, Oleflex process developed by UOP, and STAR process developed by Uhde, where the Cr/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZnO-Al2O3 oxides catalysts are applied, respectively."
[4] "The results showed that the nature of support could significantly affect the catalytic activity and the catalytic stability, and the coke deposition was much easier to occur over the acidic supports rather than the neutral or basic ones."
[5] "On the other hand, the strong interaction between metal and support may play the dominating role in improving the antisintering ability of active sites. Introduction of transition metal (Zn), (38) alkaline metal (Na, K), (39,40) alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), (31,41,42) and rare earth metal (La, Ce), (43,44) etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acid-base property simultaneously."
[6] "The introduction of promotors did not change significantly the porous property but affected dramatically the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, etc., which finally acted differently in determining the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation for the production of propylene and the catalytic stability."
