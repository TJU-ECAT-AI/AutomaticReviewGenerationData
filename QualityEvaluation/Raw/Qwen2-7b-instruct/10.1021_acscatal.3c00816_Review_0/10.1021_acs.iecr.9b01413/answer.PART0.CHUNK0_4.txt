[1] "The introduction of promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation."
[3] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[4] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition. FePt/SSF showed the highest level of coke deposition which was 5 times as many as Pt/SSF, and CePt/SSF showed the lowest level but still a little bit higher than the pristine one."
[5] "All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates from 9.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat. compared with the base Pt/SSF sample (9.2 (μmol/s)/gcat.) and improved propylene generation rates from 8.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat.."
[6] "In this work, the In promoted catalyst InPt/SSF showed its good ability in improving the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, which also offered great potential for its application to the activation of light alkanes."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

2. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by utilizing abundant natural gas resources as feedstock, which is more economical and stable compared to traditional naphtha used in conventional processes. It simplifies the reactant and product distribution, reduces capital investment, and integrates more easily with existing technologies.

3. In the context of catalysts, the use of promoter metals such as cerium (Ce), indium (In), lanthanum (La), and iron (Fe) enhances the interaction between the support and Pt, improving the dispersion of active sites and reducing their aggregation. This leads to better initial activity and catalytic stability.

4. The lattice oxygen capacity, which is crucial for the initial conversion of propane to propylene, plays a significant role in determining the catalytic stability of PDH processes. Higher lattice oxygen capacity can lead to improved initial activity and propylene generation rates.

5. The promoters Ce and In demonstrate superior abilities in preventing the growth of Pt crystallites, which are critical in maintaining the stability of the active site. This is evidenced by the XRD results, where these promoters showed the least increase in crystallite size compared to the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts.

6. Despite not improving the ability to resist coke deposition, the introduction of promoters still enhances the catalytic performance of PDH processes. The In-promoted catalyst InPt/SSF exhibits particularly good stability, making it suitable for the activation of light alkanes.

1. 烯烃直接脱氢(PDH)技术被认为是丙烯生产最具前景的方法，因为它能够解决传统生产方法面临的几个关键挑战。这些挑战包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。

2. 在PDH技术中，利用丰富的天然气资源作为原料，与传统使用石脑油的工艺相比，成本更低且供应更稳定。它简化了反应物和产物的分布，减少了资本投资，并更容易与现有技术集成。

3. 在催化剂方面，使用铈(Ce)、铟(In)、镧(La)和铁(Fe)等促进剂可以增强支持物与Pt之间的相互作用，改善活性位点的分散并减少其聚集。这导致了更好的初始活性和催化稳定性。

4. 拉晶氧容量，在确定丙烷到丙烯的初始转换中起着重要作用，对确定催化稳定性至关重要。较高的拉晶氧容量可以提高初始活动性和丙烯生成速率。

5. Ce和In在防止铂晶粒生长方面显示出优越的能力，这是通过XRD结果证实的，其中这些促进剂的晶粒大小增加最少，与其他La-和Fe促进剂相比。

6. 尽管没有改善抵抗结焦的能力，但引入促进剂仍然提高了PDH过程的催化性能。In促进的催化剂InPt/SSF表现出特别好的稳定性，使其适用于轻烷烃的激活。
