1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its high propylene selectivity. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, which often suffer from high energy consumption, low propylene selectivity, and struggle to meet the increasing demand for propylene. The development of PDH technology aims to overcome these issues by providing a more efficient and selective process.

2. The use of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology has led to an increase in the abundance and affordability of propane. This abundance and affordability have made PDH a viable and promising route for propylene production, offering an advantage over traditional methods that rely on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

3. Conventional methods for propylene production, such as FCC and steam cracking of naphtha, face significant drawbacks including high energy consumption, low propylene selectivity, and difficulties in meeting the growing demand for propylene. PDH technology seeks to address these limitations by offering a more efficient and selective alternative.

4. Cobalt (Co)-based catalysts have gained attention in PDH due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high efficiency in activating C-H bonds. These factors contribute to the attractiveness of Co-based catalysts for PDH applications.

5. In the study conducted, various Co species over Silicalite-1 were synthesized through modifying heat-treatment atmosphere and evaluated for their performance in PDH. The TOF (turnover frequency) of Co-S-1-Ar catalyst was found to be nearly nine times higher compared to the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, highlighting the superiority of the former in PDH performance.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Propane is becoming more abundant and cheaper due to advancements in shale-gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies. PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the traditional sources of propylene production, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH has the potential to produce propylene with higher efficiency. The process involves converting propane into propylene through dehydrogenation, which can be more energy-efficient than the conventional FCC and steam cracking processes. This is particularly advantageous as it reduces the energy consumption required for propylene production.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional production methods. This means that a larger proportion of the output is propylene, which is more desirable for various chemical synthesis applications. The selectivity improvement is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for propylene in the petrochemical industry.

The document also highlights the importance of the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion in achieving high catalytic activity for PDH. It mentions that the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species, when incorporated into the zeolite framework, exhibit superior PDH catalytic performance. This is due to their ability to maintain stability during the reaction process and to effectively adsorb propane molecules, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and product selectivity.

In summary, PDH technology provides a promising solution for propylene production by offering advantages in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, particularly through the utilization of advanced catalysts like those containing Co2+ species.

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH leverages the abundance and decreasing cost of propane derived from shale-gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies, offering high propylene selectivity compared to traditional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, which suffer from high energy consumption and low propylene selectivity.

2. The synthesis of anti-reduction Co species is critical for achieving high-performance PDH, as their states of active site valence and metal dispersion significantly impact catalytic performance and product selectivity. The stabilization of Co2+ species by the γ-Al2O3 matrix through a one-step hydrothermal method has been reported to exhibit anti-reduction properties and excellent PDH catalytic performance.

3. The preparation of Co-based Silicalite-1 catalysts involves solid-phase grinding of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by heat-treatment at 550°C under different atmospheres: air, Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum. Oxygen-free calcination atmospheres lead to catalysts (Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum) that demonstrate superior PDH performance compared to those calcined in air (Co/S-1-Air).

4. The oxygen-free calcined catalysts exhibit a nine-fold increase in terms of turnover frequency (TOFCo) for PDH, highlighting the significant impact of calcination atmosphere on catalytic activity. This finding underscores the effectiveness of oxygen-free atmospheres in promoting the formation of stable Co2+ species integrated into the Silicalite-1 framework, which is responsible for the enhanced PDH performance.
