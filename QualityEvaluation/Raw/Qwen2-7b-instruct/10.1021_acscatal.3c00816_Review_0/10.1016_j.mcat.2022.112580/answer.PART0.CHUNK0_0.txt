<p>In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene.</p>
<p>The development of environmentally friendly and low-cost catalysts is widely investigated, while they still present a much lower catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Due to the earth abundance and low toxicity of Co, as well as the high-efficiency activating C-H, Co-based catalysts are attracting more and more attention in PDH.</p>
<p>In this work, different Co species over Silicalite-1 are synthesized via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere and investigated for PDH systematically.</p>

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its high propylene selectivity. This addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, which often suffer from high energy consumption, low propylene selectivity, and struggle to meet the increasing demand for propylene. The development of PDH technology aims to overcome these issues by providing a more efficient and selective process.

2. The use of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology has led to an increase in the abundance and affordability of propane. This abundance and affordability have made PDH a viable and promising route for propylene production, offering an advantage over traditional methods that rely on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

3. Conventional methods for propylene production, such as FCC and steam cracking of naphtha, face significant drawbacks including high energy consumption, low propylene selectivity, and difficulties in meeting the growing demand for propylene. PDH technology seeks to address these limitations by offering a more efficient and selective alternative.

4. Cobalt (Co)-based catalysts have gained attention in PDH due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high efficiency in activating C-H bonds. These factors contribute to the attractiveness of Co-based catalysts for PDH applications.

5. In the study conducted, various Co species over Silicalite-1 were synthesized through modifying heat-treatment atmosphere and evaluated for their performance in PDH. The TOF (turnover frequency) of Co-S-1-Ar catalyst was found to be nearly nine times higher compared to the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, highlighting the superiority of the former in PDH performance.

1.PDH技术因其高丙烯选择性被认为是生产丙烯最有前景的方法。这解决了传统生产方法面临的问题，如能耗高、丙烯选择性低以及无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。PDH技术旨在通过提供更高效、更选择性的过程来克服这些问题。

2. 石油页岩和天然气水合物提取技术的发展使得丙烷的储量更加丰富且成本更低廉。这种丰富的供应和低廉的成本使得PDH成为一种可行且有前景的丙烯生产途径，相对于依赖于裂化催化裂解（FCC）和石脑油蒸汽裂解的传统方法。

3. 传统的丙烯生产方法，如FCC和石脑油蒸汽裂解，面临着高能耗、低丙烯选择性和难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求等挑战。PDH技术寻求通过提供更高效、更选择性的替代方案来解决这些问题。

4. 由于其地壳资源丰富、毒性低以及高效的C-H键活化能力，钴（Co）基催化剂在PDH领域受到了越来越多的关注。这些因素促进了Co基催化剂在PDH应用中的吸引力。

5. 在研究中，通过调整热处理气氛合成了一系列位于沸石1号（Silicalite-1）上的不同Co物种，并对它们进行了PDH系统的性能评估。与包含氧气的煅烧催化剂相比，Co-S-1-Ar催化剂的TOF（周转频率）约为Co/S-1-Air催化剂的九倍，这凸显了前者的PDH性能优势。
