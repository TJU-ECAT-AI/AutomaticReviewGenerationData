          [1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."
          [2] "However, not all Co species possess prominent catalytic activity for PDH. It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly."
          [3] "Recently, Dai et al [13] reported the isolate Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix via one-step hydrothermal method, in which the Co2+ species exhibited anti-reduction and had excellent PDH catalytic performance."
          [4] "In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively."
          [5] "It is found that Co-S-1-Ar shows superior catalytic performance with the TOFCo of 41.9 h1 for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1), and the catalytic performance over Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum via the oxygen-free calcination atmosphere are similar with that of Co-S-1-Ar."
          [6] "The highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance, while bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air has much lower catalytic performance."
          [7] "And it is demonstrated that the enhanced catalytic activity over Co-S-1-Ar is attributed to the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into the zeolite framework via replacing the silanol nests under oxygen-free heat-treatment."

          1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH leverages the abundance and decreasing cost of propane derived from shale-gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies, offering high propylene selectivity compared to traditional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, which suffer from high energy consumption and low propylene selectivity.
          2. The synthesis of anti-reduction Co species is critical for achieving high-performance PDH, as their states of active site valence and metal dispersion significantly impact catalytic performance and product selectivity. The stabilization of Co2+ species by the γ-Al2O3 matrix through a one-step hydrothermal method has been reported to exhibit anti-reduction properties and excellent PDH catalytic performance.
          3. The preparation of Co-based Silicalite-1 catalysts involves solid-phase grinding of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by heat-treatment at 550°C under different atmospheres: air, Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum. Oxygen-free calcination atmospheres lead to catalysts (Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum) that demonstrate superior PDH performance compared to those calcined in air (Co/S-1-Air).
          4. The oxygen-free calcined catalysts exhibit a nine-fold increase in terms of turnover frequency (TOFCo) for PDH, highlighting the significant impact of calcination atmosphere on catalytic activity. This finding underscores the effectiveness of oxygen-free atmospheres in promoting the formation of stable Co2+ species integrated into the Silicalite-1 framework, which is responsible for the enhanced PDH performance.

          1. PDH技术被认为是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它能够解决原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH利用来自页岩气和天然气水合物提取技术的丰富且成本降低的丙烷，提供与传统生产方法（如FCC和石脑油蒸汽裂解）相比更高的丙烯选择性，这些传统方法在能量消耗和丙烯选择性方面存在限制。
          2. 合成抗还原钴物种对于实现高性能PDH至关重要，因为活性位点电荷状态和金属分散度显著影响催化性能和产物选择性。通过一步水热法制备γ-Al2O3基质中稳定化的Co2+物种，该物种表现出抗还原性和优异的PDH催化性能。
          3. 钴基SiO2-1催化剂的合成涉及钴前体和SiO2-1的固相研磨，随后在不同的气氛下进行热处理（空气、Ar、5%H2/Ar和真空）至550°C。无氧煅烧气氛导致催化剂（Co-S-1-Ar、Co-S-1-H2和Co-S-1-Vacuum）在PDH性能方面表现出优越性，与空气煅烧气氛制得的催化剂（Co/S-1-Air）相比。
          4. 无氧煅烧催化剂的TOFCo在PDH中的增加九倍，突显了煅烧气氛对催化活性的影响。这一发现强调了无氧气氛在促进整合到SiO2-1框架中的稳定Co2+物种形成的有效性，这正是增强PDH性能的关键。
