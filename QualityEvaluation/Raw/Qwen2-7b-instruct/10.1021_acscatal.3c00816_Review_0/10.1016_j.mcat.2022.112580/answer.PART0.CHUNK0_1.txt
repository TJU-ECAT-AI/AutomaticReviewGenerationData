[1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."
[2] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity."
[3] "However, not all Co species possess prominent catalytic activity for PDH. It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly."
[4] "It is found that Co-S-1-Ar shows superior catalytic performance with the TOFCo of 41.9 h1 for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1), and the catalytic performance over Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum via the oxygen-free calcination atmosphere are similar with that of Co-S-1-Ar."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. PDH specifically addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: With advancements in shale-gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies, the availability of propane has become more abundant and affordable. This makes propane an attractive feedstock for PDH, as opposed to traditional methods that often rely on expensive or less readily available materials.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers a higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha. This translates to a more efficient use of resources and energy, reducing waste and enhancing profitability.

3. Product selectivity: The ability to produce propylene with high selectivity is crucial for meeting the growing demand for this versatile chemical. PDH achieves this by optimizing the catalytic processes involved, leading to cleaner and more targeted production of propylene.
