The investigation into the different Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere for propane dehydrogenation Highlights • The anti-reduction Co species is synthesized via oxygen-free heat-treatment. • The TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air. • The highly dispersed Co2+ species are responsible for superior PDH performance. • The Co2+ species is generated via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages. Firstly, it addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability. Propane, being a more abundant and cheaper raw material, makes PDH a more viable option. Secondly, PDH processes, particularly those utilizing catalysts like those discussed, are more efficient, offering higher propylene selectivity. Lastly, the development of low-cost, highly active, and environmentally benign catalysts, such as the Co-based catalysts synthesized over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere, improves the overall process efficiency and economic viability of PDH technology.
