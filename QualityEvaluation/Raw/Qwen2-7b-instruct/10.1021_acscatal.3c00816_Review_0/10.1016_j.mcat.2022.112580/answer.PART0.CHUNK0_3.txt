[1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."
[2] "However, not all Co species possess prominent catalytic activity for PDH. It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly."
[3] "Recently, Dai et al [13] reported the isolate Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix via one-step hydrothermal method, in which the Co2+ species exhibited anti-reduction and had excellent PDH catalytic performance."
[4] "In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively."
[5] "It is found that Co-S-1-Ar shows superior catalytic performance with the TOFCo of 41.9 h1 for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1), and the catalytic performance over Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum via the oxygen-free calcination atmosphere are similar with that of Co-S-1-Ar."
[6] "The highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance, while bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air has much lower catalytic performance."
[7] "And it is demonstrated that the enhanced catalytic activity over Co-S-1-Ar is attributed to the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into the zeolite framework via replacing the silanol nests under oxygen-free heat-treatment."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in the following ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Propane is becoming more abundant and cheaper due to advancements in shale-gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies. PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the traditional sources of propylene production, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. **Process Efficiency**: PDH has the potential to produce propylene with higher efficiency. The process involves converting propane into propylene through dehydrogenation, which can be more energy-efficient than the conventional FCC and steam cracking processes. This is particularly advantageous as it reduces the energy consumption required for propylene production.

3. **Product Selectivity**: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional production methods. This means that a larger proportion of the output is propylene, which is more desirable for various chemical synthesis applications. The selectivity improvement is crucial for meeting the increasing demand for propylene in the petrochemical industry.

The document also highlights the importance of the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion in achieving high catalytic activity for PDH. It mentions that the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species, when incorporated into the zeolite framework, exhibit superior PDH catalytic performance. This is due to their ability to maintain stability during the reaction process and to effectively adsorb propane molecules, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and product selectivity.

In summary, PDH technology provides a promising solution for propylene production by offering advantages in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, particularly through the utilization of advanced catalysts like those containing Co2+ species.

针对全球日益增长的丙烯需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，以应对传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战：

1. **原料可用性**：由于页岩气和天然气水合物提取技术的进步，丙烷变得越来越丰富且成本更低。PDH技术利用丙烷作为原料，与传统的丙烯生产方法（如流化催化裂解（FCC）和石脑油蒸汽裂解）相比，原料更易于获取。

2. **过程效率**：PDH技术有可能以更高的效率生产丙烯。该过程涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯通过脱氢，这可能比传统FCC和蒸汽裂解过程更节能。这对于降低丙烯生产所需的能源消耗至关重要。

3. **产品选择性**：PDH技术提供更高的丙烯选择性，相较于传统生产方法。这意味着输出中更大的比例是丙烯，这对于各种化工合成应用更为有利。提高选择性的改进对于满足对丙烯不断增长的需求至关重要。

文献还强调了活性位点电荷状态和金属分散度在实现PDH高效催化剂活性方面的重要性。它提到，当四面体配合的Co2+物种被整合到沸石骨架中时，它们显示出出色的PDH催化性能。这是由于它们在反应过程中保持稳定的能力以及有效地吸附丙烷分子，从而增强催化活性和产品选择性。

综上所述，PDH技术通过提供原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等优势，为丙烯生产提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是通过利用先进催化剂如含Co2+物种的催化剂。
