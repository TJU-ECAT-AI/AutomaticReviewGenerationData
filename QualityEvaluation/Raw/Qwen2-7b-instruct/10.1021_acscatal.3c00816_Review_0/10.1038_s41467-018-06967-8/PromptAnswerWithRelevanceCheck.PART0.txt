[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, the screening of new catalyst can be simply guided by the Sabatier principle. It indicates that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that leads to surface poisoning, nor too weak which fails to activate the reactants1."
[3] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity4."
[4] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane11."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently12."
[6] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis13."
[7] "However, SACs do not find broad application in high temperature (>500C) light alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[8] "To the best of our knowledge, high stability and selectivity have not been achieved for the PDH reaction with the use of single-atom Pt catalysts."
[9] "Based on the theoretical analysis, we design and synthesize the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina via an atomic dilution method and confirm the formation of Pt/Cu SAA through detailed characterizations."
[10] "Subsequent catalytic tests demonstrate the transferability from DFT calculations to practical catalytic reaction and the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6molg1Pth1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520C, WHSV=4h1, C3H8/N2=1/1."

In response to the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available. Secondly, PDH offers superior process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene without the need for intermediate chemical reactions, unlike traditional methods that involve multiple steps and higher energy consumption. Lastly, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, specifically enhancing propylene selectivity while maintaining a high propane conversion rate. This is achieved through the innovative use of single atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pt/Cu SAA, which breaks the scaling relationship, thereby improving both the activity and selectivity for propylene production, while maintaining excellent stability under high-temperature conditions.

Answer: The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which make it the most promising method for propylene production, include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products, unlike conventional methods that rely on multiple steps and reactants. This direct conversion enhances process efficiency. Additionally, PDH offers greater flexibility in feedstock selection, as it can utilize a wide range of hydrocarbons, including natural gas, refinery gases, and even bio-propane, expanding its applicability and reducing dependence on traditional oil-based sources. The enhanced selectivity and activity in PDH, achieved by breaking the scaling relationship, ensure a higher yield of propylene with fewer side reactions, improving both the economic viability and environmental impact of the production process. By developing catalysts that can simultaneously improve activity and selectivity, PDH technology aims to overcome limitations in conventional methods, making it a promising solution for propylene production.
