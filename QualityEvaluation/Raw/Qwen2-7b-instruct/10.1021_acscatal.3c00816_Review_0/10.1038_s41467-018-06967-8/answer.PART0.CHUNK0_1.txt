[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, the screening of new catalyst can be simply guided by the Sabatier principle."
[3] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity for the target product."
[4] "Herein, we describe an approach to breaking the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation, an industrially important reaction, by assembling single atom alloys (SAAs), to achieve simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion."
[5] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

In response to the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock, which is abundant and readily available. Secondly, PDH offers superior process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene without the need for intermediate chemical reactions, unlike traditional methods that involve multiple steps and higher energy consumption. Lastly, PDH technology ensures high product selectivity, specifically enhancing propylene selectivity while maintaining a high propane conversion rate. This is achieved through the innovative use of single atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pt/Cu SAA, which breaks the scaling relationship, thereby improving both the activity and selectivity for propylene production, while maintaining excellent stability under high-temperature conditions.

面对全球对丙烯的日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中脱颖而出，成为最具前景的方法，因为它在几个关键方面优于传统的生产方法。首先，PDH技术通过将丙烷作为主要原料来解决原料供应问题，这种原料丰富且易于获取。其次，PDH提供了更高的过程效率，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需中间化学反应，这与传统方法相比，这些方法涉及多个步骤和更高的能耗。最后，PDH技术确保了高产品选择性，特别是通过提高丙烯选择性的同时保持较高的丙烷转化率。这一目标是通过创新使用单原子合金（SAAs），尤其是Pt/Cu SAA，实现的，它打破了比例关系，从而提高了丙烯生产的活动性和选择性，同时在高温条件下保持了出色的稳定性。
