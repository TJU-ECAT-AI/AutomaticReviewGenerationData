[1] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."
[2] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane11."
[3] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[4] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity for the target product."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently12."

Answer: The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which make it the most promising method for propylene production, include addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH directly converts propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products, unlike conventional methods that rely on multiple steps and reactants. This direct conversion enhances process efficiency. Additionally, PDH offers greater flexibility in feedstock selection, as it can utilize a wide range of hydrocarbons, including natural gas, refinery gases, and even bio-propane, expanding its applicability and reducing dependence on traditional oil-based sources. The enhanced selectivity and activity in PDH, achieved by breaking the scaling relationship, ensure a higher yield of propylene with fewer side reactions, improving both the economic viability and environmental impact of the production process. By developing catalysts that can simultaneously improve activity and selectivity, PDH technology aims to overcome limitations in conventional methods, making it a promising solution for propylene production.
