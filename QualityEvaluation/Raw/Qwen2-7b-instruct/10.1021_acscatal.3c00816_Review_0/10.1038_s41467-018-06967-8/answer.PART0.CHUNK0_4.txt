[1] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."
[2] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[3] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications26,29,37,38,39, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream at 520C."

Answer: The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to produce propylene efficiently and selectively. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. By using PtM alloys, including PtCu, the PDH process can achieve enhanced propylene selectivity and intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane, overcoming the scaling relationship issues common in conventional catalysts. The Pt/Cu single atom alloy, in particular, offers high propylene selectivity with excellent stability, making it a promising method for propylene production.
