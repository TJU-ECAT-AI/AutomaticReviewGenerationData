[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, the screening of new catalyst can be simply guided by the Sabatier principle. It indicates that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that leads to surface poisoning, nor too weak which fails to activate the reactants1."
[3] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity4."
[4] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane11."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently12."
[6] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis13."
[7] "However, SACs do not find broad application in high temperature (>500C) light alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[8] "To the best of our knowledge, high stability and selectivity have not been achieved for the PDH reaction with the use of single-atom Pt catalysts."
[9] "Based on the theoretical analysis, we design and synthesize the catalysts with Pt/Cu SAA supported on γ-alumina via an atomic dilution method and confirm the formation of Pt/Cu SAA through detailed characterizations."
[10] "Subsequent catalytic tests demonstrate the transferability from DFT calculations to practical catalytic reaction and the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6molg1Pth1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520C, WHSV=4h1, C3H8/N2=1/1."

1. The ultimate goal of researchers in developing new catalysts is to enhance both activity and selectivity simultaneously.
2. The Sabatier principle suggests that the best catalysts should bind reactive intermediates with a suitable interaction strength, avoiding both surface poisoning and insufficient activation of reactants.
3. The scaling relationship in catalysis often leads to enhanced selectivity for desired products but at the cost of reduced intrinsic activity for the primary reaction.
4. Previous studies have shown that the catalytic properties of noble-metal alloys, including PtM alloys, are constrained by the scaling relationship, typically resulting in increased selectivity to propylene while decreasing the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity of propane.
5. There is a desire to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to concurrently improve activity and selectivity.
6. Single-atom catalysis has emerged as a promising area in heterogeneous catalysis.
7. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are not extensively used in high-temperature alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
8. To date, high stability and selectivity have not been achieved for the PDH reaction using single-atom Pt catalysts.
9. The research team designs and synthesizes Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts supported on γ-alumina through an atomic dilution method.
10. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with a low loading of 0.1 wt% exhibits high propylene selectivity of 90% and a high formation rate of 10.6 mol/g/h under practical conditions.

1. 研究人员开发新催化剂的最终目标是同时提高活性和选择性。
2. Sabatier原理表明，最佳催化剂应以合适的相互作用强度结合反应中间体，既不过强导致表面中毒，也不过弱无法激活反应物。
3. 催化剂中的缩放关系往往导致对目标产品的选择性增强，但同时降低了基础反应的内在活性。
4. 以往的研究表明，包括PtM合金在内的贵金属合金的催化性质受限于缩放关系，通常导致丙烯选择性的增加，同时减少了丙烷脱氢的内在活性。
5. 开发能够打破缩放关系的催化剂，以同时提高活性和选择性，是一个理想的目标。
6. 单原子催化已成为异质催化的一个有前景的新前沿领域。
7. 单原子催化剂（SACs）在高温轻烷烃脱氢反应中尚未得到广泛应用。
