[1] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."
[2] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[3] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity for the target product."
[4] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane11."
[5] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently12."

Answer: Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, it addresses the challenges of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock. Secondly, PDH technology improves process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene without the need for intermediate products, unlike conventional methods. Lastly, it enhances product selectivity, as PDH catalysts designed to break the scaling relationship can achieve high propylene selectivity without compromising the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. This concurrent improvement in activity and selectivity makes PDH a more efficient and environmentally friendly process for propylene production.
