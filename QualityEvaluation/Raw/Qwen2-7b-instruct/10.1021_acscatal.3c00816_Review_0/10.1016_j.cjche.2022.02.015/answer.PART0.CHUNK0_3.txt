In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it addresses several challenges faced by conventional production methods. These challenges include:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology utilizes propane, which is increasingly available from shale gas, offering a cleaner and more abundant feedstock compared to traditional methods that rely on heavier hydrocarbons.
2. Process efficiency: PDH provides a direct route to produce propylene, bypassing intermediate steps that are common in conventional processes, thus enhancing efficiency and reducing energy consumption.
3. Product selectivity: PDH selectively produces propylene from propane, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts, which is particularly advantageous in maintaining high product purity and yield.

Moreover, PDH technology leverages the use of non-noble metal oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), as catalysts, which are cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to platinum and chromium-based catalysts used in traditional processes. The introduction of metals like nickel in these catalysts can further improve their activity and stability, making PDH an increasingly attractive option for propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它解决了传统生产方法面临的几个挑战：

1. 原料供应：PDH 技术利用从页岩气中获取的丙烷作为原料，提供了一种比传统方法依赖的更清洁、更丰富的原料来源。
2. 工艺效率：PDH 提供了一条直接从丙烷生成丙烯的途径，跳过了传统流程中的中间步骤，从而提高了效率并减少了能源消耗。
3. 产品选择性：PDH 选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，最大限度地减少了副产品的形成，这对于保持高产品纯度和产率特别有利。

此外，PDH 技术利用非贵金属氧化物，如氧化锌（ZnO）作为催化剂，这为成本效益高且环保的替代品提供了铂和铬基催化剂在传统流程中使用的可能性。在这些催化剂中加入镍等金属可以进一步提高其活性和稳定性，使PDH 成为丙烯生产极具吸引力的选择。
