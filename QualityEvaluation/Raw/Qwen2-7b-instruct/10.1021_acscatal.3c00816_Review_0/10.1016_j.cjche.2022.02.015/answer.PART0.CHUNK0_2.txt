<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has been paid increasing attention owing to worldwide growing demand of propene and the increasing availability of propane from shale gas.</p>
<p>Clean and low-carbon utilization of fossil energy is an efficient way to achieve carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>Non-noble zinc-based catalysts have paid increasing attention because of low cost and nontoxic, compared with industrial Pt and Cr-based catalysts.</p>
<p>Zn2+ was the definite active site and NiZn alloy facilitated the sluggish H recombination into H2 via reverse spillover.</p>
<p>The introduction of Ni increased Lewis acid strength caused by electron transfer from ZnO to NiZn alloy, contributing to improved stability.</p>
<p>For resulted 0.5NiZn/S-1, propene formation rate was 0.18 mol C3H6·(g Zn)1·h1 at 550 C, which was above 1.5 times higher than that over Zn/S-1 without Ni.</p>
<p>Under stability test, the deactivation of 0.5NiZn/S-1 was 0.019 h1, which was only 1/10 of that over Zn/S-1.</p>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, as it utilizes propane, which is increasingly available from shale gas resources. This ensures a reliable and potentially abundant source of feedstock. Secondly, PDH enhances process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene without the need for intermediate steps, thus reducing energy consumption and potential losses. Lastly, PDH improves product selectivity, focusing on the production of propylene, which is a critical raw material for various industries, including petrochemicals. This selective process leads to higher yields of the desired product, making PDH a more economically viable and environmentally friendly approach compared to traditional methods that may involve multiple reactions and less targeted product outcomes.
