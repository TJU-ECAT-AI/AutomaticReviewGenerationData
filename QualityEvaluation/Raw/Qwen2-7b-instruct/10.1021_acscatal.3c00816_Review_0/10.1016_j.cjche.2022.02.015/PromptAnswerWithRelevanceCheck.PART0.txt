1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered promising for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically tackles these issues by utilizing a growing supply of propane from shale gas, offering a cleaner and more environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional production methods that often rely on scarce resources and potentially hazardous processes.

2. Propane dehydrogenation technology enhances catalytic activity and stability through the introduction of appropriate amounts of Ni into ZnO supported on Silicalite-1 zeolite. This results in a significant improvement in propene formation rate and reduces the deactivation rate, thereby increasing the efficiency and longevity of the catalytic process.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing clean and low-carbon fossil energy sources, which is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality. This makes PDH a more sustainable option compared to traditional methods. Secondly, the availability of propane from shale gas increases the flexibility of feedstock sources, providing a more diverse and potentially cheaper resource for propylene production. Moreover, the use of non-noble metals, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), in PDH reactions offers economic benefits due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. Despite these advantages, Zn-based catalysts face limitations in terms of activity and thermal stability. To overcome these drawbacks, the incorporation of trace elements like platinum has proven effective in enhancing both catalytic activity and stability. The study highlighted in this document takes a step further by investigating the role of nickel (Ni) in improving the performance of ZnO-supported on Silicalite-1 zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. The introduction of Ni leads to the formation of a NiZn alloy on the zeolite surface, which not only boosts the activity of the catalyst but also enhances its stability. Specifically, the addition of Ni to Zn/S-1 catalysts resulted in a significantly higher propene formation rate (1.5 times greater) at 550°C compared to the base Zn/S-1 catalyst. Furthermore, the catalyst containing 0.5% NiZn showed a remarkable improvement in stability, with a deactivation rate constant of only 0.019 h^-1, which is ten times less than that of the Zn/S-1 catalyst. This demonstrates that the strategic use of Ni in Zn/MFI catalysts can effectively optimize PDH processes, offering a promising avenue for the efficient and environmentally friendly production of propylene.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize fossil energy in a clean and low-carbon manner. This technology addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The increasing availability of propane from shale gas fuels the demand for PDH technology, which offers a viable solution for propylene production with enhanced sustainability. Non-noble zinc-based catalysts gain attention for their low cost and lack of toxicity, making them a more environmentally friendly alternative to precious metal-based catalysts like platinum and chromium. However, these catalysts often exhibit limitations in catalytic activity and stability. The introduction of nickel (Ni) into zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on Silicalite-1 zeolite has been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the PDH process. For instance, the addition of 0.5% Ni to the ZnO/Silicalite-1 catalyst system increases the propene formation rate to 1.5 times higher than that of the zinc oxide-only catalyst. Moreover, the stability test reveals that the deactivation rate constant of the Ni-added catalyst is only 1/10th of the zinc oxide-only catalyst, indicating superior stability.
