<p>Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has been paid increasing attention owing to worldwide growing demand of propene and the increasing availability of propane from shale gas.</p>
<p>However, they often suffer from limited catalytic activity and poor stability.</p>
<p>For resulted 0.5NiZn/S-1, propene formation rate was 0.18 mol C3H6·(g Zn)1·h1 at 550 C, which was above 1.5 times higher than that over Zn/S-1 without Ni.</p>
<p>Under stability test, the deactivation of 0.5NiZn/S-1 was 0.019 h1, which was only 1/10 of that over Zn/S-1.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered promising for propylene production due to its ability to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It specifically tackles these issues by utilizing a growing supply of propane from shale gas, offering a cleaner and more environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional production methods that often rely on scarce resources and potentially hazardous processes.

2. Propane dehydrogenation technology enhances catalytic activity and stability through the introduction of appropriate amounts of Ni into ZnO supported on Silicalite-1 zeolite. This results in a significant improvement in propene formation rate and reduces the deactivation rate, thereby increasing the efficiency and longevity of the catalytic process.

1. 烷基化脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够解决原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性等方面的问题而被认为是丙烯生产的最有效方法。它通过利用来自页岩气的不断增长的丙烷供应，提供了一种比传统生产方法更清洁、更环保的选择，后者往往依赖于稀缺资源和潜在危险的过程。

2. 通过在二氧化硅分子筛支持的锌氧化物中引入适量的Ni，丙烷脱氢技术增强了催化剂活性和稳定性。这导致丙烯生成速率显著提高，并减少了催化剂失效速率，从而提高了催化过程的效率和寿命。
