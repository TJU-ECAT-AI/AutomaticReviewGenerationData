In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing clean and low-carbon fossil energy sources, which is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality. This makes PDH a more sustainable option compared to traditional methods. Secondly, the availability of propane from shale gas increases the flexibility of feedstock sources, providing a more diverse and potentially cheaper resource for propylene production. Moreover, the use of non-noble metals, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), in PDH reactions offers economic benefits due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. Despite these advantages, Zn-based catalysts face limitations in terms of activity and thermal stability. To overcome these drawbacks, the incorporation of trace elements like platinum has proven effective in enhancing both catalytic activity and stability. The study highlighted in this document takes a step further by investigating the role of nickel (Ni) in improving the performance of ZnO-supported on Silicalite-1 zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. The introduction of Ni leads to the formation of a NiZn alloy on the zeolite surface, which not only boosts the activity of the catalyst but also enhances its stability. Specifically, the addition of Ni to Zn/S-1 catalysts resulted in a significantly higher propene formation rate (1.5 times greater) at 550°C compared to the base Zn/S-1 catalyst. Furthermore, the catalyst containing 0.5% NiZn showed a remarkable improvement in stability, with a deactivation rate constant of only 0.019 h^-1, which is ten times less than that of the Zn/S-1 catalyst. This demonstrates that the strategic use of Ni in Zn/MFI catalysts can effectively optimize PDH processes, offering a promising avenue for the efficient and environmentally friendly production of propylene.

在面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其独特优势而成为丙烯生产最具有前景的方法。首先，PDH技术通过利用清洁低碳的化石能源来实现碳中和，这为达到碳中和目标提供了高效途径，相较于传统方法更具可持续性。其次，从页岩气中获取的丙烷增加了原料来源的多样性和可能的成本效益，为丙烯生产提供了更加灵活且经济的选择。此外，非贵金属氧化物，如锌氧化物（ZnO），在PDH反应中的应用因其低成本和环保特性而展现出经济优势。尽管如此，基于Zn的催化剂在活性和热稳定性方面仍存在局限性。为解决这些问题，引入铂等微量元素已被证明能有效提升催化剂的活性与稳定性。本研究聚焦于探索镍（Ni）在Zn/MFI催化剂上用于PDH反应时的作用。研究表明，在Zn/S-1催化剂表面形成的NiZn合金不仅显著提高了催化剂的活性，还增强了其稳定性。具体而言，向Zn/S-1催化剂中添加Ni可使丙烯形成速率在550°C下提高1.5倍，相比基线的Zn/S-1催化剂。此外，含0.5% NiZn的催化剂显示出卓越的稳定性，其失活速率常数仅为0.019 h^-1，是Zn/S-1催化剂的十分之一。这一结果表明，在Zn/MFI催化剂中适当地使用Ni能够优化PDH过程，为高效和环境友好的丙烯生产开辟了新的可能性。
