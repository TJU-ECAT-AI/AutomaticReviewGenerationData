In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize fossil energy in a clean and low-carbon manner. This technology addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The increasing availability of propane from shale gas fuels the demand for PDH technology, which offers a viable solution for propylene production with enhanced sustainability. Non-noble zinc-based catalysts gain attention for their low cost and lack of toxicity, making them a more environmentally friendly alternative to precious metal-based catalysts like platinum and chromium. However, these catalysts often exhibit limitations in catalytic activity and stability. The introduction of nickel (Ni) into zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on Silicalite-1 zeolite has been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic activity and stability of the PDH process. For instance, the addition of 0.5% Ni to the ZnO/Silicalite-1 catalyst system increases the propene formation rate to 1.5 times higher than that of the zinc oxide-only catalyst. Moreover, the stability test reveals that the deactivation rate constant of the Ni-added catalyst is only 1/10th of the zinc oxide-only catalyst, indicating superior stability.

考虑到全球对丙烯的不断增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能够以清洁和低碳的方式利用化石能源而成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法。这种技术通过提高过程效率、优化原料可用性和提升产品选择性，有效地解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。随着页岩气中丙烷供应量的增加，PDH技术提供了可持续性更强的丙烯生产解决方案。非贵金属锌基催化剂因其成本低廉和无毒性，在环保性能上优于铂金和铬等贵金属基催化剂，受到关注。然而，这些催化剂在活性和稳定性方面往往存在局限性。向锌氧化物（ZnO）负载于硅酸铝沸石中引入镍（Ni），已被证明可以显著增强PDH过程的催化活性和稳定性。例如，将0.5%的Ni添加到ZnO/硅酸铝沸石催化剂系统中，丙烯生成速率提高了1.5倍以上，与仅使用锌氧化物的催化剂相比。此外，稳定性测试表明Ni添加催化剂的失活率常数仅为锌氧化物催化剂的1/10，显示出更优的稳定性。
