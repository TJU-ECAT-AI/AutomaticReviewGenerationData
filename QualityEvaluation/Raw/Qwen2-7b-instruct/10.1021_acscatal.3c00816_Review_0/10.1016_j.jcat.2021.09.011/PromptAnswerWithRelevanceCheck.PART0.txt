<p>Compared to the cumbersome generation of silanols via framework demetallation, we report a direct synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests.</p>
<p>The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source. The basicity of the synthesis mixture was adjusted by the addition of readily available N(CH3)4OH, instead of converting the surfactant to hydroxyl form.</p>
<p>When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K.</p>
<p>The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The promotional effect of silanol nests on intermetallic alloy formation is an intriguing phenomenon, and is expected to trigger investigations of other metal alloy catalysts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would be interesting to study other alloy nanoparticle catalysts for other industrially implemented reactions, such as acetylene semi-hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation.</p>

1. The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability and process efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on naphtha cracking, PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is increasingly available from sources like ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas. This makes PDH a more sustainable and cost-effective method for propylene production.

2. The process of generating silanols through framework demetallation is cumbersome and inefficient. However, researchers have developed a direct synthesis method for mesoporous MFI zeolites that inherently possess silanol nests. This is achieved by using a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, along with an adjustment of the synthesis mixture's basicity through the addition of N(CH3)4OH. This method leads to the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit remarkable catalytic durability and high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in PDH.

3. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite supports plays a crucial role in promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. This phenomenon is significant because it can be applied to the development of other metal alloy catalysts, potentially simplifying existing processes and expanding their applicability to other industrially relevant reactions, such as acetylene semi-hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于其能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。与依赖石脑油裂解的传统方法不同，PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料从天然气和页岩气中越来越多地获取，使其成为更可持续和成本效益更高的丙烯生产方法。

2. 通过框架去金属化生成硅醇基团的过程既繁琐又效率低下。然而，研究人员已经开发出一种直接合成方法，可以在MFI沸石分子筛中产生硅醇巢。这种方法通过使用一种双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源，以及通过添加N(CH3)4OH调整合成混合物的基本性，实现了这一点。这种方法导致形成Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒，这些颗粒在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出极长的催化寿命、高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 在沸石支持下存在的硅醇巢对促进形成互金属合金纳米颗粒起到了关键作用。这一现象非常重要，因为它可以应用于其他金属合金催化剂的发展，有可能简化现有过程并扩大它们在其他工业相关反应中的应用，如乙炔半氢化和二氧化碳氢化。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize alternative feedstocks like ethane from natural gas and shale gas. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as reliance on naphtha crackers, by offering a less expensive source of ethylene and propylene. PDH technology has garnered interest because it meets the large demand for propylene efficiently. However, traditional PDH catalysts, like Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina or chromium oxide-supported alumina, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition. To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored substituting tin with other metals, like copper, zinc, gallium, and indium. Intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, particularly those using rare earth elements like yttrium and lanthanum, have shown promise in achieving slow deactivation and high propylene selectivity. These catalysts often require the formation of alloys with platinum, which necessitates the reduction of rare earth element oxides to their metallic state. Ryoo et al.'s work focused on generating silanol nests in a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite to facilitate the formation of these rare earth-platinum alloys. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite allowed for the dispersion of rare earth elements into single atomic species, which could be readily converted to the metallic state through hydrogen reduction. This approach led to the development of highly active and durable PDH catalysts with improved performance.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够有效利用天然气和页岩气中乙烷作为替代原料。与依赖石脑油裂解的传统生产方法相比，这种技术提供了更便宜的乙烯和丙烯来源。PDH技术因其能够高效满足大量丙烯需求而受到关注。然而，传统的PDH催化剂，如铂锡双金属催化剂支持在多孔氧化铝或铬氧化物支持的氧化铝上，由于焦炭沉积导致快速失活。为了克服这个问题，研究人员探索了用铜、锌、镓和铟等其他金属替换锡的可能性。特别是使用稀土元素如钇和镧的互熔化合物PDH催化剂显示出缓慢失活和高丙烯选择性的潜力。这些催化剂通常需要形成铂与稀土元素的合金，这需要将稀土元素氧化物还原到金属状态。刘等人专注于在表面活性剂模板化的微孔MFI沸石中生成硅醇巢来促进这些稀有贵金属-铂合金的形成。硅醇巢的存在使沸石中的稀有元素分散成单原子物种，通过氢化还原即可转化为金属状态。这种方法导致开发出活性高且耐用的PDH催化剂，性能有所提升。

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges faced by conventional production methods. These include overcoming the issue of limited feedstock availability, improving process efficiency, and enhancing product selectivity. 

2. PDH technology specifically addresses these challenges by providing a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce propylene, particularly when considering the recent availability of cheaper ethylene sources from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas. This breaks the traditional balance of ethylene and propylene production and offers a targeted method for propylene production, such as PDH, which is more efficient in meeting the large demand for propylene compared to other methods.

3. A major challenge in PDH processes is the requirement for high-temperature operations, which can limit its practical implementation and efficiency. However, advancements in the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite materials with silanol nests have enabled the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit high catalytic durability, high propane conversion, and propylene selectivity.

4. The presence of silanol nests in zeolites, which are typically generated through complex demetallation processes, has now been demonstrated to occur spontaneously during hydrothermal synthesis under sodium-free conditions. This discovery not only simplifies the preparation of zeolite-supported intermetallic alloy catalysts but also suggests potential for broader applications in other metal alloy catalysts for various industrial processes.
