[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers."
[2] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas."
[3] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance."
[4] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene."
[5] "Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition."
[6] "To resolve the deactivation problem due to coke deposition, other metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, and In) have also been investigated as substitutes for Sn in recent years."
[7] "Among the intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, we focus on a recent work by Ryoo et al. on Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite."
[8] "The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y and Pt3La catalysts exhibited very slow deactivation in the PDH reaction and high propylene selectivity."
[9] "The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 or La(NO3)3, followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2."
[10] "To form an alloy with Pt, the rare earth element (REE) oxides should be fully reduced to the metallic zero-oxidation state."
[11] "In the work of Ryoo et al., the silanol nests were generated through a tedious procedure involving the synthesis of a mesoporous zeolite in a gallosilicate form, and subsequent degallation with nitric acid."
[12] "The aim of the present work was to clarify the effect of the Pt3Y alloy formation for PDH catalytic performance, using a purely siliceous zeolite possessing silanol nests."
[13] "After various attempts, we found that a mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests can be directly synthesized in a silica form under an alkali-free condition using a diammonium hydroxide surfactant."
[14] "Further, we simplified the synthesis procedure to the use of a bromide surfactant, C1864Br2, and N(CH3)4OH."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to efficiently utilize alternative feedstocks like ethane from natural gas and shale gas. This technology addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as reliance on naphtha crackers, by offering a less expensive source of ethylene and propylene. PDH technology has garnered interest because it meets the large demand for propylene efficiently. However, traditional PDH catalysts, like Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina or chromium oxide-supported alumina, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition. To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored substituting tin with other metals, like copper, zinc, gallium, and indium. Intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, particularly those using rare earth elements like yttrium and lanthanum, have shown promise in achieving slow deactivation and high propylene selectivity. These catalysts often require the formation of alloys with platinum, which necessitates the reduction of rare earth element oxides to their metallic state. Ryoo et al.'s work focused on generating silanol nests in a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite to facilitate the formation of these rare earth-platinum alloys. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite allowed for the dispersion of rare earth elements into single atomic species, which could be readily converted to the metallic state through hydrogen reduction. This approach led to the development of highly active and durable PDH catalysts with improved performance.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它能够有效利用天然气和页岩气中乙烷作为替代原料。与依赖石脑油裂解的传统生产方法相比，这种技术提供了更便宜的乙烯和丙烯来源。PDH技术因其能够高效满足大量丙烯需求而受到关注。然而，传统的PDH催化剂，如铂锡双金属催化剂支持在多孔氧化铝或铬氧化物支持的氧化铝上，由于焦炭沉积导致快速失活。为了克服这个问题，研究人员探索了用铜、锌、镓和铟等其他金属替换锡的可能性。特别是使用稀土元素如钇和镧的互熔化合物PDH催化剂显示出缓慢失活和高丙烯选择性的潜力。这些催化剂通常需要形成铂与稀土元素的合金，这需要将稀土元素氧化物还原到金属状态。刘等人专注于在表面活性剂模板化的微孔MFI沸石中生成硅醇巢来促进这些稀有贵金属-铂合金的形成。硅醇巢的存在使沸石中的稀有元素分散成单原子物种，通过氢化还原即可转化为金属状态。这种方法导致开发出活性高且耐用的PDH催化剂，性能有所提升。
