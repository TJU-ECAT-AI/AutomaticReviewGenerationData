[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers [1] . However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas [2] . This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance [3] , causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes [4] ."
[2] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene [5] ,[6] ."
[3] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit [5] . Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition [5] ."
[4] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process [7] . On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d) [8] ,[9] ,[10] ,[11] , but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl [12] ."
[5] "To resolve the deactivation problem due to coke deposition [13] ,[14] , other metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, and In) have also been investigated as substitutes for Sn in recent years [15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] . These investigations suggested that the use of new alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound-type structure might be a suitable strategy to resolve the rapid deactivation problem [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ."
[6] "Among the intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, we focus on a recent work by Ryoo et al. on Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite [28] ."
[7] "The aim of the present work was to clarify the effect of the Pt3Y alloy formation for PDH catalytic performance, using a purely siliceous zeolite possessing silanol nests."
[8] "The synthesis results and the PDH application results are reported in this paper."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several challenges faced by conventional production methods. It utilizes ethane from natural gas and shale gas, providing a less expensive source of ethylene, thus breaking the traditional balance between ethylene and propylene production. This makes PDH particularly appealing for meeting the large demand for propylene efficiently.

2. PDH technology stands out as the most efficient process for propylene production among emerging methods, capable of satisfying the significant market demand for propylene. However, it faces a major challenge due to the requirement for high-temperature operations, which can lead to rapid catalyst deactivation.

3. Traditional PDH processes using Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) suffer from issues like rapid deactivation due to coke deposition. The CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, in particular, have drawbacks such as chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation, which can be mitigated through simple catalyst regeneration processes. On the other hand, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst necessitates frequent regeneration, which involves high-temperature treatments with potentially toxic and corrosive gas mixtures.

4. Other metals like Cu, Zn, Ga, and In have been explored as substitutes for Sn in PDH catalysts, suggesting that the use of alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound structure might offer a suitable solution to alleviate rapid deactivation problems.

5. Ryoo et al.'s work focuses on the use of Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite as an innovative approach to enhance PDH catalytic performance.

6. The current research aims to investigate the impact of Pt3Y alloy formation on PDH catalytic performance, utilizing a purely siliceous zeolite with silanol nests. The synthesis and application results of these materials are documented in the paper.
