<p>Compared to the cumbersome generation of silanols via framework demetallation, we report a direct synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests.</p>
<p>The synthesis procedure employed a diammonium-type bromide surfactant [C18H37N(CH3)2C6H12N(CH3)2C4H9Br2] and a sodium-free silica source. The basicity of the synthesis mixture was adjusted by the addition of readily available N(CH3)4OH, instead of converting the surfactant to hydroxyl form.</p>
<p>When the zeolite was supported with 0.50 wt% Pt and 0.50 wt% Y using nitrate precursors, a remarkably long catalytic lifetime of 20 days was obtained with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity under the reaction condition using neat propane gas at 853 K.</p>
<p>The Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic durability with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The promotional effect of silanol nests on intermetallic alloy formation is an intriguing phenomenon, and is expected to trigger investigations of other metal alloy catalysts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would be interesting to study other alloy nanoparticle catalysts for other industrially implemented reactions, such as acetylene semi-hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation.</p>

1. The key advantage of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability and process efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on naphtha cracking, PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is increasingly available from sources like ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas. This makes PDH a more sustainable and cost-effective method for propylene production.

2. The process of generating silanols through framework demetallation is cumbersome and inefficient. However, researchers have developed a direct synthesis method for mesoporous MFI zeolites that inherently possess silanol nests. This is achieved by using a diammonium-type bromide surfactant and a sodium-free silica source, along with an adjustment of the synthesis mixture's basicity through the addition of N(CH3)4OH. This method leads to the formation of intermetallic Pt3Y alloy nanoparticles, which exhibit remarkable catalytic durability and high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in PDH.

3. The presence of silanol nests in the zeolite supports plays a crucial role in promoting the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles. This phenomenon is significant because it can be applied to the development of other metal alloy catalysts, potentially simplifying existing processes and expanding their applicability to other industrially relevant reactions, such as acetylene semi-hydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势在于其能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。与依赖石脑油裂解的传统方法不同，PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料从天然气和页岩气中越来越多地获取，使其成为更可持续和成本效益更高的丙烯生产方法。

2. 通过框架去金属化生成硅醇基团的过程既繁琐又效率低下。然而，研究人员已经开发出一种直接合成方法，可以在MFI沸石分子筛中产生硅醇巢。这种方法通过使用一种双铵型溴化表面活性剂和无钠硅源，以及通过添加N(CH3)4OH调整合成混合物的基本性，实现了这一点。这种方法导致形成Pt3Y合金纳米颗粒，这些颗粒在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出极长的催化寿命、高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 在沸石支持下存在的硅醇巢对促进形成互金属合金纳米颗粒起到了关键作用。这一现象非常重要，因为它可以应用于其他金属合金催化剂的发展，有可能简化现有过程并扩大它们在其他工业相关反应中的应用，如乙炔半氢化和二氧化碳氢化。
