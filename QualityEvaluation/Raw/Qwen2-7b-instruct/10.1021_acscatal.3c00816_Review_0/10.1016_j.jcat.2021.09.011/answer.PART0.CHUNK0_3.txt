[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers."
[2] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas."
[3] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance."
[4] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene."
[5] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit."
[6] "Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition."
[7] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process."
[8] "On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d) but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl."
[9] "To resolve the deactivation problem due to coke deposition, other metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Ga, and In) have also been investigated as substitutes for Sn in recent years."
[10] "These investigations suggested that the use of new alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound-type structure might be a suitable strategy to resolve the rapid deactivation problem."
[11] "Among the intermetallic compound PDH catalysts, we focus on a recent work by Ryoo et al. on Pt3Y and Pt3La nanoparticles supported on a surfactant-templated mesoporous MFI zeolite."
[12] "The mesoporous zeolite-supported Pt3Y and Pt3La catalysts exhibited very slow deactivation in the PDH reaction and high propylene selectivity."
[13] "The alloy nanoparticles were prepared by impregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Y(NO3)3 or La(NO3)3, followed by calcination in O2 and reduction with H2."
[14] "This conventional method is often used to support metal catalysts that are reducible with H2 (i.e., elements with a sufficiently high reduction potential), such as Ni, Pd, and Pt."
[15] "To form an alloy with Pt, the rare earth element (REE) oxides should be fully reduced to the metallic zero-oxidation state."
[16] "However, such a transition to the fully reduced metallic state is generally difficult to achieve by H2 in the case of the Y and La elements."
[17] "Instead, the supported REEs are rather known for causing strong metal-support interactions in a non-metallic oxide state."
[18] "Ryoo et al. circumvented the reduction-potential problem by atomically dispersing the REEs on silanol nests in a surfactant-templated mesoporous zeolite."
[19] "The silanol nest refers to a cluster of neighboring -SiOH groups that are associated with hydrogen bonding."
[20] "Upon O2 calcination, the silanol nest was able to disperse the REE into a single atomic species by coordination bonding."
[21] "The single atomically dispersed REE species could readily be converted to the metallic state by H2."
[22] "This phenomenon was interpreted as a result of increased chemical potential due to the single atomic dispersion, compared with that of bulk REE oxides and nanoparticles."
[23] "The aim of the present work was to clarify the effect of the Pt3Y alloy formation for PDH catalytic performance, using a purely siliceous zeolite possessing silanol nests."
[24] "After various attempts, we found that a mesoporous MFI zeolite possessing silanol nests can be directly synthesized in a silica form under an alkali-free condition using a diammonium hydroxide surfactant."
[25] "Further, we simplified the synthesis procedure to the use of a bromide surfactant, C1864Br2, and N(CH3)4OH."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its efficiency, addressing the challenges faced by conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It utilizes ethane from natural gas and shale gas as a cheaper alternative for ethylene production, breaking the traditional balance between ethylene and propylene. PDH processes employ catalysts like Pt-Sn bimetallic or CrOx/Al2O3, which face issues like rapid deactivation and toxicity, especially with CrOx/Al2O3 requiring frequent regeneration and PtSn/Al2O3 needing complex and hazardous regeneration processes. Alloy nanoparticles with an intermetallic compound structure offer a solution to these problems by providing stable and selective catalysts for propylene production.

1. 烯烃和丙烯的传统生产平衡被打破后，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为了最具前景的丙烯生产方法。它利用天然气和页岩气中的乙烷作为更便宜的乙烯来源，解决了传统方法在原料供应、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。PDH过程使用Pt-Sn双金属或CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，这些催化剂面临快速失活和毒性等问题，尤其是CrOx/Al2O3需要频繁再生，而PtSn/Al2O3则需要复杂的且具有腐蚀性的气体混合物进行再生。合金纳米颗粒具有化合物结构，提供了稳定且选择性更强的催化剂，以解决这些问题。
