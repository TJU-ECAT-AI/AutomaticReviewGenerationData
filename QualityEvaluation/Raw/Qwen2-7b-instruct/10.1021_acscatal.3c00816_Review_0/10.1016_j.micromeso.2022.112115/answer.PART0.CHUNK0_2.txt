[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, a critical component in petrochemical processes. This method addresses several challenges faced by traditional production methods, including the scarcity of high-quality feedstocks, low process efficiencies, and the selectivity issues that often lead to impurity accumulation. By employing advanced catalysts and optimizing the reaction conditions, PDH can ensure a steady supply of propylene, which is essential for the production of various chemicals and plastics.

2. The use of modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for non-noble metal Co-based catalysts in PDH significantly enhances the performance of these catalysts. This enhancement is attributed to the tuning of the Ti species and the state of the active Co species, as well as the modulation of the surface acid properties of the catalyst. As a result, the developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate exceptional propylene selectivity, achieving over 95%, and possess excellent regeneration stability during recycling PDH reactions.

3. The characterization studies reveal the dynamic evolution of titanium within the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolite structure. As the Si/Ti ratio decreases, titanium transitions from being embedded within the zeolite framework and as extralayered species to forming smaller-sized anatase TiO2 particles. This structural adjustment influences the dispersion and chemical state of the cobalt (Co) sites across different interfaces between the Co-zeolite and Co-TiO2 systems. This strategic modification allows for the precise control of the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

4. Zeolites with higher Si/Ti ratios exhibit a notable reduction in surface acidity, particularly in Brnsted acidity, compared to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites. This decrease in surface acidity facilitates the efficient desorption of propylene (C3H6), thereby enhancing both the selectivity and anti-coke stability of the catalyst. This improvement is crucial for maintaining high productivity and reducing the formation of coke, which can otherwise hinder the PDH process and decrease the overall efficiency.

1.PDH技术因其能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯而脱颖而出，这在解决传统生产方法面临的原料稀缺、过程效率低以及选择性问题等挑战方面具有优势。通过采用高级催化剂和优化反应条件，PDH可以确保稳定供应丙烯，这对于化学品和塑料生产至关重要。

2.通过使用修改后的Ti-ZSM-5沸石作为非贵金属钴基催化剂的支持物，PDH的性能得到了显著增强，这得益于活性钴物种和表面酸性质的Ti物种调谐。开发出的Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂在循环PDH反应中表现出超过95%的丙烯选择性和良好的再生稳定性。这些催化剂在丙烯选择性方面的表现极为出色，并且在循环过程中保持了良好的再生稳定性。

3.表征研究表明，Ti在Ti-ZSM-5沸石结构中的动态演化。随着Si/Ti比的降低，Ti从嵌入框架内的成分和超层成分转变为尺寸较小的锐钛矿TiO2颗粒。这种结构调整影响了Co位点在不同Co-沸石和Co-TiO2界面处的分散性和化学状态。这种精确控制允许对催化剂的活性和选择性进行精细调控。

4.具有较高Si/Ti比的沸石显示出与Al-ZSM-5沸石相比，表面酸性（尤其是Brnsted酸性）显著降低。这种表面酸性的减少促进了丙烯（C3H6）的有效脱附，从而提高了选择性和抗结焦稳定性。这种改进对于维持高生产力并减少形成焦炭（这可能会阻碍PDH过程并降低总体效率）至关重要。
