[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods are as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally, providing a stable and diverse source of raw material compared to conventional methods that may rely on specific, often scarce, resources.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH processes are highly efficient, minimizing energy consumption and waste production. This contrasts with traditional methods, such as steam cracking of naphtha, which can involve multiple steps and higher energy requirements.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes demonstrates a high selectivity towards propylene production, as evidenced by the >95% C3H6 selectivity mentioned. This ensures a high-quality product with minimal byproducts, unlike conventional methods that might produce a broader range of hydrocarbons, including heavier compounds that require additional processing.

4. **Antikoicing Stability**: The tuning of Ti species in the Ti-ZSM-5 supports and the adjustment of surface acidity through the Si/Ti ratio contribute to the catalyst's ability to maintain high performance even under conditions that could lead to coke formation, a common issue in hydrocarbon processing. This stability is crucial for long-term operation and economic viability.

5. **Enhanced Desorption Facilitation**: The reduction in surface acidity, particularly the Brnsted acidity, facilitates the easier desorption of propylene, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH process. This is a significant improvement over conventional methods where product separation might be less effective, leading to lower yields and purity.

By focusing on these aspects, PDH technology offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by conventional production methods, aiming to increase efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and ensure a steady supply of propylene, a critical component in the petrochemical industry.

1.PDH技术在应对传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的关键优势如下：

2. **原料供应**：与传统方法可能依赖特定、有时稀缺的资源不同，PDH过程以丙烷为主要原料，这是一种全球范围内丰富且多样化的原料来源。

3. **过程效率**：直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程非常高效，减少了能源消耗和废物产生。相比之下，传统的裂解轻质石脑油等方法可能涉及多个步骤和更高的能量需求。

4. **产品选择性**：使用Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH过程表现出极高的丙烯选择性，具体表现为超过95%的C3H6选择性。这确保了高质量的产品，几乎没有副产物，而传统方法可能产生更广泛的烃类，包括较重的化合物，这些化合物需要额外的处理。

5. **抗结焦稳定性**：通过调整Ti物种在Ti-ZSM-5支持材料中的分布以及通过Si/Ti比率调整表面酸性，催化剂能够维持高性能，即使在可能导致结焦形成的情况下也是如此。这种稳定性对于长期运营和经济可行性至关重要。

6. **增强的脱附促进**：表面酸性的减少，特别是Brnsted酸性，促进了丙烯的更容易脱附，从而提高了选择性和PDH过程的效率。与传统方法相比，产品分离可能不够有效，导致较低的产率和纯度。

通过关注这些方面，PDH技术提供了解决传统生产方法面临挑战的有前景的解决方案，旨在提高效率、减少环境影响，并确保丙烯的稳定供应，后者是石油化工行业的重要组成部分。
