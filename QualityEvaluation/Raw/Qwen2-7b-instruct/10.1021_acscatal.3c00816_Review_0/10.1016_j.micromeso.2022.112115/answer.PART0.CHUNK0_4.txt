[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It offers a more sustainable and potentially more cost-effective approach compared to traditional methods that often rely on expensive noble metals as catalysts and may have lower propylene yield or require additional steps for purification.

2. The use of modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for Co-based catalysts significantly enhances PDH performance, achieving high propylene selectivity and good regeneration stability. This is attributed to the tuning of the state of active Co species and the surface acid property, which are influenced by the specific Ti species present in the zeolite structure.

3. The structural evolution of Ti within the zeolite framework plays a crucial role in determining the dispersion and chemical state of Co sites, affecting both the selectivity and stability of the catalyst during PDH reactions. As the Si/Ti ratio decreases, the Ti species transform from the framework and extra-framework states into smaller anatase TiO2 particles, altering the interaction between Co and the zeolite surface.

4. Zeolites with a high Si/Ti ratio exhibit reduced surface acidity, particularly in terms of Brnsted acidity, compared to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites. This reduction facilitates the desorption of propylene (C3H6), thereby improving the overall selectivity and anti-coke stability of the catalyst. The tailored surface properties contribute to more efficient conversion of propane into propylene, minimizing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the overall performance of the PDH process.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其能高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。相较于依赖昂贵的贵金属作为催化剂的传统方法，PDH技术可能具有更高的经济效益和可持续性。

2. 通过使用改性的Ti-ZSM-5沸石作为非贵金属钴基催化剂的支持体，PDH性能得到了显著提升，实现了高丙烯选择性和良好的再生稳定性。这种提升归因于活性钴物种状态和表面酸性特性的调整，这些特性受到Ti物种在沸石结构中特定分布的影响。

3. 沸石内部Ti物种的结构演化对于确定钴位点的分散度和化学状态至关重要，从而影响PDH反应的选择性和稳定性。随着Si/Ti比的降低，Ti物种从框架和额外框架状态转变为更小的锐钛矿TiO2颗粒，改变了钴与沸石表面之间的相互作用。

4. Si/Ti比较高的沸石表现出与Al-ZSM-5沸石相比，其表面酸性尤其是Brnsted酸性明显降低。这促进了丙烯（C3H6）的脱附，从而提高了催化剂的整体选择性和抗结焦稳定性。定制化的表面性质有助于更高效的丙烷转化为丙烯，最大限度地减少不必要的副反应，增强PDH过程的整体性能。
