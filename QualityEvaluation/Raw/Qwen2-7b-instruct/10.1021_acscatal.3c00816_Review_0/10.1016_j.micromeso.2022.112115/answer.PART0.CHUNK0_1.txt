[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to enhance the performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts through the tuning of Ti species and surface acidity. This leads to high selectivity towards propylene (C3H6) with >95% yield and excellent regeneration stability in recycling PDH reactions. The structural evolution of Ti species from zeolite frameworks to smaller anatase TiO2 particles, along with the modification of Co sites' dispersion and chemical state, contributes to this enhanced performance. Moreover, the reduction of surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, in zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios facilitates the desorption of C3H6, thereby improving selectivity and anti-coke stability. In addressing the challenges of conventional production methods, PDH technology optimizes feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a preferred choice for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的优势使其成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，其关键优势在于通过调整Ti物种和表面酸性来增强非贵金属钴基催化剂的性能。这导致丙烯（C3H6）的选择性高达95%以上，并且在循环PDH反应中具有良好的再生稳定性。Ti物种从骨架到较小的锐钛矿TiO2粒子的结构演变，以及对不同钴-沸石或钴-TiO2界面的钴位点的分散性和化学状态的修改，促进了这一增强性能的实现。此外，高Si/Ti比的沸石中的表面酸度显著降低，特别是Brnsted酸度，有利于C3H6的脱附，从而提高选择性和抗结焦稳定性。与传统生产方法相比，PDH技术优化了原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性，使其成为丙烯生产的首选方法。
