[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."
[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."
[3] "The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces."
[4] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to enhance the performance of non-noble metal cobalt-based catalysts. This is attributed to the tuning of titanium species, which affects the state of active cobalt species and the surface acidity. It specifically addresses the challenges of conventional production methods by improving feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
2. The Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate exceptional performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions, achieving a C3H6 selectivity greater than 95% and showing good regeneration stability during recycling.
3. The structural modification of titanium within the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites leads to the transformation of titanium species from the framework and extra-framework types to smaller anatase TiO2 particles, influencing the dispersion and chemical state of cobalt sites at various interfaces.
4. Zeolites with a high Si/Ti ratio exhibit reduced surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, compared to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites. This reduction facilitates the desorption of C3H6, thereby enhancing selectivity and anti-coke stability.

1. 直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最具有前景的方法，因为它能够增强非贵金属钴基催化剂的性能。这得益于对钛物种的调整，影响了活性钴物种的状态和表面酸性。它特别针对传统生产方法面临的挑战，通过提高原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性来解决。
2. 钴/钛-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出色，C3H6选择性超过95%，并显示良好的再生稳定性，在循环反应中。
3. Ti-ZSM-5沸石中钛结构的修改导致钛物种从骨架和额外框架类型转变为更小的锐钛矿TiO2颗粒，影响了不同钴-沸石或钴-TiO2界面处钴位点的分散性和化学状态。
4. Si/Ti比高的沸石表面酸性显著降低，特别是Brnsted酸性，与Al-ZSM-5沸石相比。这种减少促进了C3H6的脱附，从而提高了选择性和抗结焦稳定性。
