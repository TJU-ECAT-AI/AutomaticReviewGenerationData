The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are its ability to enhance the performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts through the tuning of Ti species and surface acidity. This leads to high selectivity towards propylene (C3H6) with >95% yield and excellent regeneration stability in recycling PDH reactions. The structural evolution of Ti species from zeolite frameworks to smaller anatase TiO2 particles, along with the modification of Co sites' dispersion and chemical state, contributes to this enhanced performance. Moreover, the reduction of surface acidity, particularly Brnsted acidity, in zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios facilitates the desorption of C3H6, thereby improving selectivity and anti-coke stability. In addressing the challenges of conventional production methods, PDH technology optimizes feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a preferred choice for propylene production.

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, a critical component in petrochemical processes. This method addresses several challenges faced by traditional production methods, including the scarcity of high-quality feedstocks, low process efficiencies, and the selectivity issues that often lead to impurity accumulation. By employing advanced catalysts and optimizing the reaction conditions, PDH can ensure a steady supply of propylene, which is essential for the production of various chemicals and plastics.

2. The use of modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for non-noble metal Co-based catalysts in PDH significantly enhances the performance of these catalysts. This enhancement is attributed to the tuning of the Ti species and the state of the active Co species, as well as the modulation of the surface acid properties of the catalyst. As a result, the developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate exceptional propylene selectivity, achieving over 95%, and possess excellent regeneration stability during recycling PDH reactions.

3. The characterization studies reveal the dynamic evolution of titanium within the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolite structure. As the Si/Ti ratio decreases, titanium transitions from being embedded within the zeolite framework and as extralayered species to forming smaller-sized anatase TiO2 particles. This structural adjustment influences the dispersion and chemical state of the cobalt (Co) sites across different interfaces between the Co-zeolite and Co-TiO2 systems. This strategic modification allows for the precise control of the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

4. Zeolites with higher Si/Ti ratios exhibit a notable reduction in surface acidity, particularly in Brnsted acidity, compared to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites. This decrease in surface acidity facilitates the efficient desorption of propylene (C3H6), thereby enhancing both the selectivity and anti-coke stability of the catalyst. This improvement is crucial for maintaining high productivity and reducing the formation of coke, which can otherwise hinder the PDH process and decrease the overall efficiency.

1.PDH技术因其能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯而脱颖而出，这在解决传统生产方法面临的原料稀缺、过程效率低以及选择性问题等挑战方面具有优势。通过采用高级催化剂和优化反应条件，PDH可以确保稳定供应丙烯，这对于化学品和塑料生产至关重要。

2.通过使用修改后的Ti-ZSM-5沸石作为非贵金属钴基催化剂的支持物，PDH的性能得到了显著增强，这得益于活性钴物种和表面酸性质的Ti物种调谐。开发出的Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂在循环PDH反应中表现出超过95%的丙烯选择性和良好的再生稳定性。这些催化剂在丙烯选择性方面的表现极为出色，并且在循环过程中保持了良好的再生稳定性。

3.表征研究表明，Ti在Ti-ZSM-5沸石结构中的动态演化。随着Si/Ti比的降低，Ti从嵌入框架内的成分和超层成分转变为尺寸较小的锐钛矿TiO2颗粒。这种结构调整影响了Co位点在不同Co-沸石和Co-TiO2界面处的分散性和化学状态。这种精确控制允许对催化剂的活性和选择性进行精细调控。

4.具有较高Si/Ti比的沸石显示出与Al-ZSM-5沸石相比，表面酸性（尤其是Brnsted酸性）显著降低。这种表面酸性的减少促进了丙烯（C3H6）的有效脱附，从而提高了选择性和抗结焦稳定性。这种改进对于维持高生产力并减少形成焦炭（这可能会阻碍PDH过程并降低总体效率）至关重要。

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods are as follows:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: PDH technology utilizes propane as its primary feedstock, which is abundant and widely available globally, providing a stable and diverse source of raw material compared to conventional methods that may rely on specific, often scarce, resources.

2. **Process Efficiency**: By directly converting propane to propylene, PDH processes are highly efficient, minimizing energy consumption and waste production. This contrasts with traditional methods, such as steam cracking of naphtha, which can involve multiple steps and higher energy requirements.

3. **Product Selectivity**: The use of Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH processes demonstrates a high selectivity towards propylene production, as evidenced by the >95% C3H6 selectivity mentioned. This ensures a high-quality product with minimal byproducts, unlike conventional methods that might produce a broader range of hydrocarbons, including heavier compounds that require additional processing.

4. **Antikoicing Stability**: The tuning of Ti species in the Ti-ZSM-5 supports and the adjustment of surface acidity through the Si/Ti ratio contribute to the catalyst's ability to maintain high performance even under conditions that could lead to coke formation, a common issue in hydrocarbon processing. This stability is crucial for long-term operation and economic viability.

5. **Enhanced Desorption Facilitation**: The reduction in surface acidity, particularly the Brnsted acidity, facilitates the easier desorption of propylene, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH process. This is a significant improvement over conventional methods where product separation might be less effective, leading to lower yields and purity.

By focusing on these aspects, PDH technology offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by conventional production methods, aiming to increase efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and ensure a steady supply of propylene, a critical component in the petrochemical industry.

1.PDH技术在应对传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的关键优势如下：

2. **原料供应**：与传统方法可能依赖特定、有时稀缺的资源不同，PDH过程以丙烷为主要原料，这是一种全球范围内丰富且多样化的原料来源。

3. **过程效率**：直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程非常高效，减少了能源消耗和废物产生。相比之下，传统的裂解轻质石脑油等方法可能涉及多个步骤和更高的能量需求。

4. **产品选择性**：使用Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH过程表现出极高的丙烯选择性，具体表现为超过95%的C3H6选择性。这确保了高质量的产品，几乎没有副产物，而传统方法可能产生更广泛的烃类，包括较重的化合物，这些化合物需要额外的处理。

5. **抗结焦稳定性**：通过调整Ti物种在Ti-ZSM-5支持材料中的分布以及通过Si/Ti比率调整表面酸性，催化剂能够维持高性能，即使在可能导致结焦形成的情况下也是如此。这种稳定性对于长期运营和经济可行性至关重要。

6. **增强的脱附促进**：表面酸性的减少，特别是Brnsted酸性，促进了丙烯的更容易脱附，从而提高了选择性和PDH过程的效率。与传统方法相比，产品分离可能不够有效，导致较低的产率和纯度。

通过关注这些方面，PDH技术提供了解决传统生产方法面临挑战的有前景的解决方案，旨在提高效率、减少环境影响，并确保丙烯的稳定供应，后者是石油化工行业的重要组成部分。

1. Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, addressing the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. It offers a more sustainable and potentially more cost-effective approach compared to traditional methods that often rely on expensive noble metals as catalysts and may have lower propylene yield or require additional steps for purification.

2. The use of modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports for Co-based catalysts significantly enhances PDH performance, achieving high propylene selectivity and good regeneration stability. This is attributed to the tuning of the state of active Co species and the surface acid property, which are influenced by the specific Ti species present in the zeolite structure.

3. The structural evolution of Ti within the zeolite framework plays a crucial role in determining the dispersion and chemical state of Co sites, affecting both the selectivity and stability of the catalyst during PDH reactions. As the Si/Ti ratio decreases, the Ti species transform from the framework and extra-framework states into smaller anatase TiO2 particles, altering the interaction between Co and the zeolite surface.

4. Zeolites with a high Si/Ti ratio exhibit reduced surface acidity, particularly in terms of Brnsted acidity, compared to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites. This reduction facilitates the desorption of propylene (C3H6), thereby improving the overall selectivity and anti-coke stability of the catalyst. The tailored surface properties contribute to more efficient conversion of propane into propylene, minimizing unwanted side reactions and enhancing the overall performance of the PDH process.
