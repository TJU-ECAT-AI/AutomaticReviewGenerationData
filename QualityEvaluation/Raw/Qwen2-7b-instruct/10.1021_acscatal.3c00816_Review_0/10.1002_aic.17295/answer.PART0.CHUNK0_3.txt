[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."
[2] "But the industrial Pt-based catalysts often suffer from short-term stability under the high temperature reaction environment (500700C) via sintering and coke deposition."
[3] "Herein, stable PDH reaction in high propylene yield has been achieved by the confinement of PtZn intermetallic alloys (IMAs) in the channels of silicalite-1."
[4] "By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600C even after 90h."
[5] "Our discovery of the important roles of single-site framework Zn open new avenues in the preparation of other IMA catalysts with high performance."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. It specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology leverages the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the intermediate formation of undesirable byproducts, such as coke. This method is particularly advantageous given the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources like shale gas. Moreover, PDH processes can operate at high temperatures, typically between 500°C and 700°C, which are essential for achieving reasonable conversion levels. However, conventional Pt-based catalysts face challenges due to issues like sintering and coke deposition at these high temperatures. The introduction of PtZn intermetallic alloys (IMAs) encapsulated within silicalite-1 zeolite, as described in this research, addresses these issues by confining the PtZn IMAs spatially and the framework Zn latticeally. This results in high propylene selectivity (over 99%) without significant deactivation, even after 90 hours of operation at 600°C. The use of single-site framework Zn further enhances the stability and selectivity of the PtZn@S-1 catalyst, opening new avenues for the development of high-performance IMA catalysts.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在几个关键方面为丙烯生产提供了优势，并特别解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，包括原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性。PDH技术利用了将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的过程，避免了形成有害副产品的中间步骤，如焦炭沉积。鉴于从清洁能源如页岩气中获取的丙烷越来越多，这种方法尤其具有优势。此外，PDH工艺可在500°C至700°C的高温下运行，这对于实现合理的转化水平至关重要。然而，传统的铂基催化剂在这些高温下面临挑战，由于存在结块和焦炭沉积的问题。本研究中描述的通过在硅酸盐-1沸石的通道中封装PtZn互金属合金（IMAs），通过空间限制PtZn IMAs和框架Zn来解决这些问题。这导致了高丙烯选择性（超过99%）且在600°C运行90小时后几乎无明显失活。单个框架Zn位点的使用进一步提高了PtZn@S-1催化剂的稳定性和选择性，为高性能IMAs催化剂的开发开辟了新途径。
