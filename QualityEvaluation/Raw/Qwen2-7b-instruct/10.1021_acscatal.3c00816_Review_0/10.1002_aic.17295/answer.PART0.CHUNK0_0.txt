[1] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."
[2] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level. Inevitably, alkane dehydrogenation is accompanied by coking via undesired side reactions and sintering via the growth of platinum particles, which greatly reduces the activity and stability of the catalysts."
[3] "The introduction of a second metal (Sn,13-17 Ga,18-20 Zn,12, 21-28 In,29 Cu,30, 31 Co,32 Mn,33 Ni,34 etc.) is an efficient way to suppress coke formation and Pt sintering."
[4] "By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600C even after 90h."
[5] "The introduction of Zn single-site into silicalite-1 zeolite framework for the tailored confinement of PtZn IMA to push the limit of stable and efficient PDH."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on crude oil, which faces diminishing supplies and environmental concerns. PDH, however, utilizes abundant propane from clean energy sources like shale gas. Additionally, PDH requires high temperatures for propylene production, which leads to unwanted side reactions like coking and sintering of catalysts, reducing efficiency. The introduction of a second metal, such as zinc (Zn), in the PDH catalysts helps suppress coke formation and prevent platinum sintering, thereby maintaining high activity and selectivity. The use of zinc in a specific position within the silicalite-1 zeolite framework allows for the confinement of PtZn intermetallic alloys, leading to high propylene selectivity and stability even at high temperatures. This tailored confinement enhances the performance of the PDH process, making it an efficient and environmentally friendly method for propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。传统方法通常依赖于原油，这面临着供应逐渐减少和环境问题的困扰。相比之下，PDH利用来自清洁能源如页岩气的大量丙烷。此外，PDH需要高温来生产丙烯，这导致了催化剂上的副反应，如焦化和铂团聚，从而降低了效率。通过在PDH催化剂中引入第二金属，例如锌（Zn），有助于抑制焦化并防止铂团聚，从而保持高活性和选择性。在特定位置将锌用于硅酸盐-1沸石框架中允许对PtZn互金属合金进行精确封装，即使在高温下也能实现高丙烯选择性和稳定性。这种精确封装增强了PDH过程的性能，使其成为一种高效且环保的丙烯生产方法。
