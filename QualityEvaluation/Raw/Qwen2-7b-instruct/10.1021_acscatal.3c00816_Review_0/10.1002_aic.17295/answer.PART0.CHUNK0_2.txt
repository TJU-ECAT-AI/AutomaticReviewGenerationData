[1] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level."
[2] "But the industrial Pt-based catalysts often suffer from short-term stability under the high temperature reaction environment (500700C) via sintering and coke deposition."
[3] "Herein, stable PDH reaction in high propylene yield has been achieved by the confinement of PtZn intermetallic alloys (IMAs) in the channels of silicalite-1."
[4] "By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600C even after 90h."
[5] "Inevitably, alkane dehydrogenation is accompanied by coking via undesired side reactions and sintering via the growth of platinum particles, which greatly reduces the activity and stability of the catalysts."

In the context of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), the key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive processes that rely on intermediate hydrocarbons. This method addresses the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is increasingly available from clean energy sources such as shale gas. Process efficiency is improved as PDH operates at high temperatures (500-700°C), which facilitates the direct conversion of propane into propylene with minimal side reactions. Product selectivity is also enhanced, as PDH selectively produces propylene with high purity, minimizing the production of other undesirable byproducts. This method avoids the issues of alkane dehydrogenation accompanied by coking and sintering, which reduce the activity and stability of conventional catalysts.

在丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）的背景下，使它成为生产丙烯最具有前景的方法的关键优势包括解决原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性的问题。PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，绕过了依赖中间烃类的昂贵且能耗高的过程。这种方法通过利用日益从清洁能源如页岩气中获取的丙烷，解决了原料可用性问题。PDH在高温度（500-700°C）下运行，能够有效地将丙烷转化为高纯度的丙烯，同时最小化副产品的产生，从而提高了过程效率。产品选择性也得到了增强，因为PDH能够高度选择性地生产丙烯，而不会生成其他不希望的副产品。这种方法避免了伴随烷烃脱氢的焦化和结块问题，这些问题会降低传统催化剂的活性和稳定性。
