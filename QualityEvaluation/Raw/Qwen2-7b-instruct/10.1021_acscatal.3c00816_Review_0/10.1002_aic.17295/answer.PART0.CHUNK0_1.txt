[1] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."
[2] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level. Inevitably, alkane dehydrogenation is accompanied by coking via undesired side reactions and sintering via the growth of platinum particles, which greatly reduces the activity and stability of the catalysts."
[3] "The introduction of a second metal (Sn,13-17 Ga,18-20 Zn,12, 21-28 In,29 Cu,30, 31 Co,32 Mn,33 Ni,34 etc.) is an efficient way to suppress coke formation and Pt sintering."
[4] "By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600C even after 90h."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional propylene production relies on the petrochemical industry, where propylene is derived from oil refining and natural gas processing. This process consumes significant amounts of crude oil and natural gas, leading to supply constraints and environmental concerns. PDH technology, on the other hand, utilizes propane, a byproduct from the extraction of shale gas through clean energy sources. This not only diversifies the feedstock base but also reduces dependence on traditional fossil fuels.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Traditional methods of propylene production involve multiple steps and require high energy inputs, which can lead to inefficiencies. PDH technology, by directly converting propane into propylene, simplifies the process, reducing the number of steps and the associated energy consumption. This streamlined process enhances overall efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: Conventional production methods often involve side reactions, such as coking and sintering, which degrade catalysts and reduce the selectivity of the desired product. PDH technology, particularly the use of PtZn intermetallic nanoalloys (IMAs) encapsulated within Zn-modified MFI zeolite, ensures high propylene selectivity (over 99%) without significant deactivation. This means that the process is not only efficient but also highly selective, producing propylene with minimal byproducts.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by conventional methods through its innovative use of propane as a feedstock and advanced catalytic processes.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，通过直接脱氢制备丙烯的丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法。它特别针对传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战：

1. **原料获取**：传统丙烯生产依赖石油炼制和天然气处理过程中的副产品。这不仅消耗了大量的原油和天然气，还存在供应限制和环境问题。而PDH技术利用来自清洁能源来源的页岩气提取过程中产生的丙烷作为原料，不仅扩大了原料基础，而且减少了对传统化石燃料的依赖。

2. **生产效率**：传统的丙烯生产过程涉及多个步骤且能量投入较高，导致效率低下。PDH技术通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，简化了流程，减少了步骤和相关的能量消耗。这一精简的过程提高了整体效率。

3. **产品选择性**：传统生产方法往往伴随着焦化和铂颗粒生长等副反应，这些反应会破坏催化剂并降低目标产品的选择性。使用封装在MFI沸石骨架中的Zn修饰PtZn互金属纳米合金的PDH技术，可以实现超过99%的高丙烯选择性，而不会出现明显的失活。这意味着该过程不仅高效，而且高度选择性，能够产生丙烯，同时产生最少的副产品。

综上所述，PDH技术提供了一种可持续、高效且选择性的丙烯生产方法，通过创新地使用丙烷作为原料和先进的催化过程，解决了传统方法面临的挑战。
