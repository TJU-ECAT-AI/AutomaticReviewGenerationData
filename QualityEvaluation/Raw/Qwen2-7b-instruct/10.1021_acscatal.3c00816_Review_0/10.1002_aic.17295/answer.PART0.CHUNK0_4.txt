[1] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."
[2] "But the industrial Pt-based catalysts often suffer from short-term stability under the high temperature reaction environment (500700C) via sintering and coke deposition."
[3] "By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600C even after 90h."
[4] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level."
[5] "The introduction of a second metal (Sn,13-17 Ga,18-20 Zn,12, 21-28 In,29 Cu,30, 31 Co,32 Mn,33 Ni,34 etc.) is an efficient way to suppress coke formation and Pt sintering."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often struggle with limited feedstock availability due to the scarcity of suitable raw materials. PDH technology, however, utilizes readily available propane from clean energy sources like shale gas, which is abundant and sustainable. This makes it an attractive option for propylene production. In terms of process efficiency, PDH requires high reaction temperatures (500-700°C) to achieve reasonable conversion levels, which can lead to issues like coke deposition and Pt sintering. The introduction of a second metal, such as Zn, in Pt-based catalysts helps suppress coke formation and Pt sintering, enhancing the stability and efficiency of the process. The cooperative action of spatially and lattice-constrained PtZn intermetallic alloys and single-site Zn in the zeolite framework results in high propylene selectivity (over 99%) without obvious deactivation, even under high temperatures (600°C) and prolonged operation (90 hours). This showcases PDH technology's capability to produce propylene efficiently and sustainably, addressing the critical needs of the global economy.

面对全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最具有前景的方法，因为它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。传统方法往往因为可用原料稀缺而面临挑战。然而，PDH技术利用来自如页岩气等清洁能源来源的易于获取的丙烷进行生产，这使得它成为一种有吸引力的丙烯生产选项。在过程效率方面，PDH需要高达500-700°C的反应温度以达到合理的转化率水平，这可能导致焦炭沉积和铂颗粒聚集的问题。通过在铂基催化剂中引入第二种金属，如锌，有助于抑制焦炭形成和铂聚集，从而增强过程的稳定性和效率。空间和骨架限制的铂锌互金属合金以及在沸石框架中的单点锌的协同作用导致了超过99%的高丙烯选择性，在高温（600°C）和长时间运行（90小时）下仍能保持良好的活性，这表明PDH技术有能力高效且可持续地生产丙烯，满足全球经济的关键需求。
