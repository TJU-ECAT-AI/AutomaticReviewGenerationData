[1] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."
[2] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level. Inevitably, alkane dehydrogenation is accompanied by coking via undesired side reactions and sintering via the growth of platinum particles, which greatly reduces the activity and stability of the catalysts."
[3] "The introduction of a second metal (Sn,13-17 Ga,18-20 Zn,12, 21-28 In,29 Cu,30, 31 Co,32 Mn,33 Ni,34 etc.) is an efficient way to suppress coke formation and Pt sintering."
[4] "By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600C even after 90h."
[5] "The introduction of Zn single-site into silicalite-1 zeolite framework for the tailored confinement of PtZn IMA to push the limit of stable and efficient PDH."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is the most promising method for propylene production because it specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. Conventional methods often rely on crude oil, which faces diminishing supplies and environmental concerns. PDH, however, utilizes abundant propane from clean energy sources like shale gas. Additionally, PDH requires high temperatures for propylene production, which leads to unwanted side reactions like coking and sintering of catalysts, reducing efficiency. The introduction of a second metal, such as zinc (Zn), in the PDH catalysts helps suppress coke formation and prevent platinum sintering, thereby maintaining high activity and selectivity. The use of zinc in a specific position within the silicalite-1 zeolite framework allows for the confinement of PtZn intermetallic alloys, leading to high propylene selectivity and stability even at high temperatures. This tailored confinement enhances the performance of the PDH process, making it an efficient and environmentally friendly method for propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是丙烯生产最有前景的方法，因为它特别解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。传统方法通常依赖于原油，这面临着供应逐渐减少和环境问题的困扰。相比之下，PDH利用来自清洁能源如页岩气的大量丙烷。此外，PDH需要高温来生产丙烯，这导致了催化剂上的副反应，如焦化和铂团聚，从而降低了效率。通过在PDH催化剂中引入第二金属，例如锌（Zn），有助于抑制焦化并防止铂团聚，从而保持高活性和选择性。在特定位置将锌用于硅酸盐-1沸石框架中允许对PtZn互金属合金进行精确封装，即使在高温下也能实现高丙烯选择性和稳定性。这种精确封装增强了PDH过程的性能，使其成为一种高效且环保的丙烯生产方法。

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production. It specifically addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

1. **Feedstock Availability**: Conventional propylene production relies on the petrochemical industry, where propylene is derived from oil refining and natural gas processing. This process consumes significant amounts of crude oil and natural gas, leading to supply constraints and environmental concerns. PDH technology, on the other hand, utilizes propane, a byproduct from the extraction of shale gas through clean energy sources. This not only diversifies the feedstock base but also reduces dependence on traditional fossil fuels.

2. **Process Efficiency**: Traditional methods of propylene production involve multiple steps and require high energy inputs, which can lead to inefficiencies. PDH technology, by directly converting propane into propylene, simplifies the process, reducing the number of steps and the associated energy consumption. This streamlined process enhances overall efficiency.

3. **Product Selectivity**: Conventional production methods often involve side reactions, such as coking and sintering, which degrade catalysts and reduce the selectivity of the desired product. PDH technology, particularly the use of PtZn intermetallic nanoalloys (IMAs) encapsulated within Zn-modified MFI zeolite, ensures high propylene selectivity (over 99%) without significant deactivation. This means that the process is not only efficient but also highly selective, producing propylene with minimal byproducts.

In summary, PDH technology offers a sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the challenges posed by conventional methods through its innovative use of propane as a feedstock and advanced catalytic processes.

在对丙烯日益增长的需求背景下，通过直接脱氢制备丙烯的丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术是生产丙烯最有前景的方法。它特别针对传统生产方法面临的一系列挑战：

1. **原料获取**：传统丙烯生产依赖石油炼制和天然气处理过程中的副产品。这不仅消耗了大量的原油和天然气，还存在供应限制和环境问题。而PDH技术利用来自清洁能源来源的页岩气提取过程中产生的丙烷作为原料，不仅扩大了原料基础，而且减少了对传统化石燃料的依赖。

2. **生产效率**：传统的丙烯生产过程涉及多个步骤且能量投入较高，导致效率低下。PDH技术通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，简化了流程，减少了步骤和相关的能量消耗。这一精简的过程提高了整体效率。

3. **产品选择性**：传统生产方法往往伴随着焦化和铂颗粒生长等副反应，这些反应会破坏催化剂并降低目标产品的选择性。使用封装在MFI沸石骨架中的Zn修饰PtZn互金属纳米合金的PDH技术，可以实现超过99%的高丙烯选择性，而不会出现明显的失活。这意味着该过程不仅高效，而且高度选择性，能够产生丙烯，同时产生最少的副产品。

综上所述，PDH技术提供了一种可持续、高效且选择性的丙烯生产方法，通过创新地使用丙烷作为原料和先进的催化过程，解决了传统方法面临的挑战。

In the context of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), the key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH directly converts propane into propylene, bypassing the need for expensive and energy-intensive processes that rely on intermediate hydrocarbons. This method addresses the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is increasingly available from clean energy sources such as shale gas. Process efficiency is improved as PDH operates at high temperatures (500-700°C), which facilitates the direct conversion of propane into propylene with minimal side reactions. Product selectivity is also enhanced, as PDH selectively produces propylene with high purity, minimizing the production of other undesirable byproducts. This method avoids the issues of alkane dehydrogenation accompanied by coking and sintering, which reduce the activity and stability of conventional catalysts.

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. It specifically addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology leverages the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the intermediate formation of undesirable byproducts, such as coke. This method is particularly advantageous given the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources like shale gas. Moreover, PDH processes can operate at high temperatures, typically between 500°C and 700°C, which are essential for achieving reasonable conversion levels. However, conventional Pt-based catalysts face challenges due to issues like sintering and coke deposition at these high temperatures. The introduction of PtZn intermetallic alloys (IMAs) encapsulated within silicalite-1 zeolite, as described in this research, addresses these issues by confining the PtZn IMAs spatially and the framework Zn latticeally. This results in high propylene selectivity (over 99%) without significant deactivation, even after 90 hours of operation at 600°C. The use of single-site framework Zn further enhances the stability and selectivity of the PtZn@S-1 catalyst, opening new avenues for the development of high-performance IMA catalysts.
