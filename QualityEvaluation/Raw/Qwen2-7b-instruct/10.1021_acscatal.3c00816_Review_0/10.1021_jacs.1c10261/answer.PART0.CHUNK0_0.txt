Answer: The document provided does not contain specific information about the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods for propylene. However, PDH technology has been noted for its potential to produce propylene directly from propane, which could offer several advantages over traditional methods such as steam cracking. These advantages might include improved feedstock flexibility, higher product selectivity, and potentially more efficient use of energy and resources. The technology might also help in reducing environmental impact and increasing sustainability, especially if the catalyst used, in this case, isolated Pt atoms in SiOZnOH nests in dealuminated zeolite beta, can be optimized for better performance.

答案：提供的文档中没有具体提到直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战时的关键优势。然而，PDH技术有可能直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这可能为传统方法提供几个优点，如提高原料灵活性、产品选择性以及更高效地利用能源和资源。该技术也可能有助于减少环境影响并提高可持续性，特别是如果在此情况下使用的催化剂（即孤立的Pt原子在SiOZnOH巢中的dealuminated zeolite beta中），可以优化以获得更好的性能的话。
