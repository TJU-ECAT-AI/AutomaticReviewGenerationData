[Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over iron-silicate zeolites Highlights]
• [Fe] Zeolites are 60 times more selective for propane dehydrogenation than [Al] zeolites.
• [Fe] zeolites are effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
• Patterns of selectivity and activation energy are inconsistent with a protolytic reaction mechanism.
• A redox cycle is proposed to explain the observed catalytic activity.

[Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated.]
[Fe]ZSM-5 (MFI) samples with Si/Fe ratios of 26 and 48, and [Fe]beta zeolite (BEA*) with Si/Fe ratio of 15 were synthesized and characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption and ultraviolet-visible (UV/Visible) spectroscopy.

[Most of the Fe atoms remain in framework positions after mild calcination (753 K in air), but most of the Fe species migrate to extra-framework positions after steaming at 973 K.]
Migration of Fe species from framework to extra-framework positions can occur during the monomolecular propane reaction as well.

[The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36).]
The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5.

[A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity.]

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the literature, include its superior selectivity, higher dehydrogenation rates, and lower activation energy compared to conventional methods. This makes PDH particularly promising for propylene production. Specifically, the use of iron-silicate zeolites as catalysts shows 60 times greater selectivity for propane dehydrogenation than aluminum-silicate zeolites. Moreover, the effectiveness of these iron-based catalysts is evident in their ability to convert propane into propylene efficiently, with nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates. This efficiency is further underscored by the fact that the activation energy required for dehydrogenation over iron-silicate zeolites is significantly lower than that for aluminum-silicate zeolites, indicating a more energetically favorable reaction pathway. Additionally, the redox catalytic cycle proposed for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in iron-silicate zeolites offers a plausible explanation for the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity, which cannot be attributed to a protolytic mechanism alone. These findings suggest that PDH technology can address the challenges of conventional production methods, such as feedstock availability and process efficiency, by offering a more selective and energy-efficient route to propylene production.

文献中提到的丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的关键优势包括其优越的选择性、更高的脱氢速率和更低的活化能，这使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法。具体而言，铁硅酸盐沸石作为催化剂，显示出比铝硅酸盐沸石高60倍的丙烷脱氢选择性。此外，这些基于铁的催化剂的有效性体现在它们能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，脱氢速率几乎是裂解速率的20倍。这些效率进一步表明，铁硅酸盐沸石上孤立的Fe骨架位点上的烃类反应所需的活化能明显低于铝硅酸盐沸石，表明了一个更有利于能量的反应途径。此外，提出的氧化还原催化循环为在铁硅酸盐沸石上发生的碳氢化合物反应提供了一种可能的解释，这种循环可以解释观察到的活化能和选择性的差异，而不能归因于单纯的质子转移机制。这些发现表明，PDH技术可以通过提供一种更具选择性和能源效率的丙烯生产途径来解决传统生产方法面临的问题，如原料可用性和工艺效率。
