[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over iron-silicate zeolites Highlights • [Fe] Zeolites are 60 times more selective for propane dehydrogenation than [Al] zeolites."
[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane as the primary feedstock. Propane is widely available and abundant, which ensures a steady supply of raw materials for propylene production. Secondly, PDH technology improves process efficiency by converting propane directly into propylene without the intermediate steps required in conventional methods. This streamlined process reduces energy consumption and lowers operational costs. Thirdly, PDH technology enhances product selectivity, as evidenced by the fact that iron-silicate zeolites are 60 times more selective for propane dehydrogenation than aluminum-silicate zeolites. This higher selectivity leads to a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts and improving the overall yield of propylene.
