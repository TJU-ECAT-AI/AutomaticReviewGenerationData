The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing the challenges of conventional production methods are its enhanced feedstock flexibility, improved process efficiency, and superior product selectivity. PDH technology specifically tackles the issue of feedstock availability by converting propane, which is widely available and abundant, directly into propylene. It addresses process efficiency by offering a more streamlined production route, potentially reducing energy consumption and costs. Moreover, PDH technology demonstrates higher product selectivity, producing a greater proportion of propylene with fewer byproducts, thus optimizing yield and economic benefits.
