[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over iron-silicate zeolites Highlights • [Fe] Zeolites are 60 times more selective for propane dehydrogenation than [Al] zeolites."
[2] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."
[3] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio 0.36)."
[4] "A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, as highlighted in the document, include its superior selectivity for propylene production compared to conventional methods. This technology offers a more efficient process for propylene production due to its higher dehydrogenation rates relative to cracking rates. Additionally, PDH technology demonstrates a significant enhancement in product selectivity, as evidenced by the dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratio of 0.36 in H-[Al]ZSM-5 zeolites, which contrasts with the much higher selectivity of [Fe] zeolites. The proposed redox catalytic cycle in [Fe] zeolites further supports the technology's ability to address challenges in feedstock availability and process efficiency, making PDH a promising method for propylene production.
