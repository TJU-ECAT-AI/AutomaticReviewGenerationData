[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."
[3] "However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."
[4] "Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play significant roles because such features intrinsically influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface."
[5] "This Account describes our recent advances in controllable regulation of metal and oxide NCs toward efficient propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "As a structure-insensitive reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane can occur on an individual active site, while larger ensembles of active sites also induce structure-sensitive side reactions, leading to CC cracking and coke deposition."
[7] "The challenges and perspectives are also discussed. It is hoped that the deliberate manipulation of nanostructured catalysts to regulate the reaction mechanism will hold the key to efficient alkane conversion."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH technology addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by converting readily available propane into propylene directly, bypassing the need for more complex and resource-intensive processes. Secondly, in terms of process efficiency, PDH offers a streamlined route to propylene production, potentially reducing energy consumption and costs compared to conventional methods. Lastly, PDH enhances product selectivity by allowing for more precise control over the dehydrogenation process, minimizing unwanted byproducts and maximizing the yield of propylene. By overcoming the limitations posed by high operating temperatures, PDH technology enables the production of propylene in a more sustainable and efficient manner, making it a preferred choice in the chemical industry.

The document highlights that PDH faces challenges related to high operation temperatures, which can lead to issues such as coking side reactions and particle sintering. Nanostructured catalysts, with their tunable geometric and electronic properties, are crucial in addressing these challenges. These catalysts can influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the surface, thereby regulating the dehydrogenation process. The document discusses recent advancements in the controllable regulation of metal and oxide nanostructured catalysts to enhance the efficiency of PDH reactions. By understanding the active sites and reaction kinetics involved in propane dehydrogenation, researchers aim to optimize catalyst design, leading to improved selectivity and stability. The deliberate manipulation of these nanostructured catalysts holds the key to achieving efficient alkane conversion, contributing to the overall advancement of propylene production technologies.
