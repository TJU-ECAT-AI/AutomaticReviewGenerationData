[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."
[3] "However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."
[4] "Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play significant roles because such features intrinsically influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface."
[5] "However, thermodynamical metastability of these NCs results in grand challenges in their structure-controlled preparation."
[6] "The regulation of material structure and reaction performance at the molecular and atomic levels has attracted extended attention over the past few years."
[7] "In this Account, we review mainly our work on fundamentals and experimental design of nanostructured catalysts toward efficient propane dehydrogenation reactions."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to its ability to address several key challenges. Firstly, PDH technology utilizes propane, which is abundant and readily available as a feedstock, unlike the scarcity of certain raw materials required for traditional propylene production methods. Secondly, PDH offers enhanced process efficiency compared to conventional methods, as it directly converts propane into propylene without the need for additional chemical transformations, minimizing energy consumption and waste generation. Thirdly, PDH improves product selectivity, producing high yields of propylene with minimal byproducts, unlike methods that often result in lower propylene selectivity and higher formation of unwanted byproducts. This makes PDH a more environmentally sustainable and economically viable solution for propylene production.

考虑到全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术凭借其在解决几个关键挑战方面的优势，成为了丙烯生产最有前景的方法。首先，PDH技术利用的是丰富的丙烷作为原料，而传统的丙烯生产方法往往需要稀缺的原材料。其次，与传统方法相比，PDH技术在工艺效率上更具优势，因为它可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需额外的化学转化过程，从而减少了能源消耗和废物产生。此外，PDH还提高了产品的选择性，能够以更高的产量生产丙烯，同时减少副产品的形成，与传统方法相比，后者往往具有较低的丙烯选择性和较高的副产品生成。这使得PDH成为一种更环保、更经济的丙烯生产解决方案。
