[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."
[3] "However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."
[4] "Nanostructured catalysts (NCs) based on metals and/or metal oxides with tunable geometric and electronic properties play significant roles because such features intrinsically influence the adsorption of propyl intermediates on the catalyst surface."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH offers a direct conversion route from propane to propylene, bypassing the need for additional processing steps that are often required in alternative methods, such as methanol-to-olefins or Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins. This streamlined process enhances efficiency and reduces costs.

Secondly, PDH addresses the challenges posed by conventional production methods, especially concerning feedstock availability and process efficiency. Unlike methods that rely on fossil fuels, PDH can utilize propane, a readily available and abundant feedstock. Moreover, PDH operates with high temperatures, which, while challenging, enables the direct conversion of propane into propylene without the need for intermediate products that might require further refining or purification.

Thirdly, PDH ensures high product selectivity. By operating under optimized conditions, PDH selectively converts propane into propylene, minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts such as coke and other impurities. This selective conversion leads to a cleaner production process and higher yield of the desired propylene.

Lastly, PDH has the potential to offer environmental benefits compared to CrOx-based catalysts. While CrOx catalysts are effective, they are less environmentally friendly due to the presence of chromium, which is a heavy metal. PDH, primarily utilizing Pt-based catalysts, represents a more sustainable option, as platinum is considered less hazardous compared to chromium.

Overall, PDH technology offers a promising solution for propylene production by addressing critical challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and environmental impact, making it a preferred choice in the chemical industry.

考虑到丙烯全球需求的增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术以其在丙烯生产中作为最具前景的方法而脱颖而出，相较于传统的生产方法，它在多个关键方面提供了优势。首先，PDH提供了一条从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化途径，跳过了其他方法如甲醇到烯烃或费希尔-特罗普斯到烯烃所必需的额外加工步骤，这使得过程更加高效且成本更低。

其次，PDH解决了传统生产方法所面临的挑战，尤其是在原料可用性和过程效率方面。与依赖化石燃料的方法不同，PDH可以利用丙烷作为易得且丰富的原料。此外，PDH在高温下运行，允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需进一步精炼或净化的中间产品，从而提高了生产效率。

第三，PDH确保了高产品选择性。通过优化条件操作，PDH选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，最大限度地减少了形成不需要的副产品，如焦炭和其他杂质的可能性。这种选择性的转换导致了一个更清洁的生产过程，并提高了所需丙烯的产量。

最后，PDH有可能提供环境优势，相较于CrOx催化剂。尽管CrOx催化剂有效，但它们在环境友好性方面相对较差，因为其中含有重金属铬。相比之下，主要使用铂基催化剂的PDH代表了一个更可持续的选择，因为铂被认为比铬更无害。

综上所述，PDH技术通过解决与原料可用性、过程效率和环境影响相关的关键挑战，为丙烯生产提供了有前景的解决方案，使其成为化学工业中的首选方法。
