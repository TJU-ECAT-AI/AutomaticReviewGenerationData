[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."
[2] "As an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."
[3] "This paper is aimed at delivering general fundamentals for rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. We start with the catalytic kinetics on the active sites regarding the adsorption of key propyl intermediates on the surface."
[4] "The thermodynamical metastability of these NCs results in grand challenges in their structure-controlled preparation."
[5] "However, as an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."
[6] "This Account describes our recent advances in controllable regulation of metal and oxide NCs toward efficient propane dehydrogenation."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages over conventional production methods. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, a readily available resource, for propylene production. Secondly, PDH processes are designed to operate at high temperatures, typically above 500°C, which enhances process efficiency. Lastly, PDH aims to improve product selectivity, minimizing unwanted side reactions such as coking and particle sintering that can reduce yield and compromise catalyst stability. These advantages collectively make PDH a promising method for propylene production, especially in addressing the limitations faced by traditional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
