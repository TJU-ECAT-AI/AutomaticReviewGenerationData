The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges faced by conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology leverages the abundance and affordability of propane, a readily available feedstock. Unlike traditional methods that might require expensive investments or face limitations in feedstock sourcing, PDH utilizes existing production facilities efficiently, minimizing capital expenditures. Moreover, PDH offers high product selectivity, producing propylene with minimal byproducts. The process is optimized to yield propylene selectively from propane, ensuring a more efficient conversion and a higher yield of the desired product. This approach not only maximizes the utilization of propane but also enhances the economic viability of propylene production.
