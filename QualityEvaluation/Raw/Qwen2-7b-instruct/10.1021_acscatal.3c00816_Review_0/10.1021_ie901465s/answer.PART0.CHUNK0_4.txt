The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology allows for the utilization of abundant and inexpensive propane feedstock, which is easily available through petrochemical processes. It does not require significant capital investment, as existing production facilities can be retrofitted to incorporate PDH technology. Additionally, PDH offers enhanced product selectivity, particularly for propylene, by controlling the dehydrogenation process to maximize propylene yield. The best conversion range for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene is approximately 23% conversion, resulting in a high propylene selectivity of 94%.
