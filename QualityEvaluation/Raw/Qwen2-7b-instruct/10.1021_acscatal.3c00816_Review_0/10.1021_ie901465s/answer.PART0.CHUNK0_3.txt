[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products."
[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes."
[3] "Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."
[4] "Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."
[5] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."
[6] "However, SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks."
[7] "Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."
[8] "However, no study to date has focused on detailed characterization of PtSn/SAPO-34 with varying Pt and Sn content and their parametric characterization."
[9] "The optimum operating parameters to produce propylene selectively from propane dehydrogenation are as follows: temperature 585 C, WHSV 5.6 h1, TOS 15 h, and H2/C3H8 ratio 0.25."
[10] "The OPE suggested that the best conversion range for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene is around 23% conversion, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94 wt %."

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology stands out as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages. Firstly, PDH addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing readily available propane feedstock, thereby eliminating the need for expensive and resource-intensive processes typically required for propylene production from heavier hydrocarbons. This not only makes the PDH process more economically viable but also enhances the sustainability of propylene production. Additionally, PDH offers superior process efficiency, as it directly converts propane to propylene without the intermediate steps of cracking or reforming, thus reducing energy consumption and lowering environmental impacts. Furthermore, the PDH process yields higher product selectivity, meaning a greater proportion of the output is propylene, which is essential for the chemical industry's raw material needs. These benefits collectively make PDH a preferred choice for propylene production, especially considering the increasing demand for propylene in various sectors such as plastics, solvents, and automotive components.
