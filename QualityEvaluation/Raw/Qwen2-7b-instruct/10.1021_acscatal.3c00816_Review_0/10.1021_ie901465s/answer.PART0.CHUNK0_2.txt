[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products."
[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes."
[3] "Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."
[4] "Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."
[5] "However, SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks."
[6] "Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."
[7] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."
[8] "The OPE suggested that the best conversion range for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene is around 23% conversion, where the propylene selectivity was as high as 94 wt %."

1. The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology are its ability to address the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH technology leverages cheap and readily available propane, eliminating the need for expensive investments in infrastructure. This method offers a more efficient production route compared to traditional processes, particularly in terms of yield and selectivity, thanks to the use of highly selective catalysts such as PtSn/SAPO-34. The SAPO-34 support system is advantageous due to its lack of drawbacks associated with other supports, such as quick deactivation. Additionally, SAPO-34's weak surface acidity and shape-selective opportunities contribute to its effectiveness in dehydrogenating propane to propylene with high selectivity.

2. The optimal operating parameters for maximizing propylene production through direct propane dehydrogenation are a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of 5.6 h⁻¹, a conversion range of 14-25%, an H₂/C₃H₈ molar ratio of 0.25, and a time on stream (TOS) of 15 hours. These conditions enable the highest propylene selectivity of 94 wt % and total olefin selectivity of 97.2%, demonstrating the PDH technology's efficiency in producing propylene selectively from propane.

1. 烷烃直接脱氢（PDH）技术的主要优势在于它能够解决传统生产方法面临的原料获取、工艺效率和产品选择性等方面的问题。PDH技术利用价格低廉且易于获得的丙烷，无需昂贵的基础设施投资。与传统过程相比，这种方法在产出和选择性方面更高效，这得益于使用如PtSn/SAPO-34这类高选择性催化剂。SAPO-34支持系统的优势在于它没有其他支持材料所具有的缺点，如快速失效。此外，SAPO-34的弱表面酸性和形状选择性特性有助于其有效将丙烷转化为丙烯，具有高选择性。

2. 实现最大化丙烯生产的最优操作参数包括温度585°C、小时空间速度（WHSV）为5.6 h⁻¹、转化率范围14%-25%、H₂/C₃H₈摩尔比为0.25以及反应时间15小时。这些条件使得丙烯的选择性达到94 wt %，总烯烃选择性达到97.2%，表明PDH技术在从丙烷中选择性地生产丙烯方面的效率。
