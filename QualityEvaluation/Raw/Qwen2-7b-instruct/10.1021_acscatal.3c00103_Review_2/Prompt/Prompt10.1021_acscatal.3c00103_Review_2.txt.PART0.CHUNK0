3. Strategies for Catalytic Stability Enhancement
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Although the direct dehydrogenation technique has been industrialized, the fabrication of the corresponding catalysts is still confronted with a series of plights. The design of supported metal catalysts is significantly important. Decades have witnessed the efforts made and strategies proposed by devoted researchers to optimize the catalyst performance and improve the catalytic stability from a wide panorama. In this section, strategies focused on catalytic stability enhancement in recently reported works are summarized.
3.1. Introducing Promoters
Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters. Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on. In this section, promoters for Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts are summed up (Table 1) with the sharp revelation of the functional mechanisms.

3.1.1. Pt-Based Catalysts
Metallic Pt has already been recognized as an effective catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to its high affinity for paraffinic CH bonds. As discussed above, the PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive reaction whose kinetics is independent of the Pt particle size, while the side reactions are usually structure-sensitive reactions that are dependent on the particle size of Pt and the exposed crystal faces. Small-sized and highly dispersed Pt particles are usually preferable for the PDH reaction due to their considerable catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propylene. (64,65) Aguilar-Rios et al. investigated the relationship between the catalytic activity and the Pt dispersion and found that the dehydrogenation activity was enhanced along with the increase of Pt dispersion. (66) Pt particles with different exposed lattice planes usually manifest distinct catalytic behaviors. (67) Definitely, Pt particles with the exposed (211) surface have higher CH activation ability, while Pt particles with the exposed (111) surface exhibit higher selectivity resulting from the low binding energy to propylene. (50) Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems. As is generally acknowledged, these promoters are believed to exert geometric and electronic effects pivotally to active components. (6871) Metal promoters can inhibit the aggregation of active sites and reduce the number of neighboring Pt atoms within the assembles, and the electron transfer they provide can tune the electronic properties of central sites, increasing the energy barriers of deep dehydrogenation and adjusting the ability to adsorb propylene.
Sn is a widely utilized promoter for Pt catalysts. Alloying Pt with Sn can significantly alter the electronic and geometric structure of Pt sites. (30,7274) The electronic effects are reflected in the reduction in the d band of Pt sites and the adjustment of reaction barriers, effectively reducing the coke formation. Singh et al. found that after alloying with Sn, the Pt d band became narrower and moved down relative to the Fermi energy level, which resulted in lower adsorption of the hydrocarbons and hydrogen. (75,76) Unlike Pt alone, the energy barrier of propylene dehydrogenation increased with a lower barrier for propylene desorption, indicating that the addition of Sn could help to achieve higher catalytic selectivity (Figure 3a,b). (77) Furthermore, through the confirmation of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra presented in Figure 3c,d, it is typically observed that electron transfer from Sn to Pt occurs after alloying of Pt with Sn. (78) The geometric effect is reflected in the improvement of the Pt dispersion and antisintering ability. A detailed segregation role of Sn in PtSn catalysts was investigated by employing an acid etching technique for the simulation of Sn species loss on the PtSn alloy surface and the structure evolution of coreshell particles. (79) It was shown that this PtSn alloy surface could recover completely due to the migration of Sn atoms from the core to the shell, which was a pivotal property for obtaining highly stable and renewable catalysts. Besides, DFT calculations performed at the atomic level investigated the relationship between the segregation energy (the energy needed for the migration of Sn atoms from the core to the surface) and the number of Sn on the surface and indicated that the PtSn surface particle is recoverable and thermodynamically preferable due to the Sn segregation. Though the PtSn catalysts have already been applied in commercial production for decades, stability improvement is still possible and necessary in this field. Recently, a SiO2-supported PtSn nanoparticle catalyst that could operate the PDH reaction at thermodynamically limited conversion levels was reported. (80) The key was the premixing of the metallic precursors (chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride with a proper ratio) to form a heterometallic PtSn coordination complex that could maintain the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn during reduction and catalytic operation. The electron transfer from Sn to Pt increased the local electron density of Pt, strengthened the local Coulombic repulsion, and lowered the electron binding energy, while the geometric effect conferred by the Sn addition effectively reduced the ambient PtPt ensembles and elevated the anticoking ability. The prepared PtSn/SiO2 was stable and could operate at the thermodynamic selectivity to propylene (>99%) during a 30 h PDH reaction with a low deactivation rate (0.003), which was derived from the reasonable introduction of Sn. In our previous work, a Pt-supported Sn-rich zeolite catalyst was ingeniously designed. (81) After the alloying process, highly dispersed Pt in the form of small PtSn nanoparticles was detected. Besides, the strong electronic interaction between Sn and Pt formed Pt sites in an electron-rich state that were more reactive and selective than mono-Pt sites, as proved by the deviation of the binding energy of Sn and Pt in XPS spectra. The prepared PtSn catalyst exhibited superb catalytic durability on account of its excellent coke-resistant ability and outstanding cycling stability with no obvious decrement in the initial catalytic activity after four successive reactionregeneration cycles.
The PtGa catalyst system has also been implemented in production plants (FCDh technique). Recently, Payard et al. investigated the structureactivity relationship over silica-supported PtGa nanoparticles at a molecular level. (82) It was found that the presence of Ga could reduce the sintering of Pt sites by enhancing the interaction between the support and nanoparticles, increasing the dispersion of Pt, and accelerating the mobility of surface atoms. Both Pt and Ga interacted with SiO bonds at the interface between the nanoparticles and the oxide support, contributing to the stability of the PtGa catalyst.
In has also been developed as a promising promoter of Pt-based catalysts. Zha et al. reported that the bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) exhibited a high activity comparable to those of pure Pt and PtSn alloys and a considerable improvement in the propylene selectivity and stability compared to pure Pt. (83) The role of In was to promote electron transfer from In to Pt, which impacted the adsorption energy of propylene.
Zn is another analogous but economical promoter for Pt-based catalysts. (84,85) Cybulskis et al. investigated the explicit influence of introducing Zn to the Pt species. (70) The Zn selectively tuned the valence orbitals (Figure 3e) and the surface electronic structure of Pt (Figure 3f), resulting in increased product selectivity and stable catalytic performance. In another case, PtZn particles supported on H-ZSM-5 were devised and also exhibited excellent stability with no obvious deactivation after a 65 h dehydrogenation reaction on stream (0.011 deactivation rate) as a result of the interaction between Zn and Pt. (86) Many other metals, including Fe, (8789) Cu, (90,91) and Co, (92) can also be promoters for Pt-based catalysts to adjust the electronic properties and improve the dispersion of Pt atoms for further stability enhancement. A catalyst with PtFe nanoparticles supported on dendritic mesoporous silica was developed and exhibited high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity during a 60 h long-term test. (89) In parallel to Fe, the addition of Cu to a Pt catalyst promoted propylene desorption and inhibited CC cracking, resulting in higher catalytic performance, while the Co could serve as a less active structural promoter to break up large Pt ensembles and thus achieve higher olefin selectivity. (91,92) Alloying of Pt with rare-earth elements (REEs) has barely been accomplished through the conventional H2 reduction route due to the low chemical potential of REE oxides. Recently, however, supported PtREE alloy nanoparticle catalysts for the PDH reaction were reported. (93) PtREE alloys were successfully incorporated into a siliceous MFI zeolite with surface skeleton defects (silanol nests) (94) via a coimpregnation process followed by calcination under an O2 flow and subsequent H2 treatment (Figure 3g). The PtREE catalysts exhibited a high initial conversion of propane (nearly a thermodynamically limited conversion level) and a long catalytic lifetime. The surface silanol nests on the mesoporous zeolite, which provided a unique local electronic ambiance, stabilized the single-atom REEs through the formation of coordination bonds and further incorporated REEs with Pt to form the PtREE alloy, providing a new insight for developing efficient metal alloy PDH catalysts.
Apart from the intensive attention paid to single-promoter systems, multipromoter systems have also been developed with considerable catalytic performance. Lately, a PtGa catalyst with dual decoration of Pb and Ca was synthesized via a pore-filling coimpregnation method. (95) Briefly, Pb metal that was situated on threefold Pt3 sites could increase the Pt dispersion (Figure 3h) and impose a blocking effect to expose Pt1 sites, which were more selective for propylene (Figure 3i). Meanwhile, the Ca promoters were located between PtGa nanoparticles and the SiO2 support and could donate electrons to Pt. The introduction of Pb and Ca made this catalyst system exhibit outstandingly high catalytic stability for 30 days with no obvious deactivation. Likewise, Qiu et al. selected various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as second promoters to improve the catalytic stability of a Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst. (96) InPt/Sn-SBA-15 exhibited the best catalytic performance because the In promoter significantly affected the resistance to coke deposition and sintering, improving the catalytic stability.
Subsurface regulation has been demonstrated as a promising method to tune the adsorptive properties with the aim of enhancing the catalytic performance of metal alloys. A series of PtMn intermetallic nanoparticle catalysts with different coreshell structures were synthesized by sequential incipient wetness impregnation. (97) The effect of different subsurface compositions on the catalytic behavior was comprehensively investigated. Compared to the monometallic Pt subsurface, the Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface exhibited higher CH activation and propylene selectivity due to lower adsorption energy of the surface sites according to DFT calculations and experimental measurements (Figure 3j). Likewise, supported PtGa nanoparticles with different surface and subsurface compositions (Figure 3k) were also investigated. (98) The Pt corePtGa shell alloy supported on MFI zeolite (Pt/Ga-MFI) was prepared by impregnating Pt on Ga-MFI, while the PtGa corePtGa shell alloy catalyst (PtGa/MFI) was prepared by the PtGa coimpregnation method. PtGa/MFI exhibited higher propylene selectivity (Figure 3l) and anticoking ability because the constructed PtGa subsurface effectively increased the electron density of surface Pt and thus promoted propylene desorption.
In summary, introducing metal promoters into the Pt-based catalysts can adjust the geometric and electronic properties of Pt species, significantly improving the catalytic stability. Several metals (Sn, Ga, In, Zn, and Cu) were developed as effective promoters, as discussed above. This provides great opportunities for the sufficient utilization of Pt at the atomic scale and reduction of Pt dosage. However, in practical production, excessive amounts of metal promoters are usually utilized to construct stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, which makes this strategy uneconomical. For instance, during the PDH process, PtSn nanoparticles may separate into Sn and Pt atoms and finally form SnOx and large Pt particles. (3) To avert this situation, large amounts of Sn are usually introduced into Pt-based catalysts (Sn:Pt atomic ratio  4) to help stabilize the PtSn alloy or intermetallic. (99) Thus, there is still a long way to take measures for the reasonable introduction of promoters.
3.1.2. Metal Oxide-Based Catalysts
Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, including CoOx-, ZnOx-, VOx-, and CrOx-based catalysts, are other important PDH catalysts and have been extensively studied for decades. (51) The catalytic activity emanates from the Lewis acid MO sites that can effectively activate the CH bonds on alkanes. Unlike Pt-based catalysts, the dehydrogenation pathways strongly depend on their disparate structures and coordination states. Investigations to reveal the nature of the active sites on diverse metal oxide-based catalysts are still ongoing due to the complicated structure of the active compounds. The coke formation rate typically increases with the degree of oxide polymerization in many metal oxide-based catalytic systems, indicating that crystalline bulk oxides are usually not preferred for the dehydrogenation reaction. (17,18,63,100) Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. (101,102) A series of binary CrZrOx species supported on commercial SiO2 with different Cr and Zr ratios were recently devised. (103) The prepared Cr20Zr80/SiO2 catalyst exhibited splendid catalytic stability with no obvious activity decrease in 50 dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles, which was ascribed to the synergy and dilution effects between ZrOx and CrOx species that were generated from the positive impact on the lattice of ZrO2 due to the introduction of Cr. Additionally, the presence of alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal promoters could increase the dispersion of the active phase and help immobilize the oxidative active sites by forming strong interactions. ZnOx-based catalysts have been demonstrated as promising catalysts for PDH reaction, although they suffer from serious volatilization. MgO as a stabilizer was introduced into a ZnOx/S-1 catalyst to control the reaction-induced loss of the active Zn component. (104) The catalytic cyclic stability of ZnOx/S-1(1.0 Mg) in the PDH reaction was improved, and no obvious loss in catalytic activity was observed after six reaction/regeneration cycles compared with the MgO-free sample (Figure 4a) on account of the inhibitory effect on the loss of ZnOx species derived from the formation of stable ZnOMg bonds (Figure 4b) as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. In addition, the introduction of MgO did not affect the intrinsic activity and phase of ZnOx species (Figure 4c,d).
Another effective approach to improve the dehydrogenation performance is to regulate metal oxides with noble metals. A trace amount of Pt-modified ZnO supported on mesoporous Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized, in which the Pt acted as the promoter while Zn2+ species were identified as active sites. (105) It was indicated that ZnO was a strong Lewis acid because the electron transfer from Zn to Pt put ZnO in an electron-deficient state. After the introduction of Pt, higher activity and stability were achieved, which resulted from the inhibition effect on the reduction of zinc oxide. Besides, the achieved accelerated H2 desorption and easier CH activation (Figure 4e,f) significantly improved the selectivity toward propylene. In parallel to the ZnOx-based catalyst, Pt-promoted GaOx/Al2O3 as a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst was also devised for the dehydrogenation of propane. (106) With a mere 1000 ppm Pt addition, high catalytic activity and selectivity coupled with excellent durability were achieved due to the existence of bifunctional active phases. Lately, the intrinsic effect of a Pt-modified GaOx catalyst for propane dehydrogenation with H2 cofeeding was investigated. (107) The presence of Pt promoted the H2 dissociation (Figure 4g) and boosted the formation of a high coverage of surface Gaδ+H species that were more stable and selective to propylene (Figure 4h).
Compared with the studies on metal promoters, there are relatively few reports on metal oxide promoters. Metal oxide and noble metal promoters are commonly used to stabilize the active compounds and adjust the valence of metal oxides for metal oxide-based catalysts. The introduction of an appropriate metal oxide or noble metal into a catalytic system can greatly enhance the catalytic performance. However, the introduction of an inappropriate metal oxide may suppress the intrinsic activity of the active compound and result in bad PDH performance. Thus, how to select an effective metal oxide reasonably based on different catalytic systems is the key to this design strategy.
