Ultrasmall Co confined in the silanols of dealuminated beta zeolite: A highly active and selective catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene Highlights • CoSiBeta catalysts have state-of-the-art productivity for direct dehydrogenation of propane. • CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance. • The CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles. • The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH.
Abstract CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction. The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support. The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites. Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts. This work proves the high catalytic ability and product selectivity of small confined Co particles, as well as providing novel inspiration for the design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and advanced catalysts for PDH.
Graphical abstract A small amount of Co (0.5 wt%) supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite shows much better catalytic performance than other Co catalysts. The small confined metallic Co serving as the active site is proposed.

1. Introduction
Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction [3] . Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] . Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene.
The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] . Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5 [11] . However, the specific active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH is still unresolved. The catalytic ability of Co(II) for CH activation of propane was proposed by Coperet et al.
[10] . Hu et al. reported that silica-supported single-site Co2+ was highly selective toward propylene [12] and proposed a nonredox mechanism involving heterolytic CH bond cleavage over single-site Co2+ sites in tetrahedral coordination. Afterward, they put forward that the tetrahedral Co2+ species acting as Lewis acidic sites in CoAl2O4 were also active sites in the PDH reaction [13] , which could not be reduced during the reaction procedure at 550 C. They did not explain the presence of an induction period or the cause of catalyst deactivation. Sun et al. similarly reported that the surface Co spinel derived from tetracoordinated Co(II) on Al2O3 support under reaction conditions accounted for catalyzing the PDH reaction at a low Co loading [14] , and large Co3O4 crystallites formed at high Co loadings were easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of cracking reactions. Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co [15] . Tetrahedral Co2+ ions are widely recognized to be the active phases in spite of the varied coordination environments. Metallic Co was considered as the active site for cracking and coking reactions, which are responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the above reports showing the catalytic ability of Co2+ lacked contrasting experiments with reduced Co catalysts.
Recently Lis group gave new insight into the active phase of Co/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction [16] . The Co/Al2O3 catalyst treated through a reductionreoxidization procedure showed high catalytic activity, indicating that small metallic Co particles were the active sites. This inspires us to reexamine the active phases of cobalt catalysts in PDH. Moreover, there is a great need to explore an efficient cobalt catalyst for PDH because the catalytic performance of the previously reported cobalt catalysts is still unsatisfactory and falls short of industrial demand.
The distribution and reduction behavior of cobalt species is directly related to the support types, while general SiO2 and Al2O3 supports have inferior structures leading to ill-defined surface-active species. To expose more active sites, metal catalysts are generally downsized into nanoparticulate form and stabilized onto certain substrates. Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts [17] ,[18] . Moreover, the dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions [19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] .
We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH. After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments likely contained single cobalt species, as detected by a series of techniques of XRD, N2 sorption, DRIFT, DR UVvis, NH3 TPD, H2 TPR, XPS, TEM, and EDS mapping. By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed. A sequence of CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were also prepared and characterized, confirming that the small metallic Co particles confined in silanols are active sites, and bulk Co3O4 and large Co0 particles on SiBeta support contribute to cracking and carbon deposition, respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water. Subsequently, the as-obtained SiBeta was dried at 100 C in air overnight.
The obtained SiBeta solid was excessively impregnated with calculated cobalt nitrate solution (1 g of SiBeta in 20 mL of solution) and stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The impregnated samples were dried at 80 C for 8 h and then calcined at 600 C for 6 h in air with a heating rate of 10 C min1. The resultant samples were named as xCoSiBeta, where x refers to the mass percentage of Co (x = 0.5, 1, 3. and 10). The in situ reduction treatments over the xCoSiBeta samples were carried out at 600 C for 1 h in the reactor in flowing pure H2. The obtained catalysts were denoted as RexCoSiBeta. The in situ reduction treatments over the 0.5CoSiBeta sample were carried out at different temperatures of 600, 700, and 800 C, and these catalysts were labeled as Re0.5CoSiBeta600, Re0.5CoSiBeta700, and Re0.5CoSiBeta800, respectively. The Re10CoSiBeta catalyst was taken out of the reactor and then exposed to air overnight. The obtained sample was named as Reox10CoSiBeta.
Raw AlBeta zeolite was used to prepare the reference catalyst, and the preparation procedure for the 0.5CoAlBeta catalyst was the same as that for xCoSiBeta. The 0.5 wt% Co supported on Al2O3 as a reference catalyst (0.5Co/Al2O3) was also prepared by the same method.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were determined at 196 C using a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. The samples were outgassed at 200 C for 8 h before measurements. The specific surface area was obtained by the standard BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) equation, and the total pore volume was determined from the desorption branch of isotherms at a relative P/P0 of 0.98.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with CuKα radiation at λ = 1.5406 Å.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were measured at room temperature with a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm1.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as electron energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), was carried out on a JEOL JSM-2800 microscope at 200 kV.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2 TPR) experiments were conducted on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyzer equipped with a U-shaped tubular microreactor in an electrical furnace. The sample (50 mg) was degassed at 600 C in He for 30 min. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the sample was treated by 10 vol% H2/Ar mixed gas (110 mL min1), from 100 to 950 C at a ramp rate of 10 C min1.
The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3 TPD) profiles were similarly obtained from a Quantachrome ChemBET-3000 analyzer. Samples of 100 mg were pretreated at 600 C under He for 1 h, followed by saturation them with NH3 at 80 C for 30 min. Then the experiments were carried out from 100 to 650 C in He.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic AlKα X-ray excitation source. The reported binding energies were calibrated against the C1s peak at 284.8 eV.
Diffuse reflectance ultravioletvisible (DR UVvis) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV2450 using BaSO4 as white standards.
2.3. Catalytic PDH evaluation
PDH reactions were carried out on a quartzose fixed-bed microreactor (6 mm in inner diameter) under atmospheric pressure. All samples were pressed into tablets, crushed, and sieved into a particle size fraction of 0.250.5 mm in order to achieve plug-flow isothermal conditions. Subsequently, 0.050.3 g of the sieved fraction was loaded into the isothermal zone of the reactor using two quartz wool plugs. A thermocouple was placed in the isothermal zone to measure the operation temperature. Specifically, all the ReCoSiBeta catalysts were obtained in situ at preset temperatures, and the reactor was cooled to 200 C after reduction. Without disconnecting the reactor, the activity tests were performed. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-6890), which was equipped with a GDX-01 column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The following reaction conditions were set in these activity tests: reaction temperatures, 550 and 600 C; total flow rate of gas reactant, 20 mL min1 (5 vol% propane in nitrogen). The propane conversion (Cpropane), propylene selectivity (Spropylene), and propylene yield (Ypropylene) were calculated on the basis of a carbon atom balance method as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performances of 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts
The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta and Re0.5CoSiBeta600 catalysts is shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 1 . Carbon balance remains above 95% in all experiments. At such a low Co loading, the propane conversion of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst reaches ca. 40% at first and then gradually increases to ca. 53% within 30 min. After 6 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases to ca. 40%. It is noticeable that its propylene selectivity remains at ca. 98% during the whole reaction, which is hard to realize at such a high propane conversion. The Re0.5CoSiBeta600 catalyst shows a higher initial propane conversion of ca. 55% and ta maximal propane conversion of ca. 57% with a shorter induction period of 10 min. Then the propane conversion decreases to ca. 45% after 6 h on stream. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the Re0.5CoSiBeta600 progressively increases from 96% to 97% as the reaction goes on, slightly lower than that of 0.5CoSiBeta. Overall, 0.5CoSiBeta has propylene productivity similar to that of Re0.5CoSiBeta600, while the induction period of the former is longer and more considerable.

The catalytic performance of the Re0.5CoSiBeta catalysts prereduced at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 2 . The maximal propane conversion of Re0.5CoSiBeta increases from 57% to 72% with the elevation of reduction temperature from 600 to 700 C, and decreases to 41% as the reduction temperature increases further to 800 C ( Fig. 2 a). After 6 h on stream, the Re0.5CoSiBeta700 has the highest deactivation rate of 44.5% ( Table 1 ). The propylene selectivities are determined by the corresponding propane conversions, which they all maintain at higher than 92% ( Fig. 2 b). Noticeably, the propane conversion reaches 72% with a propylene selectivity of 92% with the Re0.5CoSiBeta700 catalyst. Such high catalytic performance is on the upper level among most reported Pt and CrOx catalysts. The comparison data are listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material . The catalytic performance of the Re0.5CoSiBeta600 catalysts obtained over different reduction periods is shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material ; the maximal propane conversion of Re0.5CoSiBeta600 decreases from 57% to 49% as the reduction time increases from 60 to 80 min, while the propylene selectivities at steady state have a slight difference of within 2%, indicating the minor influence of reduction time on the propylene selectivity.

3.2. Characterization of 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts
The XRD patterns and DRIFT spectra of AlBeta, SiBeta, and 0.5CoSiBeta samples are presented in Fig. 3 . A sequence of preparation procedures have no significant influence on the characteristic BEA structure of Beta zeolite but influence the intensity of diffraction peaks ( Fig. 3 a). The position of the main diffraction at 2θ around 22.5 corresponding to the d302 spacing of Beta zeolite has shifted slightly in different samples. Obtained from the corresponding 2θ value ( Table 2 ), the d302 spacing declines from 3.9414 Å (AlBeta, 2θ = 22.54) to 3.9346 Å (SiBeta, 2θ = 22.57), demonstrating the contraction of the BEA matrix after concentrated nitric acid treatment. Then the cobalt introduction and high-temperature calcination lead to the expansion of the SiBeta zeolite framework, which is reflected by the increase of 2θ value to 3.9484 Å (0.5CoSiBeta, 2θ = 22.50), suggesting that partial cobalt species are located in the T-site positions. The specific surface area and total pore volume of the CoSiBeta catalysts with Co loading less than 3 wt% have no significant difference, as listed in Table 2 , indicating the slight change of the textural structures after a series of treatments.

Silanols were analyzed in the hydroxyl vibration region of the DRIFT spectra of the selected catalysts presented in Fig. 3 b. The band at 3730 cm1 in all samples is assigned to the fundamental OH stretching vibration of isolated external silanols, and the band at 3600 cm1 shown in the AlBeta sample corresponds to the bridging hydroxyl groups (AlOHSi) [23] ,[24] . Upon dealumination treatment, the band at 3730 cm1 is well reserved, while the 3600 cm1 band disappears due to the removal of lattice Al atoms. Simultaneously, a broad new band appears at 3440 cm1, revealing the presence of vacant T-sites associated with silanols as reported in previous studies [25] ,[26] . The incorporation of cobalt has a very slight effect on the intensity of the 3440 cm1 band, indicating that very few Co(II) ions are anchored in the silanols [27] . The band at 3730 cm1 is intense in the 0.5CoSiBeta, possibly attributable to perturbation by the interactions with adjacent Co species [12] . The SiBeta is free of any acidic sites after dealumination, as shown in Fig. S2 . There are very weak NH3 desorption peaks on the CoSiBeta catalysts, which does not conform to the results for Lewis acidic Co(II) in zeolite framework [12] . Thus, it can be inferred that the calcination in air for 6 h transforms framework Co(II) into extraframework cobalt species. Consistently, the as-prepared 0.5CoSiBeta sample after impregnation was light blue, and turned gray-white after calcination treatment. It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption.
The morphology of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst was characterized by TEM. As seen in Fig. 4 a, there are no particles, which may be due to the high dispersity and low content of cobalt. Still, no Co particles can be discerned in Fig. 4 b under higher magnification. The EDS spectrum of this TEM image ( Fig. 4 c) confirms the absence of impurities, and EDS mapping ( Fig. 4 d) evidences the presence of Co, which is well dispersed throughout the whole SiBeta support. Therefore, a battery of post-treatments cause the cobalt species to be confined in the SiBeta support with a highly dispersed distribution. Combined with above XRD and DRIFT results, this suggests that the dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment [11] .

All the prereduced samples were unavoidably oxidized to cobalt oxides by air before characterization due to the limitation of conditions [28] ,[29] . The existence of cobalt species in SiBeta zeolite was investigated by H2 TPR, XPS, and DR UVvis measurements ( Fig. 5 ). In the H2 TPR profiles of Fig. 5 a, the catalysts have a weak reduction peak at about 280 C ascribed to the reduction of superficial CoOx on the SiBeta support [30] . The following peaks are ascribed to the reduction of CoO  Co. A broad reduction peak in the range of 400600 C is related to the CoOx clusters located in the T-sites of the zeolite [31] ,[32] . The weak reduction peak above 600 C is related to the reduction of framework Co ions [33] . The reduction properties of the 0.5CoSiBeta indicate that the cobalt species are mainly present in the form of confined CoOx, which can easily be reduced to metallic Co in a reductive atmosphere below 600 C. The reduction peaks of the Re0.5CoSiBeta samples at ca. 480 C shift to lower positions, becoming weaker with the elevated reduction temperature from 600 to 800 C, because the overreduction treatment weakens the interaction effect. The number of surface Co sites accessible to H2 is proportional to the H2 consumption [34] , so the intensity of the peak at around 480 C decreases with the increase of reduction temperature, probably due to the less accessible CoOx.

The XPS results presented in Fig. 5 b are well consistent with H2 TPR profiles. The core-level binding energy of Co2p3/2 is about 783.3 eV for 0.5CoSiBeta, very close to the reported binding energy of Co2p in CoSiBeta and CoZSM-5 [35] , indicating that the CoOx species in the 0.5CoSiBeta sample interact strongly with the zeolite framework. For the prereduced samples, the core binding energies of Co2p3/2 shifting to lower positions (ca. 782.5 eV) are related to the oxidation of metallic Co particles, because exposure to air before the XPS measurement is unavoidable. Increasing the reduction temperature to 800 C leads to the aggregation of Co particles, so the Co2p signal is very weak to be discerned in the Re0.5CoSiBeta800 catalyst.
The influence of H2 treatment on the cobalt species was also revealed by the DR UVvis spectra displayed in Fig. 5 c. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst mainly possesses a characteristic band at ca. 330 nm assigned to distorted tetrahedral Co(III), presumably corresponding to the CoOx moieties inside the zeolite channels [36] ,[37] ,[38] , and this band in Re0.5CoSiBeta catalysts is dramatically crippled. Besides, two evident bands at 590 and 660 nm appear in Re0.5CoSiBeta600/700 catalysts and are likely ascribable to the 4A2(F)  4T1(P) dd transition of Td Co(II) in tetrahedral coordination [39] , which might be ascribed to the amorphous cobalt oxides produced from the metallic Co at T-sites under ambient atmosphere [40] ,[41] ,[42] ,[43] . The newborn band at 520 nm is related to the octahedral Co(II) in extraframework cobalt species, while the absorbance band of octahedral Co(II) is less intense (about 100 times) than that of tetrahedral Co(II), so the contribution of octahedral Co(II) in the cobalt oxides is greatly masked [44] . Re0.5CoSiBeta800 shows a significant reduction in the overall intensity of the triplet band, possibly attributable to the aggregation of cobalt species [42] , which is in line with the above H2 TPR and XPS results.
The TEM images of the Re0.5CoSiBeta600/800 catalysts, prereduced for 1 h at 600 and 800 C, respectively, are presented in Fig. 6 . No particles can be observed in the TEM image of the Re0.5CoSiBeta600 sample ( Fig. 6 a and b), while a lot of particles with the mean size 4.15  3.0 nm are clearly seen in the Re0.5CoSiBeta800 ( Fig. 6 c and d). The EDS mappings in Fig. 6 e evidence the particles consisting of Co. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 6 f shows that the interplanar distances of 0.203 and 0.212 nm match the metallic Co (0 0 2) and crystallites CoO (2 0 0), respectively [45] ,[46] ,[47] , indicating that the Re0.5CoSiBeta catalysts include highly dispersed metallic Co and CoO particles that are formed in ambient atmosphere [48] . The TEM results reveal that the overreduction treatment can cause the migration of cobalt species out of the zeolite pores, which may be the reason for the poor catalytic performance of the Re0.5CoSiBeta800 catalyst.

The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with and without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction. However, the higher reduction temperature and longer reduction time lead to lower catalytic activity or higher deactivation rate, possibly because massive Co particles are formed and can easily migrate and aggregate.
3.3. The nature of active Co phases in CoSiBeta catalysts
To further figure out the correlation of catalyst activity and structure, the characterizations and catalytic performance of the CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were compared. The XRD patterns of CoSiBeta catalysts with different Co loadings are presented in Fig. 7 a. All CoSiBeta catalysts show the typical BEA structures of Beta zeolite. The intensities of these diffraction peaks become weaker with the increase of Co loading. The cobalt species are undiscerned on SiBeta support when the Co loading is low, while the diffraction peaks of Co3O4 at 2θ = 31.23, 36.85, 59.36, and 65.24 (JCPDS No. 42-1467) appear when the Co loading reaches 10 wt% [49] . The collected H2 TPR profiles of the CoSiBeta catalysts are displayed in Fig. 7 b. The reduction process starting at relatively low temperature depends on the Co loading. The starting temperature is lowest for the 10CoSiBeta (ca. 250 C), followed by overlapped doublet peaks lower than 390 C, which is consistent with the reduction temperature of pure Co3O4. Overall, the main reduction peak shifts toward higher positions with decreasing Co loading, suggesting that the metalsupport interaction becomes stronger. The main peak at 480 C indicates the predominant existence of confined CoOx in the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst [50] ,[51] . The absorbance band at ca. 200 nm in the DR UVvis spectra ( Fig. 7 c) is related to the BEA structure of SiBeta [52] . The band at 330 nm corresponds to the oxygen-to-metal charge transfer between the framework O atoms and Co(III) ions [9] , the intensity of which decreases with the increase of Co loading. The bands at 460 and 720 nm become more intense due to the formation of Co(II) in octahedral symmetry and crystallite Co3O4 [21] ,[53] . Thus, it can be determined that the cobalt species are mainly present in the forms of confined CoOx for a low Co loading and bulk Co3O4 for a high Co loading in CoSiBeta catalysts.

The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of xCoSiBeta catalysts are presented in Fig. 8 and Table 1 . All propane conversions show similar variation trends, first increasing and then decreasing. The induction period decreases with increased Co loading, from 30 min for 0.5/1CoSiBeta to 10 min for 3/10CoSiBeta catalysts. Moreover, the Co loading has a great effect on the propane conversion. The initial propane conversion increases with the increase of Co loading, from 40% for 0.5CoSiBeta to 86% for 10CoSiBeta. The maximal propane conversion is around 53, 59, 80, and 81% for the 0.5/1/3/10CoSiBeta catalysts, respectively. Increasing Co loading from 3 to 10 wt% does not lead to a significant increase in propane conversion, meaning that there are the same numbers of active sites in the two samples. After 6 h time on stream, the deactivation rates of the 3/10CoSiBeta catalysts are much higher than that of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts ( Table 1 ), with final propane conversion of around 40%. The final propane conversion of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts is 45 and 59%, respectively, slightly lower than the corresponding initial values. The propylene selectivities of the 0.5/1CoSiBeta catalysts are very high and stable, stabilizing at about 98% during the whole reaction. For the CoSiBeta catalyst with high Co loadings, the variation trend of propylene selectivity is evident. The initial propylene selectivity for the 3CoSiBeta is 92% and increases continuously during the reaction. Noticeably, the initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta is null, indicating that only side reactions occur at first. After that, the propylene selectivity rapidly increases to a high value of about 92%, suggesting that the PDH becomes the predominant reaction.

Propane conversion (c) and propylene selectivity (d) of varied 10CoSiBeta catalysts. (The Re10CoSiBeta were obtained from in situ reduction treatment, the Reox10CoSiBeta from reductionoxidation treatment). Reaction conditions: 0.3 g catalyst, 5 vol% C3H8/N2, 20 mL/min, 600 C.
To identify the active Co phases, the Reox10CoSiBeta catalyst was also prepared by exposing the Re10CoSiBeta catalyst to air overnight. The activity comparisons are depicted in Fig. 8 c and d. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta. After 20 min on stream, the propane conversions all reach ca. 80%. The initial propylene selectivities all are null, while the value increases to 92% for Re10CoSiBeta, 70% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and only 20% for 10CoSiBeta within 10 min. Interestingly, all the catalysts exhibit similar catalytic activity (about 80%) and propylene selectivity (about 93%) after 0.5 h on stream, indicating that cobalt species transform into the same active phases in spite of the initial states. After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the three catalysts remain at the same levels of about 40 and 98%, respectively, presenting similar deactivation trends.
Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts. The Co2p XPS spectra of the 10CoSiBeta catalysts pretreated under different conditions are shown in Fig. 9 . The Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks of 10CoSiBeta are present at 781.2 and 796.9 eV, respectively. The doublet separation between the two signals is about 15.7 eV and the weak satellite peaks located at 786.3 and 804.3 eV jointly confirm the predominant presence of bulk Co3O4 [41] ,[54] ,[55] . After the reductionoxidation treatment, a new peak appears at 780.2 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co resulting from reduction [16] , and the doublet separation between the Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks decreases to 15.3 eV, plus intensive satellite peaks at 786.8 and 803.6 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co0 and Co2+ in the Reox10CoSiBeta [16] ,[55] . Here, the prereduction treatment caused the formation of metallic Co, a fraction of which can be reoxidized into CoO because the Co0 nanoparticles are sensitive to aerobic atmosphere [29] . After 10 min on stream, the Co2p XPS signals of 10CoSiBeta were evidently attenuated, possibly due to the coverage of Co particles by deposited carbon, as shown in Fig. 9 b. Also, a peak at around 779.0 eV ascribed to confined metallic Co is seen on the 10CoSiBeta catalyst [16] , confirming that the Co species in 10CoSiBeta can also be reduced under reaction conditions.

The TEM images of Fig. S3 show that the mean particle sizes of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta are 11.48 and 7.67 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of Reox10CoSiBeta in Fig. S4 a evidences the presence of metallic Co (JCPDS No. 15-0806) [56] . The H2 TPR profiles of 10CoSiBeta and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts ( Fig. S4 b) show that the reduction peak of Co3O4 is greatly reduced in Reox10CoSiBeta, and the weak peak is ascribed to the reduction of newly formed CoOx. It can be inferred that the initial content of metallic Co is different and follows the order 10CoSiBeta < Reox10CoSiBeta < Re10CoSiBeta. Therefore, the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts show similar catalytic performances after 0.5 h on stream, regardless of the difference in particle sizes and initial chemical states of cobalt, suggesting that they possess the same active sites starting to function after the external cobalt species are covered with coke deposition. Also, this is reflected by the similar Co 2p XPS spectra after 10 min on stream ( Fig. S5 ). Combined with activity test results, the large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta. After prereduction pretreatment, all the surface Co3O4 particles are reduced to bulk Co0 particles, showing little propane conversion of Re10CoSiBeta at first, which means that the bulk Co are almost inactive for PDH and just result in the carbon deposition.As presented in Fig. S6 , the Re1/3CoSiBeta catalysts show activity and selectivity similar to that of the corresponding 1/3CoSiBeta catalysts during the whole reaction, which is different from the 10CoSiBeta catalyst containing massive Co3O4 particles on the external surface. The binding energies of Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 observed for the 3CoSiBeta catalyst are at 782.0 and 797.6 eV ( Fig. S7 ), with the two spinorbital peaks appearing at 786.0 and 804.5 eV, confirming there are mainly Co(II) species (in confined CoOx), and very few superficial Co(III) species (in Co3O4) can influence the initial catalytic performance [52] . Here, varied cobalt species including bulk Co0 particles, bulk Co3O4, and small confined Co0 particles present on the SiBeta support are illustrated in Fig. 10 . Bulk Co and Co3O4 particles result in coking and side reactions, respectively, and only the small metallic Co particles confined in SiBeta are active sites.Download: Download high-res image (140KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 10.

3.4. Catalyst stability and performance comparison
The recycling stability of the PDH reaction over the CoSiBeta catalyst is a prerequisite for practical application, and thus the reaction stability of 0.5CoSiBeta under forcing conditions was tested here. In Fig. 11 a, after completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt. In Fig. S8 , the 0.5CoAlBeta catalyst shows much lower propane conversion (ca. 20%) and propylene selectivity (ca. 50%) than the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst. According to the DR UVvis spectra in Fig. S9 , framework Co ions are primarily present in the 0.5CoAlBeta catalyst, and thus hard to reduce to metallic Co [57] , which may be the reason for its very weak catalytic performance. The TOF value of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is the highest and reaches 32.9 h1 for the PDH reaction at 550 C, as shown in Fig. 11 b, much higher than those obtained in previous reports. Meanwhile, the propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is also the highest, with a value above 97%. As shown in Fig. S10 , the 0.5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits much weaker catalytic performance (only 5% propane conversion) compared with 0.5CoSiBeta under the same reaction condition. The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown. The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH. Therefore, it was determined that the small metallic Co particles generated by the reduction of confined CoOx are the active sites, which show great catalytic activity with high product selectivity, as well as ideal reusability. Still, the accurate HAADF-STEM and XANES techniques are needed to witness the presence of these Co sites and the connection between them and the silanols.

4. Conclusions
CoOx confined in the SiBeta zeolite by connecting with silanols was prepared by a procedure comprising dealumination of AlBeta, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and calcination at 600 C in air. Great propane conversion and extremely high propylene selectivity were simultaneously realized over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst and match to that over commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts, which is the first time to be reported. The 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity were achieved over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst after prereduction treatment at 600 C, and this catalyst exhibited superior reuse performance with the removal of coke by facile calcination. It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment. Also, the PDH reaction over the metallic Co is likely a structure-sensitive reaction, the target reactivity of which seems to be determined by the metallic Co sizes: small metallic Co leads to high propylene selectivity, possibly by boosting propylene desorption. This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction.
