[1] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[2] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[3] "Studies on these processes are scant, which is why the mechanism explaining the progression from adsorbed atomic carbon to aromatic rings is still largely unknown."
[4] "More detailed studies are needed to better understand this process. For example, it would be beneficial to gain a fundamental understanding on the steps proposed in Schemes 4 and 5 to develop strategies to prevent coke formation through these routes."
[5] "Coke becomes detrimental when large graphitic sheets are formed that cover the catalytically active sites."
[6] "The presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance."
[7] "High yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates, which is counterintuitive."
[8] "Taking into account that Pt-based catalysts typically have low loadings (<1 wt %), whereas GaOx- and CrOx-based catalysts generally have loadings between 5 and 20 wt %, it is clear that on a weight basis Pt represents the most active formulation in PDH."
[9] "However, specific activity values are a very rough approximation of the real TOF of these catalysts."
[10] "The higher activity observed for the Pt-based catalysts may therefore be explained by the significantly lower energy barrier of the rate-limiting step."

To address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes, researchers have developed several key strategies and approaches. Firstly, reducing coke accumulation is crucial. Strategies include using supports with low Brnsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to prevent coke formation. Secondly, gaining a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of coke deposits and aromatic rings is essential. This requires detailed studies on the processes outlined in Schemes 4 and 5. Understanding these mechanisms will enable the development of strategies to prevent coke formation through these specific routes. Thirdly, managing the location of coke on the catalyst surface is important. Large graphitic sheets covering active sites are detrimental, whereas a low amount of coke deposition can sometimes positively influence catalyst performance. Lastly, optimizing catalyst performance involves balancing yield and deactivation rate. Counterintuitively, high yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates. This highlights the importance of catalyst design and the need for low-loading noble metals like platinum, which can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates compared to metal oxides. Despite these advancements, specific activity values can be misleading approximations of the real turnover frequency (TOF) of catalysts, emphasizing the need for further research to accurately quantify catalytic performance. The higher activity of platinum-based catalysts can be attributed to the significantly lower energy barrier of the rate-limiting step, underscoring the importance of considering both theoretical and experimental data in evaluating catalyst efficiency.

为了应对直接脱氢过程中催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，研究人员开发了一系列关键策略和方法。首先，减少焦炭积累至关重要。策略包括使用低Brnsted酸性的支撑材料或通过中毒酸性位点来防止焦炭形成。其次，深入了解焦炭沉积和芳香环形成的机制至关重要。这需要对在方案4和5中概述的过程进行详细研究。理解这些机制将使我们能够开发策略来通过这些特定途径防止焦炭形成。第三，管理催化剂表面焦炭的位置也很重要。覆盖活性位点的大片石墨状结构是有害的，而表面少量焦炭沉积有时可以积极影响催化剂性能。最后，优化催化剂性能涉及平衡产率和失活速率。出乎意料的是，高产率往往与相对较低的失活率相一致。这突显了催化剂设计的重要性以及为什么铂等贵金属的低负载量可以以更高的空间速度运行，并且表现出更低的失活速率与金属氧化物相比。尽管存在这些进步，具体活性值可能是催化剂实际转换频率（TOF）的误导性近似，强调了进一步研究以准确量化催化性能的重要性。铂基催化剂较高的活动性可以归因于率限制步骤的显著较低的能量壁垒，强调理论数据和实验数据在评估催化剂效率时的重要性。
