[1] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy has provided evidence of the formation of acetaldehyde and acetone intermediates as ethane and propane are adsorbed on a mesoporous chromiaalumina catalyst."
[2] "Indeed, metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, albeit they deactivate faster than the Pt-based catalysts."
[3] "However, it should be noted that specific activity values are a very rough approximation of the real TOF of these catalysts."
[4] "For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the same differences of specific activities between the Pt and metal oxide catalysts are observed."
[5] "Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."

1. In situ FTIR spectroscopy has indicated the formation of acetaldehyde and acetone intermediates when ethane and propane are adsorbed on a mesoporous chromiaalumina catalyst.
2. Metal oxide catalysts can achieve yields equivalent to platinum-based catalysts, but they deplete more quickly.
3. Specific activity figures are a simplistic estimate of the true turnover frequency of these catalysts.
4. Similar specific activity differences are noted for the dehydrogenation of isobutane as for propane.
5. There are predictions that in the near future, operando spectroscopy techniques will enable more advanced process control.
