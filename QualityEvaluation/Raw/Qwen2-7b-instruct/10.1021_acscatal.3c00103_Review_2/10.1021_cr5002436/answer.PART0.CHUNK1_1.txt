The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the following:

1. **Understanding Coke Formation**: Researchers have gained insights into the complex process of coke formation, which serves as a seeding point for the addition of olefins and paraffins, leading to the formation of large graphitic structures. This understanding helps in developing strategies to prevent or mitigate coke deposition.

2. **Coke Migration**: It has been discovered that when small polyaromatic species are formed, they can migrate from the metal surface to the support. This migration can be influenced by factors such as the addition of elements like Sn, which weaken the binding of hydrocarbons to the metal, thus facilitating migration.

3. **Catalyst Design**: The ambivalent nature of coke deposits has been recognized. They can be beneficial in certain aspects, such as enhancing the adsorption of reactants near active sites. However, when they form large graphitic sheets covering the active sites, they become detrimental to the catalyst's performance.

4. **Operando Spectroscopy**: Advanced techniques like operando UVvis and Raman spectroscopies are being utilized to monitor the formation and accumulation of coke on catalyst surfaces in real-time. This enables dynamic adjustment of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases to keep the catalyst in its most active state.

5. **Specific Activity Analysis**: Comparative studies have been conducted to understand the differences in specific activity among various catalyst types. These analyses have shed light on the factors influencing catalyst performance, including the nature of active sites and the rate-limiting steps in the dehydrogenation process.

6. **Development of Alternative Catalysts**: While alternative catalysts, especially metal oxides like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have been explored, a practicable alternative to established systems like PtSn and CrOx has not yet been developed. Continued research in this area is crucial for finding more stable and efficient catalysts.

These strategies and approaches collectively aim to address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, thereby enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括以下几点：

1. **理解焦炭形成过程**：研究人员对焦炭形成的复杂过程有了深入理解，这一过程为烯烃和烷烃的添加提供了种子点，导致形成大型石墨结构。这种理解有助于开发防止或减少焦炭沉积的策略。

2. **焦炭迁移**：发现当小聚芳族物种形成时，它们可以从金属表面迁移到载体。这种迁移可以通过添加元素如Sn来促进，Sn可以减弱碳氢化合物与金属的结合，从而促进迁移。

3. **催化剂设计**：认识到焦炭沉积的两面性。它们在某些方面有益，如增强活性位点附近的反应物吸附。然而，当它们形成覆盖活性位点的大面积石墨状结构时，就会对催化剂性能产生不利影响。

4. **原位光谱监测**：使用原位UVvis和拉曼光谱技术实时监测催化剂表面上焦炭的形成和积累。这允许动态调整脱氢和再生阶段，以保持催化剂处于最活跃状态。

5. **特定活性分析**：进行了比较研究，以理解不同催化剂类型之间特定活性的差异。这些分析揭示了影响催化剂性能的因素，包括活性位点的性质和脱氢过程中的限速步骤。

6. **替代催化剂的发展**：虽然替代催化剂，尤其是像GaOx、MoOx和VOx这样的氧化物已经受到关注，但尚未找到可替代现有系统（如PtSn和CrOx）的实用替代品。继续在这领域进行研究对于找到更稳定和高效的催化剂至关重要。

这些策略和方法共同旨在解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，从而提高工业应用中脱氢过程的效率和可持续性。
