Recent advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on enhancing catalyst stability. Key strategies include:

1. **Understanding Deactivation Mechanisms**: Detailed studies of deactivation pathways, particularly coke formation, have been pivotal. This includes investigating the role of acid and basic sites on the catalyst surface, the impact of reaction conditions (such as pressure, temperature, and feed composition), and the effectiveness of additives like promoters and supports.

2. **Promoter Element Incorporation**: Adding elements such as tin (Sn) to platinum-based catalysts has been effective in reducing coke formation by weakening the binding of hydrocarbons to the metal surface. This facilitates easier migration and condensation of small polyaromatic species, reducing the formation of large graphitic sheets.

3. **Support Material Optimization**: Selecting supports with low Brnsted acidity or using supports with specific functionalities (like mesoporous silica) can significantly reduce coke deposition. The interaction between the catalyst and the support plays a crucial role in preventing coke formation.

4. **Regeneration Strategies**: Advanced techniques for catalyst regeneration under oxidative atmospheres have been developed to remove coke without significant loss of catalyst activity. Operando spectroscopy, including UVvis and Raman spectroscopy, has been employed to monitor the chemical nature of coke deposits and adjust regeneration conditions dynamically to maintain catalyst efficiency.

5. **Mechanistic Insights**: Improving understanding of the reaction mechanisms on different catalyst types (like noble metals vs. transition metal oxides) has led to the development of catalysts with optimized active sites and improved stability. For instance, the role of metal-oxygen interactions in chromia-based catalysts and the importance of coordination states in GaOx catalysts have been crucial.

6. **Membrane Technologies**: Implementing membranes in the reactor system to control hydrogen permeability and shift the equilibrium towards olefin products has been explored. This helps in maintaining high olefin yields while minimizing side reactions.

These strategies address the challenges in catalyst design by enhancing stability, improving selectivity, and optimizing operational conditions. They pave the way for more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes in industry, contributing to the economic viability of olefin production from paraffinic feeds.

近期，在直接脱氢过程中，催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的创新主要集中在提高催化剂稳定性。关键策略包括：

1. **理解失活机制**：对失活路径（尤其是焦炭形成）的详细研究至关重要。这包括调查催化剂表面酸性和碱性位点的作用、反应条件（如压力、温度和原料组成）的影响，以及添加剂（如促进剂和支持材料）的有效性。

2. **促进元素的整合**：在铂基催化剂中加入元素，如锡（Sn），通过削弱金属表面与碳氢化合物的结合力来有效减少焦炭形成。这有助于更轻松地迁移和凝结小聚芳烃物种，减少大石墨片的形成。

3. **支持材料优化**：选择低Brnsted酸性的支持材料或使用具有特定功能（如介孔二氧化硅）的支持材料可以显著减少焦炭沉积。催化剂与支持材料之间的相互作用在防止焦炭形成方面起着关键作用。

4. **再生策略**：开发在氧化气氛下进行催化剂再生的技术，以去除焦炭而不显著损失催化剂活性。使用原位光谱技术（如紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱）监测焦炭沉积的化学性质，并根据需要调整再生条件，以维持催化剂效率。

5. **机制洞察**：改善对不同催化剂类型（如贵金属与过渡金属氧化物）反应机制的理解，促进了具有优化活性位点和增强稳定性的催化剂的发展。例如，铬氧化物催化剂中的金属-氧相互作用和镓氧化物催化剂中协调状态的重要性是关键。

6. **膜技术**：在反应器系统中实施膜技术以控制氢气渗透率并推动烯烃产物的平衡，从而保持高烯烃产率的同时最小化副反应。

这些策略通过提高稳定性、改善选择性和优化操作条件来解决催化剂设计挑战。它们为工业中更高效、更可持续的脱氢过程铺平道路，推动了从烷烃原料生产烯烃的经济可行性。
