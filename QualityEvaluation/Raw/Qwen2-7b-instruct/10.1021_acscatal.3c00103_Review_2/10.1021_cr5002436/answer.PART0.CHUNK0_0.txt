近期，针对工业应用中的催化剂设计、制造和性能优化挑战，已开发出一些关键策略和技术。这些进步集中在通过改进支撑材料、促进剂的整合以及催化剂合成方法来提高支持金属催化剂的稳定性。例如，使用介孔支持物如SBA-15可以提供表面面积和孔径之间的平衡，这对催化剂的分散性和稳定性有利。元素如锡（Sn）和锌（Zn）被添加以抑制不希望的副反应并提高选择性和稳定性。合成方法包括共沉淀、原子层沉积和溶胶凝胶过程，允许对催化剂结构和组成的精确控制。引入镧（La）或二氧化硅等掺杂物可防止结块并改善热稳定性，而碱金属如钠（Na）或铯（Cs）则稳定基体并增强活性位点的分散。温和氧化剂如二氧化碳（CO2）通过移除生成的氢气并使平衡朝产物形成方向移动，从而提高活性。优化操作条件，如温度、压力和空间速度，对于最大化催化剂在长时间运行时的性能和稳定性至关重要。
