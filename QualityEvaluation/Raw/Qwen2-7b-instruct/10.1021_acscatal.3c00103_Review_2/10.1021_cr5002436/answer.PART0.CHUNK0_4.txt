[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[5] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."

1. The demand for chemical building blocks, particularly light olefins like propylene and ethylene, has seen steady growth over the years, except in the Eurozone due to economic downturn. This growth in demand is reflected in production across major markets.

2. The abundance of shale gas has significantly lowered gas costs by about 75% compared to prices in 2005. This has made shale gas an attractive option for both energy and chemical feedstock sources.

3. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is heavily influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene. Current market conditions are favorable due to this price difference.

4. The rise in demand from the automotive industry, coupled with the decline in supply from high-cost naphtha cracking, has led to a significant increase in butadiene prices.

5. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through dedicated methods, with the majority being produced via fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking processes.

1. 这些化学基础材料的需求在过去几年中稳步增长，除了欧元区，由于最近的经济衰退影响，所有主要市场均录得需求和产量的积极增长。

2. 天然气供应的增加导致天然气成本下降约75%，与2005年的价格相比。这使得页岩气作为能源来源和化工原料极具吸引力。

3. 环烷烃脱氢的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差，当前市场条件非常有利，因为存在这样的价格差异。

4. 汽车行业需求的增加，加上裂解汽油成本高昂导致的供应减少，已经导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨。

5. 在2007年，只有不到3%的丙烯是通过专门技术生产的，而大部分则是通过流化催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解过程产生的。
