[1] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[2] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[3] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[4] "To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

1. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGL) like ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas.

2. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions advantageous.

3. In 2007, only about 3% of propylene was produced through dedicated methods, while FCC and steam cracking processes dominated the propylene production.

4. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review has been conducted comparing such a broad spectrum of dehydrogenation catalysts, though other reviews have focused on light paraffin dehydrogenation.

1. 石油页岩沉积物中包含大量可从天然气中分离的天然气液体（NGL），例如乙烷和丙烷。

2. 烷基化工艺的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷与丙烯的价格差异，当前市场条件非常有利。

3. 2007年，仅约3%的丙烯通过专门方法生产，而FCC和蒸汽裂解工艺主导了丙烯生产。

4. 我们了解到，没有全面的综述尝试比较如此广泛范围的脱氢催化剂，尽管其他综述关注于轻烷烃的脱氢。
