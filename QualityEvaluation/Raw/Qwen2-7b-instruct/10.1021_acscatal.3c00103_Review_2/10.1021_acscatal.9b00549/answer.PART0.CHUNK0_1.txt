[1] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co catalysts is attributed to geometric effects, specifically the presence of smaller PtPt ensembles and a lowered energy of the Pt 5d orbitals compared to monometallic Pt.

[1] "The similarity in TOR and the difference between the TORs of monometallic Pt and Co suggest that Co activity is negligible in comparison to that of Pt and propane molecules preferentially react on Pt sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The similarity in turnover rates (TOR) and the disparity between monometallic Pt and Co indicate that Co activity is insignificant relative to Pt, with propane molecules predominantly reacting on Pt sites.

[1] "Despite the presence of similar intermetallic phases in the XRD patterns, i.e. Pt3Co, the varying (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the FT magnitude EXAFS at the Pt LIII edge and the presence of two phases in some of the XRD patterns suggest that the average compositions of the nanoparticles among the catalysts are not similar."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Despite the similarity of intermetallic phases like Pt3Co in the XRD patterns, the varying (PtCo):(PtPt) ratios in the EXAFS at the Pt LIII edge and the observation of multiple phases in some XRD patterns indicate that the average compositions of the nanoparticles across the catalysts are not identical.

尽管XRD模式中存在类似的互金属相，如Pt3Co，但Pt LIII边缘的EXAFS中（PtCo）：（PtPt）比率的变化以及某些XRD图案中观察到的两种相表明催化剂纳米颗粒的平均组成并不相同。

[1] "The ability of Co to act as a nonactive promoter is likely due to its lower TOR in comparison to Pt. The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Co's capability to function as a nonreactive promoter seems to stem from its lower turnover rate compared to Pt. The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co catalyst is attributed to geometric effects, including smaller PtPt clusters and a reduction in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals relative to monometallic Pt.

Co作为非活性促进剂的能力可能源于其与Pt相比较低的转速率。表面Pt3Co催化剂的高烯烃选择性归因于几何效应，包括更小的PtPt簇和与单金属Pt相比降低的Pt 5d轨道能量。
