[1] "Bimetallic catalysts with two active metals, Pt and Co, were synthesized with different Co loadings for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Using in situ XAS, XRD, and an XAS surface analysis, the catalysts were shown to lead to different intermetallic structures with different morphologies related to their Co loading."
[3] "At low Co loadings, stable surface Pt3Co surface alloys with a Pt-rich core were formed. As the Co content increased, the catalyst composition formed a full Pt3Co phase with the excess excess CoII remaining on the silica."
[4] "Despite the different nanostructures in these catalysts, the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."
[5] "All PtCo catalysts have much higher propylene selectivity for propane dehydrogenation in comparison to monometallic Pt or Co."
[6] "The high selectivity was maintained at high conversion and in the presence of cofed H2."
[7] "The ability of Co to act as a nonactive promoter is likely due to its lower TOR in comparison to Pt."
[8] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."
[9] "Quantification of the surface structure was only possible due to the analysis of the difference EXAFS spectrum of the reduced and oxidized catalysts."
[10] "Identification of a specific structure by EXAFS is generally not possible. However, utilization of XRD to confirm possible nanostructures where the EXAFS can also be obtained allows one to identify the structure from ratios of CNs."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, as demonstrated in the literature, involve the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts composed of two active metals, platinum (Pt) and cobalt (Co), with different cobalt loadings. These catalysts were synthesized specifically for propane dehydrogenation. The researchers employed various techniques, including in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface analysis, to elucidate the formation of different intermetallic structures and morphologies that are related to the cobalt loading. At low cobalt loadings, the catalysts formed stable surface alloys with a Pt-rich core, transitioning to a full Pt3Co phase with excess cobalt remaining on the silica at higher cobalt contents. Despite variations in nanostructures, each catalyst maintained a Pt3Co structure on its surface. The high propylene selectivity of the PtCo catalysts, compared to monometalllic Pt or Co, was attributed to geometric effects, which led to smaller PtPt ensembles and a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals, facilitating better selectivity for dehydrogenation processes. The identification of the surface structure was only possible through the analysis of the difference EXAFS spectrum of the reduced and oxidized catalysts, providing insights into the catalyst's stability and performance optimization for industrial applications.

在直接脱氢过程中，增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的最新策略和方法包括合成由两种活性金属铂(Pt)和钴(Co)组成的双金属催化剂，并针对丙烷脱氢进行了不同钴负载量的合成。研究人员通过原位X射线吸收光谱(XAS)、X射线衍射(XRD)和表面分析等技术，揭示了不同结构和形态的形成，这些与钴负载量有关。在低钴负载时，催化剂形成了具有Pt富集核心的稳定表面合金，在更高钴含量下，催化剂组成为完整的Pt3Co相，多余的钴保留在二氧化硅上。尽管纳米结构存在差异，但每个催化剂均保持了其表面的Pt3Co结构。相对于单金属Pt或Co的高丙烯选择性，PtCo催化剂归因于几何效应，导致较小的PtPt簇和Pt 5d轨道能级降低，从而提高了脱氢过程的选择性。通过分析还原和氧化催化剂的差分EXAFS光谱来识别表面结构，仅此方法便可能提供有关催化剂稳定性和性能优化的见解，为工业应用提供了指导。

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of bimetallic catalysts composed of two active metals, primarily platinum (Pt) and cobalt (Co). These advancements specifically address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by synthesizing catalysts with different cobalt loadings, leading to the formation of distinct intermetallic structures that vary according to the cobalt content. The synthesis methods employed include incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) to achieve controlled metal loading onto the support material. 

The catalysts are characterized using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. These techniques reveal the formation of Pt3Co surface alloys with Pt-rich cores at low cobalt loadings, transitioning to full Pt3Co alloys with excess cobalt remaining on the support at higher loadings. Further increases in cobalt lead to the formation of a PtCo alloy phase in the core, despite the surface remaining as Pt3Co. At high cobalt loadings, the excess cobalt results in large monometallic cobalt nanoparticles.

Despite the diverse nanostructures of these catalysts, all exhibit a Pt3Co surface structure. They demonstrate significantly higher propylene selectivity compared to monometallic platinum or cobalt catalysts, maintaining this selectivity at high conversions and in the presence of hydrogen cofeeding. The cobalt's role as a nonactive promoter is attributed to its lower turnover rate (TOR) relative to platinum. The high olefin selectivity is attributed to geometric effects, characterized by smaller platinum-atom ensembles and a reduction in the energy of the platinum 5d orbitals compared to monometallic platinum, which inhibits hydrogenolysis while having minimal impact on dehydrogenation reactions.

这些关键策略和方法通过合成包含两种活性金属，主要是铂（Pt）和钴（Co）的双金属催化剂来增强直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性。这些进步特别解决了在催化剂设计、制造和性能优化过程中遇到的挑战，通过合成不同钴加载量的催化剂，导致形成根据钴含量变化的不同互金属结构。

使用原位X射线吸收光谱（XAS）、同步辐射X射线衍射（XRD）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析对催化剂进行表征。这些技术揭示了低钴负载时形成表面Pt3Co合金与Pt富集核心，随着钴负载增加转变为全Pt3Co合金，多余的钴留在支撑物上。进一步增加钴导致内核形成PtCo合金相，尽管表面仍为Pt3Co。高钴负载时，多余的钴导致大量单金属钴纳米颗粒的形成。

尽管这些催化剂具有不同的纳米结构，但它们都具有Pt3Co表面结构。它们表现出与单金属铂或钴催化剂相比更高的丙烯选择性，并且在高转化率和氢气共喂养的情况下保持这种选择性。钴作为非活性促进剂的作用归因于其相对较低的周转率（TOR）相对于铂。高烯烃选择性的原因是几何效应，表现为较小的铂原子簇以及与单金属铂相比铂5d轨道能级的降低，这抑制了氢解离，同时对脱氢反应影响较小。
