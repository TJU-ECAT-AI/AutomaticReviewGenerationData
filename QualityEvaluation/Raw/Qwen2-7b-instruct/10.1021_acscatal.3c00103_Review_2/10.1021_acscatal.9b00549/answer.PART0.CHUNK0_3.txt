[1] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is attributed to two factors: geometric effects leading to smaller PtPt ensembles and a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals compared to monometallic Pt.

[1] "The surface extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) obtained by fitting the difference spectrum between the fully reduced and room-temperature-oxidized catalysts suggest that the surface structure remains Pt3Co, although the core changes from Pt to Pt3Co and to PtCo."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
By fitting the difference spectrum between the fully reduced and room-temperature-oxidized catalysts, the surface extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) indicates that the surface structure stays as Pt3Co, whereas the core transforms from pure Pt to Pt3Co and eventually to PtCo.
