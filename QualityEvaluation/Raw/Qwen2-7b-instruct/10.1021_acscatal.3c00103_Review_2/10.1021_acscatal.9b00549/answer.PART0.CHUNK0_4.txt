The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of bimetallic catalysts composed of two active metals, primarily platinum (Pt) and cobalt (Co). These advancements specifically address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by synthesizing catalysts with different cobalt loadings, leading to the formation of distinct intermetallic structures that vary according to the cobalt content. The synthesis methods employed include incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) to achieve controlled metal loading onto the support material. 

The catalysts are characterized using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. These techniques reveal the formation of Pt3Co surface alloys with Pt-rich cores at low cobalt loadings, transitioning to full Pt3Co alloys with excess cobalt remaining on the support at higher loadings. Further increases in cobalt lead to the formation of a PtCo alloy phase in the core, despite the surface remaining as Pt3Co. At high cobalt loadings, the excess cobalt results in large monometallic cobalt nanoparticles.

Despite the diverse nanostructures of these catalysts, all exhibit a Pt3Co surface structure. They demonstrate significantly higher propylene selectivity compared to monometallic platinum or cobalt catalysts, maintaining this selectivity at high conversions and in the presence of hydrogen cofeeding. The cobalt's role as a nonactive promoter is attributed to its lower turnover rate (TOR) relative to platinum. The high olefin selectivity is attributed to geometric effects, characterized by smaller platinum-atom ensembles and a reduction in the energy of the platinum 5d orbitals compared to monometallic platinum, which inhibits hydrogenolysis while having minimal impact on dehydrogenation reactions.

这些关键策略和方法通过合成包含两种活性金属，主要是铂（Pt）和钴（Co）的双金属催化剂来增强直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性。这些进步特别解决了在催化剂设计、制造和性能优化过程中遇到的挑战，通过合成不同钴加载量的催化剂，导致形成根据钴含量变化的不同互金属结构。

使用原位X射线吸收光谱（XAS）、同步辐射X射线衍射（XRD）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析对催化剂进行表征。这些技术揭示了低钴负载时形成表面Pt3Co合金与Pt富集核心，随着钴负载增加转变为全Pt3Co合金，多余的钴留在支撑物上。进一步增加钴导致内核形成PtCo合金相，尽管表面仍为Pt3Co。高钴负载时，多余的钴导致大量单金属钴纳米颗粒的形成。

尽管这些催化剂具有不同的纳米结构，但它们都具有Pt3Co表面结构。它们表现出与单金属铂或钴催化剂相比更高的丙烯选择性，并且在高转化率和氢气共喂养的情况下保持这种选择性。钴作为非活性促进剂的作用归因于其相对较低的周转率（TOR）相对于铂。高烯烃选择性的原因是几何效应，表现为较小的铂原子簇以及与单金属铂相比铂5d轨道能级的降低，这抑制了氢解离，同时对脱氢反应影响较小。
