[2] "Using in situ XAS, XRD, and an XAS surface analysis, the catalysts were shown to lead to different intermetallic structures with different morphologies related to their Co loading."
[3] "At low Co loadings, stable surface Pt3Co surface alloys with a Pt-rich core were formed. As the Co content increased, the catalyst composition formed a full Pt3Co phase with the excess excess CoII remaining on the silica."
[4] "Despite the different nanostructures in these catalysts, the catalytic surface in each of these catalysts had a Pt3Co structure."
[5] "All PtCo catalysts have much higher propylene selectivity for propane dehydrogenation in comparison to monometallic Pt or Co."
[6] "The high selectivity was maintained at high conversion and in the presence of cofed H2."
[7] "The ability of Co to act as a nonactive promoter is likely due to its lower TOR in comparison to Pt."
[8] "The high olefin selectivity of the surface Pt3Co is suggested to be due to geometric effects, where there are smaller PtPt ensembles, as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals in comparison to that in monometallic Pt."
[9] "Quantification of the surface structure was only possible due to the analysis of the difference EXAFS spectrum of the reduced and oxidized catalysts."
[10] "Identification of a specific structure by EXAFS is generally not possible. However, utilization of XRD to confirm possible nanostructures where the EXAFS can also be obtained allows one to identify the structure from ratios of CNs."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, as demonstrated in the literature, involve the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts composed of two active metals, platinum (Pt) and cobalt (Co), with different cobalt loadings. These catalysts were synthesized specifically for propane dehydrogenation. The researchers employed various techniques, including in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface analysis, to elucidate the formation of different intermetallic structures and morphologies that are related to the cobalt loading. At low cobalt loadings, the catalysts formed stable surface alloys with a Pt-rich core, transitioning to a full Pt3Co phase with excess cobalt remaining on the silica at higher cobalt contents. Despite variations in nanostructures, each catalyst maintained a Pt3Co structure on its surface. The high propylene selectivity of the PtCo catalysts, compared to monometalllic Pt or Co, was attributed to geometric effects, which led to smaller PtPt ensembles and a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals, facilitating better selectivity for dehydrogenation processes. The identification of the surface structure was only possible through the analysis of the difference EXAFS spectrum of the reduced and oxidized catalysts, providing insights into the catalyst's stability and performance optimization for industrial applications.

在直接脱氢过程中，增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的最新策略和方法包括合成由两种活性金属铂(Pt)和钴(Co)组成的双金属催化剂，并针对丙烷脱氢进行了不同钴负载量的合成。研究人员通过原位X射线吸收光谱(XAS)、X射线衍射(XRD)和表面分析等技术，揭示了不同结构和形态的形成，这些与钴负载量有关。在低钴负载时，催化剂形成了具有Pt富集核心的稳定表面合金，在更高钴含量下，催化剂组成为完整的Pt3Co相，多余的钴保留在二氧化硅上。尽管纳米结构存在差异，但每个催化剂均保持了其表面的Pt3Co结构。相对于单金属Pt或Co的高丙烯选择性，PtCo催化剂归因于几何效应，导致较小的PtPt簇和Pt 5d轨道能级降低，从而提高了脱氢过程的选择性。通过分析还原和氧化催化剂的差分EXAFS光谱来识别表面结构，仅此方法便可能提供有关催化剂稳定性和性能优化的见解，为工业应用提供了指导。
