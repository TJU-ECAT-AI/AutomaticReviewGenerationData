[1] "Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc."
[2] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7 etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."
[3] "We successfully identified that In is potentially better than Sn as an alloy component to improve the PDH performance of pure Pt, and our synthesized PtIn catalyst does show enhanced PDH performance just like the PtSn catalyst."
[4] "Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable."
[5] "The addition of In, both geometric and electronic effects are introduced."
[6] "The rate-controlling step turned out to be the first dehydrogenation step on most of the facets."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of alloy components like In (indium) to improve both anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by identifying elements that can optimize the balance between activity and selectivity. The use of probability-based computational screening and reliability analysis helps in predicting the performance of catalysts and locating the optimal catalyst. The geometric role of indium includes separating Pt atoms and covering low-coordinated step Pt atoms, while the electronic effect involves electron transfer from In to Pt, which can be quantified through the d-band center of surface Pt atoms. The adsorption of propylene plays a crucial role in determining the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, and the d-band center correlates with the propylene π adsorption energy, providing a way to seek a more precise PtIn ratio for the PDH reaction in the future.
