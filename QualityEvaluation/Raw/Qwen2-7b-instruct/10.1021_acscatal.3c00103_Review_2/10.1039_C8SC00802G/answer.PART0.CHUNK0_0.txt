<p>Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc.</p>
<p>Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable.</p>
<p>Note that the higher conversion of PtSn and PtIn alloys might due to the increased number of exposed Pt atoms compared with the Pt only catalyst, although the activity of individual sites is lower on the PtSn or PtIn alloy according to DFT calculations.</p>
<p>A tiny loss in catalytic activity and an excellent improvement in selectivity were found when the ratio of PtIn was 3:1.</p>

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of probability-based computational screening, the incorporation of linear scaling relationships to map reaction rates and product selectivity, and the assessment of reliability through the estimation of uncertainties. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing a systematic approach to predict and select catalysts that offer a balance between activity and selectivity. The use of density functional theory (DFT) with Bayesian error estimation functional (BEEF-vdW) allows for a more reliable prediction of catalytic performance, considering the intrinsic errors in functionals. This method also helps in identifying elements that can improve the selectivity and stability of catalysts, such as indium (In) in the case of Pt-based catalysts. The geometric and electronic effects of alloying Pt with other metals, like indium and tin, contribute to enhanced catalytic properties by modifying the surface properties and adsorption energies of reactants. The optimization of catalyst performance is further supported by microkinetic analysis, which elucidates the reaction mechanisms and rate-controlling steps, leading to the identification of the most efficient catalyst compositions for specific reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation. The approach of using probability-based screening and free energy analysis ensures a reliable search for optimal catalysts, balancing the trade-offs between activity and selectivity to achieve the highest propylene formation performance under real reaction conditions.
