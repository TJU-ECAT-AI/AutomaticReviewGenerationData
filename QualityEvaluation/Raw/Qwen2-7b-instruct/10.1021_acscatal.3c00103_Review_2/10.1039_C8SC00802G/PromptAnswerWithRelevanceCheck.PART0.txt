<p>Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>Our calculated Pt3X values (points in Fig. 3) are almost on the fitted curve, indicating that the errors introduced by the scaling relationship are acceptable.</p>
<p>Note that the higher conversion of PtSn and PtIn alloys might due to the increased number of exposed Pt atoms compared with the Pt only catalyst, although the activity of individual sites is lower on the PtSn or PtIn alloy according to DFT calculations.</p>

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of probability-based computational screening, the incorporation of linear scaling relationships to map reaction rates and product selectivity, and the assessment of reliability through the estimation of uncertainties. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing a systematic approach to predict and select catalysts that offer a balance between activity and selectivity. The use of density functional theory (DFT) with Bayesian error estimation functional (BEEF-vdW) allows for a more reliable prediction of catalytic performance, considering the intrinsic errors in functionals. This method also helps in identifying elements that can improve the selectivity and stability of catalysts, such as indium (In) in the case of Pt-based catalysts. The geometric and electronic effects of alloying Pt with other metals, like indium and tin, contribute to enhanced catalytic properties by modifying the surface properties and adsorption energies of reactants. The optimization of catalyst performance is further supported by microkinetic analysis, which elucidates the reaction mechanisms and rate-controlling steps, leading to the identification of the most efficient catalyst compositions for specific reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation. The approach of using probability-based screening and free energy analysis ensures a reliable search for optimal catalysts, balancing the trade-offs between activity and selectivity to achieve the highest propylene formation performance under real reaction conditions.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of alloy components like In (indium) to improve both anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by identifying elements that can optimize the balance between activity and selectivity. The use of probability-based computational screening and reliability analysis helps in predicting the performance of catalysts and locating the optimal catalyst. The geometric role of indium includes separating Pt atoms and covering low-coordinated step Pt atoms, while the electronic effect involves electron transfer from In to Pt, which can be quantified through the d-band center of surface Pt atoms. The adsorption of propylene plays a crucial role in determining the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, and the d-band center correlates with the propylene π adsorption energy, providing a way to seek a more precise PtIn ratio for the PDH reaction in the future.

1. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW). This functional generates a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, enabling the assessment of the reliability of screening results. By integrating this with a scaling relationship, researchers can predict the probability of candidate catalysts outperforming the base material, such as pure platinum (Pt).

2. Challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization are addressed through the combination of reliability analysis with the scaling relationship. This approach allows for the identification of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity. The reliability analysis accounts for the intrinsic errors in functionals, ensuring that the predicted performance is robust.

3. The reliability analysis reveals that the uncertainties in the predicted catalytic performance can be substantial, up to 23 orders of magnitude for the predicted rate constants. This emphasizes the importance of assessing the reliability of computational screening methods.

4. Criteria for identifying optimal catalysts, such as Pt3In, are established based on the differences between propylene desorption free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation step free energy barrier. These criteria allow for the selection of catalysts with better selectivity and acceptable activity.

5. The methodology can be expanded to discover more PDH catalysts by adjusting the propylene desorption free energy barrier, a key factor in determining catalyst performance.

6. The introduction of indium (In) into the catalyst structure introduces both geometric and electronic effects. Geometrically, In atoms separate the Pt atoms, transforming the propylene adsorption mode from strong di-σ to weak π. Electronically, In facilitates electron transfer from itself to Pt, lowering the d-band center and promoting propylene desorption.

7. Low coordinated Pt atoms, often found at step edges, are susceptible to causing further dehydrogenation. In atoms cover these sites, inhibiting unwanted reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst.

8. The role of In in modifying the adsorption and catalytic properties of surface Pt atoms is further elucidated by correlating the propylene π adsorption energy with the d-band center. This correlation suggests that the d-band center can serve as a useful parameter in predicting the catalytic performance of Pt-In catalysts for PDH reactions, guiding the optimization of Pt-In ratios for enhanced selectivity and activity.
