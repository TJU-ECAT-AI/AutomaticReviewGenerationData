[1] "Interestingly, the recently developed Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) will generate a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, which can be used to assess the reliability of our screening results."
[2] "A tiny loss in catalytic activity and an excellent improvement in selectivity were found when the ratio of PtIn was 3:1."
[3] "The addition of In lowers the d-band center of surface Pt and facilitates the desorption of propylene."

1. Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) has been developed to assess the reliability of screening results by generating a large ensemble of variations around the prediction.
2. Alloying Pt with In at a 3:1 ratio resulted in a slight decrease in catalytic activity but significantly improved selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
3. The introduction of In atoms reduces the d-band center of surface Pt, enhancing the desorption of propylene.

1. 最近开发的贝叶斯误差估计功能与范德华相关（BEEF-vdW）被用于通过生成预测周围的大规模变体集来评估筛选结果的可靠性。
2. 合金化Pt与In的比例为3:1时，催化活性略有下降，但丙烷脱氢反应的选择性显著提高。
3. In原子的引入降低了表面Pt的d带中心，促进了丙烯的脱附。
