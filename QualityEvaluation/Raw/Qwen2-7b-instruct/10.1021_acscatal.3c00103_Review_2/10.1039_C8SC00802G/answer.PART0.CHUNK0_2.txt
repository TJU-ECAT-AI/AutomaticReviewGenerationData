1. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW). This functional generates a large ensemble of variations around the prediction, enabling the assessment of the reliability of screening results. By integrating this with a scaling relationship, researchers can predict the probability of candidate catalysts outperforming the base material, such as pure platinum (Pt).

2. Challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization are addressed through the combination of reliability analysis with the scaling relationship. This approach allows for the identification of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity. The reliability analysis accounts for the intrinsic errors in functionals, ensuring that the predicted performance is robust.

3. The reliability analysis reveals that the uncertainties in the predicted catalytic performance can be substantial, up to 23 orders of magnitude for the predicted rate constants. This emphasizes the importance of assessing the reliability of computational screening methods.

4. Criteria for identifying optimal catalysts, such as Pt3In, are established based on the differences between propylene desorption free energy barrier and further dehydrogenation step free energy barrier. These criteria allow for the selection of catalysts with better selectivity and acceptable activity.

5. The methodology can be expanded to discover more PDH catalysts by adjusting the propylene desorption free energy barrier, a key factor in determining catalyst performance.

6. The introduction of indium (In) into the catalyst structure introduces both geometric and electronic effects. Geometrically, In atoms separate the Pt atoms, transforming the propylene adsorption mode from strong di-σ to weak π. Electronically, In facilitates electron transfer from itself to Pt, lowering the d-band center and promoting propylene desorption.

7. Low coordinated Pt atoms, often found at step edges, are susceptible to causing further dehydrogenation. In atoms cover these sites, inhibiting unwanted reactions and improving the stability of the catalyst.

8. The role of In in modifying the adsorption and catalytic properties of surface Pt atoms is further elucidated by correlating the propylene π adsorption energy with the d-band center. This correlation suggests that the d-band center can serve as a useful parameter in predicting the catalytic performance of Pt-In catalysts for PDH reactions, guiding the optimization of Pt-In ratios for enhanced selectivity and activity.

1. 最近在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的进展涉及开发贝叶斯误差估计功能与范德华相互作用相关（BEEF-vdW）。此功能生成围绕预测的大规模变体集，用于评估筛选结果的可靠性。通过将此与缩放关系结合，研究人员可以预测候选催化剂相对于基材（如纯铂）性能的改进概率。

5. 通过调整丙烯脱附自由能壁垒，该方法可以扩展以发现更多PDH催化剂，这是一个决定催化剂性能的关键因素。

6. 在催化剂结构中引入铟（In）引入了几何和电子效应。几何上，In原子分离铂原子，将丙烯吸附模式从强di-σ转变为弱π。电子上，In促进电子从自身转移到铂，降低d带中心并促进丙烯脱附。

7. 低配位的铂原子，通常位于台阶边缘，容易引起进一步脱氢。In覆盖这些位置，抑制不必要的反应并提高催化剂稳定性。

8. 通过将丙烯π吸附能量与d带中心相关联，进一步阐明了In在修改表面铂原子的吸附和催化性质中的作用。这种相关性表明，d带中心可以作为预测铂-铟催化剂PDH反应性能的有用参数，指导Pt-In比例的优化以实现增强的选择性和活性。
