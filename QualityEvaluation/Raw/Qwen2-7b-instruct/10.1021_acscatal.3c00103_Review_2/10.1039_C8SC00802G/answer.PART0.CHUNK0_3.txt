[1] "Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc."
[2] "However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene. The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu,1 Sn,4 Ga,5 In,6 Ge,7 etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."
[3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."
[4] "Our synthesized PtIn catalyst does show enhanced PDH performance just like the PtSn catalyst."
[5] "Previous calculations by Yang et al. suggested that Pt3Sn is an optional candidate that lowers the propylene desorption barrier and simultaneously increases the dehydrogenation transition state barrier, consistent with our screening data in Fig. 1 and 3."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve alloying metals with specific elements to improve stability and selectivity. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications through the following mechanisms:

1. **Enhancing Anti-Coking Ability and Selectivity**: Elements like tin (Sn), indium (In), and germanium (Ge) are alloyed with platinum (Pt) to improve the anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity. These elements modify the geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst surface, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity towards propylene production.

2. **Modifying Electronic Properties**: The addition of elements such as indium modifies the d-band center of surface Pt atoms, reducing the binding strength of propylene and promoting its desorption, thereby increasing propylene selectivity.

3. **Systematic Screening and Probability Analysis**: A probability-based computational screening study is conducted to identify optimal catalyst candidates. This approach evaluates the reliability of DFT calculations, ensuring that the selected catalysts show improved performance over existing materials.

4. **Utilizing Ensembles for Reliability Assessment**: The Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) generates an ensemble of variations around predictions, allowing for the assessment of the reliability of screening results. This helps in identifying catalysts that consistently outperform others across various conditions.

5. **Mechanism Insight and Microkinetic Analysis**: Detailed mechanisms for catalysts like PtIn are explored to confirm the screening outcomes. Microkinetic analysis is constructed to describe the kinetics of the dehydrogenation reaction, revealing the rate-controlling steps and providing insights into the enhancement of propylene formation performance.

6. **Role of Elements in Catalyst Performance**: Elements such as indium play dual roles in catalyst performance, separating Pt atoms and covering low-coordinated step Pt atoms, while also facilitating electron transfer from indium to platinum, which affects the adsorption of propylene.

These strategies collectively aim to optimize catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity, addressing critical challenges in industrial dehydrogenation processes.

在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的最新策略和方法涉及通过与特定元素合金化来提高稳定性并选择性，这些进步解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的工业应用挑战。以下是其机制：

1. **增强抗焦化能力和选择性**：通过与铂（Pt）合金化锡（Sn）、铟（In）和锗（Ge）等元素来提高抗焦化能力和丙烯选择性。这些元素通过改变几何和电子性质改进催化剂表面，从而提高稳定性并增加丙烯生产的选择性。

2. **修改电子性质**：添加元素如铟可以降低表面铂（Pt）原子的d带中心，减少丙烯的结合强度并促进其脱附，从而增加丙烯选择性。

3. **系统筛选和概率分析**：进行基于概率的计算筛选研究以识别最佳催化剂候选者。这种方法评估密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的可靠性，确保所选催化剂在性能上超过现有材料。

4. **利用集合评估可靠性**：通过贝叶斯误差估计功能与范德瓦尔斯相关性（BEEF-vdW）生成预测周围的变化集合，允许评估筛选结果的可靠性。这有助于识别在各种条件下始终优于其他材料的催化剂。

5. **催化剂性能的机制洞察和微观动力学分析**：对催化剂如PtIn进行了详细机制研究，以验证筛选结果。构建微观动力学模型描述脱氢反应的动力学，揭示控制步骤并提供提高丙烯形成性能的见解。

6. **元素在催化剂性能中的作用**：元素如铟在催化剂性能中扮演双重角色，分离铂原子并覆盖低配位边缘铂原子，同时通过铟到铂的电子转移影响丙烯吸附。

这些策略共同旨在优化催化剂性能、稳定性和选择性，解决工业脱氢过程的关键挑战。
