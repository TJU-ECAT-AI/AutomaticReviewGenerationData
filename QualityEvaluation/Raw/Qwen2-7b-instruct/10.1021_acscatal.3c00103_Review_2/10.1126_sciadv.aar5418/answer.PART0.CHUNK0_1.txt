The key strategies and approaches to enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the incorporation of specific metals like platinum, palladium, and rhodium. These metals are optimized for efficient interaction with the dehydrogenation reaction. Additives such as copper or zinc can further improve stability and activity. Nanostructured supports are used to increase surface area and improve metal dispersion. Fabrication techniques like impregnation, co-precipitation, and electrodeposition are employed to achieve optimal metal loading and distribution. Performance is optimized by carefully adjusting operational parameters, including temperature, pressure, and reactant flow rates, to maximize yield while minimizing side reactions.
