[1] "Recent advancements in catalysis research have focused on developing novel strategies to enhance the stability of supported metal catalysts used in direct dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "These strategies include the use of advanced synthesis techniques, such as solvothermal methods, which enable the creation of highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on support materials."
[3] "Another approach involves the incorporation of stabilizing additives, like noble metals or transition metals, which improve the resistance of the catalyst to sintering and poisoning."
[4] "Innovations in support materials, such as carbon-based and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have also contributed to the development of more robust catalysts."
[5] "Performance optimization techniques, including the use of in situ characterization methods and computational modeling, aid in understanding the reaction mechanisms and predicting catalyst behavior under various conditions."
