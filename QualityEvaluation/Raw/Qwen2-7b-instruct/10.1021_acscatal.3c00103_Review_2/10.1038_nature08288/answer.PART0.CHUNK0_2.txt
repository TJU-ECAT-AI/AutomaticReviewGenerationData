[1] "Stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts."
[2] "Zeolitesmicroporous crystalline aluminosilicatesare widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis1,2,3 because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis."
[3] "But except for the exfoliation, none of these strategies has produced ultrathin zeolites with thicknesses below 5nm."
[4] "Of these three types of ultrathin zeolites, nanowires and nanosheets would be preferred in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ease of handling (they are collectable by filtration)."
[5] "In a typical synthesis condition (Methods), the zeolite was obtained as multilamellar stacking of MFI nanosheets that were three-dimensionally intergrown (Fig. 1a)."
[6] "The surfactant content could be decreased to 19wt% (that is, a SiO2/surfactant molar ratio of 37) by extraction with an HCl/ethanol solution."
[7] "The catalytic performance of the MFI nanosheets was investigated using large organic molecules so that diffusion of the reactant molecules constrains the reaction (Methods)26."
[8] "As expected, the catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1)."
[9] "These enhanced catalytic activities can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface (that is, on the external surface of the zeolite layer) of MFI nanosheets, with the unilamellar MFI generally exhibiting higher activities owing to its larger external surface area after calcination."
[10] "Coke deposition within micropores causes more effective catalyst deactivation than external coke formation27,28 because internally deposited coke can cover the catalytically active acid sites and also block micropores already at low coking levels; in contrast, external coke causes relatively little hindrance to diffusion unless it covers the entire external catalyst surface."
[11] "The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications."
[12] "This suggests that the structure-directing strategy that targets the mesoporous and microporous length scales simultaneously is fairly general, and that it can be extended to other zeolite structures and zeotype materials through the design of suitable bifunctional surfactants."
[13] "The next challenge is to synthesize such porous materials in the form of continuous films or membranes for advanced applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation and sensor technologies."

The document discusses recent strategies and approaches aimed at enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. Specifically, it highlights the synthesis of stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts. These nanosheets offer improved performance and stability compared to traditional zeolite structures due to their unique architecture and the presence of numerous acid sites on their external surfaces. The synthesis involves the use of bifunctional surfactants to control the formation of zeolite structures on both mesoporous and microporous length scales, resulting in ultrathin zeolite nanosheets with thicknesses below 5 nm. These ultrathin nanosheets are preferred in heterogeneous catalysis due to their ease of handling. Additionally, the document mentions that the synthesized MFI nanosheets exhibit excellent thermal stability, hydrothermal stability, and strong acidity, which are crucial for various catalytic applications. The research also points to the potential for extending the structure-directing strategy to other zeolite structures and zeotype materials through the design of suitable bifunctional surfactants. The ultimate goal is to develop continuous films or membranes of such porous materials for advanced applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation, and sensor technologies.
