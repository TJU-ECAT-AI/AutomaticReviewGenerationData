[1] "Of these three types of ultrathin zeolites, nanowires and nanosheets would be preferred in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ease of handling (they are collectable by filtration)."
[2] "But except for the exfoliation, none of these strategies has produced ultrathin zeolites with thicknesses below 5nm."
[3] "Only the layer-by-layer exfoliation of a MWW (MCM-22) zeolite crystal7,8,9 yielded zeolites with ultrathin frameworks less than 5nm thick."
[4] "In principle, zeolites will exhibit maximized molecular diffusion if the thickness of the crystal is reduced to the single unit cell dimension."
[5] "Isolated zeolite unit cells (zero-dimensional crystal structure), nanowires (one-dimensional) and nanosheets (two-dimensional) would be obtained when confining the crystal thickness to the dimension of a single unit cell along three, two and one spatial dimensions, respectively."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the synthesis of ultrathin zeolite nanosheets. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on creating materials with dimensions that maximize molecular diffusion, specifically targeting the thickness of the crystal to the single unit cell dimension. This results in the creation of zero-dimensional, one-dimensional (nanowires), and two-dimensional (nanosheets) structures. Among these, nanowires and nanosheets are particularly advantageous due to their ease of handling and collection by filtration. The use of surfactants, such as the C22-6-6 di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant, plays a crucial role in directing the formation of these zeolite structures simultaneously on both mesoporous and microporous scales, leading to the production of ultrathin zeolite nanosheets with thicknesses below 5nm. This synthesis approach not only yields materials with improved catalytic properties but also facilitates diffusion, thereby dramatically suppressing catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during processes like methanol-to-gasoline conversion.

最近开发的用于增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及超薄沸石纳米片的合成。这些进步通过聚焦于将晶体厚度调整到单个单元格尺寸，从而最大化分子扩散，来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，以适应工业应用。这导致了零维、一维（纳米线）和二维（纳米片）结构的创建。在这些中，纳米线和纳米片特别有优势，因为它们易于处理并可通过过滤收集。使用表面活性剂，如C22-6-6双季铵类型表面活性剂，在同时指导微孔和介孔尺度上的沸石结构形成中起着关键作用，导致超薄沸石纳米片的生产，其厚度低于5nm。这种合成方法不仅提供了具有改善催化性能的材料，而且还促进了扩散，从而极大地抑制了催化剂通过焦炭沉积期间的失活，例如甲醇到汽油转换过程。
