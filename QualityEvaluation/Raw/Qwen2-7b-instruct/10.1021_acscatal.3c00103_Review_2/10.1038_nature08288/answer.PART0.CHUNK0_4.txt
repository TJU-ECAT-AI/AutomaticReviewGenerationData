[1] "Stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts Zeolitesmicroporous crystalline aluminosilicatesare widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis1,2,3 because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis."

The document discusses recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. Key strategies include the development of stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts. These nanosheets address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving molecular diffusion through reducing the crystal thickness to the single unit cell dimension. Specifically, ultrathin zeolites, such as nanosheets and nanowires, are preferred for heterogeneous catalysis due to their ease of handling. The synthesis of such ultrathin zeolites, however, is extremely difficult due to Ostwald ripening, a naturally occurring process that minimizes surface free energy and results in crystal growth. To overcome this challenge, a di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant was designed, which functions as an effective structure-directing agent for zeolite formation. The resulting MFI nanosheets have a thickness of 2nm, corresponding to a single unit cell dimension, and are composed of three pentasil sheets along the b-axis. These nanosheets exhibit enhanced catalytic activities due to a large number of acid sites on the external surface, and they show a long catalytic lifetime because of slow coke deposition exclusively at external zeolite surfaces, which prevents coverage of catalytically active acid sites and blocking of micropores.

The synthesis of MFI nanosheets involves using a specific surfactant to form a micellar structure that induces the formation of a mesoscale micellar structure. The surfactant's diammonium head group acts as a structure-directing agent for the MFI zeolite, while the long-chain alkyl tail restricts excessive growth of zeolites. The thickness of the lamellar stacking is usually 20-40nm, and the zeolite layer consists of three pentasil sheets corresponding to a single unit cell along the b-axis. The structure-directing agent surfactant is removed after calcination, leading to partial condensation of the MFI layers, maintaining the mesoporous structure. The calcined samples exhibit a BET area of 520m²/g, significantly higher than conventional MFI zeolite. The catalytic performance of MFI nanosheets is superior to conventional MFI zeolite due to a larger external surface area and more acid sites on the external surface. The enhanced catalytic lifetime of MFI nanosheets is attributed to slow coke deposition at the external surface, which minimizes the hindrance to diffusion and prevents the coverage of catalytically active acid sites.

The document also highlights the importance of considering the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture for controlling crystal growth in the ac plane and layer stacking along the b-axis, leading to the production of both multilamellar and unilamellar MFI zeolite forms. The unilamellar MFI zeolite generally exhibits higher catalytic activities after calcination due to its larger external surface area. Furthermore, the enhanced thermal stability, hydrothermal stability, and strong acidity of MFI nanosheets make them suitable for various catalytic applications. The retention of tetrahedral Al in the zeolite framework after heat treatment at 700°C demonstrates the material's excellent thermal stability. The structure-directing strategy used in the synthesis of MFI nanosheets can potentially be extended to other zeolite structures and zeotype materials through the design of suitable bifunctional surfactants, suggesting broader applicability beyond zeolite MFI.

In summary, the document outlines the development of ultrathin zeolite nanosheets with enhanced catalytic stability through strategic design, synthesis, and characterization. The nanosheets exhibit improved molecular diffusion, longer lifetime, and superior catalytic performance, particularly in direct dehydrogenation processes, by optimizing the zeolite structure and controlling the surface chemistry to minimize coke formation and preserve active sites.

文档讨论了在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂稳定性的近期进展。关键策略包括开发单个单元格尺寸稳定的MFI沸石纳米片作为活性和持久催化剂。这些纳米片通过将晶体厚度减小到单个单元格尺寸来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，从而改善分子扩散。特别是，超薄沸石，如纳米片和纳米线，由于其易于处理（可通过过滤收集）而被优选用于异质催化。然而，合成这样的超薄沸石极其困难，因为奥斯特瓦尔德成核是一种自然发生的、自发过程，它减少了晶体表面自由能，导致小晶体溶解和大晶体进一步生长。

为了克服这一挑战，设计了一种二季铵型表面活性剂，即C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H13（命名为C22-6-6），用作结构导向剂。该表面活性剂由长链烷基团和两个季铵基团组成，由一个C6烷基连接。其双季铵头部充当MFI沸石的有效结构导向剂，而长链尾部诱导形成微米尺度的微球结构。使用这种表面活性剂，形成了厚度为2nm的超薄框架，对应于沿b轴的一个单个单元格尺寸。每个沸石层具有高结构相关性，在ac平面方向上略有偏差。仅h0l反射足够锐利，可在粉末X射线衍射图中进行索引，证实了层状结构的大共域特征，ac平面宽度大，而b轴框架厚度极小。元素分析显示表面活性剂含量约为制备产品的45%。通过提取HCl/乙醇溶液，表面活性剂含量可减少至19%，这意味着SiO2与表面活性剂的摩尔比为37。非可提取部分被认为是在表面活性剂作为结构导向剂作用后保留在沸石微孔中的量。可提取的部分归因于位于微球中的表面活性剂分子作为填充物。基于元素分析和上述透射电子显微镜调查，提出材料由沿直通道排列的MFI层组成，表面活性剂分子沿着MFI框架的直孔排列。

MFI纳米片的厚度通常为20-40nm，层状堆叠由三个五硅片组成，对应于沿b轴的单个单元格尺寸的厚度1.9738nm。透射电子显微镜和电子衍射在宽平面上（MFI的[010]入射）揭示了层状结构。在煅烧样品的透射电子显微镜图像中，可以看到部分凝结，但主要的介孔结构仍然保持完整。煅烧样品的氮吸附-解吸等温线也证实了高度介孔结构的存在，BET表面积为520m²/g，高于常规MFI沸石的420m²/g。保留的介孔结构可以解释为：首先，存在大量晶间生长，这些晶体可以作为支撑彼此的支柱，防止介孔结构的完全塌陷。其次，ac平面方向上存在轻微的晶体取向偏差，这使得每个MFI层上的硅醇基位置不同，防止了MFI层的完全凝结。

此外，MFI纳米片还可以通过降低合成混合物中的钠离子浓度合成单层纳米片。透射电子显微镜图像显示，材料由沿b轴没有长程堆叠的单一MFI层组成，其ac平面宽度非常窄；因此，可以将其视为由与多层形式相同的构建块组成，但没有沿b轴的长程堆叠。多层和单层MFI沸石的不同形式表明，通过控制合成混合物中的钠离子浓度，可以显著影响ac平面的晶体生长和b轴上的层堆叠，从而产生不同形式的MFI沸石。单层MFI沸石在煅烧后一般表现出更高的催化活性，这是由于其较大的外表面面积。

MFI纳米片的增强催化稳定性归因于缓慢的外部焦炭沉积，这最小化了对扩散的阻碍并防止了催化活性酸位的覆盖。在甲醇到汽油转化过程中，MFI纳米片的催化寿命远低于常规MFI沸石。原因在于外部焦炭沉积，其在低焦炭沉积水平下可以覆盖微孔并阻塞微孔，而内部焦炭沉积则更有效地导致催化剂失活，因为它可以覆盖催化活性酸位，并且即使在低焦炭沉积水平下也可以堵塞微孔。

文档还强调了MFI纳米片的热稳定性、水热稳定性和强酸性的关键作用，使其适用于各种催化应用。在700°C的热处理后，保留了约50%的初始四面体Al，证明了材料的出色热稳定性。在初步实验中，通过采用现合成策略创建了MTW沸石纳米片，这表明同时针对微孔和介孔长度尺度的目标结构定向策略相当通用，并且可以通过设计合适的双功能表面活性剂将其扩展到其他沸石结构和zeotype材料。

综上所述，文档概述了通过战略设计、合成和表征开发超薄沸石纳米片以提高催化稳定性。这些纳米片通过优化晶体质地和表面化学特性，展现出改进的分子扩散、更长的寿命以及在直接脱氢过程中更优的催化性能。
