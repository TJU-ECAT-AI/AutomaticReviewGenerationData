The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the creation of stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI. This type of zeolite is particularly useful due to its active and long-lived nature in petrochemical and fine-chemical synthesis applications. The improvement in catalytic stability is achieved by reducing the thickness of the zeolite crystals, which in turn decreases diffusion path lengths and enhances molecular diffusion within the material. Nanosheets and nanowires are considered advantageous over isolated zeolite unit cells and nanowires due to their ease of handling, as they can be collected by filtration. Despite the conceptual simplicity of synthesizing ultrathin zeolites, actual synthesis remains a significant challenge due to the naturally occurring Ostwald ripening process that minimizes surface free energy and promotes crystal growth. To overcome this, researchers have employed the use of bifunctional surfactants, such as the di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant C22-6-6, to direct the formation of zeolite structures across multiple length scales simultaneously. This approach enables the synthesis of MFI zeolite nanosheets with a thickness of only 2nm, corresponding to a single unit cell dimension. These nanosheets exhibit high activity for catalytic conversion of large organic molecules and improved diffusion, which significantly reduces catalyst deactivation through coke deposition. The synthesis method allows for the adjustment of the nanosheet structure from multilamellar to unilamellar forms, depending on the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture. The enhanced catalytic performance and lifetime of MFI nanosheets are attributed to the large number of acid sites located on the external surface of the zeolite layer, as well as the slow deposition of coke primarily at the external surface, which facilitates mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores. The synthesis of such porous materials in the form of continuous films or membranes represents the next challenge for advanced applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation, and sensor technologies.

近期在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及制备稳定的单单元细胞纳米片状的沸石MFI。这种沸石特别适用于石油化学和精细化学品合成应用，其活性和长期稳定性得到提高。通过减小沸石晶体的厚度来改善催化剂稳定性，从而降低扩散路径长度并增强材料内的分子扩散。纳米片和纳米线相较于孤立的沸石单元细胞和纳米线具有优势，因为它们易于收集（可通过过滤）。尽管超薄沸石的概念设计简单，但实际合成仍然是一个巨大的挑战，这是因为自然发生的奥斯特瓦尔德成熟过程会减少表面自由能并促进晶体生长。为克服这一问题，研究人员采用了双功能表面活性剂，如二季铵型表面活性剂C22-6-6，以定向方式形成跨越多个长度尺度的沸石结构。这种方法允许同时合成厚度仅为2nm的MFI沸石纳米片，相当于沿b轴单个单元格尺寸。这些纳米片表现出对大型有机分子催化转化的高活性以及改进的扩散性，这显著减少了通过焦炭沉积导致的催化剂失活。合成方法允许从多层到单层形式调整纳米片结构，取决于合成混合物中Na+的浓度。MFI纳米片的增强催化性能和寿命归因于位于沸石层外部表面的大量酸位点，以及主要在外表面缓慢沉积焦炭，这促进了焦炭前体物质从沸石微孔的扩散。连续薄膜或膜形式合成此类多孔材料代表了先进催化、吸附、分离和传感器技术应用的下一个挑战。

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the synthesis of ultrathin zeolite nanosheets. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on creating materials with dimensions that maximize molecular diffusion, specifically targeting the thickness of the crystal to the single unit cell dimension. This results in the creation of zero-dimensional, one-dimensional (nanowires), and two-dimensional (nanosheets) structures. Among these, nanowires and nanosheets are particularly advantageous due to their ease of handling and collection by filtration. The use of surfactants, such as the C22-6-6 di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant, plays a crucial role in directing the formation of these zeolite structures simultaneously on both mesoporous and microporous scales, leading to the production of ultrathin zeolite nanosheets with thicknesses below 5nm. This synthesis approach not only yields materials with improved catalytic properties but also facilitates diffusion, thereby dramatically suppressing catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during processes like methanol-to-gasoline conversion.

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve several strategies. These strategies primarily focus on optimizing catalyst design, fabrication, and performance through the synthesis of ultrathin zeolites, particularly nanosheets, which offer improved diffusion properties and surface area. By reducing the crystal thickness to the single unit cell dimension, researchers aim to maximize molecular diffusion and catalytic activity. This approach addresses the challenges associated with diffusion limitations and catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition, especially in petrochemical processes. A key strategy involves utilizing specialized surfactants, such as the di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant C22-6-6, to direct the formation of MFI zeolite nanosheets. These nanosheets possess a high number of active acid sites on their external surface, which enhances their catalytic efficiency for the conversion of large organic molecules. Furthermore, the synthesis method is anticipated to be applicable to other zeolites, improving their performance across various catalytic applications.

The document discusses recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. Key strategies include the development of stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI as active and long-lived catalysts. These nanosheets address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving molecular diffusion through reducing the crystal thickness to the single unit cell dimension. Specifically, ultrathin zeolites, such as nanosheets and nanowires, are preferred for heterogeneous catalysis due to their ease of handling. The synthesis of such ultrathin zeolites, however, is extremely difficult due to Ostwald ripening, a naturally occurring process that minimizes surface free energy and results in crystal growth. To overcome this challenge, a di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant was designed, which functions as an effective structure-directing agent for zeolite formation. The resulting MFI nanosheets have a thickness of 2nm, corresponding to a single unit cell dimension, and are composed of three pentasil sheets along the b-axis. These nanosheets exhibit enhanced catalytic activities due to a large number of acid sites on the external surface, and they show a long catalytic lifetime because of slow coke deposition exclusively at external zeolite surfaces, which prevents coverage of catalytically active acid sites and blocking of micropores.

The synthesis of MFI nanosheets involves using a specific surfactant to form a micellar structure that induces the formation of a mesoscale micellar structure. The surfactant's diammonium head group acts as a structure-directing agent for the MFI zeolite, while the long-chain alkyl tail restricts excessive growth of zeolites. The thickness of the lamellar stacking is usually 20-40nm, and the zeolite layer consists of three pentasil sheets corresponding to a single unit cell along the b-axis. The structure-directing agent surfactant is removed after calcination, leading to partial condensation of the MFI layers, maintaining the mesoporous structure. The calcined samples exhibit a BET area of 520m²/g, significantly higher than conventional MFI zeolite. The catalytic performance of MFI nanosheets is superior to conventional MFI zeolite due to a larger external surface area and more acid sites on the external surface. The enhanced catalytic lifetime of MFI nanosheets is attributed to slow coke deposition at the external surface, which minimizes the hindrance to diffusion and prevents the coverage of catalytically active acid sites.

The document also highlights the importance of considering the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture for controlling crystal growth in the ac plane and layer stacking along the b-axis, leading to the production of both multilamellar and unilamellar MFI zeolite forms. The unilamellar MFI zeolite generally exhibits higher catalytic activities after calcination due to its larger external surface area. Furthermore, the enhanced thermal stability, hydrothermal stability, and strong acidity of MFI nanosheets make them suitable for various catalytic applications. The retention of tetrahedral Al in the zeolite framework after heat treatment at 700°C demonstrates the material's excellent thermal stability. The structure-directing strategy used in the synthesis of MFI nanosheets can potentially be extended to other zeolite structures and zeotype materials through the design of suitable bifunctional surfactants, suggesting broader applicability beyond zeolite MFI.

In summary, the document outlines the development of ultrathin zeolite nanosheets with enhanced catalytic stability through strategic design, synthesis, and characterization. The nanosheets exhibit improved molecular diffusion, longer lifetime, and superior catalytic performance, particularly in direct dehydrogenation processes, by optimizing the zeolite structure and controlling the surface chemistry to minimize coke formation and preserve active sites.

文档讨论了在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂稳定性的近期进展。关键策略包括开发单个单元格尺寸稳定的MFI沸石纳米片作为活性和持久催化剂。这些纳米片通过将晶体厚度减小到单个单元格尺寸来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，从而改善分子扩散。特别是，超薄沸石，如纳米片和纳米线，由于其易于处理（可通过过滤收集）而被优选用于异质催化。然而，合成这样的超薄沸石极其困难，因为奥斯特瓦尔德成核是一种自然发生的、自发过程，它减少了晶体表面自由能，导致小晶体溶解和大晶体进一步生长。

为了克服这一挑战，设计了一种二季铵型表面活性剂，即C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H13（命名为C22-6-6），用作结构导向剂。该表面活性剂由长链烷基团和两个季铵基团组成，由一个C6烷基连接。其双季铵头部充当MFI沸石的有效结构导向剂，而长链尾部诱导形成微米尺度的微球结构。使用这种表面活性剂，形成了厚度为2nm的超薄框架，对应于沿b轴的一个单个单元格尺寸。每个沸石层具有高结构相关性，在ac平面方向上略有偏差。仅h0l反射足够锐利，可在粉末X射线衍射图中进行索引，证实了层状结构的大共域特征，ac平面宽度大，而b轴框架厚度极小。元素分析显示表面活性剂含量约为制备产品的45%。通过提取HCl/乙醇溶液，表面活性剂含量可减少至19%，这意味着SiO2与表面活性剂的摩尔比为37。非可提取部分被认为是在表面活性剂作为结构导向剂作用后保留在沸石微孔中的量。可提取的部分归因于位于微球中的表面活性剂分子作为填充物。基于元素分析和上述透射电子显微镜调查，提出材料由沿直通道排列的MFI层组成，表面活性剂分子沿着MFI框架的直孔排列。

MFI纳米片的厚度通常为20-40nm，层状堆叠由三个五硅片组成，对应于沿b轴的单个单元格尺寸的厚度1.9738nm。透射电子显微镜和电子衍射在宽平面上（MFI的[010]入射）揭示了层状结构。在煅烧样品的透射电子显微镜图像中，可以看到部分凝结，但主要的介孔结构仍然保持完整。煅烧样品的氮吸附-解吸等温线也证实了高度介孔结构的存在，BET表面积为520m²/g，高于常规MFI沸石的420m²/g。保留的介孔结构可以解释为：首先，存在大量晶间生长，这些晶体可以作为支撑彼此的支柱，防止介孔结构的完全塌陷。其次，ac平面方向上存在轻微的晶体取向偏差，这使得每个MFI层上的硅醇基位置不同，防止了MFI层的完全凝结。

此外，MFI纳米片还可以通过降低合成混合物中的钠离子浓度合成单层纳米片。透射电子显微镜图像显示，材料由沿b轴没有长程堆叠的单一MFI层组成，其ac平面宽度非常窄；因此，可以将其视为由与多层形式相同的构建块组成，但没有沿b轴的长程堆叠。多层和单层MFI沸石的不同形式表明，通过控制合成混合物中的钠离子浓度，可以显著影响ac平面的晶体生长和b轴上的层堆叠，从而产生不同形式的MFI沸石。单层MFI沸石在煅烧后一般表现出更高的催化活性，这是由于其较大的外表面面积。

MFI纳米片的增强催化稳定性归因于缓慢的外部焦炭沉积，这最小化了对扩散的阻碍并防止了催化活性酸位的覆盖。在甲醇到汽油转化过程中，MFI纳米片的催化寿命远低于常规MFI沸石。原因在于外部焦炭沉积，其在低焦炭沉积水平下可以覆盖微孔并阻塞微孔，而内部焦炭沉积则更有效地导致催化剂失活，因为它可以覆盖催化活性酸位，并且即使在低焦炭沉积水平下也可以堵塞微孔。

文档还强调了MFI纳米片的热稳定性、水热稳定性和强酸性的关键作用，使其适用于各种催化应用。在700°C的热处理后，保留了约50%的初始四面体Al，证明了材料的出色热稳定性。在初步实验中，通过采用现合成策略创建了MTW沸石纳米片，这表明同时针对微孔和介孔长度尺度的目标结构定向策略相当通用，并且可以通过设计合适的双功能表面活性剂将其扩展到其他沸石结构和zeotype材料。

综上所述，文档概述了通过战略设计、合成和表征开发超薄沸石纳米片以提高催化稳定性。这些纳米片通过优化晶体质地和表面化学特性，展现出改进的分子扩散、更长的寿命以及在直接脱氢过程中更优的催化性能。
