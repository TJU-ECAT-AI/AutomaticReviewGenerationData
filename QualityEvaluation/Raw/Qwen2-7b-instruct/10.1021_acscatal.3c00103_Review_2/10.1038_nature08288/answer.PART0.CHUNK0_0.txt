The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the creation of stable single-unit-cell nanosheets of zeolite MFI. This type of zeolite is particularly useful due to its active and long-lived nature in petrochemical and fine-chemical synthesis applications. The improvement in catalytic stability is achieved by reducing the thickness of the zeolite crystals, which in turn decreases diffusion path lengths and enhances molecular diffusion within the material. Nanosheets and nanowires are considered advantageous over isolated zeolite unit cells and nanowires due to their ease of handling, as they can be collected by filtration. Despite the conceptual simplicity of synthesizing ultrathin zeolites, actual synthesis remains a significant challenge due to the naturally occurring Ostwald ripening process that minimizes surface free energy and promotes crystal growth. To overcome this, researchers have employed the use of bifunctional surfactants, such as the di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant C22-6-6, to direct the formation of zeolite structures across multiple length scales simultaneously. This approach enables the synthesis of MFI zeolite nanosheets with a thickness of only 2nm, corresponding to a single unit cell dimension. These nanosheets exhibit high activity for catalytic conversion of large organic molecules and improved diffusion, which significantly reduces catalyst deactivation through coke deposition. The synthesis method allows for the adjustment of the nanosheet structure from multilamellar to unilamellar forms, depending on the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture. The enhanced catalytic performance and lifetime of MFI nanosheets are attributed to the large number of acid sites located on the external surface of the zeolite layer, as well as the slow deposition of coke primarily at the external surface, which facilitates mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores. The synthesis of such porous materials in the form of continuous films or membranes represents the next challenge for advanced applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation, and sensor technologies.

近期在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及制备稳定的单单元细胞纳米片状的沸石MFI。这种沸石特别适用于石油化学和精细化学品合成应用，其活性和长期稳定性得到提高。通过减小沸石晶体的厚度来改善催化剂稳定性，从而降低扩散路径长度并增强材料内的分子扩散。纳米片和纳米线相较于孤立的沸石单元细胞和纳米线具有优势，因为它们易于收集（可通过过滤）。尽管超薄沸石的概念设计简单，但实际合成仍然是一个巨大的挑战，这是因为自然发生的奥斯特瓦尔德成熟过程会减少表面自由能并促进晶体生长。为克服这一问题，研究人员采用了双功能表面活性剂，如二季铵型表面活性剂C22-6-6，以定向方式形成跨越多个长度尺度的沸石结构。这种方法允许同时合成厚度仅为2nm的MFI沸石纳米片，相当于沿b轴单个单元格尺寸。这些纳米片表现出对大型有机分子催化转化的高活性以及改进的扩散性，这显著减少了通过焦炭沉积导致的催化剂失活。合成方法允许从多层到单层形式调整纳米片结构，取决于合成混合物中Na+的浓度。MFI纳米片的增强催化性能和寿命归因于位于沸石层外部表面的大量酸位点，以及主要在外表面缓慢沉积焦炭，这促进了焦炭前体物质从沸石微孔的扩散。连续薄膜或膜形式合成此类多孔材料代表了先进催化、吸附、分离和传感器技术应用的下一个挑战。
