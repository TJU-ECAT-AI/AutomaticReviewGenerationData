[1] "Zeolitesmicroporous crystalline aluminosilicatesare widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis1,2,3 because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis."
[2] "But the very presence of the micropores, with aperture diameters below 1nm, often goes hand-in-hand with diffusion limitations3,4,5 that adversely affect catalytic activity."
[3] "The problem can be overcome by reducing the thickness of the zeolite crystals, which reduces diffusion path lengths and thus improves molecular diffusion4,5."
[4] "Of these three types of ultrathin zeolites, nanowires and nanosheets would be preferred in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ease of handling (they are collectable by filtration)."
[5] "Although such ultrathin zeolites are easy to imagine, their actual synthesis is extremely difficult."
[6] "We approached the synthesis of MFI nanosheets by designing a di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant, C22H45-N+(CH3)2-C6H12-N+(CH3)2-C6H13 (designated C22-6-6 hereafter)."
[7] "The large number of acid sites on the external surface of these zeolites renders them highly active for the catalytic conversion of large organic molecules, and the reduced crystal thickness facilitates diffusion and thereby dramatically suppresses catalyst deactivation through coke deposition during methanol-to-gasoline conversion."
[8] "We expect that our synthesis approach could be applied to other zeolites to improve their performance in a range of important catalytic applications."
[9] "In principle, zeolites will exhibit maximized molecular diffusion if the thickness of the crystal is reduced to the single unit cell dimension."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve several strategies. These strategies primarily focus on optimizing catalyst design, fabrication, and performance through the synthesis of ultrathin zeolites, particularly nanosheets, which offer improved diffusion properties and surface area. By reducing the crystal thickness to the single unit cell dimension, researchers aim to maximize molecular diffusion and catalytic activity. This approach addresses the challenges associated with diffusion limitations and catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition, especially in petrochemical processes. A key strategy involves utilizing specialized surfactants, such as the di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant C22-6-6, to direct the formation of MFI zeolite nanosheets. These nanosheets possess a high number of active acid sites on their external surface, which enhances their catalytic efficiency for the conversion of large organic molecules. Furthermore, the synthesis method is anticipated to be applicable to other zeolites, improving their performance across various catalytic applications. The concept of maximizing molecular diffusion by reducing the crystal thickness to the single unit cell dimension is fundamental to these advancements.
