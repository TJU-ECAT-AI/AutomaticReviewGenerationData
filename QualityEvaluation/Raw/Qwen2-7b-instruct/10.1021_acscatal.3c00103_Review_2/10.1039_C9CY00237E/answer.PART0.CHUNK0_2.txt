[1] "Recently, some transition metals such as Zr, Co, V and Zn have been used as independent PDH catalysts rather than promoters of Pt catalysts, having drawn tremendous attention."
[2] "Considering the catalytic capacity of Lewis acidic Zn species, Gong's group employed ZnO supported on Al2O3 upon the addition of a trace amount of Pt as the catalyst in the PDH reaction."
[3] "This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts."

These strategies involve the utilization of transition metals like Zr, Co, V, and Zn as independent direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) catalysts, rather than merely as promoters for platinum catalysts. This approach has gained significant interest. Furthermore, the inclusion of a trace amount of Pt along with ZnO supported on Al2O3 has proven effective in enhancing PDH reactions. A notable advancement is the development of a catalyst that contains significantly more Zn and less Pt compared to traditional PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This breakthrough challenges conventional wisdom and broadens the scope for designing stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

这些策略包括利用如Zr、Co、V和Zn这样的过渡金属作为独立的丙烷直接脱氢为丙烯（PDH）催化剂，而不是仅仅作为铂催化剂的促进剂，这引起了极大的关注。此外，将少量Pt与ZnO支持在Al2O3上一起使用已被证明对PDH反应有效。一个显著的进步是开发了一种催化剂，其Zn的含量远多于Pt，与传统的PtZn基脱氢催化剂相比，Pt的含量要少得多。这一突破挑战了传统观点，并为设计稳定脱氢催化剂开辟了广阔的道路。
