[1] "Due to a shifted focus towards higher ethylene selectivity in steam crackers and the increasing demand for propylene, the gap between conventional propylene supply and market demand is expected to grow."
[2] "The primary industrial catalysts for PDH are CrOx and Pt based catalysts, but the former is noxious and the latter is expensive. Moreover, both of them are easily deactivated, requiring frequent regeneration."
[3] "In recent years, some transition metals such as Zr, Co, V and Zn have been used as independent PDH catalysts rather than promoters of Pt catalysts, having drawn tremendous attention."
[4] "Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory catalytic performance and fast deactivation of Zn catalyst hamper its further development in the PDH reaction."
[5] "It has been demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts with small particle size are more active than the bulk ones in PDH,20,21 and the preparation of bimetallic PtZn catalysts by using various promoters (e.g., Sn, Zr, In, Zn, etc.) is an efficient strategy to disperse and prevent the sintering of small-sized Pt species."
[6] "Considering the catalytic capacity of Lewis acidic Zn species, Gong's group employed ZnO supported on Al2O3 upon the addition of a trace amount of Pt as the catalyst in the PDH reaction."
[7] "This report broke the traditional notion that metallic Pt was the active site and Zn was just a promoting element in PtZn dehydrogenation catalysts."
[8] "The activity results exhibited that the catalytic activity and reaction stability were varied within the ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios."
[9] "The catalyst consisting of 1000 ppm platinum, 10 wt% zinc and a high-silica HZSM-5 support showed much better catalytic performance at 525 C than the sole Zn/HZ and Pt/HZ as well as 10ZnyPt/HZ catalysts with other Zn/Pt ratios."
[10] "Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metal-acid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst."

1. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on transitioning from conventional CrOx and Pt-based catalysts to utilizing transition metals like Zr, Co, V, and Zn independently or in bimetallic combinations. This addresses the challenges of toxicity, cost, and deactivation by improving selectivity, stability, and efficiency.

2. To overcome the limitations of Zn catalysts, researchers have explored the use of Pt-based catalysts with small particle sizes, which exhibit higher activity than bulk catalysts. The preparation of bimetallic PtZn catalysts through various promoters has proven to be an effective strategy to disperse and prevent sintering of small-sized Pt species, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

3. Gong's group introduced a novel approach by employing ZnO supported on Al2O3 in conjunction with a trace amount of Pt as the catalyst in PDH reactions, challenging the traditional belief that Pt was the active site and Zn merely a promoter. This demonstrates the potential of Lewis acidic Zn species in catalysis, providing a new avenue for designing stable dehydrogenation catalysts.

4. The study highlights the importance of achieving a balance between metal and acid functionalities in catalyst design. The ZnPt/HZ catalyst with a specific Zn/Pt ratio (1000 ppm Pt, 10 wt% Zn) exhibited superior catalytic performance at 525°C compared to single-metal catalysts and catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios, showcasing the effectiveness of combining Pt and Zn in a synergistic manner for enhanced activity and stability in PDH reactions.

1. 近年来，通过独立使用或组合使用如Zr、Co、V和Zn等过渡金属作为PDH催化剂，而非仅作为Pt催化剂的促进剂，已经发展了一系列增强催化稳定性的支持金属催化剂方法。这些改进旨在解决传统CrOx和Pt基催化剂的毒性、成本高以及容易失活的问题，提高选择性和稳定性。

2. 针对Zn催化剂的不足，研究者探索了使用具有较小颗粒尺寸的Pt基催化剂，并发现小颗粒尺寸的Pt催化剂比常规催化剂更活跃。通过各种促进剂（如Sn、Zr、In、Zn等）制备的双金属PtZn催化剂，有效地分散并防止了小尺寸Pt物种的聚集，提高了催化剂的性能。

3. Gong的研究小组通过在Al2O3上负载ZnO并添加少量Pt作为PDH反应催化剂，挑战了传统观点，即Pt是活性位点而Zn仅作为促进剂。这表明Lewis酸性Zn物种在催化中的潜力，为设计稳定脱氢催化剂开辟了新途径。

4. 研究强调了催化剂设计中金属和酸功能之间平衡的重要性。含有特定Zn/Pt比例（1000 ppm Pt，10 wt% Zn）的ZnPt/HZ催化剂在525°C下表现出优于单一金属催化剂和不同Zn/Pt比例催化剂的优异催化性能，展示了结合Pt和Zn在PDH反应中协同作用以增强活性和稳定性的有效性。
