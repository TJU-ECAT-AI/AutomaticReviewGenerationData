[1] "In recent years, some transition metals such as Zr, Co, V and Zn have been used as independent PDH catalysts rather than promoters of Pt catalysts, having drawn tremendous attention."
[2] "Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory catalytic performance and fast deactivation of Zn catalyst hamper its further development in the PDH reaction."
[3] "Considering the catalytic capacity of Lewis acidic Zn species, Gong's group employed ZnO supported on Al2O3 upon the addition of a trace amount of Pt as the catalyst in the PDH reaction."
[4] "This report broke the traditional notion that metallic Pt was the active site and Zn was just a promoting element in PtZn dehydrogenation catalysts."
[5] "In this work, we prepared ZnPt catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite (HZ) via a co-impregnation method and tested their catalytic activity for the PDH reaction under different conditions."
[6] "Meanwhile, the interaction between Pt and Zn brought about the high thermal stability and strong carbon deposition resistance, thus causing commendable reaction stability in the PDH reaction."
[7] "The activity test results revealed that both high temperature and high Pt loading are detrimental for long-term stability, and the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst shows remarkable catalytic activity (around 46% propylene yield) and long-term stability over 65 h at 525 C with a WHSV of 0.24 h1."
[8] "The small-sized PtZn particles (alloy or mixed oxides) and high level of framework Zn species are obtained on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, and the interaction effect between them makes contributions to the high catalytic activity of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst at 525 C."
[9] "As a result, the supported Zn and a trace amount of Pt work corporately and result in high catalytic activity and great stability at 525 C, and this sheds a bright light on the design of other hyperstable dehydrogenation catalysts."
