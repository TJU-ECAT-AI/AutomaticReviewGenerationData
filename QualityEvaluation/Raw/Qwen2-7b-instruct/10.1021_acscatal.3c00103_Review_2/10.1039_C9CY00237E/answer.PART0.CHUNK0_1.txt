[1] "In recent years, some transition metals such as Zr, Co, V and Zn have been used as independent PDH catalysts rather than promoters of Pt catalysts, having drawn tremendous attention."
[2] "Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory catalytic performance and fast deactivation of Zn catalyst hamper its further development in the PDH reaction."
[3] "Considering the catalytic capacity of Lewis acidic Zn species, Gong's group employed ZnO supported on Al2O3 upon the addition of a trace amount of Pt as the catalyst in the PDH reaction."
[4] "Given the above, we further obtain that the catalytic activity of both Pt and Lewis acidic Zn species in the ZnPt combination system should be taken into consideration in the PDH reaction."
[5] "It is noteworthy that the high catalytic activity was reached at a low reaction temperature of 525 C."
[6] "Meanwhile, the interaction between Pt and Zn brought about the high thermal stability and strong carbon deposition resistance, thus causing commendable reaction stability in the PDH reaction."
[7] "The catalyst system is of great potential to be applied in propylene production, which can reduce cost due to the elimination of regeneration apparatus and reduced Pt usage."
[8] "Additionally, it provides vital guidance for the design of stable catalysts in other heterogeneous reactions."
