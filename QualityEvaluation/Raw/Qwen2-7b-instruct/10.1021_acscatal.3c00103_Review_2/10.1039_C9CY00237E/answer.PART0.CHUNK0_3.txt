[1] "The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the incorporation of multiple metal species, the use of complex supports, and the optimization of metal loading. These advancements aim to address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications."
[2] "The optimal catalyst for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was found to contain 1000 ppm platinum and 10 wt% zinc, supported on a high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite. This catalyst showed a high propylene yield of about 46% and exceptional dehydrogenation stability over 65 hours at 525°C without any regeneration procedure or hydrogen as auxiliary gas."
