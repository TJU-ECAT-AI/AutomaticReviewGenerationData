[1] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[2] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
[3] "The nature of active Co phases in CoSiBeta catalysts... The cobalt species are mainly present in the forms of confined CoOx for a low Co loading and bulk Co3O4 for a high Co loading in CoSiBeta catalysts."
[4] "Combined with activity test results, the large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta."

1. The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve preparing CoOx confined in the SiBeta zeolite by connecting with silanols. This method addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by achieving great propane conversion and extremely high propylene selectivity over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst, which matches the performance of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts. 

2. The cobalt species are predominantly in the form of CoOx confined in the T-sites of the SiBeta zeolite support. This confinement allows for easy reduction to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which contributes to the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment.

3. The nature of active Co phases in CoSiBeta catalysts varies with the Co loading. Confined CoOx is present for a low Co loading, while bulk Co3O4 is found for a high Co loading. These different forms of cobalt species have distinct impacts on catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. The presence of large Co3O4 particles on the surface of the 10CoSiBeta catalyst leads to serious side reactions, causing a very low initial propylene selectivity. Prereduction treatment reduces these Co3O4 particles to bulk Co0 particles, which are mostly inactive for the PDH reaction and result in carbon deposition.

1. 最近发展起来增强直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括在SiBeta沸石中制备连接于硅烷醇的CoOx。这种方法通过实现0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的显著催化活性和极高丙烯选择性，以及与商业Pt和CrOx催化剂相当的性能，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。

2. 钴物种主要以位于SiBeta沸石基质T位点的CoOx形式存在。这种限制允许在反应过程中容易还原为金属钴颗粒，这有助于具有或不具有预还原处理的CoSiBeta催化剂表现出相似的催化性能。

3. CoSiBeta催化剂中活性钴相的性质随钴负载变化。对于低钴负载，存在封闭的CoOx；而对于高钴负载，则存在大量的Co3O4。这些不同形式的钴物种对催化活性和选择性有不同的影响。

4. 表面存在的大量Co3O4颗粒导致了10CoSiBeta催化剂严重的副反应，造成非常低的初始丙烯选择性。预还原处理将这些Co3O4颗粒还原为无定形的Co0颗粒，这些颗粒在PDH反应中基本不活跃，并导致碳沉积。
