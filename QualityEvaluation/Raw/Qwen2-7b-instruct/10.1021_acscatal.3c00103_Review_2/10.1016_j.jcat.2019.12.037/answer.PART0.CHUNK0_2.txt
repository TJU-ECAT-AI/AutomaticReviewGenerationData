[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[3] "To further figure out the correlation of catalyst activity and structure, the characterizations and catalytic performance of the CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were compared."
[4] "Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts."

1. The recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of metal species confined in zeolite supports, particularly in Beta zeolite. These advancements aim to create ultrasmall-sized metal particles that are highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation reactions, addressing challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. 

2. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrates significant catalytic activity with exceptionally high propylene selectivity. The induction period is notably shortened after a reduction treatment, suggesting that the confined CoOx species can be converted to metallic Co particles, enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. Researchers have compared the characterization and catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with varying cobalt loadings to understand the correlation between catalyst activity and structure. This approach helps in optimizing catalyst composition and structure for enhanced performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The similarity in catalytic performance between the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts underpins the dynamic transformation of cobalt species under reaction conditions. This suggests that the actual active species in the PDH reaction might not be the starting materials, contributing to their equivalent catalytic efficiency despite differences in their initial states.

1. 最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的稳定性，开发了一种在沸石基质中形成超小金属颗粒的方法，特别是贝塔沸石。这些进展旨在创建高效催化脱氢反应的超小金属颗粒，以解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，适用于工业应用。

2. 0.5CoSiBeta催化剂表现出显著的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性。在还原处理后，诱导期明显缩短，这表明被限制的CoOx物种可以转化为金属Co颗粒，从而增强催化性能。

3. 研究人员比较了不同钴负载的CoSiBeta催化剂的表征和催化性能，以了解催化剂活性与结构之间的关系。这种方法有助于优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高脱氢反应的性能。

4. 10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂之间相似的催化性能表明，催化剂物种在反应条件下动态转变。这表明实际的活性物种在PDH反应中可能不是初始材料，这解释了它们具有等效的催化效率，尽管它们的初始状态存在差异。
