[1] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[2] "By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed."
[3] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."
[4] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
[5] "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

These strategies and approaches include the development of supported metal catalysts with enhanced dispersion and confinement of metal species, particularly in zeolitic supports like SiBeta. The use of dealuminated zeolites creates T-sites with silanols that effectively confine metal species, leading to highly active and selective catalysts. The confinement of metal oxides (CoOx) in these sites allows for their easy reduction to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance. This approach not only improves the stability of the catalyst but also offers insights into the active phase of cobalt in direct dehydrogenation processes, leading to the design of green and economically viable catalysts for propylene production.

这些策略和方法包括在如SiBeta这样的沸石支持物中开发具有增强分散性和金属物种有效限制的金属催化剂。通过去铝化沸石可以生成含有硅烷醇的T位点，这些位点有效地将金属物种封装起来，导致活性和选择性极高的催化剂。金属氧化物（CoOx）在这些位点内的封装允许它们在反应过程中容易还原为金属Co颗粒，这显著提高了催化性能。这种方法不仅提高了催化剂的稳定性，还提供了关于直接脱氢过程中钴活性相的新见解，从而设计出绿色且经济实惠的催化剂用于丙烯生产。
