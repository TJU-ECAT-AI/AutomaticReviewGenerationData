[1] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[2] "The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst."
[3] "The nature of active Co phases in CoSiBeta catalysts... The cobalt species are mainly present in the forms of confined CoOx for a low Co loading and bulk Co3O4 for a high Co loading in CoSiBeta catalysts."
[4] "Combined with activity test results, the large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta."

1. The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve preparing CoOx confined in the SiBeta zeolite by connecting with silanols. This method addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by achieving great propane conversion and extremely high propylene selectivity over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst, which matches the performance of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts. 

2. The cobalt species are predominantly in the form of CoOx confined in the T-sites of the SiBeta zeolite support. This confinement allows for easy reduction to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which contributes to the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment.

3. The nature of active Co phases in CoSiBeta catalysts varies with the Co loading. Confined CoOx is present for a low Co loading, while bulk Co3O4 is found for a high Co loading. These different forms of cobalt species have distinct impacts on catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. The presence of large Co3O4 particles on the surface of the 10CoSiBeta catalyst leads to serious side reactions, causing a very low initial propylene selectivity. Prereduction treatment reduces these Co3O4 particles to bulk Co0 particles, which are mostly inactive for the PDH reaction and result in carbon deposition.

1. 最近发展起来增强直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括在SiBeta沸石中制备连接于硅烷醇的CoOx。这种方法通过实现0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的显著催化活性和极高丙烯选择性，以及与商业Pt和CrOx催化剂相当的性能，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。

2. 钴物种主要以位于SiBeta沸石基质T位点的CoOx形式存在。这种限制允许在反应过程中容易还原为金属钴颗粒，这有助于具有或不具有预还原处理的CoSiBeta催化剂表现出相似的催化性能。

3. CoSiBeta催化剂中活性钴相的性质随钴负载变化。对于低钴负载，存在封闭的CoOx；而对于高钴负载，则存在大量的Co3O4。这些不同形式的钴物种对催化活性和选择性有不同的影响。

4. 表面存在的大量Co3O4颗粒导致了10CoSiBeta催化剂严重的副反应，造成非常低的初始丙烯选择性。预还原处理将这些Co3O4颗粒还原为无定形的Co0颗粒，这些颗粒在PDH反应中基本不活跃，并导致碳沉积。

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
[2] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."
[3] "To further figure out the correlation of catalyst activity and structure, the characterizations and catalytic performance of the CoSiBeta catalysts with higher Co loadings were compared."
[4] "Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts."

1. The recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of metal species confined in zeolite supports, particularly in Beta zeolite. These advancements aim to create ultrasmall-sized metal particles that are highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation reactions, addressing challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. 

2. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrates significant catalytic activity with exceptionally high propylene selectivity. The induction period is notably shortened after a reduction treatment, suggesting that the confined CoOx species can be converted to metallic Co particles, enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. Researchers have compared the characterization and catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with varying cobalt loadings to understand the correlation between catalyst activity and structure. This approach helps in optimizing catalyst composition and structure for enhanced performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The similarity in catalytic performance between the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts underpins the dynamic transformation of cobalt species under reaction conditions. This suggests that the actual active species in the PDH reaction might not be the starting materials, contributing to their equivalent catalytic efficiency despite differences in their initial states.

2. 0.5CoSiBeta催化剂表现出显著的催化活性和极高的丙烯选择性。在还原处理后，诱导期明显缩短，这表明被限制的CoOx物种可以转化为金属Co颗粒，从而增强催化性能。

3. 研究人员比较了不同钴负载的CoSiBeta催化剂的表征和催化性能，以了解催化剂活性与结构之间的关系。这种方法有助于优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高脱氢反应的性能。

4. 10CoSiBeta、Re10CoSiBeta和Reox10CoSiBeta催化剂之间相似的催化性能表明，催化剂物种在反应条件下动态转变。这表明实际的活性物种在PDH反应中可能不是初始材料，这解释了它们具有等效的催化效率，尽管它们的初始状态存在差异。

[1] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
[2] "By combining activity test and characterization results, the nature of active cobalt species and the cause of catalyst deactivation in PDH are discussed."
[3] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."
[4] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown."
[5] "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

These strategies and approaches include the development of supported metal catalysts with enhanced dispersion and confinement of metal species, particularly in zeolitic supports like SiBeta. The use of dealuminated zeolites creates T-sites with silanols that effectively confine metal species, leading to highly active and selective catalysts. The confinement of metal oxides (CoOx) in these sites allows for their easy reduction to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance. This approach not only improves the stability of the catalyst but also offers insights into the active phase of cobalt in direct dehydrogenation processes, leading to the design of green and economically viable catalysts for propylene production.

这些策略和方法包括在如SiBeta这样的沸石支持物中开发具有增强分散性和金属物种有效限制的金属催化剂。通过去铝化沸石可以生成含有硅烷醇的T位点，这些位点有效地将金属物种封装起来，导致活性和选择性极高的催化剂。金属氧化物（CoOx）在这些位点内的封装允许它们在反应过程中容易还原为金属Co颗粒，这显著提高了催化性能。这种方法不仅提高了催化剂的稳定性，还提供了关于直接脱氢过程中钴活性相的新见解，从而设计出绿色且经济实惠的催化剂用于丙烯生产。
