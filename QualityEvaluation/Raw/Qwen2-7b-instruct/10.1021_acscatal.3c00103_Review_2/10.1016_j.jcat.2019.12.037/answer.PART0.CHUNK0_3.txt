<p>Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes provided in the literature that directly address the strategies and approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. The literature focuses on the development of a cobalt-based catalyst supported on dealuminated beta zeolite (SiBeta) for the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.</p>
