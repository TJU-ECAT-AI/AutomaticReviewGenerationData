To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, researchers have developed several key strategies and approaches. These advancements specifically target the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. One innovative approach involves utilizing a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as an alternative support for the catalyst, replacing traditional alumina. This zeolite offers enhanced reactivity and stability due to its unique structure, which boosts the performance of supported metals by facilitating both facile reactant and product diffusion and maintaining high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores.

Another significant advancement is the strategic incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) alongside platinum (Pt) into the zeolite structure. REEs are known for their strong metal-support interactions with Pt, stabilizing the latter in the form of small nanoparticles. While the initial expectation was that adding REEs might improve the catalyst's activity, the actual outcome was a dramatic increase in catalytic lifetime, surpassing tenfold with the addition of lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y).

The successful formation of long-lasting Pt-REE alloy nanoparticles critically depends on the synthesis procedures of the zeolite. Despite the zeolites being siliceous and having similar mesoporosity, the use of sodium-free conditions during synthesis facilitated the atomically dispersed REEs, crucial for alloy formation. Researchers hypothesized that the single atomic species of REEs, with a high chemical potential, could be converted to metallic states more easily with hydrogen gas than their bulk oxides. The presence of silanol nests—clusters of silanol groups often detected in mesoporous zeolites synthesized under sodium-free conditions—was believed to stabilize these single atomic REEs by forming coordination bonds.

By intentionally generating silanol nests through the synthesis of a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequent removal of gallium (Ga) atoms, the REEs were effectively atomically dispersed. This allowed for the formation of Pt-REE intermetallic nanoparticles when heated under hydrogen gas at 700°C. The resulting nanoparticles exhibited remarkable catalytic performance improvements, including higher activity, selectivity, and durability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the Pt-La and Pt-Y bimetallic catalysts showed high initial propane conversion rates and underwent extremely slow deactivation, retaining a significant conversion rate even after 30 days of operation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of surface silanol nests in enabling the atomistic alloying of REEs into Pt nanoparticles, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

In summary, the development of these strategies and approaches has significantly advanced the field of catalysis for direct dehydrogenation processes, offering more durable and active catalysts suitable for industrial applications. The utilization of specialized zeolite supports, strategic incorporation of REEs, and the optimization of synthesis procedures have collectively contributed to overcoming key challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究人员开发了几个关键策略和方法。这些进展专门针对催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，以适应工业应用。一种创新的方法是利用具有微/介孔结构的硅酸盐MFI沸石作为催化剂的替代支撑物，取代传统的氧化铝。这种沸石因其独特的结构而提供了增强的活性和稳定性，该结构提高了支持金属的性能，通过促进反应物和产物的扩散，并保持金属纳米粒子在介孔中的高分散性。

另一个显著的进步是在沸石结构中战略性地引入稀土元素（REE）与铂（Pt）相结合。REEs因其与Pt的强金属-支撑相互作用而闻名，稳定后者形成小型纳米颗粒。尽管最初的预期是添加REEs可能会改善催化剂的活性，但实际结果是催化寿命的惊人增加，超过十倍，通过添加镧（La）和钇（Y）。

Pt-REE合金纳米颗粒的成功形成在很大程度上取决于沸石合成过程。尽管这些沸石是硅质的且具有相似的介孔性，但在无钠条件下合成沸石促进了原子分散的REEs，这是合金形成的关键。研究人员推测，具有高化学势的单原子REEs可以更容易地用氢气转化为金属状态，而不是它们的氧化物。表面硅醇巢——在无钠条件下合成的介孔沸石中经常检测到的硅醇簇群——被认为是通过形成配位键稳定这些单原子REEs。

通过故意生成硅醇巢，通过合成介孔镓硅酸盐沸石并随后去除镓（Ga）原子，实现了REEs的有效原子分散。这允许在加热至700°C的氢气下形成Pt-REE间金属纳米颗粒。产生的纳米颗粒在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中表现出显著的催化性能改进，包括更高的活性、选择性和耐用性。特别是，Pt-La和Pt-Y双金属催化剂显示出接近平衡转化率的高初始丙烷转换率，并经历了极其缓慢的降解，即使在30天的操作后仍保留了8%的转化率。这些比较表明，Pt-La/沸石和Pt-La/沸石之间的差异主要归因于合金形成。然而，值得注意的是，Pt-La/沸石样品中仍然存在少量的Ga（Si/Ga = 598），即使在去镓化后，这可能参与催化功能。对剩余Ga的作用进行了研究，以及与Pt-La/沸石相比，通过比较mz-deGa、La/mz-deGa和Pt/mz-deGa的结果，发现Ga的作用不如合金形成明显，但仍有可能性作为促进剂增强催化功能或促进PtLa/mz-deGa中的合金形成。此外，在类似的方式下，PtY/mz-deGa也表现出高初始丙烷转换率和丙烯选择性，并且催化剂降解速度较慢。这似乎归因于原子大小和电子亲和力的差异。由于La比Y有更大的原子大小和较低的电子亲和力，Pt的几何和电子性质被更大地修改。这些结果表明，沸石可以作为PDH催化剂的发展的有效支撑。近年来，使用沸石支持的催化剂报告了高效丙烷转化为丙烯，例如PtZn和PtSn催化剂。对于工业应用中的沸石支持催化剂，建立高效的再生方法，如用于PtSn/氧化铝的氧氯化过程，至关重要。然而，这些催化剂的可再生性尚未充分证明。
