<p>When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2.</p>

<p>The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods).</p>
<p>From this unexpected observation, we speculated that the PtREE alloy formation could occur by incorporating the REEs in the form of single atomic species with high chemical potential.</p>

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Utilizing a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. This provides both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores, improving the catalytic performance.

2. Incorporating rare-earth elements (REEs) into the catalyst. The REEs are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with platinum, stabilizing the latter in the form of small nanoparticles. The addition of REEs, specifically lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y), significantly increases the catalytic lifetime of the Pt/zeolite catalysts.

3. Controlling the formation of PtREE alloy nanoparticles by utilizing silanol nests, which are detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in mesoporous zeolites synthesized under sodium-free conditions. These nests stabilize single atomic REE species, enabling easier conversion to metallic REEs through hydrogenation and facilitating alloy formation.

4. Ensuring that supported Pt nanoparticles are all present as intermetallic compounds with REEs. This results in the formation of PtREE nanoparticles with an L12 superlattice structure, which exhibit high initial activity and prolonged catalytic lifetime.

5. Addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on the synthesis methods that can produce highly active and more durable catalysts, such as those that incorporate REEs and utilize specific zeolite supports with tailored mesoporous structures.

These advancements address the challenges by improving the stability, activity, and selectivity of catalysts, leading to enhanced performance in direct dehydrogenation processes.

在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的最近开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 使用具有微/介孔结构的硅基MFI沸石作为替代氧化铝的支持物。这提供了易于反应物和产物扩散以及金属纳米粒子在介孔中的高分散性，从而改善了催化性能。

2. 在催化剂中加入稀土元素（REE）。REEs与铂之间具有很强的金属支持相互作用，稳定后者为小纳米颗粒。通过添加REEs，特别是镧（La）和钇（Y），显著增加了Pt/沸石催化剂的催化寿命。

3. 控制PtREE合金纳米粒子的形成，利用在无钠条件下合成的介孔沸石中检测到的硅醇巢。这些巢可以稳定单原子REE物种，并且通过氢化更容易地转换为金属REEs，从而促进合金形成。

4. 确保支持的Pt纳米粒子全部以与REEs的互金属化合物形式存在。这导致形成了具有L12超晶格结构的PtREE纳米粒子，这些纳米粒子表现出高初始活性和延长的催化寿命。

5. 通过关注可以产生高度活跃和更耐用催化剂的合成方法来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，例如那些包含REEs并使用具有特定介孔结构的沸石支持物的方法。

这些进步通过改善稳定性、活性和选择性来解决挑战，从而在直接脱氢过程中提高了催化剂的性能。
