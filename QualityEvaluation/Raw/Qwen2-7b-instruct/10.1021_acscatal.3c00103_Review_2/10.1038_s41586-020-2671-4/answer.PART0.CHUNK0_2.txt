[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
[4] "The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods)."
[5] "In accordance with our hypothesis, the REEs incorporated in this zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as shown in a video taken by AR-HAADF-STEM (see Supplementary Video 1)."
[6] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability, as shown in Fig. 2."
[7] "Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the PtLa/mz-deGa catalyst contained a small amount of Ga (Si/Ga = 598) even after the degallation, and that this may participate in the catalytic function17,18."

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of mesoporous zeolites as supports. These zeolites feature ultrathin frameworks and interconnected mesopores that facilitate both reactant and product diffusion while allowing for high dispersion of metal nanoparticles. By incorporating rare-earth elements (REEs) like lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) with platinum (Pt), the catalyst dispersion and stability are improved due to strong metal-support interactions that stabilize the Pt nanoparticles. The REEs are introduced into the mesoporous zeolite through a co-impregnation process involving aqueous solutions of REE precursors and Pt, followed by heating under oxygen and hydrogen flows. The REEs are dispersed atomically in the zeolite, leading to the formation of intermetallic compounds with Pt, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. The presence of small amounts of gallium (Ga) after the degallation process may contribute to the catalytic function, suggesting a synergistic effect among the elements in the catalyst system.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中负载型金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发的关键策略和方法涉及使用具有超薄骨架和三维互联介孔结构的沸石作为支持物。这些沸石通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及在介孔中的金属纳米粒子高分散性来提升催化性能。通过将镧（La）、钇（Y）等稀土元素与铂（Pt）结合到沸石中，可以改善催化剂的分散性和稳定性，因为这些元素与Pt之间有强大的金属-支撑相互作用，使Pt纳米颗粒稳定化为较小的颗粒。通过向沸石中注入镧、钇和铂的水溶液混合物，并在氧气和氢气流下进行加热，将REEs引入沸石中。REEs在沸石中的原子级分散导致与Pt形成互金属化合物，这显著提高了催化性能，在活性、选择性和耐久性方面表现出色。在去镓处理后，催化剂中可能残留的小量镓（Ga）可能对催化功能有所贡献，表明元素在催化剂系统中的协同效应。
