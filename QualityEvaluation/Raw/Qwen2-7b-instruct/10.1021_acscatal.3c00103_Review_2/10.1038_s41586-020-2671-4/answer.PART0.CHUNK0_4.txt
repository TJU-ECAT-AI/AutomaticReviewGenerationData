[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s3,7."
[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles14,15."
[4] "Investigation by atomic-resolution electron microscopy showed that some La and Y existed in an alloyed form with Pt nanoparticles, supported on the mesoporous zeolite."
[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability."
[6] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on improving catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. Key strategies include:

1. Utilizing mesoporous zeolites as supports, particularly those with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by facilitating both reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores.

2. Incorporating rare-earth elements (REEs) such as lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) into the catalyst system to improve dispersion and stability of the precious metal component (Pt) through strong REE-Pt interactions, resulting in smaller and more stable nanoparticles.

3. Exploiting the role of surface silanol nests in mesoporous zeolites to facilitate the formation of alloy nanoparticles between Pt and REEs, enabling the activation of hard-to-reduce REEs and promoting their diffusion onto the Pt surface for alloy formation.

4. Enhancing the catalytic performance of the PDH process by forming intermetallic compounds, such as Pt3La and Pt3Y, which exhibit improved activity, selectivity, and durability compared to conventional Pt-based catalysts.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design by optimizing the support material and metal loading, while improving fabrication techniques to ensure controlled particle size and dispersion. They also optimize performance through the strategic use of alloy formation, which can lead to enhanced reactivity and stability, crucial for industrial applications requiring high efficiency and long-term operation.

近期在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂稳定性的进展集中在改进催化剂设计、制造和性能优化以适应工业应用。关键策略包括：

1. 使用具有微观/介观多孔结构的介孔沸石作为支撑材料，这些结构通过促进反应物和产物的扩散以及金属纳米粒子在介孔内的高分散性来提升支持金属的催化性能。

2. 将镧（La）和钇（Y）等稀土元素整合到催化剂体系中，通过强La-Pt和Y-Pt相互作用增强铂基贵金属的分散性和稳定性，从而形成更小且更稳定的纳米颗粒。

3. 利用介孔沸石表面的硅醇巢（silanol nest）功能，促进铂和REEs之间的合金纳米颗粒形成，实现难以还原的REEs的激活，并促进其向铂表面扩散以形成合金。

4. 通过形成如Pt3La和Pt3Y这样的互金属化合物来增强PDH过程的催化性能，这些化合物在活性、选择性和耐久性方面相比传统的铂基催化剂表现出显著改善。

这些进展通过优化支撑材料和金属负载，以及改进制造技术以确保控制颗粒大小和分散性，解决了催化剂设计的挑战。它们还通过战略性合金形成优化性能，这可以导致增强的反应性和稳定性，对于需要高效性和长期运行的工业应用至关重要。
