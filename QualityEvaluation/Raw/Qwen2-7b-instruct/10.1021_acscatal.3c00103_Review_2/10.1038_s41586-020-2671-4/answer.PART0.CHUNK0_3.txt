[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production3."
[2] "The method works well when using easily reducible late transition metals, but Pt alloy formation with rare-earth elements through the H2 reduction route is almost impossible owing to the low chemical potential of rare-earth element oxides6."
[3] "We find that the silanol nests enable the rare-earth elements to exist as single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential compared with that of the bulk oxide, making it possible for them to diffuse onto Pt."
[4] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support8,9,10,11,12,13 owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores12,13."
[5] "When used with late transition metals, the same preparation strategy produces Pt alloy catalysts that incorporate an unusually large amount of the second metal and, in the case of the PtCo alloy, show high catalytic activity and selectivity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in H2."
[6] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface."
[7] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."
[8] "The catalytic reaction was performed at 580C using a pure propane flow at a large space velocity (see Methods), and these harsh operating conditions caused even the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst to experience severe coke formation and catalyst deactivation within 1 d."
[9] "The rapid deactivation behaviour of the PtLa/mz catalyst was similar to that of the monometallic Pt catalyst supported on mesoporous zeolite (Pt/mz), consistent with the hydrogen chemisorption property of the PtLa/mz sample, indicating that the supported Pt existed entirely as monometallic nanoparticles and that no alloy with La was present."
[10] "For industrial application of the zeolite-supported catalysts, it would be important to establish an efficient regeneration method, such as the oxychlorination process employed for PtSn/alumina."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the utilization of advanced catalyst supports, such as mesoporous zeolites, with hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structures. These supports are designed to improve reactant and product diffusion, while also promoting high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. One notable advancement is the incorporation of rare-earth elements (REEs) into the catalyst formulation. By leveraging the properties of REEs, researchers have managed to create alloy nanoparticles with improved stability, particularly against coke deposition. This is achieved by utilizing silanol nests within the zeolite structure to facilitate the formation of single atomic species of REEs, which can then easily diffuse onto the platinum surface and form alloys. This approach has been successfully applied to create bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts that exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity for processes such as propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, the integration of zeolite supports offers a potential avenue for developing more durable catalysts with better performance, which is crucial for industrial applications. The use of such advanced catalysts not only improves the efficiency of petrochemical processes but also aims to reduce the frequency of catalyst regeneration, making them more sustainable and economically viable options.
