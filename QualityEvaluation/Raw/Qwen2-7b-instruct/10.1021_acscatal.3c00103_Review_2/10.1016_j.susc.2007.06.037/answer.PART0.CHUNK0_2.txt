[1] "The adsorption of ethene (C2H4) on Pt(1 1 1) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys has been investigated experimentally by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption."
[2] "On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form."
[3] "In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces."
[4] "The HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks."

This study employed high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption to investigate the adsorption of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys. The findings indicated that ethene adopts an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on these surfaces, with this being the most stable adsorbed form. Moreover, a minor amount of π-bonded ethene was identified, which was more prevalent on the Pt2Sn surface alloy. Lastly, the high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys showed only slight differences in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

本研究利用高分辨率电子能量损失光谱和温度程序脱附对乙烯在Pt(1 1 1)以及Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1)和Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附进行了实验研究。结果表明，乙烯在这些表面上以η2 di-σ键形式吸附，这是最稳定的吸附形式。此外，还发现了一种π键型乙烯，其在Pt2Sn表面合金中的含量更高。最后，乙烯在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的高分辨率电子能量损失光谱仅在失活峰的能量位置上表现出微小差异。
