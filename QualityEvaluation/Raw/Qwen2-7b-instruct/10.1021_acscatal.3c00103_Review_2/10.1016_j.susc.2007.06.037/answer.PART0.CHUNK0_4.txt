On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form.
In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces.
Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The research investigates the adsorption of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and ordered PtxSn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. The study reveals that the most stable adsorbed form of ethene is in an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on both surfaces. Additionally, a minor amount of π-bonded ethene is identified, with its abundance varying across the different surface alloys. The HREELS spectra show slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks between ethene adsorbed on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys.

研究通过高分辨率电子能量损失光谱和温度程序脱附对Pt(1 1 1)及有序PtxSn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上乙烯的吸附进行了考察。研究发现，最稳定的吸附形式为乙烯在两种表面上以η2 di-σ键构型存在。此外，还识别出了一定量的π键合乙烯，其在不同表面合金中的丰度有所不同。HREELS谱图显示，在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上吸附的乙烯的能级位置的丢失峰有轻微差异。
