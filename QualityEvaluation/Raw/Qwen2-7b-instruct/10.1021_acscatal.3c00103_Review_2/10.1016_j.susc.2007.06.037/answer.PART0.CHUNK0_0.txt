On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form.
In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces.
Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The study found that ethene predominantly adopts an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on both Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, being the most stable adsorbed form. Additionally, a minor amount of π-bonded ethene was identified, with higher abundance on the Pt2Sn surface alloy compared to the others. The high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys showed similar energetic positions for the loss peaks.

研究发现，乙炔在Pt(1 1 1)以及PtSn表面合金上主要以η2 di-σ键合形式吸附，这是最稳定的吸附形式。此外，还检测到了少量π键合的乙炔，其在Pt2Sn表面合金中的丰度高于其他表面。高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）光谱显示，乙炔在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的损失峰的能量位置相似。
