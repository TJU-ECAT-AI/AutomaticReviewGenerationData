On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form.
In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces.
Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The study found that ethene predominantly adopts an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on both Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, being the most stable adsorbed form. Additionally, a minor amount of π-bonded ethene was identified, with higher abundance on the Pt2Sn surface alloy compared to the others. The high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys showed similar energetic positions for the loss peaks.

The study reveals that ethene primarily adopts an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on both Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, which is the most stable adsorbed form. Moreover, a lesser amount of π-bonded ethene is detected, with a higher presence on the Pt2Sn alloy compared to the other surfaces. The high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra for ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys exhibit minimal differences in the energetic positions of their loss peaks.

The key strategies and approaches developed in the research involve the comparison of experimental results obtained through high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature programmed desorption with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These methods enable a comprehensive assignment of vibration modes and loss features to the species present on the surfaces of Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1), and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys. Specifically, ethene was found to adsorb in a η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on these surfaces, with a minor amount also found to be π-bonded. The research highlights differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks in the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys, indicating distinct adsorption behaviors.
