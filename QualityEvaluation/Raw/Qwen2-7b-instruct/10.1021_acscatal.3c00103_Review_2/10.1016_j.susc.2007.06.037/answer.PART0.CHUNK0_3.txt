[1] "The experimental results have been compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowing us to perform a complete assignment of all vibration modes and loss features to the species present on the surfaces."
[2] "On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form."
[3] "In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces."
[4] "Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks."

The key strategies and approaches developed in the research involve the comparison of experimental results obtained through high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and temperature programmed desorption with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These methods enable a comprehensive assignment of vibration modes and loss features to the species present on the surfaces of Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1), and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys. Specifically, ethene was found to adsorb in a η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on these surfaces, with a minor amount also found to be π-bonded. The research highlights differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks in the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys, indicating distinct adsorption behaviors.

研究中开发的关键策略和方法包括将实验结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算相结合，通过高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和程序升温脱附。这些方法允许对表面Pt(1 1 1)、Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1)和Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)上存在的物种的所有振动模式和损耗特征进行完整的分配。具体而言，研究发现乙烷在这些表面上以η2 di-σ键合形式吸附，其中还发现了一种较小量的π键合乙烷，且在Pt2Sn表面合金中的含量更多。研究表明，乙烷在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的HREELS光谱的能级位置差异很小，表明了不同的吸附行为。
