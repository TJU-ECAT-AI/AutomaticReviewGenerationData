On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form.
In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces.
Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The study reveals that ethene primarily adopts an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation on both Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, which is the most stable adsorbed form. Moreover, a lesser amount of π-bonded ethene is detected, with a higher presence on the Pt2Sn alloy compared to the other surfaces. The high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra for ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys exhibit minimal differences in the energetic positions of their loss peaks.

研究发现，乙烷在Pt(1 1 1)以及PtSn表面合金上主要以η2 di-σ键形式吸附，这是最稳定的吸附形式。此外，还检测到了少量π键型乙烷，Pt2Sn合金上的含量高于其他表面。高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）对乙烷在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的谱图显示，在损失峰的能量位置上仅有轻微差异。
