[1] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

[2] "This is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the higher energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111)."

[3] "The d-band center of Pt(111) is located at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, whereas that of Pt3Ti(111) downshifts to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling, giving rise to weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates and changes in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions."

[4] "This indicates that Pt3Ti has higher selectivity toward propylene for PDH compared to pure Pt."

[5] "The lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy corresponds to a higher oxygen activity."

[6] "The formation energy of the oxygen vacancy can therefore be used as a descriptor when searching for new catalysts for ODH of propane."

Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of the catalysts. These modifications involve controlling the size and shape of nanoparticles, alloying with transition metals or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate supports. For instance, by alloying platinum (Pt) with titanium (Ti), the electronic properties of the catalyst can be altered, leading to changes in the adsorption of reaction intermediates and the relative free energy barriers during dehydrogenation and side reactions. This modification can lead to a higher selectivity toward propylene. Additionally, the formation energy of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface is a key descriptor for catalytic activity. Catalysts with lower formation energy of oxygen vacancies exhibit higher activity, making them suitable for oxygen dehydrogenation of propane.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发了一系列策略和方法。这些策略包括调整催化剂的几何结构和电子特性，如控制纳米颗粒的大小和形状、合金化以引入过渡金属或主族金属以及选择合适的支撑材料。例如，通过将铂（Pt）合金化为钛（Ti），可以改变催化剂的电子性质，从而影响反应中间体的吸附和反应步骤期间的相对自由能和能量壁垒。这可以导致丙烯选择性的提高。此外，催化剂表面氧空位的形成能是活性的关键描述符。氧空位形成能较低的催化剂表现出更高的活性，因此它们适合于丙烷的氧气脱氢。
