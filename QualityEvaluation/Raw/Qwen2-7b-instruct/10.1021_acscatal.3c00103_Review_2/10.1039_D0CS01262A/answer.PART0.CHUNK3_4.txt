[1] "Small cluster VOx with a low VO ratio could increase the propylene selectivity at the expense of lowering the activity, while polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio could lower the propylene selectivity."
[2] "The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers."
[3] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period. With the consumption of the VO during the reaction, the AlOV sites become dominating active sites for propylene formation."
[4] "The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."
[5] "Liu et al.402 studied PDH on perfect Ga2O3(100) by DFT calculations. The bridge-bound surface O sites are active for cleaving the CH bonds in propane, and thus rather stable OH groups are formed on the surface."
[6] "For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced."
[7] "On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O. Since it is also possible to generate gaseous H2O at high temperatures, the reaction would follow an ODH mechanism comprising H2O at the initial stage and follow a PDH mechanism forming H2 at the steady stage."
[8] "For the transition state for this elementary step, the electrons are transferred from lattice oxygens to metal centers as an i-propoxide and an OH group from propane."
[9] "The kinetics of the PDH reaction over M1V2O3 (M = MnCu, RuAg, and OsAu) were studied by Zhang et al.391 In their model, surface V and O atoms are replaced with single atoms, including M1(Vvac)V2O3(0001) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) and M1(Ovac)V2O3(0001) (M = Pd, Pt, and Au)."
[10] "The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy."

What are the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, and how do these advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications?

Answer: Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on optimizing the composition, size, and valence state of metal clusters. Key strategies include:

1. **Adjusting Cluster Size and Valence State**: Researchers have found that balancing the cluster size and valence state of metals can improve selectivity while maintaining activity. Smaller clusters with a low ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites can increase propylene selectivity but may lower overall activity. Conversely, larger clusters with a higher VO ratio can lower propylene selectivity. Sub-monolayer VOx layers have been identified as providing a high propylene yield, confirming recent experimental findings.

2. **Modulating Active Sites**: The use of different metal oxides and their surface sites as active centers plays a crucial role in enhancing stability. For instance, the terminal VO sites on V2O5 are active for acetone formation, while the VO support is the main site for propylene formation. The ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites affects the catalyst's performance.

3. **Valence State Dependence**: The valence state of metals significantly influences the catalytic activity, especially in processes involving oxygen. Oxygen vacancies in the catalyst structure can alter the electronic structure of active species, affecting reaction mechanisms. The presence of lattice oxygen is essential for the initial stages of propane dehydrogenation, facilitating the formation of desired products like propylene.

4. **Reaction Mechanism Optimization**: Understanding and optimizing the reaction pathways, particularly the rate-determining step (RDS), helps in enhancing the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes. This includes minimizing unwanted byproducts like CO and CO2 formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation and lower selectivity.

5. **Surface Engineering**: Techniques such as adding alkali metal additives to V-based and Mo-based catalysts can improve propylene selectivity by modifying the acid-base properties of the catalysts. Blocking active centers on the catalyst surface with additives like potassium can inhibit consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion, leading to high initial selectivity.

6. **Metal Oxide Selection**: Different types of catalysts, such as Cr-based, Ga-based, Mo-based catalysts, and mixed metal oxides, have been studied. While these catalysts allow for redox mechanisms without structural collapse, the complexity of metal oxides requires careful consideration of their crystal structures, oxidation states, and surface facets.

7. **Single Atom Catalysts (SACs)**: SACs offer distinct properties from supported nanoclusters and provide opportunities to establish structure-reactivity relationships. Strategies like strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) to prevent sintering on the surface, or the use of single atoms on metal oxides, can enhance catalytic performance and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and activity, while also considering the practical aspects of scale-up and industrial application. The integration of theoretical models, computational simulations, and experimental validation is crucial for the rational design and optimization of catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经发展了一些关键策略和方法。这些进步在催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面解决了工业应用中的挑战。

1. **调整簇大小和价态**：研究发现，通过平衡金属簇的大小和价态，可以提高选择性同时保持活性。较小的簇，终端VO比其他氧位低的比例增加丙烯选择性，但可能降低总体活性。较大的簇，高VO比率可以降低丙烯选择性。亚单层VOx层已被确认提供高的丙烯产率，并且最近的实验结果得到了证实。

2. **调节活性位点**：不同金属氧化物及其表面位点作为活性中心的作用对于提高稳定性至关重要。例如，V2O5上的终端VO位点对乙酸酮形成是活跃的，而VO支持是主要的丙烯形成位点。VO的比例影响催化剂的性能。

3. **价态依赖性**：金属的价态在涉及氧气的过程中有显著影响，特别是脱氢过程。氧空位在催化剂结构中可以改变活性物种的电子结构，影响反应机制。表面氧离子在初始阶段对丙烷脱氢化至关重要，有助于形成所需的产物如丙烯。

4. **反应机制优化**：理解并优化反应路径，尤其是速率决定步骤（RDS），有助于提高脱氢过程的效率。这包括最小化如CO和CO2等副产品的形成，这些副产品可能导致催化剂失活和降低选择性。

5. **表面工程**：向V基和Mo基催化剂添加碱金属添加剂可以改善丙烯选择性，通过修改催化剂的酸碱性质。在催化剂表面上添加钾等物质可以抑制连续丙烯和平行丙烷燃烧，导致高初始选择性。

6. **金属氧化物的选择**：Cr基、Ga基、Mo基催化剂以及混合金属氧化物的使用显示了允许红ox机制而不引起结构崩溃的能力。然而，对于这些氧化物的复杂性，需要仔细考虑它们的晶格结构、氧化状态和表面面。

7. **单原子催化剂（SACs）**：SACs提供了与支持纳米簇不同的特性，并为建立结构-反应性关系提供了机会。策略如强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）防止表面聚集，或在金属氧化物上使用单原子，可以增强催化剂的性能和稳定性。

这些进步通过关注提高选择性、稳定性和活性，同时考虑工业化应用的实用性，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。理论模型、计算模拟和实验验证的综合集成对于直接脱氢过程的合理设计和优化至关重要。
