Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on optimizing the interaction between the metal active phase and the support, as well as modifying the catalyst surface to improve stability and selectivity. Strategies include:

1. **Surface Modification**: Incorporating promoter metals to the catalyst surface can alter the electronic properties of the metal-support interface, reducing carbon deposition and enhancing stability. For instance, adding metals like Au or Sn to Ni-based catalysts can inhibit the growth of carbon deposits.

2. **Nanostructuring**: Creating highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on the support can increase the surface area and optimize the active site distribution, which improves the catalytic activity and stability. Smaller particle sizes are particularly effective in minimizing carbon deposition.

3. **Composite Catalysts**: Developing bimetallic or core-shell catalysts, such as NiRh, NiRu, or NiPt alloys, can offer enhanced activity and stability due to synergistic effects between the metals. These catalysts are effective in reducing methane dissociation and enhancing carbon removal, thus improving stability.

4. **Support Engineering**: Selecting appropriate support materials that facilitate CO2 activation and stabilize the catalyst surface can improve the overall catalytic performance. Supports like ceria or titania can enhance CO2 binding and activation, contributing to better stability.

5. **Size Optimization**: Tailoring the particle size of the catalyst to an optimal size where the activity and stability are maximized can address the challenges of carbon formation and sintering. This involves balancing the size to minimize the risk of carbon deposition and maintain high activity.

These strategies address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by targeting the key factors responsible for catalyst deactivation, such as carbon formation, sintering, and loss of selectivity. They aim to create catalysts that are more robust and efficient in industrial applications, thereby increasing the feasibility and sustainability of direct dehydrogenation processes.

近期，直接脱氢过程支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性提升主要集中在优化金属活性相与支撑材料之间的相互作用，以及通过改变催化剂表面来提高稳定性和选择性。策略包括：

1. **表面改性**：在催化剂表面上引入辅助金属可以改变金属-支撑界面的电子特性，减少碳沉积并增强稳定性。例如，将Au或Sn添加到Ni基催化剂中可以抑制碳沉积的增长。

2. **纳米结构化**：在支撑材料上创建高度分散的金属纳米颗粒可以增加表面积并优化活性位点分布，从而提高催化活性和稳定性。较小的颗粒尺寸特别有效于减少碳沉积。

3. **复合催化剂**：开发双金属或核壳催化剂，如NiRh、NiRu或NiPt合金，可以通过金属之间的协同效应提供增强的活性和稳定性。这些催化剂在减少甲烷分解和增强碳移除方面非常有效，从而提高稳定性。

4. **支撑工程**：选择有助于CO2激活并稳定催化剂表面的支持材料可以改善整体催化性能。像氧化铈或二氧化钛这样的支持材料可以增强CO2结合和激活，从而促进更好的稳定性。

5. **尺寸优化**：调整催化剂颗粒大小到一个最优大小，使活动性和稳定性最大化，以解决碳形成、聚集和选择性丧失的问题。这涉及平衡尺寸以最小化碳沉积的风险，并保持高活性。

这些策略通过针对导致催化剂失活的关键因素（如碳形成、聚集和选择性丧失）来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。它们旨在创建更坚固、更高效的催化剂，以增加直接脱氢过程在工业应用中的可行性和可持续性。
