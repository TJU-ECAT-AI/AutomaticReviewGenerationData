Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve strategic modifications to catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization. Key strategies include:

1. **Optimizing Metal Composition**: The use of alkali metal additives, such as potassium, can improve propylene selectivity in propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts. These additives modify the acid-base properties of the catalysts, influencing their selectivity.

2. **Tailoring Cluster Size and Valence State**: The ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites plays a crucial role in catalyst design, impacting the balance between activity and selectivity. Sub-monolayer VOx clusters can provide a high propylene yield, balancing the trade-off between these properties.

3. **Understanding Catalytic Mechanisms**: Recent studies have delineated the division of PDH reactions into two distinct periods, with VO species acting as key active sites during different stages of the reaction. This insight aids in the rational design of catalysts that optimize selectivity.

4. **Leveraging Surface Chemistry**: The surface chemistry of metal oxides, including the participation of lattice oxygens in CH bond activation, has been elucidated through studies on materials like Mo3O9. This knowledge guides the selection of active sites for efficient reactions.

5. **Exploring Single Atom Catalysis**: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer unique properties that differ from those of supported metal clusters. Research focuses on synthesizing thermally stable SACs, particularly by exploiting strong metal-support interactions to prevent sintering and maintain single atom integrity.

6. **Tailoring Support Materials**: The choice of support materials is critical in anchoring single metal atoms effectively. Theoretical calculations consider the compatibility and interaction between single atoms and supports to optimize catalytic performance.

7. **Universal Scaling Relationships**: A comprehensive understanding of the CH bond activation across a range of alkanes and catalysts has been achieved through the establishment of universal scaling relationships. This aids in predicting catalyst efficiency and guiding the development of new catalysts.

8. **Addressing the Trade-off Between Activity and Selectivity**: There is a fundamental constraint linking CH bond activation, olefin desorption, and deep CH bond activation. Strategies that break this relation, such as alloying Pt with another metal or implementing core-shell structures, aim to enhance catalytic performance while maintaining selectivity and stability.

These advancements collectively address the multifaceted challenges in catalyst design, offering promising avenues for optimizing performance in industrial applications.

近期，针对直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的增强，采取了一系列策略和方法。关键点包括：

1. **优化金属组成**：通过添加碱金属如钾，可以提高V基和Mo基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的丙烯选择性。这些添加剂改变催化剂的酸碱性质，影响其选择性。

2. **调整簇大小与价态状态**：终端VO与其它氧位的比例是催化剂设计的关键参数，影响活性与选择性的平衡。亚单层VOx簇可以提供较高的丙烯产率，平衡这两个属性之间的权衡。

3. **理解催化机制**：最近的研究揭示了PDH反应的两个不同阶段，其中VO物种在反应的不同阶段作为关键活性位点。这为设计优化选择性的催化剂提供了见解。

4. **利用表面化学**：对金属氧化物表面化学的理解，特别是如何参与CH键活化，通过研究材料如Mo3O9来阐明。这指导了有效反应活性位点的选择。

5. **探索单原子催化**：单原子催化剂(SACs)具有与支持金属簇不同的独特性质。研究重点在于合成热稳定的SACs，尤其是通过利用强金属-支持相互作用防止聚集和保持单原子完整性。

6. **定制支撑材料**：选择合适的支撑材料对于有效锚定单金属原子至关重要。理论计算考虑单原子与支撑材料的兼容性和相互作用，以优化催化性能。

7. **建立通用缩放关系**：通过对一系列烷烃和催化剂建立了通用缩放关系，全面理解了CH键激活的过程。这有助于预测催化剂效率并指导新催化剂的发展。

8. **解决活性与选择性之间的权衡**：CH键激活、烯烃脱附和深层CH键激活之间存在基本约束。通过合金化Pt与其他金属或实施核壳结构等策略，旨在增强催化性能同时维持选择性和稳定性。

这些进展共同解决了催化剂设计中的多方面挑战，提供了优化工业应用性能的有前景途径。
