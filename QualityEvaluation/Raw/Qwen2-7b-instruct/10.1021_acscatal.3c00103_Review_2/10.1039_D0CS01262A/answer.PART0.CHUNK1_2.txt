[1] "The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering."
[2] "The DFT studies of Rodriguez and coworkers194,197,198 indicated that the effective barrier of methane activation decreased from 0.9 eV over a Ni(111) surface to only 0.15 eV over a Ni/CeO2x(111) surface (Fig. 15)."
[3] "The study revealed that the oxygen vacancy enhanced the CH activation of methane."
[4] "The whole catalytic cycle involving the oxygen vacancy was not analyzed. It is highly desired to analyze the elementary reaction steps at the metaloxide interface in the catalytic cycle to gain a better understanding of the role of the interface in DRM."
[5] "This suggests that the reduction degree of the CeO2 or oxygen vacancy is vital for the activity of Ni/Co sites."
[6] "The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation."
[7] "Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations."
[8] "The Ni/Co cation on reduced CeO2 (Ce2O3) shows a much lower activity for CH activation of methane compared to the Ni/Co cation on CeO2."
[9] "In contrast, single-site Ni1/Mg(100) was not active for CO2 and CH4 dissociation, while Ni4/MgO(100) enabled the formation of H2, CO, and H2O under DRM reaction, revealed by combined DFT, kMC simulation, and experimental studies."
[10] "The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation."
[11] "The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation."
[12] "It was found that by doping Pt on Ni(111) methane dissociation was greatly promoted."
[13] "The results demonstrated that NiPt bimetallic catalysts were beneficial to methane adsorption and dissociation and atomic C/H adsorption, but might be less favorable for synthesis gas formation."
[14] "The lower activation energy of CH + O  CHO on Pt1Cu(111) than on Pt1Ni(111) illustrated a higher potential of CO formation on Pt1Cu(111), which prevented C formation and resulted in a better coke-resistance."
[15] "The microkinetic modeling of Rh4/Ana-Ov illustrated a high (up to 90%) CO selectivity, which was increased with temperature."

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. **Support Materials**: Utilizing specific support materials like Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) or CeO2, which provide strong metal-support interactions, stabilizing the metal atoms and reducing sintering. This helps in maintaining the active sites of the catalyst over prolonged periods.

2. **Promoter Elements**: Incorporating elements like La2O3, Cu, or Sn into the catalyst structure. These elements modify the electronic properties of the metal surface, lowering the activation energy for methane dissociation and reducing the risk of carbon deposition.

3. **Bimetallic Systems**: Employing bimetallic catalysts such as NiSn, NiFe, or NiCu, which offer improved reactivity and stability compared to pure metal catalysts. The interaction between different metals can enhance the reactivity towards the dehydrogenation of methane or ethane.

4. **Single-Atom Alloys (SAAs)**: Developing single-atom alloy catalysts like NiPt or PtCu, which provide high surface area and optimal reactivity towards the desired chemical reactions. These catalysts show enhanced methane activation and dissociation capabilities, albeit with potential trade-offs in synthesis gas formation.

5. **Size Control**: Controlling the size of the metal clusters or nanoparticles. Smaller clusters tend to have higher reactivity but may face issues with stability. Larger clusters offer better stability but may lose reactivity. The balance is crucial for achieving high catalytic activity and stability.

6. **Surface Engineering**: Modifying the surface of the catalyst through treatments like decorating with AlOx species or doping with Sn, which can block under-coordinated sites, preventing deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

7. **Reduction Degree and Oxygen Vacancies**: Altering the reduction degree of the support material (like CeO2) or introducing oxygen vacancies to enhance the activation of methane or ethane, thereby improving the catalyst's efficiency.

8. **Support-Metal Interactions**: Leveraging the properties of support materials to anchor metal clusters, preventing aggregation and ensuring that the active sites remain exposed, thus enhancing the catalyst's performance.

9. **Elemental Composition**: Adjusting the elemental composition of the catalyst, like doping Pt onto Cu(111) or Ni(111) surfaces, to optimize the reactivity towards dehydrogenation reactions while maintaining or enhancing coke resistance.

These advancements collectively aim to optimize the balance between reactivity, stability, and selectivity, addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing a more controlled and efficient conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemical products.

为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. **支撑材料**：使用特定的支撑材料，如Ce掺杂羟基磷灰石（HAP-Ce）或CeO2，提供强大的金属-支撑相互作用，稳定金属原子并减少烧结。这有助于在长期过程中保持催化剂的活性位点。

2. **促进元素**：将La2O3、Cu或Sn等元素引入催化剂结构中。这些元素可以修改金属表面的电子性质，降低甲烷解离的活化能，并减少碳沉积的风险。

3. **双金属体系**：采用NiSn、NiFe或NiCu等双金属催化剂，它们相对于纯金属催化剂提供改进的反应性和稳定性。不同金属之间的相互作用可以增强对甲烷或乙烷脱氢的反应活性。

4. **单原子合金（SAAs）**：发展单原子合金催化剂，如NiPt或PtCu，提供高表面积和最佳的反应性。这些催化剂在甲烷激活和解离方面表现出增强的能力，尽管可能在合成气形成方面存在潜在的折衷。

5. **尺寸控制**：控制金属簇或纳米颗粒的尺寸。较小的簇通常具有更高的活性，但可能会面临稳定性问题。较大的簇提供了更好的稳定性，但在活性方面可能会失去优势。平衡对于实现高催化活性和稳定性至关重要。

6. **表面工程**：通过装饰AlOx物种或掺入Sn对催化剂表面进行处理，可以阻止不协调的位点，预防深度脱氢和焦炭形成。

7. **还原度和氧空位**：改变支撑材料（如CeO2）的还原度或引入氧空位以增强甲烷或乙烷的激活，从而提高催化剂的效率。

8. **支持-金属相互作用**：利用支撑材料的性质来锚定金属簇，防止聚集并确保活性位点保持暴露，从而增强催化剂的性能。

9. **元素组成**：调整催化剂的元素组成，如在Cu(111)或Ni(111)表面上掺入Pt，优化脱氢反应的活性，同时维持或增强焦炭抵抗性。

这些进步共同旨在优化活性、稳定性和选择性的平衡，通过提供更可控和高效的烃转化为有价值的化学产品，解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。
