[1] "Despite the numerous experimental studies devoted to investigating the mechanism of DRM, there are still arguments between different researchers."
[2] "Metal dependence of activity Steam reforming of methane is one of the main processes for hydrogen production. To date, many efforts have been devoted to investigating the SRM reaction from both experimental and theoretical points of view."
[3] "The difference between the theoretical and experimental results might be caused by some sources of errors both in the modeling and in the experiments."
[4] "The activity was therefore considered to depend on the surface structure of the NPs, and the under-coordination sites (edges, kinks, and defects) were expected to be the active sites for SRM because of the larger fraction of under-coordinated surface sites exposed on small particles than larger particles."
[5] "The apparent activation energies calculated from the modeling were 1.131.21 eV with the Ni particle size in the range of 8 nm to 12 nm, which was in good agreement with the results measured by experiments, 1.061.17 eV for 812 nm."
[6] "The microkinetic analysis results agree with the experimental observation reported in the literature."
[7] "It was found that the M(211) surface is most active for Rh, Ni, and Pd catalysts, while for Pt, the M(100) surface is most active."
[8] "Ni-based bimetallic catalysts by alloying Ni (the active metal) with another metal (e.g. Au, Ru, Rh, Co, Pt, Ag, Sn) are generally used to reduce methane dissociation and enhance the surface reaction of carbon removal, which could effectively increase catalyst resistance to deactivation and improve catalyst stability."
[9] "The addition of Ag into Ni catalysts reduced the catalytic activity towards SRM but enhanced coke formation resistance."
[10] "The authors also calculated the TOF based on Gibbs free energy, which was 5.92 s1 at 1023 K for CO2 activation on the support, very close to the experimental value (6.13 s1 at 1023 K), but much higher than that on the Ni surface (4.42 × 106 s1)."

1. There are still differing opinions among researchers regarding the DRMs mechanism despite extensive experimental studies.

2. Many efforts have been made to study the steam reforming of methane (SRM) from both experimental and theoretical perspectives.

3. The discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental outcomes might be attributed to errors in both modeling and experimental methods.

4. The activity of SRM was thought to be influenced by the surface structure of nanoparticles, with edge, kink, and defect sites presumed to be active due to their greater exposure on smaller particles.

5. The calculated apparent activation energies for nickel particles of 8-12 nm were 1.13-1.21 eV, closely matching experimental results of 1.06-1.17 eV for particles of 8-12 nm.

6. The microkinetic analysis matched experimental observations.

7. The most active surface for DRMs was found to be the (211) surface for Rh, Ni, and Pd catalysts, whereas the (100) surface was most active for Pt.

8. Nickel-based bimetallic catalysts were created by alloying nickel with metals like Au, Ru, Rh, Co, Pt, Ag, and Sn to decrease methane dissociation and enhance carbon removal, thereby boosting catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.

9. The inclusion of Ag in nickel catalysts decreased the catalytic activity for SRM but improved coke formation resistance.

10. The calculated turnover frequency for CO2 activation on the support was 5.92 s^-1 at 1023 K, closely resembling the experimental value of 6.13 s^-1 at 1023 K, but much higher than that on the Ni surface (4.42×10^6 s^-1).

1. 尽管进行了大量的实验研究来探讨DRM机制，但研究人员之间仍然存在分歧。

2. 许多努力从实验和理论两个角度研究了蒸汽重整甲烷（SRM）。

3. 理论预测与实验结果之间的差异可能归因于模型和实验方法中的错误。

4. SRM的活性被认为取决于纳米颗粒的表面结构，边缘、尖端和缺陷位点因其在较小颗粒上的更大暴露而被认为是活性位点。

5. 对8-12 nm镍粒子的计算显着激活能为1.13-1.21 eV，这与8-12 nm粒子的实验结果匹配良好，范围为1.06-1.17 eV。

6. 微动力学分析与实验观察相吻合。

7. DRMs最活跃的表面被发现是Rh、Ni和Pd催化剂的（211）表面，而Pt催化剂的最活跃表面是（100）表面。

8. 通过将镍与其他金属（如Au、Ru、Rh、Co、Pt、Ag、Sn）合金化来制备镍基双金属催化剂，以降低甲烷解离并增强碳去除的表面反应，从而有效提高催化剂稳定性及抗失活能力。

9. 在镍催化剂中加入Ag降低了SRM的催化活性，但增强了焦炭形成抵抗力。

10. 支持上CO2激活的计算转速为1023 K时为5.92 s^-1，接近实验值6.13 s^-1，但远高于Ni表面的值（4.42×10^6 s^-1）。
