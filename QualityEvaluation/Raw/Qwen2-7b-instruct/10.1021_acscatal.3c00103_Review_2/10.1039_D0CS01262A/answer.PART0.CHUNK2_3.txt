[1] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."
[2] "By using microkinetic analysis combined with results from DFT calculations, Xiao et al.365 found that a non-reverse HoriutiPolanyi mechanism accounts for more than half the propylene production at the under-coordinated active sites that dominate the kinetics of PDH."

The key strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization. Recent advancements focus on modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of the catalysts. These strategies include:

1. Controlling the size and shape of metal nanoparticles to optimize the surface area and reactivity.
2. Alloying metals with transition metals or main-group metals to adjust the electronic properties of the catalyst surface.
3. Selecting appropriate catalyst supports that can modify the electronic properties and reactivity of the active sites.
4. Modifying the electronic structure through the introduction of dopants to suppress unwanted side reactions and improve selectivity.
5. Developing novel core-shell catalysts that improve the utilization efficiency of precious metals while maintaining or enhancing activity and selectivity.

These advancements aim to reduce the selectivity to byproducts, maintain catalyst stability, and extend the use time of catalysts by suppressing deactivation mechanisms and promoting the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier.
