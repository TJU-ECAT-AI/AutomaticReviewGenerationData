To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent strategies focus on reducing the selectivity to byproducts and maintaining the catalyst's stability. Key approaches include the addition of one or more main-group metals or transition metals (TMs) such as Sn, In, Cu, and Ga. These additives help in reducing the tendency to form coke and improve the stability of the catalyst. Additionally, the surface area of small Pt clusters contributes to a higher coking rate, as the larger surface area facilitates faster coke formation, leading to quicker deactivation of the catalyst. By introducing elements like Sn into the catalyst, the energy barrier for propylene desorption can be reduced, while simultaneously increasing the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, thus improving the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，最近的策略集中在降低产物选择性并保持催化剂的稳定性。关键方法包括添加一个或多个主族元素或过渡金属（TM），如Sn、In、Cu和Ga。这些添加剂有助于减少形成焦炭的趋势，并提高催化剂的稳定性。此外，小型Pt簇的表面积导致较高的焦炭速率，因为较大的表面积促进了更快的焦炭形成，导致催化剂更快地失活。通过向催化剂中引入元素如Sn，可以降低丙烯脱附的能量壁垒，同时增加丙烯脱氢化过程的能量壁垒，从而改善催化剂的选择性和稳定性。
