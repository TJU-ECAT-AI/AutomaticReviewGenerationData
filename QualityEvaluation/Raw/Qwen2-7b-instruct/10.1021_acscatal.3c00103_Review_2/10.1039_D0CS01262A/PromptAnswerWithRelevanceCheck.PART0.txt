The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering.
Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations.
The study revealed that the oxygen vacancy enhanced the CH activation of methane.
CeO2 is an efficient support that can play an essential role in the DRM process.

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve strategic modifications to catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization. Key strategies include:

1. **Optimizing Metal Composition**: The use of alkali metal additives, such as potassium, can improve propylene selectivity in propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts. These additives modify the acid-base properties of the catalysts, influencing their selectivity.

2. **Tailoring Cluster Size and Valence State**: The ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites plays a crucial role in catalyst design, impacting the balance between activity and selectivity. Sub-monolayer VOx clusters can provide a high propylene yield, balancing the trade-off between these properties.

3. **Understanding Catalytic Mechanisms**: Recent studies have delineated the division of PDH reactions into two distinct periods, with VO species acting as key active sites during different stages of the reaction. This insight aids in the rational design of catalysts that optimize selectivity.

4. **Leveraging Surface Chemistry**: The surface chemistry of metal oxides, including the participation of lattice oxygens in CH bond activation, has been elucidated through studies on materials like Mo3O9. This knowledge guides the selection of active sites for efficient reactions.

5. **Exploring Single Atom Catalysis**: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer unique properties that differ from those of supported metal clusters. Research focuses on synthesizing thermally stable SACs, particularly by exploiting strong metal-support interactions to prevent sintering and maintain single atom integrity.

6. **Tailoring Support Materials**: The choice of support materials is critical in anchoring single metal atoms effectively. Theoretical calculations consider the compatibility and interaction between single atoms and supports to optimize catalytic performance.

7. **Universal Scaling Relationships**: A comprehensive understanding of the CH bond activation across a range of alkanes and catalysts has been achieved through the establishment of universal scaling relationships. This aids in predicting catalyst efficiency and guiding the development of new catalysts.

8. **Addressing the Trade-off Between Activity and Selectivity**: There is a fundamental constraint linking CH bond activation, olefin desorption, and deep CH bond activation. Strategies that break this relation, such as alloying Pt with another metal or implementing core-shell structures, aim to enhance catalytic performance while maintaining selectivity and stability.

These advancements collectively address the multifaceted challenges in catalyst design, offering promising avenues for optimizing performance in industrial applications.

To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports.
This is due to the weakened binding strength of propylene and the higher energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Pt(111).
The d-band center of Pt(111) is located at 1.97 eV relative to the Fermi level, whereas that of Pt3Ti(111) downshifts to 2.37 eV due to the strong PtTi dd orbital coupling, giving rise to weaker adsorption of reaction intermediates and changes in the relative free energy and barriers of the reaction steps during dehydrogenation and side reactions.
This indicates that Pt3Ti has higher selectivity toward propylene for PDH compared to pure Pt.
The lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy corresponds to a higher oxygen activity.
The formation energy of the oxygen vacancy can therefore be used as a descriptor when searching for new catalysts for ODH of propane.

Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of the catalysts. These modifications involve controlling the size and shape of nanoparticles, alloying with transition metals or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate supports. For instance, by alloying platinum (Pt) with titanium (Ti), the electronic properties of the catalyst can be altered, leading to changes in the adsorption of reaction intermediates and the relative free energy barriers during dehydrogenation and side reactions. This modification can lead to a higher selectivity toward propylene. Additionally, the formation energy of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface is a key descriptor for catalytic activity. Catalysts with lower formation energy of oxygen vacancies exhibit higher activity, making them suitable for oxygen dehydrogenation of propane.

The purpose of this review is to describe the recent progress in computational catalysis that has addressed the CH bond activation of light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane by heterogeneous transition metal, oxide, and metal/oxide catalysts, with emphasis on activity, selectivity and coke formation in light alkane conversion.
Despite the great challenges, significant progress has been made in the direct conversion of methane to chemicals, especially in the production of hydrocarbons, such as olefins and aromatics.
The differences between the three processes are based on the oxidant used, the energetics and kinetics of the reaction, and the synthesis gas produced with different H2/CO ratios.
For group 810 metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, and Ir), the DFT calculated activation barriers of O*-assisted CH4 dissociation were much higher than those of OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation, both higher than those of direct CH4 dissociation.
The Pt(111) surface is an exception, where the activation barrier for OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation was lower than those for the direct dissociation and the O*-assisted route.
The microkinetic modeling of steam and dry reforming by Maestri et al.83 predicted that the direct dissociation of the CH bond was the main pathway of methane activation on Rh catalyst.
The activity was therefore considered to depend on the surface structure of the NPs, and the under-coordination sites (edges, kinks, and defects) were expected to be the active sites for SRM because of the larger fraction of under-coordinated surface sites exposed on small particles than larger particles.

Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period.
The rate of propane ODH reaction is proportional to C3H8 partial pressure and independent of O2 partial pressure in the limit of very low H2O concentrations, and therefore propane activation is a kinetically relevant step.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.
However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations.
Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst.
Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts.
On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.

These advancements focus on the rational design of catalysts with improved selectivity, the optimization of cluster size and valence state, and the incorporation of alkali metal additives.
Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts.
The effect of alkali metal additives is explained by a modification of the acid-base properties of the catalysts.
On VOx/SiO2 catalysts, the potassium additive by blocking active centers on the catalyst surface exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion.
This leads to high initial selectivity (95%) for propylene formation.
In addition to alkali metal additives, efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of different O sites for propane ODH on supported VOx catalysts.
The incorporation of alkali metal additives modifies the acid-base properties of the catalysts, enhancing propylene selectivity.
The optimization of cluster size and valence state also plays a crucial role in maintaining high activity and selectivity.
Polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio can lower the propylene selectivity.
Small cluster VOx with a low VO ratio could increase the propylene selectivity at the expense of lowering the activity.

The addition of one or more main-group metals or TMs, such as Sn, In, Cu, and Ga, is also an effective way to reduce the tendency to form coke.
The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation.
The introduction of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation.

To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent strategies focus on reducing the selectivity to byproducts and maintaining the catalyst's stability. Key approaches include the addition of one or more main-group metals or transition metals (TMs) such as Sn, In, Cu, and Ga. These additives help in reducing the tendency to form coke and improve the stability of the catalyst. Additionally, the surface area of small Pt clusters contributes to a higher coking rate, as the larger surface area facilitates faster coke formation, leading to quicker deactivation of the catalyst. By introducing elements like Sn into the catalyst, the energy barrier for propylene desorption can be reduced, while simultaneously increasing the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation, thus improving the selectivity and stability of the catalyst.

The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering.
The DFT studies of Rodriguez and coworkers194,197,198 indicated that the effective barrier of methane activation decreased from 0.9 eV over a Ni(111) surface to only 0.15 eV over a Ni/CeO2x(111) surface (Fig. 15).
Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations.
CeO2 is an efficient support that can play an essential role in the DRM process.
The Ni/Co cation on CeO2 shows a much lower activity for CH activation of methane compared to the Ni/Co cation on reduced CeO2 (Ce2O3).
The strong interactions enhanced the Ni reactivity for methane dissociation and probably prevented carbon deposition and deactivation during DRM.
In contrast, single-site Ni1/Mg(100) was not active for CO2 and CH4 dissociation, while Ni4/MgO(100) enabled the formation of H2, CO, and H2O under DRM reaction, revealed by combined DFT, kMC simulation, and experimental studies.
The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation.
The study revealed that the oxygen vacancy enhanced the CH activation of methane.
The whole catalytic cycle involving the oxygen vacancy was not analyzed.
It is highly desired to analyze the elementary reaction steps at the metaloxide interface in the catalytic cycle to gain a better understanding of the role of the interface in DRM.
The Ni/Al2O3 interface provided the active site for WGS, while all Ni atoms were active for DRM, which was confirmed by the experimental measurements.
They proposed a mechanism that CH4 activation occurred on the Ni surface to form H2 and activated coke precursors. CO2 activation took place at the Ni/La2O3 interface to generate bidentate carbonate.
Moreover, the carbon deposition was inhibited on La2O3 modified Ni(111) because of the lower reaction rate in CH  C + H, compared to that on La modified Ni(111).
The modified catalysts improved the DRM reaction both thermodynamically and kinetically.
The use of supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts can effectively suppress coke formation on Ni surfaces.
Meanwhile, some supports, such as CeO2, promoters such as La2O3, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts such as NiSn and NiFe can improve the metal activity for DRM due to enhanced methane activation.

The ratio of the terminal VO to the other two oxygen sites is a key parameter in the catalyst design.
Small cluster VOx with a low VO ratio could increase the propylene selectivity at the expense of lowering the activity, while polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio could lower the propylene selectivity.
Sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers.
Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period.
The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.
The activation energies for propane primary dehydrogenation and propylene secondary combustion increase as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+), while the corresponding reaction rates decrease.
DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling provide a guideline to manipulate the catalyst surface to reduce the carbon formation by lowering the surface carbon coverage.
The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy.
The alloy of Pt with a second metal and a coreshell structure is an effective way to lower the ethylene and propylene desorption energy and increase the olefin selectivity and lower the coking potential, but at the expense of lower activity.
The single metal or metal clusters on oxides could be explored to break down the constrained relation to enhance the catalytic performance.

Despite the numerous experimental studies devoted to investigating the mechanism of DRM, there are still arguments between different researchers.
Metal dependence of activity Steam reforming of methane is one of the main processes for hydrogen production. To date, many efforts have been devoted to investigating the SRM reaction from both experimental and theoretical points of view.
The difference between the theoretical and experimental results might be caused by some sources of errors both in the modeling and in the experiments.
The activity was therefore considered to depend on the surface structure of the NPs, and the under-coordination sites (edges, kinks, and defects) were expected to be the active sites for SRM because of the larger fraction of under-coordinated surface sites exposed on small particles than larger particles.
The apparent activation energies calculated from the modeling were 1.131.21 eV with the Ni particle size in the range of 8 nm to 12 nm, which was in good agreement with the results measured by experiments, 1.061.17 eV for 812 nm.
The microkinetic analysis results agree with the experimental observation reported in the literature.
It was found that the M(211) surface is most active for Rh, Ni, and Pd catalysts, while for Pt, the M(100) surface is most active.
Ni-based bimetallic catalysts by alloying Ni (the active metal) with another metal (e.g. Au, Ru, Rh, Co, Pt, Ag, Sn) are generally used to reduce methane dissociation and enhance the surface reaction of carbon removal, which could effectively increase catalyst resistance to deactivation and improve catalyst stability.
The addition of Ag into Ni catalysts reduced the catalytic activity towards SRM but enhanced coke formation resistance.
The authors also calculated the TOF based on Gibbs free energy, which was 5.92 s1 at 1023 K for CO2 activation on the support, very close to the experimental value (6.13 s1 at 1023 K), but much higher than that on the Ni surface (4.42 × 106 s1).

Small cluster VOx with a low VO ratio could increase the propylene selectivity at the expense of lowering the activity, while polymeric VOx with a high VO ratio could lower the propylene selectivity.
The cluster size needs to be compromised between the activity and selectivity, and sub-monolayer VOx could provide a high propylene yield, which has been very recently confirmed experimentally by Gong and coworkers.
Over γ-Al2O3 supported VOx, the VO mainly contributes to H2O and CH3CO*CH3 formation and deep oxidation to CO2 in the ODH dominant period. With the consumption of the VO during the reaction, the AlOV sites become dominating active sites for propylene formation.
The dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers.
Liu et al.402 studied PDH on perfect Ga2O3(100) by DFT calculations. The bridge-bound surface O sites are active for cleaving the CH bonds in propane, and thus rather stable OH groups are formed on the surface.
For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced.
On the Ga2O3(100) surface, it is difficult for the H atoms in the OH groups to form H2 or H2O. Since it is also possible to generate gaseous H2O at high temperatures, the reaction would follow an ODH mechanism comprising H2O at the initial stage and follow a PDH mechanism forming H2 at the steady stage.
For the transition state for this elementary step, the electrons are transferred from lattice oxygens to metal centers as an i-propoxide and an OH group from propane.
The kinetics of the PDH reaction over M1V2O3 (M = MnCu, RuAg, and OsAu) were studied by Zhang et al.391 In their model, surface V and O atoms are replaced with single atoms, including M1(Vvac)V2O3(0001) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) and M1(Ovac)V2O3(0001) (M = Pd, Pt, and Au).
The lattice oxygen is the main active site. It significantly adds complexity in DFT modeling, where the activity of oxygen depends on the local structure and coordination as well as oxygen vacancy.

What are the key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, and how do these advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications?

Answer: Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on optimizing the composition, size, and valence state of metal clusters. Key strategies include:

1. **Adjusting Cluster Size and Valence State**: Researchers have found that balancing the cluster size and valence state of metals can improve selectivity while maintaining activity. Smaller clusters with a low ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites can increase propylene selectivity but may lower overall activity. Conversely, larger clusters with a higher VO ratio can lower propylene selectivity. Sub-monolayer VOx layers have been identified as providing a high propylene yield, confirming recent experimental findings.

2. **Modulating Active Sites**: The use of different metal oxides and their surface sites as active centers plays a crucial role in enhancing stability. For instance, the terminal VO sites on V2O5 are active for acetone formation, while the VO support is the main site for propylene formation. The ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites affects the catalyst's performance.

3. **Valence State Dependence**: The valence state of metals significantly influences the catalytic activity, especially in processes involving oxygen. Oxygen vacancies in the catalyst structure can alter the electronic structure of active species, affecting reaction mechanisms. The presence of lattice oxygen is essential for the initial stages of propane dehydrogenation, facilitating the formation of desired products like propylene.

4. **Reaction Mechanism Optimization**: Understanding and optimizing the reaction pathways, particularly the rate-determining step (RDS), helps in enhancing the efficiency of dehydrogenation processes. This includes minimizing unwanted byproducts like CO and CO2 formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation and lower selectivity.

5. **Surface Engineering**: Techniques such as adding alkali metal additives to V-based and Mo-based catalysts can improve propylene selectivity by modifying the acid-base properties of the catalysts. Blocking active centers on the catalyst surface with additives like potassium can inhibit consecutive propylene and parallel propane combustion, leading to high initial selectivity.

6. **Metal Oxide Selection**: Different types of catalysts, such as Cr-based, Ga-based, Mo-based catalysts, and mixed metal oxides, have been studied. While these catalysts allow for redox mechanisms without structural collapse, the complexity of metal oxides requires careful consideration of their crystal structures, oxidation states, and surface facets.

7. **Single Atom Catalysts (SACs)**: SACs offer distinct properties from supported nanoclusters and provide opportunities to establish structure-reactivity relationships. Strategies like strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) to prevent sintering on the surface, or the use of single atoms on metal oxides, can enhance catalytic performance and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and activity, while also considering the practical aspects of scale-up and industrial application. The integration of theoretical models, computational simulations, and experimental validation is crucial for the rational design and optimization of catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes.
