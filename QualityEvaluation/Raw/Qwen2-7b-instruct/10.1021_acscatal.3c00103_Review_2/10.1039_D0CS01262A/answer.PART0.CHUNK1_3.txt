[1] "The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering."
[2] "The DFT studies of Rodriguez and coworkers194,197,198 indicated that the effective barrier of methane activation decreased from 0.9 eV over a Ni(111) surface to only 0.15 eV over a Ni/CeO2x(111) surface (Fig. 15)."
[3] "Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations."
[4] "CeO2 is an efficient support that can play an essential role in the DRM process."
[5] "The Ni/Co cation on CeO2 shows a much lower activity for CH activation of methane compared to the Ni/Co cation on reduced CeO2 (Ce2O3)."
[6] "The strong interactions enhanced the Ni reactivity for methane dissociation and probably prevented carbon deposition and deactivation during DRM."
[7] "Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations."
[8] "CeO2 is an efficient support that can play an essential role in the DRM process."
[9] "In contrast, single-site Ni1/Mg(100) was not active for CO2 and CH4 dissociation, while Ni4/MgO(100) enabled the formation of H2, CO, and H2O under DRM reaction, revealed by combined DFT, kMC simulation, and experimental studies."
[10] "The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation."
[11] "The study revealed that the oxygen vacancy enhanced the CH activation of methane."
[12] "The whole catalytic cycle involving the oxygen vacancy was not analyzed."
[13] "It is highly desired to analyze the elementary reaction steps at the metaloxide interface in the catalytic cycle to gain a better understanding of the role of the interface in DRM."
[14] "The Ni/Al2O3 interface provided the active site for WGS, while all Ni atoms were active for DRM, which was confirmed by the experimental measurements."
[15] "They proposed a mechanism that CH4 activation occurred on the Ni surface to form H2 and activated coke precursors. CO2 activation took place at the Ni/La2O3 interface to generate bidentate carbonate."
[16] "Moreover, the carbon deposition was inhibited on La2O3 modified Ni(111) because of the lower reaction rate in CH  C + H, compared to that on La modified Ni(111)."
[17] "The modified catalysts improved the DRM reaction both thermodynamically and kinetically."
[18] "The use of supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts can effectively suppress coke formation on Ni surfaces."
[19] "Meanwhile, some supports, such as CeO2, promoters such as La2O3, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts such as NiSn and NiFe can improve the metal activity for DRM due to enhanced methane activation."
