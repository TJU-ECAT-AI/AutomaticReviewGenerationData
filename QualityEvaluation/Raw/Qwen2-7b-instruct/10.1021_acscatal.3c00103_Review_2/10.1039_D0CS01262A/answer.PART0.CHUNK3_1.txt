[1] "Very recently, Xiong and co-workers found that the PDH reaction can be divided into two periods in the VOx reduction by propane: the initial ODH dominant period leading to propylene, water and CO2 formation and the non-ODH dominant period."
[2] "The rate of propane ODH reaction is proportional to C3H8 partial pressure and independent of O2 partial pressure in the limit of very low H2O concentrations, and therefore propane activation is a kinetically relevant step."
[3] "For the propane ODH reaction over VOx involving the participation of the O2 molecule, the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface can be reduced."
[4] "However, the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations."
[5] "Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the activity of the different O sites for propane ODH of the supported VOx catalyst."
[6] "Alkali metal additives have been found to improve the propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts."
[7] "On V2O5 powders and supported VOx, the dependencies of reaction rates on C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical, indicating that both surfaces have similar active centers."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Dividing the PDH reaction into two periods to better understand the mechanism and optimize the process.
2. Focusing on the rate-determining step of propane ODH, which is the activation of propane, and optimizing the conditions for this step.
3. Reducing the energy barriers for H2O elimination on the surface of VOx catalysts to facilitate the ODH process.
4. Considering the complex interplay between the partial pressures of propane (C3H8), oxygen (O2), and water (H2O) on the catalyst surface, especially at higher concentrations of H2O.
5. Enhancing the activity of the different O sites on the supported VOx catalyst through the addition of alkali metal additives.
6. Improving propylene selectivity by modifying the acid-base properties of V-based and Mo-based catalysts.
7. Ensuring that both surfaces of the catalyst have similar active centers by maintaining consistent dependencies on the concentrations of reactants.

These advancements aim to address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on specific reaction steps, reducing energy barriers, enhancing selectivity, and ensuring uniform active sites across the catalyst surface.
