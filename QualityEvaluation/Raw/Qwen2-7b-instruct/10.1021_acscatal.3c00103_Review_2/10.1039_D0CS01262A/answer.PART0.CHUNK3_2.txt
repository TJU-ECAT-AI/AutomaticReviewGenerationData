The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Rational design of catalysts with improved selectivity.
2. Optimization of cluster size and valence state.
3. Incorporation of alkali metal additives to modify the acid-base properties of the catalysts.

These advancements specifically address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. Alkali metal additives have been found to improve propylene selectivity for propane ODH on V-based and Mo-based catalysts. The effect of these additives involves modifying the acid-base properties of the catalysts, leading to high initial selectivity for propylene formation. Additionally, optimizing cluster size and valence state helps maintain high activity and selectivity, with polymeric VOx exhibiting lower propylene selectivity and small cluster VOx increasing selectivity at the cost of activity.

最近开发的增强支持金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 合理设计具有更高选择性的催化剂。
2. 集群大小和电荷状态的优化。
3. 添加碱金属添加剂以修改催化剂的酸碱性质。

这些进步特别解决了催化剂设计、制造和工业应用性能优化的挑战。发现碱金属添加剂可以提高V基和Mo基催化剂上丙烷脱氢化过程中丙烯的选择性。这些添加剂的作用是通过修改催化剂的酸碱性质，导致高初始丙烯选择性形成。此外，优化集群大小和电荷状态有助于保持高活性和选择性，聚态VOx表现出较低的丙烯选择性，而小规模的VOx增加了选择性，但牺牲了活性。
