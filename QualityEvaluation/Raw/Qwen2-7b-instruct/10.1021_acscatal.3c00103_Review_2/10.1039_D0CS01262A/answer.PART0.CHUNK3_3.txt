Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the ratio of terminal VO sites to other oxygen sites, utilizing small clusters with a low VO ratio for increased propylene selectivity, and exploring sub-monolayer VOx for high propylene yields. Catalyst design focuses on manipulating the surface to reduce carbon formation by lowering surface carbon coverage. The lattice oxygen acts as the main active site, and its activity is influenced by local structure, coordination, and oxygen vacancy. Alloying Pt with another metal or employing a core-shell structure can lower ethylene and propylene desorption energy, increasing olefin selectivity and reducing coking potential, albeit at the expense of activity. Investigating single metals or metal clusters on oxides aims to break the relationship between activity and selectivity to enhance catalytic performance. The use of DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling provides insights into optimizing catalyst performance, and integrating these computational methods with experimental studies accelerates the development of next-generation catalysts for alkane conversion.
