[1] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts,2,371,372 such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

[2] "The introduction of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation (see Fig. 31b)."

[3] "The lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy corresponds to a higher oxygen activity. Likewise, the TiO2 support lowered the formation energy of oxygen vacancy, thus increasing the activity."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve modifying the geometrical and electronic structures of the catalysts. These modifications include controlling the size and shape of nanoparticles, alloying with transition metals or main-group elements, and choosing appropriate supports. For instance, the addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) catalysts can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption while simultaneously increasing the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation. Additionally, reducing the formation energy of oxygen vacancies on the surface of metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), can increase the activity of the catalysts. This is because the lower formation energy corresponds to a higher oxygen activity.

近期，通过改变催化剂的几何结构和电子性质来提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的稳定性。这些策略包括控制纳米颗粒的大小和形状、合金化过渡金属或主族元素以及选择合适的支撑物。例如，向铂（Pt）催化剂中添加锡（Sn）可以降低丙烯脱吸的能量壁垒，同时增加丙烯脱氢的活化能。此外，降低金属氧化物表面（如二氧化钛（TiO2））上氧空位的形成能可以提高催化剂的活性。这是因为更低的形成能对应着更高的氧活性。
