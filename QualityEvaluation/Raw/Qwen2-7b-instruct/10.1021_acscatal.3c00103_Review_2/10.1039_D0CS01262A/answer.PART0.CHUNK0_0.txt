[1] "The purpose of this review is to describe the recent progress in computational catalysis that has addressed the CH bond activation of light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane by heterogeneous transition metal, oxide, and metal/oxide catalysts, with emphasis on activity, selectivity and coke formation in light alkane conversion."
[2] "Despite the great challenges, significant progress has been made in the direct conversion of methane to chemicals, especially in the production of hydrocarbons, such as olefins and aromatics."
[3] "The differences between the three processes are based on the oxidant used, the energetics and kinetics of the reaction, and the synthesis gas produced with different H2/CO ratios."
[4] "For group 810 metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, and Ir), the DFT calculated activation barriers of O*-assisted CH4 dissociation were much higher than those of OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation, both higher than those of direct CH4 dissociation."
[5] "The Pt(111) surface is an exception, where the activation barrier for OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation was lower than those for the direct dissociation and the O*-assisted route."
[6] "The microkinetic modeling of steam and dry reforming by Maestri et al.83 predicted that the direct dissociation of the CH bond was the main pathway of methane activation on Rh catalyst."
[7] "The activity was therefore considered to depend on the surface structure of the NPs, and the under-coordination sites (edges, kinks, and defects) were expected to be the active sites for SRM because of the larger fraction of under-coordinated surface sites exposed on small particles than larger particles."

1. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advancements in computational catalysis that focus on the activation of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds in light alkanes, including methane, ethane, and propane, using heterogeneous catalysts like transition metals, oxides, and metal-oxide hybrids. The review emphasizes understanding the activity, selectivity, and coke formation in the conversion of light alkanes.

2. Despite facing significant challenges, substantial progress has been achieved in directly converting methane into various chemicals, particularly hydrocarbons like olefins and aromatics.

3. The differences among the three indirect conversion processes of methane—steam reforming (SRM), dry reforming (DRM), and partial oxidation (POM)—are rooted in the oxidant utilized, the energetics and kinetics of the reactions, and the synthesis gas produced with varying hydrogen-to-carbon dioxide ratios.

4. For group 810 metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, and Ir), the direct CH bond activation via methane dissociation had lower activation barriers compared to O*-assisted and OH*-assisted pathways.

5. The Pt(111) surface uniquely showed a lower activation barrier for OH*-assisted CH4 dissociation compared to direct dissociation and O*-assisted routes.

6. The microkinetic modeling by Maestri et al. predicted that the direct dissociation of the CH bond was the primary pathway for methane activation on Rh catalysts.

7. The activity of the reforming process was attributed to the surface structure of nanoparticles, with under-coordinated sites like edges, kinks, and defects expected to serve as active sites due to their higher exposure on smaller particles compared to larger ones.

1. 本综述旨在描述计算催化领域中关于轻烷烃（如甲烷、乙烷和丙烷）中碳-氢（CH）键激活的最新进展，重点是使用过渡金属、氧化物和金属/氧化物催化剂。综述强调了在轻烷烃转化中的活性、选择性和焦炭形成。

2. 尽管面临重大挑战，但在直接将甲烷转化为各种化学品，特别是烷烃衍生物如烯烃和芳香烃方面取得了显著进步。

3. 三种间接的甲烷转化过程——蒸汽重整（SRM）、干重整（DRM）和部分氧化（POM）之间的差异在于使用的氧化剂、反应的能学和动力学以及不同氢/二氧化碳比下产生的合成气。

4. 对于组810金属（Ru、Rh、Pd、Os和Ir），通过直接甲烷分解进行的CH键激活的活化能低于O*-辅助和OH*-辅助途径。

5. Pt(111)表面独特地显示了OH*-辅助CH4分解的活化能低于直接分解和O*-辅助路径。

6. Maestri等人通过微动力学建模预测，Rh催化剂上甲烷激活的主要途径为直接分解。

7. 重整过程的活性归因于纳米颗粒的表面结构，边缘、尖角和缺陷等未协调的表面站点由于在较小颗粒中暴露率更高而被认为是活性位点，这与较大的颗粒相比。
