[1] "The differences between the three processes are based on the oxidant used, the energetics and kinetics of the reaction, and the synthesis gas produced with different H2/CO ratios."
[2] "However, despite the great challenges, significant progress has been made in the direct conversion of methane to chemicals, especially in the production of hydrocarbons, such as olefins and aromatics."
[3] "For these metals, most studies demonstrated an activity trend of Ru, Rh > Ni, Ir > Pt, Pd > Co, Fe with a temperature range of 6731173 K and atmospheric pressure."
[4] "It was found that for temperatures above 1100 K there is no possibility of carbon formation for the steam-to-methane ratios above unity."
[5] "It was suggested that the addition of Ag into Ni catalysts reduced the catalytic activity towards SRM but enhanced coke formation resistance."

1. The differences between the three indirect processes of methane conversion are determined by the oxidant used, the reaction's energetics and kinetics, and the synthesis gas's H2/CO ratio.

2. Significant advancements have been made in directly converting methane into chemicals, particularly in producing hydrocarbons like olefins and aromatics.

3. The activity trend for these metals in steam reforming of methane is Ru, Rh > Ni, Ir > Pt, Pd > Co, Fe, at a temperature range of 6731173 K and atmospheric pressure.

4. For temperatures above 1100 K, there is no chance of carbon formation when the steam-to-methane ratio is greater than unity.

5. Adding silver to Ni catalysts decreases its activity in steam reforming but boosts its capability to resist coke formation.

1. 这三个间接转化甲烷的过程差异取决于使用的氧化剂、反应的能量和动力学以及合成气的H2/CO比。

2. 已在直接将甲烷转化为化学品方面取得了显著进展，特别是生产如烯烃和芳香烃等的碳氢化合物。

3. 在673至1173 K的温度范围内和大气压条件下，这些金属在蒸汽重整甲烷中的活性趋势为Ru, Rh > Ni, Ir > Pt, Pd > Co, Fe。

4. 当蒸汽与甲烷的比例大于1时，如果温度高于1100 K，则没有可能形成碳。

5. 向Ni催化剂中添加银降低了其在蒸汽重整过程中的活性，但增强了其抵抗结焦的能力。
