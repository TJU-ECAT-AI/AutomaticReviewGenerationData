[1] "Strong adsorption of propylene means that the surface-adsorbed propylene molecule prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to the deep dehydrogenation and cracking of the subsequent C3 derivatives. The formation of ethane, methane, and coke would lower selectivity to propylene."
[2] "The higher coking rate on small Pt clusters is due to the larger Pt surface area, and the faster coke formation resulted in faster deactivation."
[3] "The introduction of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation."
[4] "The lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy corresponds to a higher oxygen activity."
[5] "The first CH bond activation has a lower activation barrier than the secondary CH activation on the supported V2O5, while both CH bond activations have similar energy barriers on the supported VO3."

1. The strong adsorption of propylene on the surface catalyst leads to deeper dehydrogenation and cracking of subsequent C3 derivatives, which in turn results in the formation of ethane, methane, and coke, thereby reducing the selectivity towards propylene.
2. The higher rate of coke formation on smaller Pt clusters is attributed to the increased surface area of the clusters, leading to faster coke formation and catalyst deactivation.
3. The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption while simultaneously increasing the activation energy required for propylene dehydrogenation.
4. The oxygen vacancy with a lower formation energy exhibits a higher activity, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane.
5. The first CH bond activation displays a lower activation barrier than the secondary CH activation on supported vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), whereas both activation steps have similar energy barriers on supported vanadyl oxide (VO3).

1. 强大的丙烯吸附会导致随后的C3衍生物更深层次的脱氢和裂解，从而形成乙烷、甲烷和焦炭，这会降低丙烯的选择性。
2. 小型铂簇的较高焦炭生成速率归因于较大的铂表面面积，导致更快的焦炭形成和催化剂失活。
3. 锡（Sn）的引入可以降低丙烯脱吸附的能量壁垒，同时提高丙烯脱氢化所需的激活能量。
4. 形成能量较低的氧空位表现出更高的活性，这对于丙烷的脱氢至关重要。
5. 在支持的钒五氧化物（V2O5）上，首次CH键激活显示了更低的激活壁垒，而两个激活步骤在支持的钒氧基（VO3）上的能量壁垒相似。
