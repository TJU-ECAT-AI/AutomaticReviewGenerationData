[1] "The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering."
[2] "Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations."
[3] "The Ni/Co cation on CeO2 shows a much lower activity for CH activation of methane compared to the Ni/Co cation on reduced CeO2 (Ce2O3)."
[4] "CeO2 is an efficient support that can play an essential role in the DRM process."
[5] "In contrast, single-site Ni1/Mg(100) was not active for CO2 and CH4 dissociation, while Ni4/MgO(100) enabled the formation of H2, CO, and H2O under DRM reaction, revealed by combined DFT, kMC simulation, and experimental studies."
[6] "The study revealed that the oxygen vacancy enhanced the CH activation of methane."
[7] "The Ni cluster provided the active sites, and MgO offered the Mgvac as an anchor for Ni clusters to prevent Ni aggregation."
[8] "In the presence of both CH4 and O2 at a stoichiometric feed ratio, the major reaction pathways were the direct formation of H2 and CO followed by their consecutive oxidation."
[9] "Based on the study, a Marsvan Krevelen (MVK) redox cycle221 was postulated for POM over Pt: the methane oxidation was accompanied by the reduction of platinum oxide, which was re-oxidized via incorporation of dioxygen into the catalyst."
[10] "The calculation also indicated that gas-phase CO could easily combine with O* to form CO2. The CO2 selectivity was, therefore, dependent on the amount of adsorbed O* present on the surface."
[11] "The relative order of carbon formation was observed as Ni > Pd  Rh, Ru, Ir, Pt, reported by Claridge and Battle et al.48,229"
[12] "The activation barriers of CH4 dissociation were largely reduced by the introduction of a single Pt atom on the Cu(111) surface."
[13] "The activation energies of the first and second CH bond cleavage steps for ethylene formation were calculated as Pt(111) < Pt3Sn(111) (bulk alloy) < Pt3Sn/Pt(111) (surface alloy) < PtSn/Pt(111) (surface alloy)."
[14] "Smaller HOMOLUMO gaps indicated higher activity due to the increased flexibility of the valence electron at the active site."
[15] "The selectivity descriptor was calculated as 0.12, 0.04, and +0.36 eV for Pt, the bulk alloy, and the surface alloy, respectively."
