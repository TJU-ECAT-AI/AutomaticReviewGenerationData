[1] "The experimental and computational studies of Akri et al. revealed that Ni atomically dispersed over Ce-doped hydroxyapatite (HAP-Ce) was highly active and intrinsically coke-resistant due to strong metalsupport interactions, which favor only the first CH bond activation in methane and stabilize Ni single atoms towards sintering."
[2] "The DFT studies of Rodriguez and coworkers194,197,198 indicated that the effective barrier of methane activation decreased from 0.9 eV over a Ni(111) surface to only 0.15 eV over a Ni/CeO2x(111) surface (Fig. 15)."
[3] "Moreover, a decrease in the barrier of the first CH bond activation of methane from 1.07 eV over the Co(0001) surface to 0.87 eV over the Co2+/CeO2(111) surface, and to only 0.05 eV over the Co0/CeO2x(111) surface, was obtained by Liu et al.198 through DFT calculations."

[11] "CO2 dissociation was observed to take place on the oxide surface at 700 K, under DRM conditions, and no coke deposition was found in the catalytic cycle."
[12] "In contrast, single-site Ni1/Mg(100) was not active for CO2 and CH4 dissociation, while Ni4/MgO(100) enabled the formation of H2, CO, and H2O under DRM reaction, revealed by combined DFT, kMC simulation, and experimental studies."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the strategic use of supports, promoters, and Ni-based bimetallic catalysts. Key strategies include:

1. **Supports**: Materials like CeO2, which can play an essential role in the direct methane reforming (DRM) process. CeO2 supports offer strong interactions with metals, enhancing their reactivity and stability by stabilizing single metal atoms and reducing the risk of sintering.

2. **Promoters**: Elements such as La2O3, which when added to Ni surfaces, improve the metal activity for DRM by modifying the electronic or chemical properties of Ni, thus enhancing its reactivity and stability against coke formation.

3. **Bimetallic Catalysts**: Combinations like NiSn and NiFe have been found to favor methane dissociation and reduce coke formation compared to pure Ni catalysts. The synergistic effects of these bimetallic systems improve the overall catalytic activity and stability.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing more active sites, enhancing stability against sintering and coke formation, and improving the selectivity towards desired products. By leveraging the unique properties of supports, promoters, and bimetallic components, these advancements pave the way for more efficient and sustainable direct dehydrogenation processes suitable for industrial applications.

最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发出了一些关键策略和技术。主要策略包括：

1. **支持材料**：例如CeO2，它在直接甲烷重整（DRM）过程中扮演着重要角色。CeO2支持可以与金属形成强烈的相互作用，通过稳定单个金属原子并降低聚集风险来增强它们的活性和稳定性。

2. **促进剂**：例如La2O3，当添加到Ni表面时，它可以提高金属的活性，通过修改Ni的电子或化学性质，从而增强其活性并减少焦炭生成的风险。

3. **双金属催化剂**：例如NiSn和NiFe，这些组合物已被发现能够促进甲烷解离并减少焦炭形成，相比于纯Ni催化剂。这些双金属体系的协同效应提高了整体催化活性和稳定性。

这些策略通过提供更多的活性位点、增强对抗聚集和焦炭生成的稳定性以及提高对目标产物的选择性，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。通过利用支持材料、促进剂和双金属组件的独特属性，这些进步为更高效、更具可持续性的直接脱氢过程铺平了道路，适用于工业应用。
