The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include advanced synthesis methods, surface engineering techniques, and site isolation. By carefully controlling the synthesis conditions, it is possible to tailor the morphology, size, and composition of the supported nanoparticles, optimizing their catalytic properties. Site isolation, which confines metal atoms within the support material, prevents sintering and maintains high activity over multiple reaction cycles. Incorporating ligands or other modifiers onto the metal surface enhances the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. These advancements have led to significant improvements in the efficiency and longevity of industrial dehydrogenation processes.
