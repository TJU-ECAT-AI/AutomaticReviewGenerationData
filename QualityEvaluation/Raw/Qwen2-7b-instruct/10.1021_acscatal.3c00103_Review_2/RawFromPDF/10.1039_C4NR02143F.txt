Abstract
This paper describes an investigation of the promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. We have shown that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts possess higher propylene selectivity and lower deactivation rate as well as enhanced anti-coking ability upon Cu addition. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which is confirmed by the change of particle morphology and atomic electronic environment of the catalyst. The Pt–Cu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of C–C bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on Pt–Cu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for C–C bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation.
1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry for the production of various chemicals,1,2 such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil.3 However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves4 has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production. Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives.5,6 The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive. Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process.3 However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene.2,6 Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation.7 Hence, it is of great significance to develop catalytic materials with high propylene selectivity and excellent anti-coking ability, as well as high propane conversion.
Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability,3,4,8 but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability,2,7,9 and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts. However, many problems of Pt, such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation10,11 and low propylene selectivity resulted from the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via C–C bond cleavage,12,13 constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic efficiency of Pt catalysts.
Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn,2,7,12,14 La,11,15 Ga16 and Zn17 species has been reported to be effective. Zhang et al.7 studied a Pt–Sn/ZSM-5 catalyst and inferred that Sn could change the interfacial characteristics between the Pt metal and the ZSM-5 support, which facilitated the desorption of carbon deposits from metal clusters to the carrier, resulting in improved stability. An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al.17 The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of Pt–Zn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also been employed to understand the effect of promoters on the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst for PDH. Yang et al.18 demonstrated that the introduction of Sn lowered the desorption barrier for propylene on the metal surface and reduced the possibility of subsequent reactions generating coke deposits. Particularly, the C–C bond rupture was kinetically hindered as the deposition of Sn on Pt increased the energy barrier of C–C bond cleavage. Notably, copper has been widely adopted as a promoter in dehydrogenation,19,20 which can suppress the formation of coke and lighter hydrocarbon. Veldurthi et al.19 investigated copper-modified Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, which showed enhanced n-butane conversion, catalyst stability, as well as C4 olefin selectivity. Pt–Cu catalysts were also studied in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes20 and presented high alkane conversion with improved selectivity towards alkenes. These investigations motivate us to examine the influence of Cu addition on the catalytic performance and stability of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.
In this work, Pt–Cu/Al2O3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy of CO and propylene adsorption (CO-IR and C3H6-IR) to understand the interaction between Cu addition and the active sites of Pt. The amount and chemical composition of the formed coke were investigated via thermogravimetric (TG) and temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), which further explained the impact of copper on coke deposit. In addition to the experimental results, the superior catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of Pt–Cu/Al2O3 were theoretically explained according to the literature. The addition of d-orbital filled Cu resulted in a weakened interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules as well as a higher energy barrier for C–C rupture, since the Cu addition altered the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
H2PtCl6·6H2O (Tianjin Kaiyingte chemical trade Co., Ltd, 99.9%) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 99.5%) were used as metal precursors. A γ-Al2O3 support (Sinopharm chemical Reagent Co.) was pretreated at 700 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. The monometallic catalysts (e.g., Pt/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3) were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C in the muffle furnace for 4 h. For Pt–Cu/Al2O3, the support of γ-Al2O3 was firstly impregnated with a solution of Cu(NO3)2, followed by a solution of H2PtCl6. After each impregnation step, the catalysts were dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C in the muffle furnace for 4 h.
A series of catalysts with different loadings were synthesized and denoted as Pt–Cux/Al2O3, where x represents the mass loading of Cu. Mass loading of Pt was set at 0.5 wt% for these catalysts (i.e., Pt–Cu0.5/Al2O3).
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained with a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 analyzer at −196 °C. Prior to the experiments, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 4 h. The specific surface area of the samples was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.21 The cumulative pore volume and pore size were calculated from the desorption branches of the isotherms employing the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Dispersion of the catalysts was studied by H2 chemisorption. For fresh catalysts, 200 mg of samples were pre-reduced with 10 vol% H2/Ar at 550 °C for 2 h and then flushed with Ar at 550 °C for 0.5 h. Spent catalysts were pretreated with Ar at 200 °C for 1 h. H2 chemisorption was carried out at 50 °C by injecting pulses of 10 vol% H2/Ar every 5 min until the consumption peaks became stable. The metal dispersion is calculated using the following equations:
where VH2 is the volume of the adsorbed H2 (ml), SF is the stoichiometry factor, MW is the atomic weight of the Pt (g mol−1), and WPt is the weight of supported Pt on the sample (g).
TEM images were acquired using a JEOL-2100F microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The fresh catalysts were pre-reduced at 550 °C in a flow of 10 vol% H2/N2 for 2 h. The samples were dispersed in ethanol and dropped on carbon-film coated copper grids.
Raman spectra were obtained at room temperature under ambient conditions using a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm Ar-ion laser beam. Data acquisition was conducted with an exposure time of 10 s and 1 accumulation.
Adsorption spectroscopies of IR were attained using a Nicolet Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrometer. The samples (20 mg) were pressed into flakes and placed in an in situ chamber. The samples were reduced at 550 °C under a flow of 10 vol% H2–Ar (30 ml min−1) and then cooled to ambient temperature. CO or propylene was then introduced into the cell for 30 min. The system was then evacuated for data collection of chemisorbed CO or propylene.
TPO experiments were carried out with a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 chemisorption analyzer connected with an online mass spectrometer (QIC 20, Hiden). The spent catalysts were pretreated at 100 °C for 0.5 h in an Ar environment. The samples were then heated from 100 to 900 °C in a flow of air (20 ml min−1) with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min−1.
TG measurements were carried out with a Netzsch STA449F3 thermal analyzer to investigate the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst. The spent catalysts were dried in situ at 100 °C for 0.5 h before experiments. The TG curves were recorded from 50 to 900 °C in a flow of air (50 ml min−1) with a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.3. Activity test
The PDH reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure and 600 °C in a continuous fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was maintained at 3 h−1. The premixed reactant mixture with fixed compositions of propane, hydrogen, and nitrogen was introduced into the reactor using mass flow controllers (D07-19B, Sevenstar). The flow ratio of propane and hydrogen was 1 : 1 and the total flow was balanced to 50 ml min−1 by nitrogen. Prior to reaction, catalyst samples were reduced under flowing 10 vol% H2–N2 (50 ml min−1) at 550 °C for 2 h. The composition of the product gas was continuously monitored with an online gas chromatograph, equipped with a flame ionization detector (Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity detector (Al2O3 Plot column).
2.4. Analytical method
Conversion, selectivity3 and the deactivation parameter17 were calculated using the following equations:
Propane Conversion:
Selectivity of Product:
Deactivation parameter:
where i represents hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas stream, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the corresponding flow rate. The deactivation parameter,17 calculated from the drop in conversion of propane during the reaction, is introduced to quantify the deactivation rate of different catalysts for better comparison of catalyst stability.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performances
The catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with different copper contents is shown in Fig. 1. Generally, relatively high propane conversions of 42–52% are observed over the catalysts at the very beginning of the reaction, which then decays significantly with time-on-stream. To make a clear comparison on the stability of the catalyst, the deactivation parameter D17 is adopted in this work to quantify the deactivation rate. The D values for Pt/Al2O3, Pt–Cu0.25/Al2O3, Pt–Cu0.5/Al2O3, and Pt–Cu1.0/Al2O3 catalysts are 23.9, 10.7, 8.6, and 16.6%, respectively. Despite a decrease in the initial propane conversion, the Cu addition in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst clearly suppresses the deactivation rate. An increased selectivity of the catalyst is also observed at the beginning of the reaction and reaches a steady state after 100 min. After 260 min of reaction, the propylene selectivity of Pt/Al2O3, Pt–Cu0.25/Al2O3, Pt–Cu0.5/Al2O3, and Pt–Cu1.0/Al2O3 catalysts is 77.2, 87.7, 90.8, and 87.0%, respectively. The Cu addition results in an enhancement in propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, where Pt–Cu0.5/Al2O3 exhibits the highest propylene selectivity with the lowest deactivation rate. The propylene yield of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 1b. With the increasing copper content, a gradual increase in the propylene yield is presented. But as the copper loading increases to 1.0 wt%, the catalyst undergoes a severe yield loss due to the decrease of propylene selectivity. Apparently, there is an optimal copper content for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (0.5 wt%). Herein, the Pt–Cu0.5/Al2O3 catalyst (denoted as Pt–Cu/Al2O3 afterwards) is chosen to further investigate the role of copper on the catalytic performance of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH.

3.2. Characterization of fresh catalysts
Table 1 summarizes textural properties of the Pt-based catalysts. The γ-Al2O3 support is favorable for PDH because of its relatively high surface area, excellent thermal stability, and appropriate acidity.17,22,23 The impregnation of Pt and Cu causes only a slight decrease in surface area and pore volume of the catalyst. The measurement of metal dispersion by H2 chemisorption shows a high dispersion of 83.6% for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Table 1). The Cu addition causes a decrease of metal dispersion to 65.3%. Consistent with the results of H2 uptakes shown in Table 1, Cu was reported to have a lower H2 adsorption ability owing to its filled 3d electrical orbital,24 resulting in a weak electrical interaction with hydrogen atoms. The Cu addition may cover a fraction of the platinum surface and lower the hydrogen uptake as well as the metal dispersion.25 Additionally, according to the DFT studies by Nykänen et al.26 and Yang et al.,18 the geometric and electronic effects of the bimetallic catalyst could also contribute to the weakened adsorption of hydrogen.

The morphology of the metallic phases in reduced catalysts is revealed by TEM images shown in Fig. 2. Well dispersed metal particles with uniform profiles are observed on the surface of the reduced Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 2a). A high-resolution TEM image of the sample (Fig. 2b) shows a distinct hexagonal profile of the metal particle.27 The structure of Pt can be indexed as an fcc cuboctahedron structure,28 as depicted in the inset of Fig. 2b. The lattice spacing values of 1.94 Å and 2.26 Å correspond to the (100) and (111) planes of platinum, respectively. In Fig. 2c, the lattice spacing of the particle is 2.08 Å, which is assigned to the Cu (111) surface. The difference in the metal particle size between the reduced Pt/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts is also observed from these images. Apparently, the Cu particle shows a larger particle size of approximately 11.3 ± 1.3 nm, whereas the particle size of Pt is measured as 6.0 ± 0.5 nm. In Fig. 2d, the lattice spacing of the metal particle in the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is 2.15 Å, suggesting the formation of alloys with different phase compositions in reduced Pt–Cu/Al2O3. Compared with the d-spacing of possible phases in PDF cards, the lattice spacing of 2.15 Å is assigned to the (111) plane of the Pt–Cu phase. The inset of Fig. 2d illustrates the different structures between Pt–Cu and Pt particles. Additionally, the irregular shape of the metal particle in reduced Pt–Cu/Al2O3, as compared to the hexagonal profiles of Pt particles, indicates the imparity of the crystal structure between these two kinds of metal particles and the incorporation of Cu atoms into the Pt lattice.

To further understand the influence of Cu addition on the surface structure of the Pt catalyst, IR spectroscopy was carried out with CO as the probe molecule (Fig. 3). The adsorption of CO on Pt/Al2O3 shows a sharp peak at 2063 cm−1, which corresponds to the linearly bound CO on the Pt surface.29,30 The linear adsorption peak of the catalyst can be resolved into two peaks. The higher energy band at around 2064 cm−1 is associated with the CO linearly bound to the terraces or planes that are coordinatively saturated,31,32 while the broad band around 2032 cm−1 is assigned to the CO adsorbed at the corners or apex atoms that are coordinatively unsaturated.22,32 Compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Cu addition results in a downward shift of the CO band to 2058 cm−1 with the two resolved peaks shifted to 2059 and 2021 cm−1, while a relatively weak CO adsorption at 2160 cm−1 that can be assigned to CO/Cu bands29,33,34 is also observed in Fig. 3b. The shifting of wavenumber to lower frequencies suggests that the electronic interaction between the CO probe molecule and the metal surface is weakened.17,30 As illustrated by the peak area of CO adsorption in Fig. 3b, the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst also displays a decreased intensity in the adsorption of CO. The bonding between CO and the metal is formed by the electron donation from the CO 5σ orbital to the empty d orbital of the metal, and the back-donation from the filled metal d orbital to the CO 2π* antibonding orbital of the CO molecule.35 The back-donation removes the excess negative charge of metal atoms, thus stabilizing the bond of CO–Pt (Fig. 3c). With its d-orbital filled, Cu is expected to donate electrons to the system, which consequently leads to the downward shift of the C–O stretching frequency.36 Hence, the Cu addition alters the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms and weakens the interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules, resulting in the final downward shift of the CO adsorption band. Similar findings have been reported in previous studies.17,29,30 Indeed, Toolenaar et al.29 investigated the adsorption of CO on the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst and observed the downward shift of the CO/Pt band, which was caused by the geometrical effect altering the interaction between Pt and Cu, consistent with our results.

3.3. Characterization of spent catalysts
TEM images of spent catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 4. The substances with non-uniform structure observed in the images, which shows distinctly different morphologies from the Al2O3 support, can be assigned to coke deposits. The disordered structure of the coke deposits is identical to the feature of amorphous coke. The small increase of the surface area of the spent catalysts also implies the formation of porous substances (Table 1). According to previous studies,27,37 coking formation has been considered as the main reason for catalyst deactivation, since coke could cover the metal surface and diminish the active sites.10,38 H2 chemisorption results have revealed a sharp decrease of metal dispersion for the spent catalysts (Table 1), which indicates a decrease of Pt active sites caused by coke formation,39 corresponding well to the declined catalytic activity with time-on-stream.17

TG spectra of spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The total weight losses of spent Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 are calculated to be 9.4% and 7.8%, respectively. A lower amount of coke deposits on the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is obtained, suggesting a better anti-coking ability. Three weight losses are observed at around 150, 450 and 550 °C, where the second weight loss is the most significant one. Generally, the weight loss of spent catalysts is caused by the burning off of carbon deposits on the catalyst.30 The weight loss temperatures at 450 and 550 °C are typical for coke combustion on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.39,40 The weight loss at 150 °C can be attributed to the combustion of the adsorbed H atoms on catalysts.30
Fig. 5 TG profiles of spent (a) Pt/Al2O3 and (b) Pt–Cu/Al2O3.
To further investigate the nature of the coke components, TPO measurements were carried out (Fig. 6). The amount of hydrogen in each type of coke is partially identified from the H2O signal. The peak of the H2O signal at low temperature is mainly caused by the adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the catalyst,30 which further supports the assignment of the first weight loss in TG spectra. The CO2 signal represents the C amount in coke. Two peaks of the CO2 signal detected in the spectra are attributed to different coke species.10,30 According to a previous study on coke species,10 the two types of coke could be assigned to cokes formed on the metallic centers and the supports.37,39 The temperature locations of the CO2 peak at 450 and 550 °C correlate well with the second and third weight losses in TG, indicating that the weight losses are caused by the combustion of different coke species. Based on the previous study, coke is initially formed on the metal surface and then transferred to the support, followed by further dehydrogenation and condensation reactions on acid sites.10,38 Therefore, a more heavily condensed coke species is expected to be formed on the support, which might be more difficult to remove through combustion as higher oxidation temperature is required.30
Fig. 6 TPO profiles of spent Pt/Al2O3 (solid) and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 (dashed). (a) CO2 signal; (b) H2O signal.
The ratio of H2O to CO2 is used to calculate the composition of the hydrogen content in coke deposits. According to the peak intensity of H2O and CO2, the H/C ratios of spent Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 are calculated to be 1.8 and 2.2, respectively, demonstrating a lighter coke composition in Pt–Cu/Al2O3. According to the results of the integral calculation of H2O and CO2 signals (Fig. 6a), the amount of coke is consistent with TG analysis of both catalysts. Hence, important clues can be obtained from these TPO results for determining the role of Cu in improving the anti-coking ability of the catalyst. A lighter coke composition with a decreased coke amount is detected on the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, which means that Cu addition can suppress coke deposition and further dehydrogenation.30 Indeed, the transformation to a lighter coke composition can facilitate the desorption of coke precursors, which contributes to the decrease of coke formation.7 Meanwhile, a high H/C ratio of about 2 : 1 indicates the aliphatic hydrocarbon composition of the coke,10 which is in accordance with the feature of amorphous coke.
Raman spectra (Fig. 7) of spent Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 were obtained to examine the degree of graphitization of the coke. Five peaks are observed at 1326, 1598, 2630, 2903 and 3193 cm−1. The peaks at around 1326 and 1598 cm−1, marked as D* and G*, are attributed to the C–H bending and CC stretching in aromatic and alkyl hydrocarbon,41 while the three peaks between 2600 and 3200 cm−1 are attributed to the C–H stretching in alkyl hydrocarbons.10,41,42 Based on the results of peak fitting,43,44 the D* and G* can be deconvoluted into four peaks: D, R1, G, and R2. According to an investigation by Kawakami et al.,43 the coke species deposited on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts could be classified as disordered coke since four peaks appeared. The peak intensity ratio of D band to G band is usually used as an important index of the degree of graphitization of carbon materials.10,43,44 The ID/IG values of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 are 2.43 and 2.42, respectively, which indicates the similar graphitization degree of the two coked catalysts. In addition to the inhibition of coke deposition, Cu exhibits a negligible effect on the degree of graphitization of coke. Additionally, the relatively high ID/IG value of about 2.4 demonstrates a high content of hydrogen composition in the coke species,10,43 which is consistent with the TEM and TPO results of the spent catalyst. It should be noted that the increase of the H/C ratio associated with Cu addition is not observed to cause the corresponding change in the degree of graphitization, which is another evidence supporting the formation of a less graphitized coke species on both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. Discussion
The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst.45 The existence of the interaction between Pt and Cu atoms in Pt–Cu/Al2O3 is revealed by the distinct difference of the crystal structure and the morphology of metal particles before and after Cu addition, as shown in the TEM images of the fresh catalysts (Fig. 2). Additionally, CO-IR analysis also implies the existence of a Pt–Cu interaction, since a change of the electronic environment of Pt atoms in Pt–Cu/Al2O3 is verified by the downshift of the CO adsorption band (Fig. 3). Moreover, this Pt–Cu interaction is also supported by the study of Boga et al.,45 where the X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterization proved the existence of a Pt–Cu bimetallic cluster, clearly indicating the existence of a bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu.
The influence of the Pt–Cu interaction on improved propylene selectivity can be explained by the increased energy barrier of C–C bond rupture. As exhibited in Fig. 8, the Cu addition results in a remarkable suppression of methane formation. The predominance of methane formation on Pt/Al2O3 indicates a high catalytic activity towards C–C bond rupture compared to Pt–Cu/Al2O3 (Fig. 9).18,26 Thus, the decreased methane selectivity (Fig. 8) suggests a higher energy barrier for the initial C–C cleavage of Pt–Cu/Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3. This explanation is similar to the research finding of thermal chemistry of propane on Pt (111) and the Pt–Sn metal surface. According to the investigation by Nykänen et al.,26 the C–C and C–H bond rupture was kinetically hindered since the deposition of Sn on Pt could elevate the energy barriers of C–C and C–H bond cleavage. The enrichment of the electron density of Pt by alloying with Sn could weaken the electron interaction between Pt and propane/propylene molecules, resulting in a higher energy barrier for C–C bond cleavage.18 Thus, it is reasonable to expect a similar effect of Cu on Pt/Al2O3 as that of Sn. Additionally, the increased energy barrier of the C–H bond can explain the higher H/C ratio of the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, since further dehydrogenation and pyrolysis reactions via C–H bond cleavage are suppressed. The promotional effect of Cu on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has also exhibited in other dehydrogenation systems. The suppression of cracking reaction of the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst is reported in butane dehydrogenation, which is ascribed to the formation of the Pt–Cu alloy.19

As more direct evidence reveals the relationship between the Pt–Cu interaction and the superior performance of the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst, C3H6-IR was employed to examine the influence of Cu addition on propylene adsorption. The alkene species formed via alkane dehydrogenation has been considered as the origin of coke formation by many studies.9,10,27 The band at 1649 cm−1 is ascribed to ν(CC) of propylene and the band at 1444 cm−1 is assigned to δas(C–H) of methyl (Fig. 10).46 It is obvious that the propylene adsorption is weakened on the metal surface of Pt–Cu/Al2O3 since a lower uptake of propylene is presented (Fig. 10), which suggests that the Cu addition facilitates propylene desorption. Propylene, employed as the electron donors,30 forms the bonding between the propylene molecule and the metal atom by transferring its electron to the empty d orbital of the metal.35 The interaction between d-orbital filled Cu and Pt weakens the electronic interaction between Pt and propylene molecules,36 leading to the consequent weakened propylene adsorption. The facile desorption of propylene from the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation18,26,47,48 and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocarbons (Fig. 9).17,49 The investigation by Cremer et al.50 provided a more detailed transformation process of adsorbed alkenes on the Pt surface, which also supported that the coke was formed via the condensation of alkene species. The adsorbed di-σ-bonded propylene can decompose into propylidyne, which dehydrogenates to generate vinylmethylidyne, followed by further polymerization and dehydrogenation on the metal surface to form carbon deposits.51 Thus, the Pt–Cu interaction increases the propylene selectivity and minimizes coke formation by suppressing the propylene adsorption on the metal. This is consistent with our catalytic test results shown in Fig. 1, since improved catalyst stability and higher propylene selectivity are well exhibited upon Cu addition. The addition of promoters is reported to facilitate propylene desorption in the bimetallic Pt–Zn/Al2O3 catalyst and the metal–metal interaction is recognized as the origin of the enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation.17 This is consistent with the study on the Pt–Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation,52 and also the study on the Pt–Ca/Al2O3 catalyst for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.30

5. Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the effect of Cu on Pt–Cu/Al2O3 for PDH and provided mechanistic explanations for the improved catalytic performance. The introduction of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate. The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which results in a propylene selectivity of 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. The improved anti-coking ability of the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on Pt–Cu/Al2O3. Additionally, the Cu addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for C–C bond cleavage is required on the Pt–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. The primary origin of the enhancement upon Cu addition can be ascribed to the unique Pt–Cu bimetallic interaction.
