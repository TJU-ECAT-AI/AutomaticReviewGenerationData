[1] "Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane (1)."
[2] "For stable performance, traditional alumina-supported platinum-based catalysts require excess tin and feed dilution with hydrogen; however, this reduces per-pass propylene conversion and thus lowers catalyst productivity."
[3] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[4] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."
[5] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1. Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2)."
[6] "Addition of hydrogen to the feed stream improved the activity and stability of the Pt/γ-Al2O3 and the commercial mimic Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (Fig. 1, A and B, blue squares and green triangles, respectively), albeit to levels much lower than those achieved by Pt1Sn1/SiO2."
[7] "The overall productivity of a PDH catalyst is affected by the conversion-selectivity data as well as the catalyst stability and the inherent reaction rates."
[8] "Because the dehydrogenation reaction is operated under carbon-rich reducing conditions, it is inevitable that, over time, catalyst deactivation due to deposition of solid carbon would compromise the performance of the catalysts."
[9] "We attempted to regenerate the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst by oxidation, using 1% O2 as a mild oxidant at 500C followed by reduction at 600C (see supplementary materials for details of the regeneration procedure)."
[10] "The real-space Pt LIII EXAFS spectra for the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 4D) are substantially different from the spectra of monometallic Pt and indicate the mixing of Pt and Sn atoms."

1. Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve:
   - Using silica as the support for platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, which allows for better stability and selectivity to propylene.
   - Preserving the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor, ensuring the metals remain in close contact during reduction and catalytic operation.
   - Forming intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles that improve propylene selectivity and reduce the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation, enhancing catalyst stability.
   - Avoiding the formation of segregated SnOx and Pt phases, which can occur over traditional catalyst supports, by maintaining a benign interaction between the nanoparticles and the support.

2. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:
   - Reducing the need for hydrogen dilution, which improves per-pass propylene conversion and productivity.
   - Avoiding rapid catalyst deactivation through the prevention of carbon buildup and alloy segregation.
   - Achieving thermodynamically limited conversion levels without dilution, allowing for high selectivity and stability.
   - Offering a catalyst that can run up to 30 hours without deactivation, improving operational efficiency and reducing maintenance costs.

Answer: The recent developments in catalyst design and fabrication for direct dehydrogenation processes focus on utilizing silica as the support for Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles. This approach ensures the preservation of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn, preventing segregation and formation of SnOx phases. By avoiding the need for hydrogen dilution and achieving thermodynamically limited conversion, these catalysts exhibit high selectivity and stability, enabling longer operational periods without deactivation. This leads to improved per-pass propylene conversion, productivity, and operational efficiency compared to traditional alumina-based catalysts.
