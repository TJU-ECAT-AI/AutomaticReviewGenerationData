[2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."

[7] "The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the following steps:

1. Utilizing platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles supported on silica, which interact more weakly with the support material, preventing segregation of the metals. This leads to a catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, achieving high stability and selectivity towards propylene production.

2. Ensuring the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn during catalyst synthesis, preserving this interaction during the reduction and PDH reaction. This prevents the formation of segregated phases that can lead to catalyst deactivation.

3. Avoiding the use of hydrogen dilution in the feed, which typically reduces the thermodynamic limit of conversion and decreases catalyst productivity. The developed catalyst can operate at high conversion levels without dilution, maximizing propylene yield.

4. Achieving high selectivity to propylene (over 99%) by using a silica support that does not promote the formation of a tin oxide phase, unlike alumina supports which can lead to phase segregation and catalyst deactivation.

5. Maintaining the Pt-Sn interaction throughout the catalytic process, which enhances stability and reduces the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation, leading to prolonged operation without deactivation.

6. Synthesizing the catalyst by forming a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the Pt and Sn atoms are in immediate contact, which is crucial for maintaining the beneficial interaction during reduction and PDH reaction.

7. Comparing the performance of the developed catalyst to commercial mimics and other catalysts in terms of conversion, selectivity, and yield, highlighting its superior performance and potential for undiluted propane feed without compromising stability.

8. Investigating the structure and composition of the catalyst, including XRD, UV-Vis spectroscopy, XPS, DRIFTS, TEM, and XANES analyses, to confirm the formation of Pt-Sn surface alloys and the absence of segregation or phase separation.

9. Demonstrating the ability to regenerate the catalyst after deactivation, maintaining high activity and selectivity, which is a critical feature for practical industrial applications.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on enhancing stability, selectivity, and operational efficiency, particularly in direct dehydrogenation processes for propylene production from propane. The use of Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles on a silica support offers a promising solution for achieving high yields of propylene while maintaining catalyst stability over long periods of operation.

在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括以下步骤：

1. 利用铂锡（Pt1Sn1）纳米颗粒支持在硅胶上，它们与支撑材料的相互作用较弱，防止金属颗粒分离。这导致催化剂在热力学极限转化水平下运行，实现高稳定性和丙烯选择性。

2. 在催化剂合成中确保铂和锡的原子混合，在还原和PDH反应过程中保留这种相互作用。这防止形成可能导致催化剂失活的分离相。

3. 避免使用氢稀释作为反应物流，通常会降低热力学极限转换率并降低催化剂的生产效率。开发的催化剂可以在无稀释的高转换率条件下运行，最大限度地提高丙烯产量。

4. 通过使用不会促进锡氧化物相形成的硅胶支撑，实现高丙烯选择性（超过99％），这与使用铝胶支撑可能引发的相分离和催化剂失活相比，具有更高的稳定性和选择性。

5. 在整个催化过程中保持Pt-Sn相互作用，这可以增强稳定性并减少氢解和焦炭形成的速度，从而实现长时间运行而无需失活。

6. 通过形成铂锡异质配合物来合成催化剂，确保铂和锡原子立即接触，这对于在还原和PDH反应期间维持有利的相互作用至关重要。

7. 将开发的催化剂与商用模拟和其他催化剂在转换、选择性和产出方面进行比较，突出其优越性能和无稀释丙烷流体的可能性，同时不损害稳定性。

8. 对催化剂结构和组成进行研究，包括XRD、紫外可见光谱、XPS、DRIFTS、TEM和XANES分析，以确认铂锡表面合金的存在，并证明不存在分离或相分离。

9. 演示催化剂在失活后能够再生，保持高活性和选择性，这是工业应用的关键特征。

这些进展通过专注于增强稳定性、选择性和操作效率来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，特别是针对从丙烷生产丙烯的直接脱氢过程。使用Pt1Sn1纳米颗粒支持在硅胶上的解决方案为实现高丙烯产量的同时保持长期操作的催化剂稳定性提供了有前景的解决方案。
