[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit"
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[3] "Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[4] "Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation."
[5] "The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[6] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."
[7] "Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles)."
[8] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, were obtained with 16 vol % propane in helium. Propane streams are diluted in commercial operations to increase the limiting equilibrium conversion, which is higher at lower propane partial pressure (fig. S2), and to limit catalyst deactivation rates (7, 16, 17)."
[9] "Increasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on SiO2-supported catalysts to the levels used in the commercial Al2O3-supported catalysts (Pt:Sn = 1:5) led to poor performance (fig. S3A) (15)."
[10] "The data above show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibited very high productivity and stability compared with other catalysts."
[11] "To further confirm the presence of PtSn surface alloys, XPS of the freshly reduced Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed that the atomic ratio of Pt and Sn was 1, consistent with the nominal loading (fig. S8)."
[12] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. **Use of Silica Support**: The research suggests the use of silica as a support for platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles. This choice leads to better stability and selectivity for propylene synthesis, as opposed to alumina, which can cause alloy segregation and carbon buildup.

2. **Atomic Mixing of Metals**: Preserving the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor ensures that these elements remain in a stable, intermetallic phase during catalytic operation. This prevents segregation and formation of unstable phases, enhancing stability.

3. **Thermodynamic Limit Conversion**: Operating the catalysts at or near the thermodynamic limit of propane conversion allows for higher yields and selectivities, avoiding the dilution of reactants typically required to prevent deactivation.

4. **Avoidance of Hydrogen Dilution**: The ability to achieve high conversion without hydrogen dilution reduces the need for downstream separation units, improving efficiency and lowering costs.

5. **Regeneration Capability**: The catalysts can be partially regenerated after deactivation, allowing for continued use without significant loss of performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on material selection, synthesis methods, and operational conditions that enhance stability, selectivity, and efficiency in direct dehydrogenation processes. They enable higher productivity, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact, making them suitable for industrial applications.

最近在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. **使用硅酸盐作为支持物**：研究建议使用硅酸盐作为铂锡（Pt1Sn1）纳米颗粒的支持物。这种选择能够提供更好的稳定性和丙烯选择性，相比于氧化铝，后者可能导致合金分离和碳积累。

2. **金属原子混合**：保持铂和锡在前体中的原子混合，在催化操作中确保这些元素保持在稳定的互金属相态。这防止了分离和形成不稳定的相，从而增强了稳定性。

3. **热力学极限转化率**：通过在或接近丙烷转化的热力学极限下操作催化剂，允许更高的产出和选择性，避免了通常用于防止失活所需的反应剂稀释。

4. **避免氢气稀释**：能够在不进行氢气稀释的情况下实现高转化率减少了下游分离单元的需求，提高了效率并降低了成本。

5. **再生能力**：催化剂在失活后可以部分再生，无需显著损失性能就可以继续使用。

这些进步通过关注材料选择、合成方法以及操作条件，以提高稳定性和选择性，并优化工业应用中的生产率、能源消耗和环境影响，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。
