The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the following steps:

1. Utilizing platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles supported on silica, which interact more weakly with the support material, preventing segregation of the metals. This leads to a catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, achieving high stability and selectivity towards propylene production.

2. Ensuring the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn during catalyst synthesis, preserving this interaction during the reduction and PDH reaction. This prevents the formation of segregated phases that can lead to catalyst deactivation.

3. Avoiding the use of hydrogen dilution in the feed, which typically reduces the thermodynamic limit of conversion and decreases catalyst productivity. The developed catalyst can operate at high conversion levels without dilution, maximizing propylene yield.

4. Achieving high selectivity to propylene (over 99%) by using a silica support that does not promote the formation of a tin oxide phase, unlike alumina supports which can lead to phase segregation and catalyst deactivation.

5. Maintaining the Pt-Sn interaction throughout the catalytic process, which enhances stability and reduces the rate of hydrogenolysis and coke formation, leading to prolonged operation without deactivation.

6. Synthesizing the catalyst by forming a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, ensuring that the Pt and Sn atoms are in immediate contact, which is crucial for maintaining the beneficial interaction during reduction and PDH reaction.

7. Comparing the performance of the developed catalyst to commercial mimics and other catalysts in terms of conversion, selectivity, and yield, highlighting its superior performance and potential for undiluted propane feed without compromising stability.

8. Investigating the structure and composition of the catalyst, including XRD, UV-Vis spectroscopy, XPS, DRIFTS, TEM, and XANES analyses, to confirm the formation of Pt-Sn surface alloys and the absence of segregation or phase separation.

9. Demonstrating the ability to regenerate the catalyst after deactivation, maintaining high activity and selectivity, which is a critical feature for practical industrial applications.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on enhancing stability, selectivity, and operational efficiency, particularly in direct dehydrogenation processes for propylene production from propane. The use of Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles on a silica support offers a promising solution for achieving high yields of propylene while maintaining catalyst stability over long periods of operation.

   - 利用二氧化硅支持的Pt1Sn1纳米颗粒，这些颗粒在保持铂锡原子混合的同时，确保与支持的良性交互。
   - 通过将氯化铂酸和二价锡氯化物混合到盐酸溶液中形成异金属铂锡配合物，确保铂锡交互在还原和PDH反应期间的保存。
   - 确保异金属铂锡配合物的存在允许形成如Pt1Sn1和Pt3Sn等互金属相，这些相对于实现热力学极限转换水平和高丙烯选择性至关重要。
   - 合成方法以异金属铂锡配合物为起点，确保铂和锡原子在还原和PDH反应期间保持直接接触，从而促进互金属相的形成，这些相对催化剂的稳定性和性能有贡献。
   - 通过提供能够在无需氢气稀释的情况下达到热力学极限转换水平、实现高丙烯选择性并保持稳定性的催化剂系统，优化了工业应用中的催化剂性能，解决了上述挑战。
