[1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit"
[2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
[3] "Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
[4] "Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation."
[5] "The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
[6] "This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation."
[7] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."
[8] "Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles)."
[9] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1."
[10] "Increasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on SiO2-supported catalysts to the levels used in the commercial Al2O3-supported catalysts (Pt:Sn = 1:5) led to poor performance (fig. S3A) (15)."
[11] "Similarly, decreasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 to Pt1Sn1 led to rapid catalyst deactivation (fig. S3B)."
[12] "The data above show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibited very high productivity and stability compared with other catalysts."
[13] "The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
[14] "The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of H2PtCl6 is characterized by a prominent absorption peak at 260 nm; SnCl2 exhibits no absorption in the visible range. The combined precursor solution shows several additional UV-Vis absorption peaks at 279, 363, 420, and 488 nm that are characteristic of a heterometallic Pt-Sn complex (55), indicating the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms before reduction and growth of NPs on the support."
[15] "Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
[16] "The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries."

1. Recent developments in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles. These nanoparticles, when operated under thermodynamically limited conversion levels, exhibit excellent stability and selectivity to propylene, exceeding 99%. This stability is attributed to the preservation of atomic mixing between Pt and Sn, preventing segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase, unlike traditional catalyst supports. Additionally, the interaction between these nanoparticles and the silica support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation, ensuring a benign interaction.

2. To address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, researchers have focused on developing catalysts that can operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without hydrogen dilution. This approach aims to achieve higher per-pass propane conversion with high propylene selectivity and elevated catalyst stability, surpassing the limitations of current processes. The use of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, which maintain the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn, plays a crucial role in achieving these advancements.

3. Challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications include maintaining catalyst stability under harsh reaction conditions, avoiding carbon buildup, and achieving high selectivity towards desired products. Recent strategies involve using silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, which preserve the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn, ensuring a benign interaction with the support, preventing segregation, and achieving thermodynamically limited conversion levels. This approach addresses the challenges by providing a catalyst that can operate efficiently without dilution, thus improving productivity and stability.

4. The key strategies developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:
   - Utilizing silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles that maintain the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn, preserving a benign interaction with the support.
   - Synthesizing the catalysts by mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in hydrochloric acid to form a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, which ensures the preservation of Pt-Sn interaction during reduction and catalytic operation.
   - Ensuring the heterometallic nature of the Pt-Sn complex allows for the formation of intermetallic phases, such as Pt1Sn1 and Pt3Sn, which are essential for achieving thermodynamically limited conversion levels and high propylene selectivity.
   - The synthesis method involves using a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex as the starting point, which ensures that the Pt and Sn atoms remain in immediate contact during reduction and the PDH reaction, facilitating the formation of intermetallic phases that contribute to the catalyst's stability and performance.

These advancements address the challenges by providing a catalyst system that can operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, achieve high propylene selectivity, and maintain stability over long periods without deactivation, thus optimizing catalyst performance for industrial applications.
