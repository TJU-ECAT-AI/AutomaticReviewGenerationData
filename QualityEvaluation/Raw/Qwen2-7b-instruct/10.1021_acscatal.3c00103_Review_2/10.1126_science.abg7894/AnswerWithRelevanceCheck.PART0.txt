          [1] "Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit"
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinumtin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation."
          [3] "Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
          [4] "Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation."
          [5] "The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports."
          [6] "This catalyst also does not build up carbon and could run up to 30 hours without deactivation."
          [7] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."
          [8] "Under these reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is 66.5% (fig. S2). The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showed near-thermodynamic conversion of >66% (Fig. 1A, red circles) and >99% selectivity to propylene (Fig. 1B, red circles)."
          [9] "The data in Fig. 1, A to C, show the performance of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 0.6 wt % Sn) for propane dehydrogenation at 580C, 16 vol % propane (with the remainder helium) and at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 4.7 hours1."
          [10] "Increasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on SiO2-supported catalysts to the levels used in the commercial Al2O3-supported catalysts (Pt:Sn = 1:5) led to poor performance (fig. S3A) (15)."
          [11] "Similarly, decreasing the Sn:Pt atomic ratio on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 to Pt1Sn1 led to rapid catalyst deactivation (fig. S3B)."
          [12] "The data above show that the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibited very high productivity and stability compared with other catalysts."
          [13] "The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
          [14] "The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of H2PtCl6 is characterized by a prominent absorption peak at 260 nm; SnCl2 exhibits no absorption in the visible range. The combined precursor solution shows several additional UV-Vis absorption peaks at 279, 363, 420, and 488 nm that are characteristic of a heterometallic Pt-Sn complex (55), indicating the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms before reduction and growth of NPs on the support."
          [15] "Data in Fig. 3A show that the process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex."
          [16] "The XRD spectra in Fig. 3D show that the formed NPs were essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. This finding is supported by the presence of the XRD peaks corresponding to Pt1Sn1 (41.8 and 44.1) and Pt3Sn1 (39.0 and 45.3) stoichiometries."

          Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate specific materials and preparation methods. Key strategies include:

          1. **Using Silica Supports**: The silica support (SiO2) provides a benign environment for the platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, preventing segregation and formation of unwanted phases like tin oxide (SnOx).

          2. **Atomically Mixed Precursors**: The synthesis of catalysts involves creating a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex that maintains the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn throughout the catalytic operation, ensuring a stable intermetallic phase.

          3. **Optimized Alloy Formation**: The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts form atomically mixed Pt-Sn NPs upon reduction, resulting in smaller, stable intermetallic particles that do not segregate.

          4. **High Productivity and Stability**: The catalysts achieve high productivity and stability, particularly when operated at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without dilution, offering superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

          These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications, specifically for the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene with high selectivity and minimal deactivation.

          近期在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂稳定性的进步涉及开发新型催化剂设计，这些设计采用了特定材料和制备方法。关键策略包括：

          1. **使用硅胶支撑**：硅胶支撑（SiO2）为铂锡（Pt1Sn1）纳米颗粒提供了一个良性环境，防止了分离和形成不希望的相如锡氧化物（SnOx）。

          2. **原子混合前体**：催化剂合成涉及创建一个铂锡（Pt-Sn）配位复合物，该复合物在整个催化操作中保持了铂和锡的原子混合，确保了稳定的互金属相。

          3. **优化合金形成**：Pt1Sn1/SiO2催化剂在还原后形成了原子混合的Pt-Sn NPs，结果是更小、更稳定的互金属颗粒，不会发生分离。

          4. **高生产力和稳定性**：催化剂在热力学极限转换水平下运行时，无需稀释，表现出高生产力和稳定性，与传统催化剂相比，提供了更优的性能。

          这些进展通过提供更高效且稳定的催化剂来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，特别是用于以高选择性生产丙烯并最小化失活的丙烷脱氢过程的工业应用。
