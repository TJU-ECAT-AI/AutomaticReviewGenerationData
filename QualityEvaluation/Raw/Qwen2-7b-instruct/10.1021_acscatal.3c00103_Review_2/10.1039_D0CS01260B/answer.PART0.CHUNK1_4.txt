<p>For the Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx-, and Sn/SnOx-based catalysts, the promotion effects of Sn species in Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts through the geometric and electronic modifications have been widely studied since the 1960s. However, Sn alone can play the role of the active sites in the dehydrogenation reactions instead of the promoters. The metallic Sn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits comparable performance to those of KCr2O3/Al2O3 and KPtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts for PDH reactions.</p>
<p>For the ZnOx-based catalysts, either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The high-silica zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters show over 90% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>For the ZrOx-based catalysts, the coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located on the top of an ideal flat surface are identified as the main active sites for the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>The PDH reactions over PdCu SAA and cluster surfaces are revealed by the DFT calculation results with respect to the activation of CH bond, the desorption of propylene, and the formation of key intermediates.</p>
<p>For the nickel(111)-catalyzed PDH and side reactions, the adsorption of propane and propylene is physisorption and chemisorption, respectively. For the facile first CH activation, the formation of 1-propyl intermediate is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than that of the 2-propyl intermediate.</p>

1. Sn species can independently function as active sites in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, exhibiting similar performance to Pt-based catalysts. Nanosized ZnO clusters support high propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. ZrOx catalysts feature active Zr cations (Zrcus) for PDH reactions. DFT calculations elucidate the PdCu surfaces' roles in CH activation, propylene desorption, and key intermediate formation. Nickel(111) favors the formation of 1-propyl intermediate over 2-propyl during PDH reactions.

1.Sn物种可以独立作为烷烃脱氢反应中的活性位点，表现出与基于Pt的催化剂相似的性能。纳米尺寸的ZnO簇支持PDH反应中高丙烯选择性。ZrOx催化剂中的Zr离子（Zrcus）是PDH反应的关键活性位点。DFT计算揭示了PdCu表面在CH活化、丙烯脱附以及关键中间体形成过程中的作用。Ni(111)更倾向于形成1-丙基中间体而非2-丙基，在PDH反应过程中。
