[1] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."
[2] "For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability."
[3] "To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production."
[4] "Therefore, toward the Pt-catalyzed PDH process, numerous efforts have been made to develop efficient and stable catalysts based on extending the knowledge of the structure-performance relationship and the catalytic mechanism."
