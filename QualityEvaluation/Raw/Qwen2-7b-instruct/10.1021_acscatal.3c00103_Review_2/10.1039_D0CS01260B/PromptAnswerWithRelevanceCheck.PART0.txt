[1] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."
[2] "The understanding on the catalyst structureactivity relationship and mechanism for the alkane ODH processes may provide a reference for the structural design of the DH catalysts, though different tasks and limitations exist between these two processes."
[3] "Several strategies have been performed to solve this problem. The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."
[4] "However, there are rare reports to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of these co-fed gases in the alkane DH reactions over non-Pt catalysts."
[5] "Though some metal or metal oxide catalysts have achieved industrial applications, a full picture about the working state and the catalytic mechanism for these catalysts still cannot be realized."

<quotes>
<p>Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated. Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively.</p>
<p>In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades. Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years. For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability.</p>
<p>For the PDH reaction at 550 C, the catalyst displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C, while >98% selectivity and 1.46 s1 rate can be achieved at 600 C. The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by the 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), providing a strong interaction with the metal sites for great anti-sintering stability in the long-term reaction.</p>
<p>Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size. More than 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction is achieved on this promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst due to favorable diffusion in short paths.</p>

1. The challenges in the direct dehydrogenation processes for ethane and propane include the difficulty in activating the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the selectivity control of CH cleavage versus CC cleavage, and the issues of olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anti-coking ability. These challenges are common in both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts.

2. The Oleflex and Catofin processes, which utilize PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts respectively, are the primary commercial technologies for PDH reactions. These catalysts face similar challenges in terms of dehydrogenation selectivity, olefin release, and catalyst durability.

3. The PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst, which displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate at 550 C, exhibits great anti-sintering stability due to the confinement of SnIV/II ions within the Mg(Al)O lattice structure.

4. The microporous zeolites pose challenges in precisely locating metal sites within their pores and maintaining these sites against sintering or ripening. The hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite, with its strong interaction with Pt metals, facilitates the formation of small Pt nanoparticles, enabling high propylene selectivity and suppressed oligomerization side reactions.

3. PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 催化剂在550°C时显示出99%以上的丙烯选择性和0.96 s1的特定速率，由于SnIV/II离子被限制在Mg(Al)O晶格结构中，表现出出色的抗结块稳定性。

4. 微孔沸石在精确定位其孔内的金属位点以及防止这些位点发生聚集或烧结方面存在挑战。层次化的硅酸盐沸石通过其与Pt金属的强大相互作用，促进了小Pt纳米颗粒的形成，从而实现了高丙烯选择性和抑制副反应的能力。

<p>The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount. For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16).</p>
<p>The structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts are also improved by the selected support. A less than one monolayer Si/Al ratio of Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) strongly affects the catalytic activity and stability of the supported VOx species for the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>For the dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) possess a well-defined 3D center-radial mesopore structure and a large pore diameter, allowing the isolated VO4 active sites to highly disperse with an appropriate concentration and facile accessibility and improving the internal diffusion of the relevant reactants.</p>
<p>During the catalyst preparation stage, the OH groups can serve as effective anchoring sites for the V-precursors to achieve the good dispersion of VOx species on the supports. On the other hand, the detrimental OH groups can also be formed in the pre-reduction of VOx catalysts by H2 feed gas and coexist with the reduced V4+ and/or V3+ sites.</p>
<p>In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction.</p>
<p>For the as-obtained catalyst, the presence of surface OH groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are proved to be strongly connected with the intrinsic PDH activity and the coke formation process, based on the results of the in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations.</p>
<p>By regulating the ratio of Ga/Al for the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the distribution of Ga+, Brnsted acid sites and GaOx species can be controlled, and GaOx clusters are formed at high Ga/Al ratios (>1/2), while a 1/1 ratio of Ga+ to Brnsted acid sites is achieved at a Ga/Al ratio with 1/2 for creating a LewisBrnsted acid pair.</p>
<p>Employing the SOMC method using a precursor of Fe(oCp)2 (bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(ii)) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment, SiO2-supported isolate and stable FeII species in three coordination are constructed as the active sites for selectively catalizing the PDH reaction through a non-redox mechanism.</p>
<p>Either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as illustrated in Table 6. The high-silica zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters show over 90% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>The ZrO2-based catalysts show catalytic activities for the CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions (Table 6). The coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located on the top of an ideal flat surface are identified as the main active sites for the PDH reactions, and their concentration can be regulated by varying the kind of the supported hydrogenation-active metals such as Cu, Ru and Rh, and by doping with promoters such as Li, Ca, Mg, Cu, Sm, La and Y.</p>
<p>The synergistic effect between CrOx and ZrOx in bulk binary CrZrOx oxides has also been proved as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts.</p>

1. The distribution of vanadium species on the support depends on the loading amount. Different vanadium species, including isolated vanadium, polymetric vanadium oxyxide, and crystalline vanadium pentoxide, are formed when the surface density reaches specific levels.

2. Selective support materials can significantly improve the catalytic activity and stability of vanadium oxyxide species in dehydrogenation reactions. A lower Si/Al ratio in the Al2O3SiO2 support leads to enhanced activity and stability.

3. Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles provide a well-defined structure with large pores, allowing for the dispersion of isolated vanadium tetrahedra with high concentration and ease of reactant diffusion.

4. Hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface can serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors, facilitating the dispersion of vanadium oxyxide species. However, detrimental hydroxyl groups can also form during reduction, coexisting with reduced vanadium species.

5. In the initial dehydrogenation reactions, besides the reduction of high-valence vanadium to lower valence forms, dynamic changes in other vanadium-related sites occur. An oxidative dehydrogenation pathway exists alongside the consumption of the vanadium-oxygen group.

6. Surface hydroxyl groups on vanadium/Al2O3 catalysts are closely linked to intrinsic PDH activity and coke formation, as indicated by in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations.

7. By adjusting the ratio of gallium to aluminum in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the distribution of gallium species, Brnsted acid sites, and gallium oxyxide clusters can be controlled. High ratios of gallium to aluminum lead to gallium oxyxide clusters, while a 1:1 ratio creates a LewisBrnsted acid pair.

8. Using the SOMC method with a precursor of iron(II) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction, stable iron(II) species are synthesized on silica, serving as active sites for non-redox PDH reactions.

9. Nanosized zinc oxide assemblies or single-site zinc(II) ions have been found to be active in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. High-silica zeolite-supported zinc oxide nanoclusters show high propylene selectivity.

10. Zirconia-based catalysts exhibit activity in CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations are the main active sites, and their concentration can be regulated by various factors.

[5] "By modifying the intrinsic activity of the active sites with a significantly declined apparent activation energy, the optimal Zn0.3Cr catalyst displays 31% conversion and 94% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 480 C and 5000 mL gcat1 h1 space velocity."

<p>For the Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx-, and Sn/SnOx-based catalysts, the promotion effects of Sn species in Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts through the geometric and electronic modifications have been widely studied since the 1960s. However, Sn alone can play the role of the active sites in the dehydrogenation reactions instead of the promoters. The metallic Sn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits comparable performance to those of KCr2O3/Al2O3 and KPtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts for PDH reactions.</p>
<p>For the ZnOx-based catalysts, either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The high-silica zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters show over 90% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>For the ZrOx-based catalysts, the coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located on the top of an ideal flat surface are identified as the main active sites for the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>The PDH reactions over PdCu SAA and cluster surfaces are revealed by the DFT calculation results with respect to the activation of CH bond, the desorption of propylene, and the formation of key intermediates.</p>
<p>For the nickel(111)-catalyzed PDH and side reactions, the adsorption of propane and propylene is physisorption and chemisorption, respectively. For the facile first CH activation, the formation of 1-propyl intermediate is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than that of the 2-propyl intermediate.</p>
