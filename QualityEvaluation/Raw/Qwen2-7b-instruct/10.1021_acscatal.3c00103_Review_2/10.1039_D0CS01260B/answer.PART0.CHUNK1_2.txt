<p>The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount. For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16).</p>
<p>The structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts are also improved by the selected support. A less than one monolayer Si/Al ratio of Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) strongly affects the catalytic activity and stability of the supported VOx species for the PDH reaction.</p>
<p>For the dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) possess a well-defined 3D center-radial mesopore structure and a large pore diameter, allowing the isolated VO4 active sites to highly disperse with an appropriate concentration and facile accessibility and improving the internal diffusion of the relevant reactants.</p>
<p>During the catalyst preparation stage, the OH groups can serve as effective anchoring sites for the V-precursors to achieve the good dispersion of VOx species on the supports. On the other hand, the detrimental OH groups can also be formed in the pre-reduction of VOx catalysts by H2 feed gas and coexist with the reduced V4+ and/or V3+ sites.</p>
<p>In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction.</p>
<p>For the as-obtained catalyst, the presence of surface OH groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are proved to be strongly connected with the intrinsic PDH activity and the coke formation process, based on the results of the in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations.</p>
<p>By regulating the ratio of Ga/Al for the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the distribution of Ga+, Brnsted acid sites and GaOx species can be controlled, and GaOx clusters are formed at high Ga/Al ratios (>1/2), while a 1/1 ratio of Ga+ to Brnsted acid sites is achieved at a Ga/Al ratio with 1/2 for creating a LewisBrnsted acid pair.</p>
<p>Employing the SOMC method using a precursor of Fe(oCp)2 (bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(ii)) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment, SiO2-supported isolate and stable FeII species in three coordination are constructed as the active sites for selectively catalizing the PDH reaction through a non-redox mechanism.</p>
<p>Either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as illustrated in Table 6. The high-silica zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters show over 90% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.</p>
<p>The ZrO2-based catalysts show catalytic activities for the CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions (Table 6). The coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located on the top of an ideal flat surface are identified as the main active sites for the PDH reactions, and their concentration can be regulated by varying the kind of the supported hydrogenation-active metals such as Cu, Ru and Rh, and by doping with promoters such as Li, Ca, Mg, Cu, Sm, La and Y.</p>
<p>The synergistic effect between CrOx and ZrOx in bulk binary CrZrOx oxides has also been proved as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts.</p>

1. The distribution of vanadium species on the support depends on the loading amount. Different vanadium species, including isolated vanadium, polymetric vanadium oxyxide, and crystalline vanadium pentoxide, are formed when the surface density reaches specific levels.

2. Selective support materials can significantly improve the catalytic activity and stability of vanadium oxyxide species in dehydrogenation reactions. A lower Si/Al ratio in the Al2O3SiO2 support leads to enhanced activity and stability.

3. Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles provide a well-defined structure with large pores, allowing for the dispersion of isolated vanadium tetrahedra with high concentration and ease of reactant diffusion.

4. Hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface can serve as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors, facilitating the dispersion of vanadium oxyxide species. However, detrimental hydroxyl groups can also form during reduction, coexisting with reduced vanadium species.

5. In the initial dehydrogenation reactions, besides the reduction of high-valence vanadium to lower valence forms, dynamic changes in other vanadium-related sites occur. An oxidative dehydrogenation pathway exists alongside the consumption of the vanadium-oxygen group.

6. Surface hydroxyl groups on vanadium/Al2O3 catalysts are closely linked to intrinsic PDH activity and coke formation, as indicated by in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations.

7. By adjusting the ratio of gallium to aluminum in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the distribution of gallium species, Brnsted acid sites, and gallium oxyxide clusters can be controlled. High ratios of gallium to aluminum lead to gallium oxyxide clusters, while a 1:1 ratio creates a LewisBrnsted acid pair.

8. Using the SOMC method with a precursor of iron(II) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction, stable iron(II) species are synthesized on silica, serving as active sites for non-redox PDH reactions.

9. Nanosized zinc oxide assemblies or single-site zinc(II) ions have been found to be active in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. High-silica zeolite-supported zinc oxide nanoclusters show high propylene selectivity.

10. Zirconia-based catalysts exhibit activity in CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations are the main active sites, and their concentration can be regulated by various factors.

11. A synergistic effect between chromium oxide and zirconia in bulk binary chromium-zirconia oxides enhances the performance of zirconia-based catalysts.
