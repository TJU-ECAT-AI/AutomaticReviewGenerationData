[1] "The advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications involve the use of advanced synthesis strategies, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and seeded molecular crystal growth (SOMC) approaches, to finely control the structure of active sites."
[2] "These strategies aim to localize metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or zeolite framework to induce the formation of new active sites involved in a synergetic reaction mechanism or an undesired pathway."
[3] "For instance, incorporating metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework can produce acid sites with complete functions, not just serving as active sites for CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking process."
[4] "Strategies to address the issues related to catalyst stability include fine-tuning the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides through promoters or supports, utilizing isolation effects to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating possible active sites responsible for coking on the selected support."
[5] "In addition, co-feeding of gases such as hydrogen, steam, and soft oxidant CO2 can reduce the formation of coke species, although the effect of hydrogen as a coke inhibitor might be weakened in certain cases."
[6] "To maintain dynamic structural stability of active sites during reaction and regeneration, a moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports is crucial. This necessitates the development of an efficient pretreatment procedure."

1. Advanced synthesis strategies like ALD and SOMC are used to precisely control the structure of active sites in catalysts for industrial applications. 

2. These strategies aim to localize metals on metal oxides or zeolites to create new active sites involved in a synergistic or unwanted reaction pathway.

3. Incorporating metal hetero-ions into zeolite frameworks can produce acid sites with full functionality, beyond just serving as cracking sites.

4. Strategies to enhance catalyst stability include fine-tuning electronic properties, using isolation effects, and eliminating coking-prone sites on the support.

5. Gases like hydrogen, steam, and CO2 can reduce coke formation, but the hydrogen's effect might be diminished in some cases.

6. Maintaining dynamic stability requires a balanced interaction among metals, promoters, and supports, along with developing an efficient pretreatment process.

1. 先进的合成策略，如原子层沉积（ALD）和种子分子晶体生长（SOMC），被用来精确控制催化剂活性位点的结构。

2. 这些策略旨在将金属局部化在金属氧化物或沸石骨架上，以产生参与协同或不期望反应途径的新活性位点。

3. 在沸石骨架中引入金属杂原子可以产生具有完全功能的酸位点，而不仅仅是作为裂解、深度脱氢或结焦过程的活性位点。

4. 提高催化剂稳定性的策略包括调整电子性质，使用隔离效应，以及消除支持材料上的可能导致结焦的活性位点。

5. 氢气、蒸汽和CO2等气体可以减少结焦形成，但氢气的抑制效果在某些情况下可能减弱。

6. 维持动态稳定性需要金属、促进剂和支持之间适当的相互作用，并开发有效的预处理程序。
