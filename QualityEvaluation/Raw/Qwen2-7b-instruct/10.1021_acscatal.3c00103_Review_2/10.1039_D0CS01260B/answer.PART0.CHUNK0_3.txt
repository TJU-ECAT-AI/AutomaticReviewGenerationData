[1] "To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production."
[2] "For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability."
[3] "Therefore, toward the Pt-catalyzed PDH process, numerous efforts have been made to develop efficient and stable catalysts based on extending the knowledge of the structure-performance relationship and the catalytic mechanism."
[4] "For instance, a rod-shaped porous Al2O3 possessing a weakened surface acidity in comparison with the commercial Al2O3 has been adopted as the support of the active Cr2O3 sites, and this CrAl-800 catalyst shows a significantly lower coke deposition amount than the reference catalyst (3.6% vs. 15.7%) in the PDH reactions at 600 C."
[5] "By modifying the intrinsic activity of the active sites with a significantly declined apparent activation energy, the optimal Zn0.3Cr catalyst displays 31% conversion and 94% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 480 C and 5000 mL gcat1 h1 space velocity."

1. The removal of coke from used catalysts through frequent regeneration is necessary to maintain the service lifetime of dehydrogenation catalysts, although this process is undesirable for industrial production.
2. The direct challenges faced by dehydrogenation catalysts include selective activation of CH bonds over CC bonds, olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anti-coking ability.
3. Many efforts have been directed towards developing Pt-based catalysts for PDH processes, focusing on extending the understanding of the relationship between structure and performance, and catalytic mechanisms.
4. A rod-shaped porous Al2O3 with reduced surface acidity compared to commercial Al2O3 has proven effective in supporting active Cr2O3 sites, leading to a CrAl-800 catalyst that shows significantly less coke deposition than a reference catalyst at 600°C.
5. By adjusting the intrinsic activity of active sites with a decreased apparent activation energy, the Zn0.3Cr catalyst achieves 31% conversion and 94% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 480°C and 5000 mL gcat1 h1 space velocity.

1. 要保持催化剂的可服务寿命，需要通过频繁再生去除使用过的催化剂上的焦炭，但这对工业生产来说是不理想的。
2. 直接挑战包括选择性激活CH键而非CC键、烯烃的脱附、催化剂结构稳定性以及抗结焦能力。
3. 许多努力集中在开发基于扩展结构性能关系和催化机制知识的高效稳定铂基PDH催化剂上。
4. 与商业Al2O3相比具有较低表面酸性的棒状多孔Al2O3被用作支持活性Cr2O3位点的载体，CrAl-800催化剂在600°C时显示出比参考催化剂低得多的焦炭沉积量。
5. 通过调整活性位点的内在活性并降低显热活化能，Zn0.3Cr催化剂在480°C和5000 mL gcat1 h1空速下实现了31%的转化率和94%的丙烯选择性。
