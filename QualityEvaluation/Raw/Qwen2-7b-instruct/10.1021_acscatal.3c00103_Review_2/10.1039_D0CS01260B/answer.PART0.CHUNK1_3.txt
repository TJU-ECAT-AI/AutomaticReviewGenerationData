The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing advanced synthesis techniques like atomic layer deposition (ALD) and seeded molecular crystal growth (SOMC). Localizing metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or zeolite framework can create new active sites involved in a synergistic reaction mechanism. Understanding the structure-property relationship for catalysts is essential for developing efficient, selective, and stable catalysts. Strategies to maintain catalyst stability include fine-tuning electronic properties through promoters or supports, geometric modification on active sites through isolation effects, and eliminating active sites responsible for coke formation. The co-feeding of gases like hydrogen and steam can reduce the formation of coke species and improve the single-pass yield of dehydrogenation reactions. Maintaining the dynamic structural stability of active sites during reaction and regeneration is crucial for catalyst performance.
