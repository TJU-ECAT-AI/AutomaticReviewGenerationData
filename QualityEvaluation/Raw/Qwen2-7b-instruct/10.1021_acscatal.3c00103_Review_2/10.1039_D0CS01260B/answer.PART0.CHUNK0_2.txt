1. Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include comparative summaries of synthesis, structural information, catalytic properties, and mechanisms for ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene dehydrogenation catalysts. These advancements aim to address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on the selective activation of CH bonds, suppressing CC cleavage, and mitigating coke formation.

2. The Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts are two primary commercial technologies developed for the PDH reactions in the last few decades. These processes face issues like coke deposition and catalyst deactivation during industrial production.

3. Maintaining an acceptable service lifetime of the catalyst requires the removal of coke through frequent regeneration, which is undesirable in industrial settings.
