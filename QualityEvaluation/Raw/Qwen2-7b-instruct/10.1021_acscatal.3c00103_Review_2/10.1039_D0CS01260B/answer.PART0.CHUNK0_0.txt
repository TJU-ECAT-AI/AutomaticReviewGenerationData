<p>Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated. Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively.</p>
<p>In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades. Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years. For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability.</p>
<p>For the PDH reaction at 550 C, the catalyst displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C, while >98% selectivity and 1.46 s1 rate can be achieved at 600 C. The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by the 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), providing a strong interaction with the metal sites for great anti-sintering stability in the long-term reaction.</p>
<p>Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size. More than 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction is achieved on this promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst due to favorable diffusion in short paths.</p>

1. The challenges in the direct dehydrogenation processes for ethane and propane include the difficulty in activating the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the selectivity control of CH cleavage versus CC cleavage, and the issues of olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anti-coking ability. These challenges are common in both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts.

2. The Oleflex and Catofin processes, which utilize PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts respectively, are the primary commercial technologies for PDH reactions. These catalysts face similar challenges in terms of dehydrogenation selectivity, olefin release, and catalyst durability.

3. The PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst, which displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate at 550 C, exhibits great anti-sintering stability due to the confinement of SnIV/II ions within the Mg(Al)O lattice structure.

4. The microporous zeolites pose challenges in precisely locating metal sites within their pores and maintaining these sites against sintering or ripening. The hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite, with its strong interaction with Pt metals, facilitates the formation of small Pt nanoparticles, enabling high propylene selectivity and suppressed oligomerization side reactions.

1. 直接脱氢过程中的挑战包括烷烃中CH键激活的困难、CH裂解与CC裂解的选择性控制、烯烃的释放、催化剂结构稳定性以及抗结焦能力。这些问题在铂基和CrOx基催化剂中普遍存在。

2. Oleflex 和Catofin 过程是PDH反应的主要商业技术，分别使用PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3催化剂。这些催化剂面临相似的挑战，如脱氢选择性、烯烃释放和催化剂耐用性。

3. PtSn/Mg(Sn)(Al)O@Al2O3 催化剂在550°C时显示出99%以上的丙烯选择性和0.96 s1的特定速率，由于SnIV/II离子被限制在Mg(Al)O晶格结构中，表现出出色的抗结块稳定性。

4. 微孔沸石在精确定位其孔内的金属位点以及防止这些位点发生聚集或烧结方面存在挑战。层次化的硅酸盐沸石通过其与Pt金属的强大相互作用，促进了小Pt纳米颗粒的形成，从而实现了高丙烯选择性和抑制副反应的能力。
