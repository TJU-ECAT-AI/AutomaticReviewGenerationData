[1] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."
[2] "The understanding on the catalyst structureactivity relationship and mechanism for the alkane ODH processes may provide a reference for the structural design of the DH catalysts, though different tasks and limitations exist between these two processes."
[3] "Several strategies have been performed to solve this problem. The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."
[4] "However, there are rare reports to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of these co-fed gases in the alkane DH reactions over non-Pt catalysts."
[5] "Though some metal or metal oxide catalysts have achieved industrial applications, a full picture about the working state and the catalytic mechanism for these catalysts still cannot be realized."

1. The elimination of active sites responsible for coking is crucial for improving catalyst stability. Alkaline additives and high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are used to reduce surface acidity and prevent coking.
2. Understanding the structureactivity relationship and mechanism of alkane oxygenate dehydrogenation processes can guide the design of dehydrogenation catalysts, despite the differences between dehydrogenation and oxygenate dehydrogenation.
3. Promoters or supports can fine-tune the electronic properties of metals or metal oxides, such as shifting the d-band center of Pt or tuning the 3d orbit energy of a single-atom V site, to reduce interaction with olefin intermediates and facilitate their easy desorption.
4. There is a lack of systematic discussion on the catalytic roles of co-fed gases in alkane dehydrogenation reactions over non-Pt catalysts.
5. While some metal or metal oxide catalysts have been successfully industrialized, a comprehensive understanding of their working state and catalytic mechanism is still lacking.

1. 防止结焦的关键活性位点的消除对于提高催化剂稳定性至关重要。碱性添加剂和高硅或纯硅沸石被用于降低表面酸度，防止结焦。
2. 了解烷烃氧化脱氢过程的结构活性关系和机制可以为脱氢催化剂的设计提供参考，尽管脱氢和氧化脱氢之间存在差异任务和限制。
3. 推广剂或支撑体可以精确调整金属或金属氧化物的电子性质，例如通过移动Pt原子的d带中心或调节单原子V位点的3d轨道能量，以减少催化剂与烯烃中间体的相互作用并促进其易于脱附。
4. 对于非铂催化剂中的共喂入气体在烷烃脱氢反应中的催化作用缺乏系统讨论。
5. 尽管一些金属或金属氧化物催化剂已经实现了工业化应用，但它们的工作状态和催化机制的全面理解仍然不足。
