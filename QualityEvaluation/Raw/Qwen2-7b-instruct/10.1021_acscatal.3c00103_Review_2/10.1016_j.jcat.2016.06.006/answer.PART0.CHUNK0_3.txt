Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the incorporation of nanostructured supports and modification of surface functionalities. High-temperature annealing is used to improve crystal structure stability, while the addition of co-catalysts enhances both catalytic activity and selectivity. Tailored support materials are also being explored to better match specific reaction conditions. Fabrication methods are optimized to achieve consistent particle size and distribution, targeting increases in turnover frequency and reductions in byproducts for performance optimization.
