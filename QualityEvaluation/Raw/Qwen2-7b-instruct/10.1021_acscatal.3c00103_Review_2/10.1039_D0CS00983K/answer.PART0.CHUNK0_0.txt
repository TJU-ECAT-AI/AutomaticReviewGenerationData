[1] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."
[2] "The high cost of Pt and the potential environmental problems of CrOx have driven researchers to improve the coking and sintering resistance of Pt catalysts, and to find new non-noble metal and environment-friendly catalysts."
[3] "For the dehydrogenation of these light alkanes, the conversion of ethane to ethylene still depends on steam cracking at about 850 C."
[4] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed."
[5] "The time between regenerations over the supported Pt catalyst for light-alkane dehydrogenation is determined by the rate of coking, because the sintering of Pt during the reaction is a relatively slow process."

1. Researchers have been focusing on enhancing the coking and sintering resistance of platinum catalysts and exploring new non-noble metal and environmentally friendly catalysts to mitigate the high cost of platinum and potential environmental issues associated with chromium oxide (CrOx).

2. The conversion of ethane to ethylene is currently dependent on steam cracking at approximately 850°C due to the lack of efficient alternatives.

3. For the complete recovery of activity in a Pt catalyst, the sintered Pt particles must undergo redispersion.

4. The duration between regeneration cycles for supported Pt catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation processes is primarily governed by the rate of coking.

1. 研究人员正在努力提高铂催化剂的结焦和烧结抵抗力，并探索新的非贵金属和环保催化剂，以降低铂的成本并解决铬氧化物（CrOx）可能带来的环境问题。

2. 由于缺乏更有效的替代方法，目前乙烷转化为乙烯仍依赖于约850°C的蒸汽裂解。

3. 要完全恢复铂催化剂的活性，必须使烧结的铂颗粒重新分散。

4. 支持型铂催化剂在轻烷烃脱氢过程中进行再生之间的周期主要由结焦速率决定。
