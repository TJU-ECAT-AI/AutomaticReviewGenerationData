The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving the resistance of platinum (Pt) catalysts against coking and sintering. Researchers have made significant progress in this area. Additionally, there is a growing focus on the development of environmentally friendly catalysts that maintain high dehydrogenation performance and structural integrity over long periods, essential for industrial applications. Another major challenge is the advancement of in situ characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the active sites on the catalyst surface. Lastly, optimizing the design and operation of dehydrogenation reactors aims to boost efficiency by minimizing pressure drops, which in turn enhances single-pass conversion rates and reduces overall energy consumption.
