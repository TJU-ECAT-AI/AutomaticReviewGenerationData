<p>Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations. Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam.</p>
<p>For the reaction conditions, the rate of coking is affected by H2,76 H2O, the partial pressure of hydrocarbons, as well as the space time and linear velocity of oil vapor. For a catalyst, the most important factor is its composition.</p>
<p>Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOP's OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations.</p>
<p>Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The addition of Ga, In, Zn, Cu, Ir, Co to Pt catalysts exhibits similar effects as Sn. PtGa/SiO2 containing isolated gallium sites display a high performance in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Promoters such as Cu, Ni, Ce, have also been introduced into CrOx-based catalysts142144 to optimize the surface distribution of active Cr species. All these modifications facilitate the formation of oligomeric chromium species, and decrease the amount of inactive isolated Cr6+ sites, leading to improved dehydrogenation performance.</p>
<p>For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the selectivity to isobutylene exceeds 80% for isobutane dehydrogenation over all these catalysts.33,104 The fundamental cause of the great change in selectivity should be attributed to the longer distance between metal atoms in metal sulfides than that in metals.</p>
<p>However, the catalyst used in the circulating fluidized-bed reactor should be resistant to abrasion and impact.</p>
<p>The comparison of the ADHO technology and the commercial dehydrogenation processes are listed in Table 3.</p>

1. To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, strategies and approaches include improving the coking resistance of the catalyst, optimizing reaction conditions, modifying catalyst composition, and using in situ characterization techniques for deeper research on the reaction mechanism and active sites of the catalyst.

2. The optimization of reaction conditions involves adjusting parameters such as hydrogen and water partial pressures, oil vapor space time, and linear velocity to reduce coking rates and prolong the time between catalyst regenerations.

3. Promoters like copper, nickel, and cerium can be introduced into chromium oxide-based catalysts to improve the surface distribution of active chromium species, thereby forming oligomeric chromium species and reducing the amount of inactive isolated chromium 6+ sites, which leads to improved dehydrogenation performance.

4. The addition of metals such as gallium, indium, zinc, copper, iridium, and cobalt to platinum catalysts can exhibit similar effects as tin in terms of enhancing catalytic performance, selectivity, and stability.

5. The use of gallium in the form of gallium sites or gallium-containing compounds can significantly improve the dehydrogenation performance of catalysts, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation.

6. The introduction of metal sulfides, such as iron, cobalt, molybdenum, and sulfur, can modify the dehydrogenation performance of catalysts for both light alkanes and cyclohexane by altering the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst surface.

7. The circulating fluidized-bed reactor type, characterized by its low backmixing and high efficiency, is advantageous for dehydrogenation processes due to its ability to regenerate spent catalysts and supply heat for reactions by utilizing the high-temperature regenerated catalyst.

8. The ADHO process utilizes a WO3-containing catalyst, which demonstrates high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 43% and a propylene selectivity of 89.9%. This process also eliminates the need for pre-treating the feed and can operate under normal conditions without being poisoned by sulfur and metals. The catalyst deactivates primarily through coke deposition, allowing for complete recovery of activity through coke combustion with air and redispersion of sintered platinum nanoparticles.
