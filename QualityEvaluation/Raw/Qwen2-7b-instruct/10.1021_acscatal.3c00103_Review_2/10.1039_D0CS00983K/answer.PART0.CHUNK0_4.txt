<p>From the discussion on catalysts, particularly supported metal catalysts, it is mentioned that: "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles,63 and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce." This quote highlights the use of a second metal to form alloys with Pt to improve the sintering resistance of Pt particles.</p>
<p>Another relevant quote is: "Slowing down the coking rate and prolonging the time between regenerations are pivotal for improving the technologies of light alkane dehydrogenation. Just like the sintering of Pt, coking is unavoidable, but some measures can be taken to slow down the coking rate, including the optimization of reaction conditions and the catalyst." This quote emphasizes the importance of slowing down the coking rate and discusses potential strategies to achieve this.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is noted that: "Improving the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations. Moreover, the optimization of reaction conditions can also help to lengthen the time between regenerations, such as the introduction of hydrogen or steam." This quote specifically addresses improving the coking resistance of catalysts and suggests optimization of reaction conditions as a way to extend the operational lifespan of catalysts.</p>
