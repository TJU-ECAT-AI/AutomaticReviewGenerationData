[1] "Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts prepared by two-step impregnation (first tin), with a Sn/Pt atomic ratio ranging from zero to 6.72, were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and tested in isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Metal dispersion correlates linearly with reaction rate; both parameters reach a maximum when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio is about one."
[3] "The activity of the sites capable of hydrogen chemisorption, as expressed in turnover frequency number, TOF, decrease as the tin concentration is increased."
[4] "From theoretical ab-initio calculations, it is proposed that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer responsible for hydrogen dissociation through an orbital overlapping."

The key strategies and approaches to enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the composition and dispersion of metals on the support material. In this study, Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts were prepared through a two-step impregnation process, which allowed for control over the Sn/Pt atomic ratio. This ratio was varied to find the optimal balance that maximizes both metal dispersion and reaction rate. The research suggests that tin, when present at a specific ratio with platinum, can reduce the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer, facilitating hydrogen dissociation. This is achieved through orbital overlapping, which likely enhances the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert reactants into products during isobutane dehydrogenation. The decrease in hydrogen chemisorption activity with increased tin concentration indicates that the relationship between tin content and catalyst performance is critical. By fine-tuning these parameters, the researchers aimed to optimize catalyst design, fabrication, and performance for industrial applications.

增强直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括优化金属在支撑材料上的组成和分散。在这项研究中，通过两步浸渍过程制备了Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4催化剂，这允许对Sn/Pt原子比进行控制。该比例被调整以找到最大化金属分散和反应速率的最佳平衡点。研究表明，当锡与铂以特定比例存在时，可以减少铂-氢电荷转移，从而促进氢气的离解。这可能是通过轨道重叠实现的，这可能增强了催化剂有效转换反应物为产物的能力，在异丁烷脱氢过程中。随着锡含量的增加，氢化吸收活性的下降表明锡含量与催化剂性能之间的关系至关重要。通过精细调整这些参数，研究人员旨在优化催化剂设计、制造和工业应用中的性能。
