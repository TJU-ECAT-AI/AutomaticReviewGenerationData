[1] "Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts prepared by two-step impregnation (first tin), with a Sn/Pt atomic ratio ranging from zero to 6.72, were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and tested in isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Metal dispersion correlates linearly with reaction rate; both parameters reach a maximum when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio is about one."
[3] "The activity of the sites capable of hydrogen chemisorption, as expressed in turnover frequency number, TOF, decrease as the tin concentration is increased."
[4] "From theoretical ab-initio calculations, it is proposed that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer responsible for hydrogen dissociation through an orbital overlapping."

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the metal dispersion and atomic ratios, specifically focusing on the Sn/Pt ratio. These advancements aim to improve the catalyst's performance by balancing the activity of hydrogen chemisorption sites, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation process. Theoretical calculations suggest that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer, facilitating more efficient hydrogen dissociation. By doing so, these strategies address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.
