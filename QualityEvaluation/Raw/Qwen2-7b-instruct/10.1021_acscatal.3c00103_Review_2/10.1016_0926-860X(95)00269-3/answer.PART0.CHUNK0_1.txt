[1] "Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts prepared by two-step impregnation (first tin), with a Sn/Pt atomic ratio ranging from zero to 6.72, were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and tested in isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Metal dispersion correlates linearly with reaction rate; both parameters reach a maximum when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio is about one."
[3] "The activity of the sites capable of hydrogen chemisorption, as expressed in turnover frequency number, TOF, decrease as the tin concentration is increased."
[4] "From theoretical ab-initio calculations, it is proposed that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer responsible for hydrogen dissociation through an orbital overlapping."

To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, researchers have developed strategies focusing on optimizing metal dispersion, particularly achieving a Sn/Pt atomic ratio of approximately one for maximum activity. These advancements aim to improve catalyst performance by reducing the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer through orbital overlapping, thus addressing challenges in catalyst design and fabrication. The study also indicates that increasing tin concentration decreases the activity of hydrogen chemisorption sites, suggesting a balance is needed for optimal catalytic efficiency.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究人员开发了策略，特别是通过将Sn/Pt原子比调整至约1来优化金属分散度，以实现最大活性。这些进展旨在通过轨道重叠减少铂-氢电荷传输，从而通过氢解离，解决催化剂设计和制造中的挑战。研究还表明，增加锡浓度会降低能够吸附氢的活性位点的活性，这表明需要找到最佳平衡以实现最优催化效率。
