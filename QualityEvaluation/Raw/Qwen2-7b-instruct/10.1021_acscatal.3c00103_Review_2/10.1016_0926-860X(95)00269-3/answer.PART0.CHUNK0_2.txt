[1] "Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts prepared by two-step impregnation (first tin), with a Sn/Pt atomic ratio ranging from zero to 6.72, were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and tested in isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Metal dispersion correlates linearly with reaction rate; both parameters reach a maximum when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio is about one."
[3] "The activity of the sites capable of hydrogen chemisorption, as expressed in turnover frequency number, TOF, decrease as the tin concentration is increased."
[4] "From theoretical ab-initio calculations, it is proposed that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer responsible for hydrogen dissociation through an orbital overlapping."

These studies demonstrate that the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes can be enhanced through strategic control of metal dispersion, particularly by adjusting the Sn/Pt atomic ratio to about one. This ratio optimizes the reaction rate, which is crucial for industrial applications. Additionally, incorporating tin into the catalyst structure helps reduce the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer, thereby facilitating hydrogen dissociation. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization.
