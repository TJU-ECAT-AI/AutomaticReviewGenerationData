[1] "Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts prepared by two-step impregnation (first tin), with a Sn/Pt atomic ratio ranging from zero to 6.72, were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and tested in isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Metal dispersion correlates linearly with reaction rate; both parameters reach a maximum when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio is about one."
[3] "The activity of the sites capable of hydrogen chemisorption, as expressed in turnover frequency number, TOF, decrease as the tin concentration is increased."
[4] "From theoretical ab-initio calculations, it is proposed that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer responsible for hydrogen dissociation through an orbital overlapping."

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of tin in conjunction with platinum on zinc aluminate. This combination allows for optimized dispersion of metals, which in turn affects the reaction rate. The Sn/Pt atomic ratio plays a crucial role in achieving maximum activity and stability. Theoretical calculations suggest that tin reduces the charge transfer between platinum and hydrogen, facilitating hydrogen dissociation more efficiently. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving efficiency and stability.
