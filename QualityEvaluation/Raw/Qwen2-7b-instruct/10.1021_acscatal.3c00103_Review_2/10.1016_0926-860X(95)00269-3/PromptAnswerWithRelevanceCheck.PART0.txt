[1] "Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts prepared by two-step impregnation (first tin), with a Sn/Pt atomic ratio ranging from zero to 6.72, were characterized by hydrogen chemisorption, temperature-programmed reduction and tested in isobutane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Metal dispersion correlates linearly with reaction rate; both parameters reach a maximum when the Sn/Pt atomic ratio is about one."
[3] "The activity of the sites capable of hydrogen chemisorption, as expressed in turnover frequency number, TOF, decrease as the tin concentration is increased."
[4] "From theoretical ab-initio calculations, it is proposed that tin reduces the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer responsible for hydrogen dissociation through an orbital overlapping."

The key strategies and approaches to enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the composition and dispersion of metals on the support material. In this study, Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts were prepared through a two-step impregnation process, which allowed for control over the Sn/Pt atomic ratio. This ratio was varied to find the optimal balance that maximizes both metal dispersion and reaction rate. The research suggests that tin, when present at a specific ratio with platinum, can reduce the platinum-hydrogen charge transfer, facilitating hydrogen dissociation. This is achieved through orbital overlapping, which likely enhances the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert reactants into products during isobutane dehydrogenation. The decrease in hydrogen chemisorption activity with increased tin concentration indicates that the relationship between tin content and catalyst performance is critical. By fine-tuning these parameters, the researchers aimed to optimize catalyst design, fabrication, and performance for industrial applications.
