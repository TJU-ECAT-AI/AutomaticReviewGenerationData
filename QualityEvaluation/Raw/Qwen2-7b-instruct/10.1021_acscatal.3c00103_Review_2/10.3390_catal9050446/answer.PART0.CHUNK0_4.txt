2.1. "In our previous study [23], we reported that oxychlorination treatment was effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, and we observed that catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys after oxychlorination treatment showed improved PDH activity."
2.2. "They applied a hydrogen reduction stage at high temperature (800 C) immediately after drying the catalyst without a calcination step."
2.3. "The SR catalysts showed overall higher values for the conversion of propane, as well as propylene selectivity, compared to Cal600."
2.4. "This might be attributed to the difference in catalyst support. In our case, Al2O3 may provide more favorable conditions to form the Pt3Sn alloy than the SiO2 support during direct reduction."
2.5. "The DTA curve for Cal600 has one inflection point. However, the DTA plots of the SR catalysts contained two inflection points, and the second peak is related to the coke 'drain-off' effect."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of specific catalyst supports, such as Al2O3, which provide favorable conditions for the formation of Pt3Sn alloys during direct reduction. This approach helps to improve both the conversion of propane and the selectivity towards propylene compared to conventional catalysts. Additionally, the inclusion of co-catalysts like Sn, especially in the form of the Pt3Sn alloy, can suppress unwanted side reactions, enhance propylene selectivity, and prevent catalyst deactivation. The direct reduction method, performed without calcination, allows for the formation of different PtSn alloys, with the Pt3Sn alloy being particularly advantageous for improving catalytic activity. The 'drain-off' effect, observed in the DTA analysis of the SR catalysts, suggests that coke can migrate to the edges of the Pt3Sn alloy, preserving active sites and allowing the PDH reaction to proceed for longer periods. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by enhancing stability, efficiency, and selectivity.

最近在直接脱氢化过程中增强支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及使用特定的催化剂支撑，如Al2O3，在直接还原过程中为形成Pt3Sn合金提供有利条件。这种方法有助于提高丙烷的转化率以及丙烯选择性，与常规催化剂相比。此外，特别是以Pt3Sn合金形式存在的共催化剂Sn的加入可以抑制不希望的副反应，增强丙烯选择性，并防止催化剂失活。直接还原方法，在没有煅烧的情况下进行，允许形成不同的PtSn合金，其中Pt3Sn合金特别有利于提高催化活性。在SR催化剂的DTA分析中观察到的“排水”效应表明，焦炭可以迁移到Pt3Sn合金的边缘，保持活性位点并允许PDH反应持续更长时间。这些进步解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的工业应用挑战，通过增强稳定性、效率和选择性来应对这些挑战。
