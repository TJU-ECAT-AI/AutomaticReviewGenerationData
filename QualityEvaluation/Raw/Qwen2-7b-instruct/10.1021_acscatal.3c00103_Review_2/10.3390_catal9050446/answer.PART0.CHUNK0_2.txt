<p>Propane conversion for the PDH reaction over the SR catalysts prepared by the direct reduction method, as well as that for the Cal600 catalyst prepared by conventional calcination.</p>
<p>Propylene selectivity values determined after 1 h were in the order of SR500 > SR550 > SR600 > Cal600 > SR450 > SR800 > SR900.</p>
<p>Two different alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, were detected between 38 and 46 in 2θ.</p>
<p>Images of each catalyst are shown at four magnifications. Compared to Cal600, the SR catalysts contain much smaller alloy particles.</p>
<p>The amount of coke is summarized in Table 1 (in the Discussion section).</p>
<p>It has been reported [24] that the first peak near 417 C can be attributed to coke combustion on either Pt or PtSn alloy sites, whereas the second peak near 494.4 C is due to the "drain-off" effect.</p>
<p>In the case of the SR550 catalyst, the difference in Pt contents was 50.45 at.% at the edge and 58.26 at.% in the core of a metal particle.</p>
<p>The DTA curve for Cal600 has one inflection point. However, the DTA plots of the SR catalysts contained two inflection points, and the second peak is related to the coke "drain-off" effect.</p>

The document highlights recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. These advancements focus on improving catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. Key strategies include:

1. **Direct Reduction Method**: Employing a direct reduction method to prepare catalysts without a calcination step. This method involves reducing the catalysts at high temperatures immediately after drying, leading to the formation of different PtSn alloys, specifically Pt3Sn and PtSn, which are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity.

2. **Alloy Formation**: Forming a specific alloy structure through the direct reduction process. The document reports that when the precursor ratio of Pt/Sn is 3 to 1.8 by weight (1:1 by mole), a larger amount of Pt3Sn and a smaller amount of PtSn alloy is formed. This is attributed to the difference in catalyst support, with Al2O3 providing more favorable conditions for forming the Pt3Sn alloy compared to SiO2.

3. **Particle Size Control**: Controlling the size of the metal particles to ensure better dispersion and interaction between nano-sized Pt and Sn particles. Smaller metal particles formed during reduction can result in increased interactions, enhancing the catalytic activity.

4. **Coke Behavior Analysis**: Analyzing the behavior of coke during the dehydrogenation process. The document notes that high activity catalysts, like the SR550 catalyst, can generate more coke, which accumulates and covers the catalyst active sites. However, the coke can migrate to the edges of the Pt3Sn alloy or PtxSny (x/y > 3) alloy, preserving active sites and allowing the dehydrogenation reaction to continue.

These strategies address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on the formation of specific alloy structures, control of particle size, and understanding the behavior of coke during the dehydrogenation process, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic stability and efficiency of the catalysts in industrial applications.

本文强调了在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂稳定性的近期策略和方法。这些进步集中在改进催化剂设计、制造和工业应用性能优化上。关键策略包括：

1. 直接还原法：采用直接还原方法准备催化剂，而无需煅烧步骤。这种方法涉及在干燥后立即在高温下还原催化剂，从而形成不同的PtSn合金，特别是Pt3Sn和PtSn，这导致催化活性的增强。

2. 合金形成：通过直接还原过程形成特定的合金结构。文献报告，当Pt/Sn的前体比为3:1.8（按重量计）时（1:1按摩尔计），形成了更多的Pt3Sn和较少的PtSn合金。这归因于催化剂支持的差异，其中Al2O3提供了形成Pt3Sn合金的更优条件，而不是SiO2。

3. 颗粒尺寸控制：控制金属颗粒的大小以确保更好的分散和纳米级Pt和Sn颗粒之间的相互作用。在还原过程中形成的较小金属颗粒可以导致增加的相互作用，增强催化活性。

4. 焦炭行为分析：分析焦炭在脱氢过程中的行为。文献指出，高活性催化剂，如SR550催化剂，可以生成更多焦炭，积累并覆盖催化剂活性位点。然而，焦炭可以迁移到Pt3Sn合金或PtxSny（x/y > 3）合金的边缘，保留活性位点，并允许脱氢反应继续进行。

这些策略通过关注特定合金结构的形成、颗粒尺寸的控制以及对脱氢过程中焦炭的行为的理解，从而在工业应用中提高催化剂的整体稳定性与效率，来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。
