<p>The demand for light olefins such as ethylene and propylene has increased continuously.</p>
<p>In this paper, we refer to Al2O3 without differentiating its α-, γ-, and θ-phases because the effect of the Al2O3 phase is not the objective of this study.</p>
<p>They applied a hydrogen reduction stage at high temperature (800 C) immediately after drying the catalyst without a calcination step.</p>
<p>The SR catalysts showed overall higher values for the conversion of propane, as well as propylene selectivity, compared to Cal600.</p>
<p>Of the SR catalysts, SR550 showed the highest activity.</p>
<p>This might be attributed to the difference in catalyst support. In our case, Al2O3 may provide more favorable conditions to form the Pt3Sn alloy than the SiO2 support during direct reduction.</p>
<p>Cal600 was found to contain larger metal particles, whereas the SR catalysts have nano-sized metal particles.</p>
<p>The DTA curve for Cal600 has one inflection point. However, the DTA plots of the SR catalysts contained two inflection points, and the second peak is related to the coke "drain-off" effect.</p>

1. The demand for light olefins like ethylene and propylene has seen continuous growth.
2. The paper does not differentiate between the α-, γ-, and θ-phases of Al2O3 as its focus is not on the effect of the Al2O3 phase.
3. A hydrogen reduction stage was conducted at 800°C immediately following the drying process without a calcination step.
4. The SR catalysts demonstrated superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to the Cal600 catalyst.
5. The SR550 catalyst showed the highest level of activity among the tested catalysts.
6. The direct reduction method likely favored the formation of the Pt3Sn alloy over the PtSn alloy on the Al2O3 support.
7. The Cal600 catalyst contained larger metal particles, while the SR catalysts featured nano-sized metal particles.
8. The DTA curve for Cal600 displayed a single inflection point, while the SR catalysts had two, with the second peak associated with the coke "drain-off" effect.

1. 对轻烯烃如乙烯和丙烯的需求持续增长。
2. 论文没有区分α-、γ-和θ型Al2O3，因为本研究不关注Al2O3相的影响。
3. 在干燥催化剂后立即进行氢气还原步骤，并在800°C下进行，而没有进行煅烧步骤。
4. SR催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面表现出比Cal600催化剂更高的值。
5. SR550催化剂在测试的催化剂中表现出最高的活性。
6. 直接还原方法可能在Al2O3支持上有利于形成Pt3Sn合金而不是PtSn合金。
7. Cal600催化剂包含较大的金属颗粒，而SR催化剂具有纳米级的金属颗粒。
8. Cal600的DTA曲线显示一个转折点，而SR催化剂的曲线有两个转折点，其中第二个峰值与焦炭“迁移”效应相关。
