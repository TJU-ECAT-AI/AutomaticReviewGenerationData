The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing direct reduction methods for catalyst preparation. This approach allows for the formation of different PtSn alloys, particularly the Pt3Sn alloy, which can offer improved catalytic performance compared to conventional calcination methods. By controlling the precursor ratio of Pt/Sn, it is possible to optimize the formation of these alloys, leading to catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. The use of Al2O3 as a support material is preferred due to its superior thermal and mechanical stability, facilitating the formation of the Pt3Sn alloy. Moreover, the direct reduction process leads to the creation of nano-sized metal particles, which increases the surface area and improves the interaction between Pt and Sn, enhancing the catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the formation of coke during the PDH reaction is analyzed through DTA, revealing that high activity catalysts may generate more coke, which can migrate to the edges of Pt3Sn alloy particles, preserving active sites and prolonging the catalytic life of the material.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发的关键策略和方法包括使用直接还原法进行催化剂制备。这种方法允许形成不同的PtSn合金，特别是Pt3Sn合金，相较于传统的煅烧方法，这种合金可以提供更好的催化性能。通过控制Pt/Sn的前驱体比例，可以优化合金的形成，从而提高催化剂的活性和选择性。由于其优越的热稳定性和机械稳定性，使用Al2O3作为载体材料是首选的，这有利于形成Pt3Sn合金。此外，直接还原过程导致纳米级金属颗粒的产生，这增加了表面积并提高了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，从而增强催化效率。此外，通过对PDH反应中生成的焦炭的分析，发现高活性催化剂可能生成更多的焦炭，这些焦炭可以迁移到Pt3Sn合金颗粒的边缘，保持活性位点，延长材料的催化寿命。

1. Recently, researchers have focused on developing strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. Key approaches include the use of direct reduction methods to prepare catalysts without the conventional calcination step, which can result in the formation of different PtSn alloys. These advancements aim to optimize catalyst design, fabrication, and performance by creating nano-sized metal particles and promoting the formation of specific alloy compositions that can improve reactivity and stability. Additionally, treatments such as oxychlorination are being explored to regenerate catalysts and maintain their efficiency after use.

2. The direct reduction method involves applying a high-temperature hydrogen reduction stage immediately after drying the catalyst, bypassing the calcination step typically used in conventional catalyst preparation. This approach allows for the formation of PtSn alloys that are believed to enhance the catalytic activity of the dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Although PtSn alloys can form on both Al2O3 and SiO2 supports, the direct reduction process may lead to the rearrangement of these alloys depending on the specific conditions and support properties. This indicates that the choice of support and the direct reduction process play crucial roles in determining the type and distribution of the formed alloys.

4. The coke behavior was analyzed through differential thermal analysis (DTA), revealing differences in the coke accumulation and migration between the conventional calcined catalyst (Cal600) and the directly reduced catalysts (SR). The SR catalysts displayed two inflection points in their DTA curves, suggesting that coke tends to migrate from the metal sites to the surface of the catalyst support, potentially preserving active sites and allowing the dehydrogenation reaction to continue for a longer duration. This phenomenon, referred to as the 'drain-off' effect, highlights the potential for enhanced stability and activity of directly reduced catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

1. 近期，研究人员在直接脱氢化过程中增强支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性的策略和方法上进行了重点研究。关键的方法包括采用直接还原法准备催化剂，避免了常规煅烧步骤，从而可以形成不同类型的PtSn合金。这些进步旨在通过创造纳米级金属颗粒并促进特定合金组成的选择，优化催化剂设计、制造和性能，以提高反应性和稳定性。此外，正在探索如氯氧再生等处理方法来再生催化剂并维持其使用后的效率。

2. 直接还原法涉及在干燥催化剂后立即应用高温氢气还原阶段，跳过了传统催化剂制备中常用的煅烧步骤。这种方法允许形成PtSn合金，据信可以增强脱氢反应的活性。

3. 尽管PtSn合金可以在Al2O3和SiO2两种支持材料上形成，但直接还原过程可能会导致这些合金的重新排列，这取决于具体的条件和支持性质。这表明选择支持材料和直接还原过程对于确定形成合金的类型和分布至关重要。

4. 通过差示热分析（DTA）分析了焦炭行为，揭示了常规煅烧催化剂（Cal600）与直接还原催化剂之间在焦炭积累和迁移上的差异。SR催化剂显示出了DTA曲线中的两个转折点，表明焦炭倾向于从金属位点迁移到催化剂支持物的表面，可能保留活性位点，并允许脱氢反应持续更长时间。这种现象被称为“排出”效应，突显了直接还原催化剂在脱氢过程中可能增强稳定性和活性的潜力。

The document highlights recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. These advancements focus on improving catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. Key strategies include:

1. **Direct Reduction Method**: Employing a direct reduction method to prepare catalysts without a calcination step. This method involves reducing the catalysts at high temperatures immediately after drying, leading to the formation of different PtSn alloys, specifically Pt3Sn and PtSn, which are responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity.

2. **Alloy Formation**: Forming a specific alloy structure through the direct reduction process. The document reports that when the precursor ratio of Pt/Sn is 3 to 1.8 by weight (1:1 by mole), a larger amount of Pt3Sn and a smaller amount of PtSn alloy is formed. This is attributed to the difference in catalyst support, with Al2O3 providing more favorable conditions for forming the Pt3Sn alloy compared to SiO2.

3. **Particle Size Control**: Controlling the size of the metal particles to ensure better dispersion and interaction between nano-sized Pt and Sn particles. Smaller metal particles formed during reduction can result in increased interactions, enhancing the catalytic activity.

4. **Coke Behavior Analysis**: Analyzing the behavior of coke during the dehydrogenation process. The document notes that high activity catalysts, like the SR550 catalyst, can generate more coke, which accumulates and covers the catalyst active sites. However, the coke can migrate to the edges of the Pt3Sn alloy or PtxSny (x/y > 3) alloy, preserving active sites and allowing the dehydrogenation reaction to continue.

These strategies address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on the formation of specific alloy structures, control of particle size, and understanding the behavior of coke during the dehydrogenation process, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic stability and efficiency of the catalysts in industrial applications.

本文强调了在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂稳定性的近期策略和方法。这些进步集中在改进催化剂设计、制造和工业应用性能优化上。关键策略包括：

1. 直接还原法：采用直接还原方法准备催化剂，而无需煅烧步骤。这种方法涉及在干燥后立即在高温下还原催化剂，从而形成不同的PtSn合金，特别是Pt3Sn和PtSn，这导致催化活性的增强。

2. 合金形成：通过直接还原过程形成特定的合金结构。文献报告，当Pt/Sn的前体比为3:1.8（按重量计）时（1:1按摩尔计），形成了更多的Pt3Sn和较少的PtSn合金。这归因于催化剂支持的差异，其中Al2O3提供了形成Pt3Sn合金的更优条件，而不是SiO2。

3. 颗粒尺寸控制：控制金属颗粒的大小以确保更好的分散和纳米级Pt和Sn颗粒之间的相互作用。在还原过程中形成的较小金属颗粒可以导致增加的相互作用，增强催化活性。

4. 焦炭行为分析：分析焦炭在脱氢过程中的行为。文献指出，高活性催化剂，如SR550催化剂，可以生成更多焦炭，积累并覆盖催化剂活性位点。然而，焦炭可以迁移到Pt3Sn合金或PtxSny（x/y > 3）合金的边缘，保留活性位点，并允许脱氢反应继续进行。

这些策略通过关注特定合金结构的形成、颗粒尺寸的控制以及对脱氢过程中焦炭的行为的理解，从而在工业应用中提高催化剂的整体稳定性与效率，来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of specific catalyst supports, such as Al2O3, which provide favorable conditions for the formation of Pt3Sn alloys during direct reduction. This approach helps to improve both the conversion of propane and the selectivity towards propylene compared to conventional catalysts. Additionally, the inclusion of co-catalysts like Sn, especially in the form of the Pt3Sn alloy, can suppress unwanted side reactions, enhance propylene selectivity, and prevent catalyst deactivation. The direct reduction method, performed without calcination, allows for the formation of different PtSn alloys, with the Pt3Sn alloy being particularly advantageous for improving catalytic activity. The 'drain-off' effect, observed in the DTA analysis of the SR catalysts, suggests that coke can migrate to the edges of the Pt3Sn alloy, preserving active sites and allowing the PDH reaction to proceed for longer periods. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by enhancing stability, efficiency, and selectivity.
