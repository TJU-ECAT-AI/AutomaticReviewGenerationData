[1] "In our previous study [23], we reported that oxychlorination treatment was effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, and we observed that catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys after oxychlorination treatment showed improved PDH activity."
[2] "They applied a hydrogen reduction stage at high temperature (800 C) immediately after drying the catalyst without a calcination step."
[3] "However, we agree that PtSn alloy can be formed on both supports, but the rearrangement of different alloys may occur when a direct reduction process is employed."
[4] "In addition, the coke behavior was analyzed by DTA. The DTA curve for Cal600 has one inflection point. However, the DTA plots of the SR catalysts contained two inflection points, and the second peak is related to the coke 'drain-off' effect."

1. Recently, researchers have focused on developing strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. Key approaches include the use of direct reduction methods to prepare catalysts without the conventional calcination step, which can result in the formation of different PtSn alloys. These advancements aim to optimize catalyst design, fabrication, and performance by creating nano-sized metal particles and promoting the formation of specific alloy compositions that can improve reactivity and stability. Additionally, treatments such as oxychlorination are being explored to regenerate catalysts and maintain their efficiency after use.

2. The direct reduction method involves applying a high-temperature hydrogen reduction stage immediately after drying the catalyst, bypassing the calcination step typically used in conventional catalyst preparation. This approach allows for the formation of PtSn alloys that are believed to enhance the catalytic activity of the dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Although PtSn alloys can form on both Al2O3 and SiO2 supports, the direct reduction process may lead to the rearrangement of these alloys depending on the specific conditions and support properties. This indicates that the choice of support and the direct reduction process play crucial roles in determining the type and distribution of the formed alloys.

4. The coke behavior was analyzed through differential thermal analysis (DTA), revealing differences in the coke accumulation and migration between the conventional calcined catalyst (Cal600) and the directly reduced catalysts (SR). The SR catalysts displayed two inflection points in their DTA curves, suggesting that coke tends to migrate from the metal sites to the surface of the catalyst support, potentially preserving active sites and allowing the dehydrogenation reaction to continue for a longer duration. This phenomenon, referred to as the 'drain-off' effect, highlights the potential for enhanced stability and activity of directly reduced catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

1. 近期，研究人员在直接脱氢化过程中增强支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性的策略和方法上进行了重点研究。关键的方法包括采用直接还原法准备催化剂，避免了常规煅烧步骤，从而可以形成不同类型的PtSn合金。这些进步旨在通过创造纳米级金属颗粒并促进特定合金组成的选择，优化催化剂设计、制造和性能，以提高反应性和稳定性。此外，正在探索如氯氧再生等处理方法来再生催化剂并维持其使用后的效率。

2. 直接还原法涉及在干燥催化剂后立即应用高温氢气还原阶段，跳过了传统催化剂制备中常用的煅烧步骤。这种方法允许形成PtSn合金，据信可以增强脱氢反应的活性。

3. 尽管PtSn合金可以在Al2O3和SiO2两种支持材料上形成，但直接还原过程可能会导致这些合金的重新排列，这取决于具体的条件和支持性质。这表明选择支持材料和直接还原过程对于确定形成合金的类型和分布至关重要。

4. 通过差示热分析（DTA）分析了焦炭行为，揭示了常规煅烧催化剂（Cal600）与直接还原催化剂之间在焦炭积累和迁移上的差异。SR催化剂显示出了DTA曲线中的两个转折点，表明焦炭倾向于从金属位点迁移到催化剂支持物的表面，可能保留活性位点，并允许脱氢反应持续更长时间。这种现象被称为“排出”效应，突显了直接还原催化剂在脱氢过程中可能增强稳定性和活性的潜力。
