<p>Direct reduction was employed to prepare PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared at temperatures from 450 to 900 C, and the catalytic performance was evaluated in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.</p>
<p>The SR catalysts showed overall higher values for the conversion of propane, as well as propylene selectivity, compared to Cal600.</p>
<p>Of the SR catalysts, SR550 showed the highest activity.</p>
<p>The direct reduction method results in the formation of different PtSn alloys, and PtSn and Pt3Sn alloys were identified.</p>
<p>A larger amount of Pt3Sn and a smaller amount of PtSn alloy was formed after direct reduction when the precursor ratio of Pt/Sn was 3 to 1.8 by weight (1:1 by mole).</p>
<p>This might be attributed to the difference in catalyst support. In our case, Al2O3 may provide more favorable conditions to form the Pt3Sn alloy than the SiO2 support during direct reduction.</p>
<p>Cal600 was found to contain larger metal particles, whereas the SR catalysts have nano-sized metal particles.</p>
<p>High activity catalysts could generate more coke, which would accumulate and cover the catalyst active sites. The well-dispersed Pt3Sn alloy may accelerate the PDH reaction and generate more coke.</p>

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing direct reduction methods for catalyst preparation. This approach allows for the formation of different PtSn alloys, particularly the Pt3Sn alloy, which can offer improved catalytic performance compared to conventional calcination methods. By controlling the precursor ratio of Pt/Sn, it is possible to optimize the formation of these alloys, leading to catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity. The use of Al2O3 as a support material is preferred due to its superior thermal and mechanical stability, facilitating the formation of the Pt3Sn alloy. Moreover, the direct reduction process leads to the creation of nano-sized metal particles, which increases the surface area and improves the interaction between Pt and Sn, enhancing the catalytic efficiency. Additionally, the formation of coke during the PDH reaction is analyzed through DTA, revealing that high activity catalysts may generate more coke, which can migrate to the edges of Pt3Sn alloy particles, preserving active sites and prolonging the catalytic life of the material.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发的关键策略和方法包括使用直接还原法进行催化剂制备。这种方法允许形成不同的PtSn合金，特别是Pt3Sn合金，相较于传统的煅烧方法，这种合金可以提供更好的催化性能。通过控制Pt/Sn的前驱体比例，可以优化合金的形成，从而提高催化剂的活性和选择性。由于其优越的热稳定性和机械稳定性，使用Al2O3作为载体材料是首选的，这有利于形成Pt3Sn合金。此外，直接还原过程导致纳米级金属颗粒的产生，这增加了表面积并提高了Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，从而增强催化效率。此外，通过对PDH反应中生成的焦炭的分析，发现高活性催化剂可能生成更多的焦炭，这些焦炭可以迁移到Pt3Sn合金颗粒的边缘，保持活性位点，延长材料的催化寿命。
