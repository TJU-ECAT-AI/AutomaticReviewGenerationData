<p>The synergistic mechanism of Pt-modified Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation is discussed. The presence of Pt can assist H2 dissociation and increase the surface coverage of hydrogen species, which promotes the propylene production.</p>
<p>With excessive Pt, Gaδ+ can be further reduced to form PtGa alloy with less surface hydrogen species. Consequently, the relative propylene formation rate between PtGaOx and the summed contribution of individual Pt and GaOx increases linearly with the content of hydrogen species.</p>
<p>Optimally, the relative propylene formation rate of PtGaOx with 0.03wt% Pt exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual components.</p>
<p>The synergy between metals and metal oxides can effectively improve the heterogeneous catalytic process. This paper describes the intrinsic effect of Pt modification over GaOx (PtGaOx) on propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>With the increase of Pt loading, the propylene formation rate on Pt-modified gallium oxide is promoted compared to the summation of contribution of individual pure Pt and gallium oxide. The promotion, i.e., the relative propylene formation rate, is utilized to describe synergistic effect, presenting a volcano-shaped profile.</p>
<p>Moreover, the relative propylene formation rate has a linear relationship with the surface Gaδ+H content which has a higher activation capability for propane.</p>
<p>When Pt loading is 0.03wt% with Pt-modified defective gallium oxide surface structure, the most prominent synergistic promotion for propane dehydrogenation is achieved due to the highest coverage of surface Gaδ+H species.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt facilitates the hydrogen dissociation and spillover on Ga2O3 surface, leading to a higher Gaδ+H content and stronger propane activation ability.</p>
<p>When Pt loading is more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+ is further reduced to form PtGa alloy, which causes the less Gaδ+H and the decrease of the synergistic effect.</p>
<p>The analysis of surface species under in situ conditions can establish the relationship between the catalytic reactivity and surface species, which provides a promising route for exploring the catalytic mechanism of metal-oxide catalysts.</p>

The document discusses the synergistic mechanism of platinum-gallium oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, focusing on how the presence of platinum assists in hydrogen dissociation and increases the surface coverage of hydrogen species, thus enhancing propylene production. Excessive platinum can reduce gallium oxide to form a platinum-gallium alloy with reduced surface hydrogen species, leading to an increased relative propylene formation rate. The relative propylene formation rate shows a volcano-shaped profile with the increase of platinum loading and has a linear relationship with the surface gallium δ+ hydrogen content, which activates propane more effectively. The optimal amount of platinum, 0.03 wt%, yields the highest coverage of surface gallium δ+ hydrogen species, facilitating the most pronounced synergistic promotion for propane dehydrogenation. Platinum promotes hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the gallium oxide surface, increasing the gallium δ+ hydrogen content and the propane activation ability. Beyond 0.1 wt% of platinum, the gallium δ+ species are further reduced to form a platinum-gallium alloy, causing a decrease in the synergistic effect due to reduced gallium δ+ hydrogen content.

本文讨论了铂改性的镓氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的协同机制，重点在于铂如何促进氢分子解离并增加表面氢物种的覆盖度，从而提高丙烯产量。过量的铂可以将镓氧化物还原成铂镓合金，减少表面氢物种，导致相对丙烯形成速率增加。相对丙烯形成速率呈现出火山形曲线，并且与表面镓δ+氢含量线性相关，后者对丙烷激活能力更强。铂加载量为0.03 wt%，表面镓δ+氢物种覆盖率最高，实现了最显著的协同促进作用，对于丙烷脱氢。铂促进氢分子解离并在镓氧化物表面溢出，增加表面镓δ+氢含量和丙烷激活能力。铂含量超过0.1 wt%，镓δ+物种进一步被还原成铂镓合金，导致协同效应降低，由于减少了镓δ+氢含量。
