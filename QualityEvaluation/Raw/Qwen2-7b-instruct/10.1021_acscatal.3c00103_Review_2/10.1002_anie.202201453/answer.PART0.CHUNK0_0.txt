<p>Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers5a revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability. In addition, the importance of noble metals in promoting H2 dissociation is emphasized. Kondratenko and co-workers6b suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction.</p>
<p>In this work, to identify the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3 for PDH with H2 cofeeding, Ga2O3 catalysts modified with various Pt loadings were investigated. Based on high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM), quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (quasi in situ XPS), D2 temperature-programmed surface reaction (D2-TPSR) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) measurements, the surface structure and gallium hydride/hydroxide species of PtGa2O3 were explored. The intrinsic role of Pt and its effect on gallium oxides were also discussed.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of xPt3Ga2O3 for PDH reaction is examined. To exclude diffusion effect, the tests are under kinetic regime. The initial propylene formation rate, which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formation per mass of catalyst per hour, is collected at 5minutes of the reaction. As shown in Figure1a, the formation rate increases until the content of Pt reaches 0.03wt% and then remains slowly increases when Pt increases to 0.3wt%.</p>
<p>Over 3Ga2O3 catalyst, 5nm Ga2O3 nanoparticles are observed (Figure2ac). The lattice spacings are 0.264, 0.254 and 0.241nm, corresponding to Ga2O3 (121), (111) and (401) plane, respectively.15 The homogeneous distribution of gallium on Al2O3 support is confirmed by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping analysis (FigureS2a).</p>
<p>Quasi in situ XPS experiments were conducted after H2 reduction for 60min at 600C to test the valance state of Ga on the surface. Binding energies in spectra of Ga 2p3/2 at 1118.9, 1117.6 and 1116.8eV are assigned to Ga3+, Gaδ+ (0<δ<3), and Ga0 ions,4b, 17 respectively (Figure3a). Cybulskis etal.4b suggested the Ga species at 1117.6eV can be ascribed to the partially reduced Ga through operando XANES and XPS after H2 pre-treated at 650C, and H ligand can be coordinated to the partially reduced Ga. The formation of oxygen vacancy leads to the change of Ga charge, which affects the valence state of Ga.</p>
<p>To summarize, after one-hour H2 reduction at 600C, the corresponding surface structures of 3Ga2O3, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 and 0.1Pt3Ga2O3 are partially reduced gallium oxide (GaOx), partially reduced gallium oxide with Pt (PtGaOx) and partially reduced gallium oxide with Pt1Ga1 alloy (PtGa-GaOx), respectively. According to the relative reactivity for PDH (Figure1b), it is supposed that PtGaOx surface structure plays a significant role in the mutual promotion effect.</p>
<p>When Pt loading is less than 0.1wt%, it is observed that the trends of formation rate and Gaδ+H intensity with Pt loading are consistent. However, inconsistent trends are observed with Pt loading of more than 0.1wt%, in which the formation rate remains relatively stable while Gaδ+H intensity sharply decreases with Pt. This indicates the effect of gallium oxide on PDH could become weaker with the increase of Pt, which may lead to the change of the active sites.</p>

1. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of noble metals, specifically Pt, to improve the reactivity and stability of metal oxides like Ga2O3. This is achieved by promoting H2 dissociation, which increases the surface coverage of hydrogen species, thereby enhancing the activation of propane molecules. The presence of Pt assists in the regeneration of GaH/GaOH species, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Advances in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications focus on the synergistic interaction between metals and metal oxides. By modifying metal oxides with noble metals, researchers aim to create catalysts with improved reactivity and stability. The use of Pt as a promoter for Ga2O3 catalysts allows for the enhancement of propane dehydrogenation rates by facilitating H2 dissociation and improving the surface coverage of hydrogen species, leading to increased propylene production. This approach addresses the challenges in catalyst design by optimizing the catalytic activity and stability, making them more suitable for industrial applications.

3. The intrinsic role of Pt in enhancing the catalytic performance of metal oxides lies in its ability to facilitate H2 dissociation, leading to the formation of hydrogen species that can more effectively activate the propane molecules. This is particularly evident in the context of PDH reactions, where Pt-modified Ga2O3 catalysts exhibit improved propylene formation rates compared to pure Ga2O3 or Pt alone. The synergy between Pt and Ga2O3 catalysts is characterized by a volcano-shaped profile, indicating a significant enhancement in the propylene formation rate when the Pt loading is optimized.

4. The analysis of surface species under in situ conditions provides insights into the catalytic reactivity and surface species composition, offering a promising route for exploring the catalytic mechanism of metal-oxide catalysts. The examination of surface structures, chemical states, and surface species like Gaδ+H (partially reduced gallium species) reveals that these elements play a critical role in the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3. The presence of Pt facilitates the hydrogen dissociation and spillover on Ga2O3 surface, leading to a higher coverage of Gaδ+H species, which in turn enhances the propane activation ability and propylene formation rate.

5. The optimization of Pt loading on Ga2O3 catalysts is crucial for achieving the most pronounced synergistic promotion in propane dehydrogenation. At a Pt loading of 0.03wt%, the catalyst exhibits the highest propylene formation rate due to the optimal coverage of Gaδ+H species, which are responsible for the enhanced dehydrogenation activity. This optimal Pt loading enables the most effective hydrogen dissociation and spillover, leading to a higher surface concentration of active species and improved catalytic performance.
