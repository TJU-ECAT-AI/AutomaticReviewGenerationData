<p>The synergy between metals and metal oxides can effectively improve the heterogeneous catalytic process.</p>
<p>This paper describes the intrinsic effect of Pt modification over GaOx (PtGaOx) on propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane.</p>
<p>With excessive Pt, Gaδ+ can be further reduced to form PtGa alloy with less surface hydrogen species.</p>
<p>Consequently, the relative propylene formation rate between PtGaOx and the summed contribution of individual Pt and GaOx increases linearly with the content of hydrogen species.</p>
<p>Optimally, the relative propylene formation rate of PtGaOx with 0.03wt% Pt exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual components.</p>
<p>To identify the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3 for PDH with H2 cofeeding, Ga2O3 catalysts modified with various Pt loadings were investigated.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure1a, the formation rate increases until the content of Pt reaches 0.03wt% and then remains slowly increases when Pt increases to 0.3wt%.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the synergistic effect of the Pt-modified gallium oxide catalysts on PDH reactivity, Pt and Ga2O3 catalysts are tested as reference, respectively.</p>
<p>Over 3Ga2O3 catalyst, 5nm Ga2O3 nanoparticles are observed.</p>
<p>Over 0.03Pt3Ga2O3, Pt nanoparticles are 0.80.2nm, which is relatively scattered and isolated.</p>
<p>Over 0.1Pt3Ga2O3, Pt nanoparticles of 1.20.3nm are found.</p>
<p>According to the relative reactivity for PDH (Figure1b), it is supposed that PtGaOx surface structure plays a significant role in the mutual promotion effect.</p>
<p>When Pt loading is 0.03wt% with Pt-modified defective gallium oxide surface structure, the most prominent synergistic promotion for propane dehydrogenation is achieved due to the highest coverage of surface Gaδ+H species.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt facilitates the hydrogen dissociation and spillover on Ga2O3 surface, leading to a higher Gaδ+H content and stronger propane activation ability.</p>
<p>When Pt loading is more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+ is further reduced to form PtGa alloy, which causes the less Gaδ+H and the decrease of the synergistic effect.</p>

1. Recent strategies for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the incorporation of noble metals like platinum (Pt) into metal oxides, which improves the stability and efficiency of the catalysts.

2. These advancements aim to address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving the reactivity and stability of the catalysts, reducing the risk of deactivation, and enhancing the selectivity towards desired products.

3. The key approaches include the use of Pt as a promoter to enhance the catalytic performance of metal oxide-based catalysts, such as gallium oxide (GaOx), through the promotion of hydrogen dissociation and the formation of active surface species.

4. The Pt-modified gallium oxide catalysts show a volcano-shaped profile for the relative propylene formation rate, indicating a synergistic effect that is maximized at a specific Pt loading, which is crucial for achieving optimal performance.

5. The surface structure and composition of Pt-modified gallium oxide catalysts play a significant role in the synergistic effect. The presence of Pt facilitates the hydrogen dissociation and spillover on the Ga2O3 surface, leading to the formation of active surface species that promote the dehydrogenation of propane.

6. The optimal Pt loading for maximizing the synergistic effect depends on the balance between the promotion of hydrogen dissociation and the formation of PtGa alloy, which can reduce the surface concentration of active species.

7. The analysis of surface species under in situ conditions establishes a relationship between the catalytic reactivity and the surface species, providing insights into the catalytic mechanism and guiding the design of more efficient metal-oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
