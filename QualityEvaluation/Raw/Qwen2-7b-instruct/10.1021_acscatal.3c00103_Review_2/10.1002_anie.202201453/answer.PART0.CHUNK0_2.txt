<p>This paper describes the intrinsic effect of Pt modification over GaOx (PtGaOx) on propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane.</p>
<p>Optimally, the relative propylene formation rate of PtGaOx with 0.03wt% Pt exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual components.</p>
<p>In this work, to identify the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3 for PDH with H2 cofeeding, Ga2O3 catalysts modified with various Pt loadings were investigated.</p>
<p>Over 3Ga2O3 catalyst, 5nm Ga2O3 nanoparticles are observed.</p>
<p>Without Pt doping, there are 19% Gaδ+ and 81% Ga3+ on the surface, indicating the Ga2O3 can hardly be completely reduced by H2.</p>
<p>When the content of Pt increases to more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+ is rare on the surface because the excessive Pt helps the further reduction of Gaδ+ to Ga0 with formation of Pt1Ga1 alloy.</p>
<p>According to the relative reactivity for PDH (Figure1b), it is supposed that PtGaOx surface structure plays a significant role in the mutual promotion effect.</p>
<p>Moreover, the relative propylene formation rate has a linear relationship with the surface Gaδ+H content which has a higher activation capability for propane.</p>
<p>When Pt loading is more than 0.1wt%, Gaδ+ is further reduced to form PtGa alloy, which causes the less Gaδ+H and the decrease of the synergistic effect.</p>

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of noble metals as promoters to improve the reactivity of metal oxides. This involves the promotion of H2 dissociation and the enhancement of the surface coverage of hydrogen species, which facilitates the activation of CH in propane. The synergy between metals and metal oxides is crucial for improving the heterogeneous catalytic process. By modifying metal oxides with noble metals like platinum, researchers aim to achieve a higher propylene formation rate compared to the sum of contributions from individual pure metal and oxide components. The optimal Pt loading for achieving the most pronounced synergistic promotion in propane dehydrogenation is 0.03 wt%, resulting in the highest coverage of surface Gaδ+H species. The presence of Pt assists in hydrogen dissociation and spillover onto the Ga2O3 surface, leading to a higher Gaδ+H content and stronger propane activation ability. However, when the Pt loading exceeds 0.1 wt%, the excess Pt helps in the further reduction of Gaδ+ to form PtGa alloy, which causes a decrease in Gaδ+H and subsequently diminishes the synergistic effect.

最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发了一些关键策略和方法。这些策略包括使用贵金属作为促进剂来提高金属氧化物的活性。这涉及促进氢分子分解以及增强表面氢物种的覆盖度，从而有利于丙烷中CH基团的活化。金属与金属氧化物之间的协同作用对于改善异相催化过程至关重要。通过向金属氧化物中添加贵金属如铂，研究人员旨在实现丙烯生成速率的提高，超过单独纯金属和氧化物成分贡献之和。在实现丙烷脱氢过程中最显著协同促进效果的最佳铂负载为0.03 wt%，这导致表面Gaδ+H物种的最大覆盖率。铂的存在有助于氢分子分解并溢流到Ga2O3表面，导致更高的Gaδ+H含量和更强的丙烷激活能力。然而，当铂负载超过0.1 wt%时，过量的铂有助于进一步还原Gaδ+形成PtGa合金，这会导致Gaδ+H减少并相应地削弱协同效应。
