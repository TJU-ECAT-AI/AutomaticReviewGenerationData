Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve designing catalysts that can simultaneously increase activity and selectivity. These strategies aim to address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. Notably, the synthesis of Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, which exhibit excellent stability and high propylene selectivity at high temperatures, represents a significant breakthrough. The Pt/Cu SAA catalysts demonstrate improved stability over traditional Pt-based alloys, enabling their use in high-temperature dehydrogenation reactions without experiencing rapid deactivation. The isolation of Pt atoms in the metallic state on Cu nanoparticles is a promising approach for enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity in alkane dehydrogenation processes. The practical demonstration of the transferability of theoretical predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations to real-world catalytic reactions showcases the effectiveness of these advanced catalysts in achieving enhanced performance for dehydrogenation reactions.
