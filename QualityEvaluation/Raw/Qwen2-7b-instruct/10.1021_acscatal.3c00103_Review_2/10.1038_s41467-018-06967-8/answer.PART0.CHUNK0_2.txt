[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis."
[4] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream at 520C."

1. The ultimate goal of researchers in developing new catalysts is to achieve both enhanced activity and selectivity.
2. The catalytic properties of PtM alloys, as indicated by previous DFT calculations, are restricted by the scaling relationship, leading to improved selectivity for propylene but reduced intrinsic dehydrogenation activity for propane.
3. Single-atom catalysis is a rapidly advancing area in heterogeneous catalysis.
4. The synthesized Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) exhibits excellent stability, lasting for at least 120 hours under operating conditions at 520 degrees Celsius.

1. 研究人员在开发新催化剂的目标始终是同时提高活性和选择性。
2. 根据先前的DFT计算，这些PtM合金的催化性质确实受到缩放关系的限制，这通常导致丙烯选择性增加而脱氢作用降低。
3. 单原子催化已成为异质催化研究的活跃前沿领域之一。
4. 合成的Pt/Cu单原子合金（SAA）表现出出色的稳定性，在520摄氏度下运行至少120小时。
