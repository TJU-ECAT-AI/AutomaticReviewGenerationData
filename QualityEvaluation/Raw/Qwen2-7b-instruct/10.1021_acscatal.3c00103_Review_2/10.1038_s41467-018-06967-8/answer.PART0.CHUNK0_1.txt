To address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, recent advancements focus on developing catalysts that can simultaneously enhance activity and selectivity. Single-atom catalysis has emerged as a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, offering distinct and often outstanding performances in various chemical reactions. In the context of propane dehydrogenation, researchers have designed single atom alloy (SAAs) containing platinum (Pt) and copper (Cu) to break the scaling relationship typically encountered with noble metal alloys. This innovation allows for a significant improvement in propylene selectivity while maintaining a slight loss in intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. These SAAs demonstrate excellent stability at high temperatures, unlike their low-temperature counterparts, making them suitable for industrial applications.

为了应对催化剂设计、制造和性能优化在工业应用中的挑战，最近的发展集中在开发既能增强活性又能提高选择性的催化剂。单原子催化已成为异质催化的一个有前景的新前沿，为各种化学反应提供了独特且往往杰出的表现。在丙烷脱氢的背景下，研究人员设计了由铂(Pt)和铜(Cu)组成的单原子合金(SAAs)，以打破通常与过渡金属表面吸附能相关的缩放关系。这种创新允许显著提高丙烯的选择性，同时保持微弱的脱氢活性损失。这些SAAs在高温下表现出出色的稳定性，与低温应用不同，使其适合工业应用。
