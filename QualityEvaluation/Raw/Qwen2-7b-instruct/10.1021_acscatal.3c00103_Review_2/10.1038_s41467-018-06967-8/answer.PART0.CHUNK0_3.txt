[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity for the target product."
[3] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently."
[5] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis."
[6] "A large number of single-atom catalysts exhibit distinct and often outstanding performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions."
[7] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream at 520C."
[8] "Compared with Pt nanoparticles, a little higher temperature of CH activation for Pt/Cu SAA suggests a slightly weaker intrinsic activity of dehydrogenation."
[9] "During the PDH at 520C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6molg1Pth1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12h on stream."
[10] "As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12h on stream."
[11] "Although DFT calculations predict slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA, its higher propylene formation rate can be attributed to its better Pt dispersion compared with 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Pt dispersion=29%)."

1. The ultimate goal of researchers in developing new catalysts is to achieve both enhanced activity and selectivity simultaneously.
2. The enhancement of catalytic activity often comes with side reactions, reducing the selectivity for the desired product due to the scaling relationship.
3. Previous DFT calculations have shown that noble metal alloys like PtM are restricted by the scaling relationship, leading to improved selectivity but decreased intrinsic activity.
4. Developing a catalyst that breaks the scaling relationship is crucial for achieving concurrent improvements in activity and selectivity.
5. Single-atom catalysis has emerged as a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis.
6. Single-atom catalysts have demonstrated exceptional performance across various chemical reactions.
7. The synthesized Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) maintains excellent stability at high temperatures, unlike previous low-temperature SAA applications.
8. The intrinsic activity of dehydrogenation for Pt/Cu SAA is slightly weaker compared to Pt nanoparticles, as indicated by the temperature of CH activation.
9. The propylene formation rate for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 decreased significantly after 12 hours of operation during PDH at 520°C.
10. The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst did not experience deactivation over 12 hours of operation at the same conditions.
11. The higher propylene formation rate of Pt/Cu SAA compared to 0.1Pt/Al2O3 can be attributed to its superior dispersion of Pt atoms, despite a slightly higher dehydrogenation barrier.

1. 研究人员在开发新催化剂时的最终目标是同时实现活性和选择性的增强。
2. 催化剂活性的增强往往伴随着副反应，降低了目标产物的选择性，这是由于存在缩放关系。
3. 之前的DFT计算表明，如PtM这样的贵金属合金确实受限于缩放关系，导致对丙烯的促进选择性与脱氢反应的内在活性下降。
4. 开发能够打破缩放关系的催化剂对于实现活性和选择性的同步提升至关重要。
5. 单原子催化已经成为异质催化领域最活跃的新前沿之一。
6. 大量单原子催化剂在广泛的化学反应中表现出独特的出色性能。
7. 合成的Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAA)在高温下保持了出色的稳定性，这与之前低温SAA应用不同。
8. 与Pt纳米颗粒相比，Pt/Cu SAA的内在脱氢活性稍弱，这体现在CH激活所需的温度上。
9. 在520°C下进行PDH操作后，经过12小时，0.1Pt/Al2O3的丙烯生成速率显著降低。
10. Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在相同的条件下没有经历12小时的失活操作。
11. 与0.1Pt/Al2O3相比，Pt/Cu SAA较高的丙烯生成速率可以归因于其Pt原子的更优分散，尽管其脱氢步骤的能垒略有增加。
