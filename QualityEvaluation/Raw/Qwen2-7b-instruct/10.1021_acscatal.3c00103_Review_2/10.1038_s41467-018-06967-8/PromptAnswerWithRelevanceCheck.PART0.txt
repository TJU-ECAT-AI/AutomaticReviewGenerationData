To address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, recent advancements focus on developing catalysts that can simultaneously enhance activity and selectivity. Single-atom catalysis has emerged as a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, offering distinct and often outstanding performances in various chemical reactions. In the context of propane dehydrogenation, researchers have designed single atom alloy (SAAs) containing platinum (Pt) and copper (Cu) to break the scaling relationship typically encountered with noble metal alloys. This innovation allows for a significant improvement in propylene selectivity while maintaining a slight loss in intrinsic dehydrogenation activity. These SAAs demonstrate excellent stability at high temperatures, unlike their low-temperature counterparts, making them suitable for industrial applications.

[1] "The development of new catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is always the ultimate goal of researchers."
[2] "However, due to the existence of the scaling relationship, the enhancement of the activity toward the aimed product frequently accompanies a series of similar side reactions, leading to the reduced selectivity for the target product."
[3] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "Therefore, it is desirable to develop a catalyst that can break the scaling relationship to achieve the improvement of activity and selectivity concurrently."
[5] "Single-atom catalysis has become one of the most active new frontiers in heterogeneous catalysis."
[6] "A large number of single-atom catalysts exhibit distinct and often outstanding performances in a broad scope of chemical reactions."
[7] "Unlike previous reported low temperature SAA applications, our synthesized Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream at 520C."
[8] "Compared with Pt nanoparticles, a little higher temperature of CH activation for Pt/Cu SAA suggests a slightly weaker intrinsic activity of dehydrogenation."
[9] "During the PDH at 520C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6molg1Pth1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12h on stream."
[10] "As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12h on stream."
[11] "Although DFT calculations predict slightly increased dehydrogenation barrier for Pt/Cu SAA, its higher propylene formation rate can be attributed to its better Pt dispersion compared with 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (Pt dispersion=29%)."
