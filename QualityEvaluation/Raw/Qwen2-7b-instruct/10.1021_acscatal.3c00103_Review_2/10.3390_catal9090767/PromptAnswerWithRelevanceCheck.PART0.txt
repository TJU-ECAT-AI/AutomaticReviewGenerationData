[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[4] "However, the most of HT-like compounds are prepared by co-precipitation method; as a result, the morphologies of as-synthetized products are usually low crystalline NPs consisting of a great number of small and thick plates [3,8]."
[5] "That must be detrimental to fully utilizing the active metal species in bulk."
[6] "Fortunately, the calcined HT can be reconstructed due to the memory effect of HT. During the process, some metal ions have the chance to be introduced into the layer of reconstructed HT [30,31]."
[7] "The lattice-confined metal species can be converted into highly dispersed metal NPs and even single metal atom sites."
[8] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
[9] "In this paper, PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst in a flower-like nanosheet array (PtInHT-FR) was fabricated by reduction-followed by calcination of the flower-like PtIn-HT precursor (PtInHT-F) with a hierarchical microstructure, which produced from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, followed by thermal decomposition and structural reconstruction."
[10] "During the preparation process, the HT-X, HT-XC, InHT-X and InHT-XC samples were also prepared. The structure and physic-chemical properties of catalysts and precursors were studied. The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

[5] "The proposed formation of a ball-flower-like and single-plate hierarchical microstructure is tentatively proposed in Scheme 1."
[6] "The ball-flower-like multi-level hierarchical microstructure with abundant wedge-shaped pores, and short-channel honeycomb-like pores, but not the slit-like pores, is in favor of propane and propene diffusion."
[7] "Furthermore, the low SBET of PtInHT-FR facilitates the propene desorption and then decreases the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis on metal sites."
[8] "The regeneration and activation test for PtInHT-FU is shown in Figure 11. After each regeneration, the activity can be restored up to the level before regeneration, but decreases rapidly; almost no change in the selectivity can be observed."

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of promoters to form bimetallic catalysts, employing calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds for high surface area and uniform metal distribution, and the reconstruction of these precursors to introduce metal ions into the layers, resulting in highly dispersed metal nanoparticles and even single metal atom sites. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the dispersion of metals, facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products, and maintaining high selectivity. Hierarchical microstructures with complex pore systems are also crucial for enhancing diffusion properties and reducing the risk of carbon deposition and Pt-sintering, thus extending catalyst life. The regeneration and activation tests demonstrate the ability to restore activity post-deactivation, albeit with a rapid decline in activity after multiple cycles, while selectivity remains largely unchanged.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发出的关键策略和方法包括使用促进剂形成双金属催化剂、利用热解水滑石类似物化合物获得高比表面积和原子级均匀分布的金属物种，并在这些前体的重构过程中引入金属离子，从而形成高度分散的金属纳米颗粒甚至单个金属原子位点。这些进步通过改善金属的分散性、促进反应物和产物的扩散以及保持高选择性来解决催化剂设计、制造和工业应用性能优化的挑战。复杂的微结构具有复杂的孔系统对于增强扩散性质和降低碳沉积和Pt聚集的风险至关重要，从而延长催化剂的寿命。再生和激活测试表明，尽管活动度在多次循环后迅速下降，但选择性基本保持不变。
