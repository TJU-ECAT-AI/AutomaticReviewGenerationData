[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[4] "The calcined HT-like compounds are regarded as a good way to obtained supported metal catalysts with high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species due to the topotactic transformation [28]."
[5] "These features, the changeable composition and the acid-base property make it is possible to improve PDH performance by optimizing Pt-based catalysts [8,24]."
[6] "The small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction."
[7] "That suggests that the impregnation condition is beneficial to reconstructing the HT phase."
[8] "This indicates that the HT layer becomes thinner and thinner."
[9] "Additionally, the decreasing M2+/(M3+ + M4+) ratio can cause the increase of positive charge density in the layers."
[10] "The basic morphology feature still can be maintained, but some broken particles can be found on the surface of single-plate PtInHT-PR sample."
[11] "The formation of ultrathin nanosheets is bound to decrease the average crystallite size in the c direction (Table 1) and weaken the diffraction peaks of HT phase in initial huge HT-F and HT-P template, which is consistent with the XRD results in Figure 1."
[12] "The strong interaction is beneficial to stabilize and disperse metal active species."
[13] "The pore size increases in the following order, PtInHT-FC < PtInHT-PC < PtInHT-MC, and the same trend can be found for their SBET values."
[14] "In addition, the relative content of surface, metallic-state In increases in the order of PtInHT-FR, PtInHT-PR and PtInHT-MR."
[15] "Therefore, it can be inferred that the most of the surface In species have a chance to make close contact with Pt species and form plenty of strongly interacting PtIn centers over PtInHT-FR."
[16] "This phase transfer of support could be the one cause of induction of performance during reaction."
[17] "The amount of deposited carbon on the catalysts used increases following the order of PtInHT-FU, to PtInHT-MU and finally to PtInHT-PU."
[18] "The low SBET of PtInHT-FR facilitates the propene desorption and then decreases the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis on metal sites."
[19] "The regeneration and activation test for PtInHT-FU is shown in Figure 11."
[20] "The deposited carbon can easily form on the large-size Pt sites over PtInHT-PR and PtInHT-MR [37]."
[21] "Although the maximum conversion is up to 50%, the PDH reaction cannot be carried out after 50 h for PtInHT-PR and 20 h for PtInHT-MR due to the reactor blockage by a large amount of deposited carbon."
[22] "Fortunately, the deposited carbon over PtInHT-FR after reacting for 190 h is much less than that over others."
[23] "Meanwhile, the overabundant In0 species could bring about a disadvantageous influence to the PDH reaction."
[24] "This is associated with the fact that the carbon deposits can easily form on the large-size Pt sites over PtInHT-PR and PtInHT-MR [37]."
[25] "The regeneration conditions can cause Pt sintering and decrease the Pt dispersion to a certain extent, which can result in the decrease of initial activity with cycles of regeneration [38,39]."

1. Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts. This increases the dispersion of Pt and facilitates electron transfer, leading to improved activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. The calcined HT-like compounds offer high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species, enhancing PDH performance. The hierarchical microstructure provides stable and easily accessible active sites for the reaction.
