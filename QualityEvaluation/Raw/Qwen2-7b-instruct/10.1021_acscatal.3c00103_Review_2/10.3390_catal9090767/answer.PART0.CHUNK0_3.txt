[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."
[4] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[5] "In fact, the hierarchical morphology and porous structure play important roles in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, the effect of hierarchical microstructure is seldom reported."
[6] "Calcined HT-like compounds are regarded as a good way to obtained supported metal catalysts with high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species due to the topotactic transformation [28]."
[7] "During the process, some metal ions have the chance to be introduced into the layer of reconstructed HT [30,31]. The lattice-confined metal species can be converted into highly dispersed metal NPs and even single metal atom sites."
[8] "In this paper, PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst in a flower-like nanosheet array (PtInHT-FR) was fabricated by reduction-followed by calcination of the flower-like PtIn-HT precursor (PtInHT-F) with a hierarchical microstructure, which produced from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, followed by thermal decomposition and structural reconstruction."
[9] "The corresponding calcined samples were marked as PtInHT-XU. During the preparation process, the HT-X, HT-XC, InHT-X and InHT-XC samples were also prepared."
[10] "After the reaction, the XRD patterns of used samples are shown in Figure 7."
[11] "Additionally, the decreasing M2+/(M3+ + M4+) ratio can cause the increase of positive charge density in the layers, while the big radii of In3+ (0.080 nm, the Shannon ionic radis [34]) and Pt4+ (0.063 nm, Shannon ionic radius [34]) ions can broaden the distance of metal ions in the layers."
[12] "After calcination and reduction, the HT phase disappears along with the occurrence of MgO (JCPDS file number 45-0946) and meixnerite (Mg4Al2(OH)14·3H2O, JCPDS file number 35-0964) diffraction peaks in Figure 1."
[13] "The basic morphology feature still can be maintained, but some broken particles can be found on the surface of single-plate PtInHT-PR sample."
[14] "The slit-shaped mesopores are the common features of all samples."
[15] "The broad PSD was in the mesopore range; big dp and SBET values of PtInHT-MC are related to unordered aggregation of small, flakey-like particles."
[16] "XPS analysis was applied to investigate the surface chemical state and relative concentration of In element on the reduced samples."
[17] "It is worth mentioning that PtInHT-FC exhibits a higher surface Pt density than that of PtInHT-PC and PtInHT-MC, due to its low SBET and high DPt, as listed in Table 2."
[18] "The most important thing is that the carbon is only deposited on the partial pore channel mouth of PtInHT-FU, meaning the active sites in the pore channels have no chance to be covered by the deposited carbon."
[19] "The activity induction should be closely related with the partial coverage of the active metal surface by In2O3 species [7]."
[20] "Fortunately, the deposited carbon over PtInHT-FR after reacting for 190 h is much less than that over others."
[21] "Although, the deposited carbon can be removed by a simple oxidation process (not the industrial condition), but the regeneration conditions can cause Pt sintering and decrease the Pt dispersion to a certain extent, which can result in the decrease of initial activity with cycles of regeneration [38,39]."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve several methods:

1. **Promoter doping**: Incorporating dopants such as Sn, In, Ga, and Cu into the catalyst matrix to form bimetallic catalysts, which improves dispersion and electron transfer, leading to higher activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. **Support modification**: Modifying the support material (such as Al2O3) with ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, or replacing it with ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O oxide to enhance surface area and achieve atomic-scale uniformity of metal species.

3. **Structural reconstruction**: Using calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds to create supported metal catalysts with high surface area and uniform metal distribution, facilitated by topotactic transformation during synthesis. Metal ions can be introduced into the HT layer during the reconstruction process, leading to highly dispersed metal nanoparticles or even single metal atom sites.

4. **Hierarchical microstructure design**: Fabricating catalysts with multi-level hierarchical microstructures, such as flower-like nanosheet arrays, to improve diffusion pathways, enhance stability, and maintain active sites by protecting them from carbon deposition and Pt sintering.

5. **Surface chemistry optimization**: Utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the surface chemical state and concentration of elements like In, which affects the interaction with the metal species and contributes to enhanced stability and selectivity.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on dispersion enhancement, electron transfer improvement, surface area maximization, and protection of active sites, thereby improving overall catalytic stability and efficiency in industrial applications.
