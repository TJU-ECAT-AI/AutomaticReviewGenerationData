[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Calcined HT-like compounds are regarded as a good way to obtained supported metal catalysts with high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species due to the topotactic transformation [28]."
[4] "During the process, some metal ions have the chance to be introduced into the layer of reconstructed HT [30,31]. The lattice-confined metal species can be converted into highly dispersed metal NPs and even single metal atom sites."
[5] "The proposed formation of a ball-flower-like and single-plate hierarchical microstructure is tentatively proposed in Scheme 1."
[6] "The ball-flower-like multi-level hierarchical microstructure with abundant wedge-shaped pores, and short-channel honeycomb-like pores, but not the slit-like pores, is in favor of propane and propene diffusion."
[7] "Furthermore, the low SBET of PtInHT-FR facilitates the propene desorption and then decreases the likelihood of deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis on metal sites."
[8] "The regeneration and activation test for PtInHT-FU is shown in Figure 11. After each regeneration, the activity can be restored up to the level before regeneration, but decreases rapidly; almost no change in the selectivity can be observed."

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of promoters to form bimetallic catalysts, employing calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds for high surface area and uniform metal distribution, and the reconstruction of these precursors to introduce metal ions into the layers, resulting in highly dispersed metal nanoparticles and even single metal atom sites. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving the dispersion of metals, facilitating better diffusion of reactants and products, and maintaining high selectivity. Hierarchical microstructures with complex pore systems are also crucial for enhancing diffusion properties and reducing the risk of carbon deposition and Pt-sintering, thus extending catalyst life. The regeneration and activation tests demonstrate the ability to restore activity post-deactivation, albeit with a rapid decline in activity after multiple cycles, while selectivity remains largely unchanged.
