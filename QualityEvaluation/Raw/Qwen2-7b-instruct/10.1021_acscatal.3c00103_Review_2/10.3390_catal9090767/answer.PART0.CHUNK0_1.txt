[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "Calcined HT-like compounds are regarded as a good way to obtained supported metal catalysts with high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species due to the topotactic transformation."
[3] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."
[4] "The ball-flower-like multi-level hierarchical microstructure with abundant wedge-shaped pores, and short-channel honeycomb-like pores, but not the slit-like pores, is in favor of propane and propene diffusion."
[5] "The high content In0 species in PtInHT-PR and PtInHT-MR can not only block Pt active sites [8], but also weaken PtIn interactions and lead to the Pt sintering (see Figure 2, Figure 8 and Figure 10)."
[6] "Fortunately, the calcined HT can be reconstructed due to the memory effect of HT. During the process, some metal ions have the chance to be introduced into the layer of reconstructed HT [30,31]."
[7] "The XRD patterns of HT-F, HT-P and HT-M exhibit strong characteristic diffraction peaks in the HT phase [32], although their preparation processes are different."
[8] "The formation of ultrathin nanosheets is bound to decrease the average crystallite size in the c direction (Table 1) and weaken the diffraction peaks of HT phase in initial huge HT-F and HT-P template, which is consistent with the XRD results in Figure 1."
[9] "Additionally, a new diffraction peak appears at around 26.0 in all the used samples, which belongs to the carbon deposits (JCPD file number 44-1644)."
[10] "After the reaction, the XRD patterns of used samples are shown in Figure 7. It can be found that the meixnerite phase is still retained in the used PtInHT-FU, which is supposed to be favorable for the PDH reaction [7]."
[11] "Meanwhile, the overabundant In0 species could bring about a disadvantageous influence to the PDH reaction. The high content In0 species in PtInHT-PR and PtInHT-MR can not only block Pt active sites [8], but also weaken PtIn interactions and lead to the Pt sintering (see Figure 2, Figure 8 and Figure 10)."

The key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve:

1. Doping promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, which improves propene selectivity and inhibits deactivation.
2. Utilizing calcined HT-like compounds to create catalysts with high surface area and uniform metal distribution through topotactic transformation.
3. Obtaining highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts by incorporating promoters or using HT as a support.
4. Designing catalysts with multi-level hierarchical microstructures, such as ball-flower-like, single-plate, and block mass, to optimize diffusion of reactants and products.
5. Maintaining In elements in the oxidation state of In3+ in the catalyst to prevent easy reduction and blockage of active sites, thus enhancing stability and reducing Pt sintering.
6. Taking advantage of the memory effect of HT to reconstruct the compound during the preparation process, allowing for the introduction of metal ions into the layer.
7. Ensuring that the crystal phase structure of the catalysts, as revealed by XRD, aligns with the desired properties, such as high surface area and atomic-scale uniformity.
8. Decreasing the average crystallite size in the c direction to weaken diffraction peaks and facilitate the formation of hierarchical microstructures.
9. Recognizing that the presence of carbon deposits, as indicated by new diffraction peaks, can negatively impact catalyst performance.
10. Retaining the Meixnerite phase in the used catalysts, which is favorable for PDH reactions, as suggested by the XRD patterns.
11. Understanding that an abundance of In0 species can block active sites, weaken PtIn interactions, and lead to Pt sintering, negatively affecting the catalyst's performance.

These strategies collectively address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, leading to enhanced stability, selectivity, and efficiency in dehydrogenation processes.
