[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "For example, PtIn [16] and PtGa [17,18] bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) show higher activity and selectivity in PDH, which has been attributed to the increased Pt dispersion and electron transfer from In or Ga to Pt [11,18]."
[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."
[4] "However, the most of HT-like compounds are prepared by co-precipitation method; as a result, the morphologies of as-synthetized products are usually low crystalline NPs consisting of a great number of small and thick plates [3,8]."
[5] "That must be detrimental to fully utilizing the active metal species in bulk."
[6] "Fortunately, the calcined HT can be reconstructed due to the memory effect of HT. During the process, some metal ions have the chance to be introduced into the layer of reconstructed HT [30,31]."
[7] "The lattice-confined metal species can be converted into highly dispersed metal NPs and even single metal atom sites."
[8] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."
[9] "In this paper, PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst in a flower-like nanosheet array (PtInHT-FR) was fabricated by reduction-followed by calcination of the flower-like PtIn-HT precursor (PtInHT-F) with a hierarchical microstructure, which produced from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, followed by thermal decomposition and structural reconstruction."
[10] "During the preparation process, the HT-X, HT-XC, InHT-X and InHT-XC samples were also prepared. The structure and physic-chemical properties of catalysts and precursors were studied. The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Incorporating promoters like tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), and copper (Cu) into bimetallic catalysts to improve the dispersion of precious metals and facilitate electron transfer between the metal and promoter, enhancing the selectivity for propene production.
2. Utilizing sandwich-structured catalysts with single Pt atom sites, which are more effective in PDH reactions compared to aggregates of Pt particles.
3. Employing hydrothermal synthesis methods to prepare hydrotalcite-like compounds that can be reconstructed during calcination, leading to the formation of highly dispersed metal nanoparticles and even single metal atoms on the surface of the catalyst support.
4. Fabricating catalysts with hierarchical microstructures, such as flower-like nanosheets, which provide a more stable and accessible surface for active sites, facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.
5. Optimizing the morphology of the catalysts, such as achieving a flower-like nanosheet array structure, to improve the surface area and dispersion of the active metal species, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and stability.
6. Controlling the synthesis conditions to ensure the formation of low-crystalline nanoparticles, which are more prone to sintering and loss of activity during high-temperature reactions.
7. Using co-precipitation methods to synthesize catalyst precursors, followed by reconstruction processes to introduce additional metal ions and promote the formation of highly dispersed metal species.
8. Conducting detailed studies on the structure and physical-chemical properties of both catalysts and precursors to understand the relationship between the microstructure and morphology and the catalytic performance, aiming to optimize the design of the catalysts for improved performance and stability.
