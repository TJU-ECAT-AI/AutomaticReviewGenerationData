<p>While there is a considerable literature on the influence of additives on the activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation occurring on Pt-bimetallic catalysts, a clear understanding of the separate effects of metal particle size and composition has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been observed that the initial deactivation on Pt for ethane dehydrogenation is very fast.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very difficult to measure the true initial activity of a pure Pt catalyst and compare it with a promoted Pt catalyst exhibiting lower initial deactivation.</p>
<p>The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the effects of particle size composition for PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene.</p>
<p>Details concerning the preparation of all samples are listed in Table S1.</p>
<p>While our previous study has shown by XPS that surface enrichment of tin likely occurs in PtSn alloys,</p>
<p>the extent of deactivation between 0.3 min and 10.3 min as a function of particle size for Pt and Pt3Sn catalysts is shown in Fig. 9.</p>
<p>Coke formation increases as particle size increases for both Pt and PtSn,</p>
<p>the value of C/Pt measure after 2 h of reaction decreased very sharply with increasing Sn content.</p>
<p>Our results show the same trend with Sn promotion but also suggest that even under conditions with little deactivation, PtSn catalysts are intrinsically more active than Pt.</p>
<p>While there is a 300% increase in ethane TOF from 1.5 nm to 8.5 nm for Pt/Mg(Al)O,</p>

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Utilizing a synthetic method to make PtSn particles of uniform size, which are then loaded onto a calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O) support. This ensures precise control over both particle size and composition, allowing for accurate comparisons of catalyst performance.

2. Operating at low residence time conditions to limit ethene formation and thus reduce the extent of deactivation. This provides a strategy for obtaining the true initial activity of Pt and Pt-bimetallic catalysts more accurately.

3. Measuring the effects of composition and particle size on the rate of ethane dehydrogenation and the selectivity to ethene. The results of this study provide insights into the roles of metal particle size and composition on the properties of PtSn nanoparticles for ethane dehydrogenation.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by enabling more precise control over catalyst characteristics and by providing a clearer understanding of how these characteristics influence catalytic behavior. The use of uniform-sized particles and low residence time conditions facilitates more accurate measurements of catalyst activity and selectivity, which is crucial for optimizing industrial processes. The findings on the combined effects of composition and particle size on ethane dehydrogenation also contribute to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial use.
