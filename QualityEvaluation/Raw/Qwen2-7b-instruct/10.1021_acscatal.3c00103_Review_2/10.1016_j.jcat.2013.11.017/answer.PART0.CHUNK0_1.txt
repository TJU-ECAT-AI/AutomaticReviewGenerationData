[1] "The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the effects of particle size composition for PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
[2] "To compare the true initial activity of different catalysts, a low feed residence time was used."
[3] "For a fixed average particle size, ethane TOF and the selectivity to ethene increased with increasing content of Sn in the PtSn particle."
[4] "The observed effects of particle size and composition are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic factors."
[5] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene."
[6] "The TOF of ethane increased by about 40% and the selectivity to ethene increased from 85% to 95% as the fraction of Sn in the PtSn nanoparticles increased from 0 to 0.42."

1. The primary goal of the research was to evaluate how the size and composition of PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles impact the ethane dehydrogenation to ethene. 

2. Utilizing a low feed residence time was crucial for accurately measuring the initial activity of various catalysts.

3. When the average particle size was constant, there was an increase in ethane turnover frequency (TOF) and ethene selectivity as the Sn content in the PtSn particle increased.

4. The observed changes in particle size and composition were explained by a mix of geometric and electronic influences.

5. Implementing low residence time led to a substantial reduction in deactivation, which could be attributed to decreased coke formation from ethene.

6. An increase in Sn fraction within the PtSn nanoparticles resulted in a TOF boost of approximately 40% and an ethene selectivity jump from 85% to 95%.

1. 研究的主要目标是评估PtSn双金属纳米粒子的尺寸和组成对乙烷脱氢到乙烯的影响。

2. 使用低反应物停留时间对于准确测量不同催化剂的初始活性至关重要。

3. 当平均颗粒尺寸保持不变时，随着PtSn颗粒中Sn含量的增加，乙烷转率频率（TOF）和乙烯选择性都有所提高。

4. 在颗粒尺寸和组成上观察到的变化可以归因于几何和电子因素的结合。

5. 采用低反应物停留时间可以显著降低失活，这可以归因于从乙烯形成的焦炭减少。

6. PtSn纳米颗粒中Sn的含量增加导致约40%的乙烷TOF提升和从85%到95%的乙烯选择性增加。
