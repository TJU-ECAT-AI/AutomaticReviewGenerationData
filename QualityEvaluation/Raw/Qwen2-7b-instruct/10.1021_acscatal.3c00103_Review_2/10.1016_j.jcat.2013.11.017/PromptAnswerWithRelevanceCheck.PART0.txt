[1] "The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the effects of particle size composition for PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
[2] "In order to determine whether the initial rate of dehydrogenation on Pt is higher or lower than a bimetallic catalyst, the amount of coke formation must be reduced."
[3] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."
[4] "For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn."
[5] "These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles."
[6] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles."
[7] "Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

1. The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve focusing on the effects of particle size and composition. These advancements specifically target improving the rate and selectivity of ethene formation, minimizing coke accumulation, and quantifying the extent of catalyst deactivation.

2. To determine if the initial rate of dehydrogenation on pure platinum catalysts is higher or lower than on bimetallic catalysts, it is essential to reduce the amount of coke formation. This is achieved by operating at low residence time conditions, which limits ethene formation and provides a more accurate measure of the true initial activity.

3. Operating at low residence time conditions significantly lowers deactivation by reducing the amount of coke formed from ethene. This allows for measurements closer to the true initial activity of the catalyst, providing a clearer understanding of its intrinsic performance.

4. For a fixed average particle size, the turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity to ethene production increase with the content of tin (Sn) in the PtSn nanoparticles. This indicates that the addition of Sn promotes both the rate of ethane dehydrogenation and the selectivity to ethene.

5. The observed trends in the increase of TOF and selectivity to ethene are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects caused by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles. The geometric effects relate to changes in the surface morphology, while the electronic effects are associated with alterations in the surface chemistry due to the transfer of electronic charge between Sn and Pt.

6. Although larger particles may exhibit higher TOF for ethane dehydrogenation due to easier removal of nascent ethene from the surface to the gas phase, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to justify the loss of surface area by using larger particles. This implies that, for optimal performance, it is preferable to use smaller particles despite their slightly lower TOF.

7. Practical implementation of this system at high conversion levels suggests that small-sized and Sn-promoted catalysts should be utilized to prevent coke formation, ensuring stable and efficient dehydrogenation processes.

1. 最近开发的用于增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法，着重于粒子大小和组成的影响。这些进步特别针对提高乙烯生成速率和选择性、减少焦炭积累以及量化催化剂失活程度。

2. 要确定纯铂催化剂的初始脱氢速率是否高于双金属催化剂，必须减少焦炭形成量。通过在低停留时间条件下操作，限制乙烯生成，可以更准确地测量真初活性，从而提供催化剂内在性能的清晰理解。

3. 在低停留时间条件下操作，显著降低了由于乙烯形成的催化剂失活程度，这使得对真实初始活性的测量更加准确，提供了催化剂真正初始性能的清晰定义。

4. 对固定平均粒子大小而言，铂锡合金纳米颗粒中锡（Sn）含量的增加导致乙烷脱氢的转速（TOF）和乙烯选择性提高。这表明添加Sn既促进了乙烷脱氢速率，也提高了乙烯选择性。

5. 观察到的TOF和乙烯生成选择性增加趋势归因于锡（Sn）在铂（Pt）纳米颗粒表面存在的几何和电子效应的结合。几何效应与表面形态的变化有关，而电子效应则与Sn和Pt之间电子电荷转移引起的表面化学变化有关。

6. 尽管较大的粒子可能由于从表面向气相更容易去除新生乙烯而表现出更高的TOF，但获得的TOF增益不足以抵消使用较大粒子时表面面积的损失。这意味着，为了最佳性能，优选使用较小的粒子，尽管它们的TOF略低。

7. 实际上，实施此系统以达到高转化率水平建议使用小尺寸和Sn促进的催化剂以防止焦炭形成，确保稳定高效的脱氢过程。

To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent advancements focus on optimizing metal particle size and composition. Key strategies include:

1. **Controlling Particle Size**: Smaller particles generally exhibit higher activity and selectivity, possibly due to the higher proportion of terrace sites versus corners and step sites, which are more active for catalyzing CC bond breaking.

2. **Adding Promoters**: Incorporating elements like tin (Sn) into the catalyst can modify surface chemistry, reducing the ability of the metal to cleave carbon-carbon bonds, which prevents methane and coke formation. This is attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.

3. **Low Residence Time Experiments**: Running reactions at low residence times reduces deactivation by minimizing ethene re-adsorption, allowing for measurements closer to the true initial activity of the catalysts.

4. **Using Small and Sn-Promoted Catalysts**: For industrial applications requiring high conversions, small-sized Sn-promoted catalysts are recommended to avoid coke formation while maintaining high efficiency and selectivity.

These advancements help in addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, leading to more efficient and stable dehydrogenation processes.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，最近的进展集中在优化金属颗粒尺寸和组成。关键策略包括：

1. **控制颗粒大小**：较小的颗粒通常表现出更高的活性和选择性，可能是因为更高的台阶位点比例相对于角点和台阶位点，这些位点更适合催化CC键断裂。

2. **添加促进剂**：在催化剂中加入锡（Sn）等元素可以修改表面化学，减少金属裂解碳-碳键的能力，从而防止甲烷和焦炭形成。这归因于几何和电子效应的结合。

3. **低停留时间实验**：在低停留时间下运行反应可减少失活，通过最小化乙烷的再吸附，允许更接近催化剂的真实初始活性的测量。

4. **使用小型和Sn促进的催化剂**：对于需要高转化率的工业应用，推荐使用小型的Sn促进催化剂来避免焦炭形成，同时保持高效性和选择性。

这些进步有助于解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，为工业应用带来更有效和稳定的脱氢过程。
