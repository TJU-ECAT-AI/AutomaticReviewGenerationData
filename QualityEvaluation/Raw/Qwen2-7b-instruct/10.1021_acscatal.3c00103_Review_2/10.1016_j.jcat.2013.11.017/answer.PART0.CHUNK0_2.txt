<p>While there is a considerable literature on the influence of additives on the activity, selectivity, and coke accumulation occurring on Pt-bimetallic catalysts, a clear understanding of the separate effects of metal particle size and composition has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been observed that the initial deactivation on Pt for ethane dehydrogenation is very fast.</p>
<p>To compare the true initial activity of different catalysts, a low feed residence time was used.</p>
<p>A unique strategy was employed to make accurate comparisons of true initial activity. Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity.</p>
<p>For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn.</p>
<p>These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles.</p>
<p>Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation.</p>

To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent advancements focus on optimizing metal particle size and composition. Key strategies include:

1. **Controlling Particle Size**: Smaller particles generally exhibit higher activity and selectivity, possibly due to the higher proportion of terrace sites versus corners and step sites, which are more active for catalyzing CC bond breaking.

2. **Adding Promoters**: Incorporating elements like tin (Sn) into the catalyst can modify surface chemistry, reducing the ability of the metal to cleave carbon-carbon bonds, which prevents methane and coke formation. This is attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.

3. **Low Residence Time Experiments**: Running reactions at low residence times reduces deactivation by minimizing ethene re-adsorption, allowing for measurements closer to the true initial activity of the catalysts.

4. **Using Small and Sn-Promoted Catalysts**: For industrial applications requiring high conversions, small-sized Sn-promoted catalysts are recommended to avoid coke formation while maintaining high efficiency and selectivity.

These advancements help in addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, leading to more efficient and stable dehydrogenation processes.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，最近的进展集中在优化金属颗粒尺寸和组成。关键策略包括：

1. **控制颗粒大小**：较小的颗粒通常表现出更高的活性和选择性，可能是因为更高的台阶位点比例相对于角点和台阶位点，这些位点更适合催化CC键断裂。

2. **添加促进剂**：在催化剂中加入锡（Sn）等元素可以修改表面化学，减少金属裂解碳-碳键的能力，从而防止甲烷和焦炭形成。这归因于几何和电子效应的结合。

3. **低停留时间实验**：在低停留时间下运行反应可减少失活，通过最小化乙烷的再吸附，允许更接近催化剂的真实初始活性的测量。

4. **使用小型和Sn促进的催化剂**：对于需要高转化率的工业应用，推荐使用小型的Sn促进催化剂来避免焦炭形成，同时保持高效性和选择性。

这些进步有助于解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，为工业应用带来更有效和稳定的脱氢过程。
