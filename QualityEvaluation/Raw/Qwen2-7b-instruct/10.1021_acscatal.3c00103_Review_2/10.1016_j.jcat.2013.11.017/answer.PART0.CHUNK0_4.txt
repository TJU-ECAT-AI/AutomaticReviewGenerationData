[1] "The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the effects of particle size composition for PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles on the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."
[2] "To compare the true initial activity of different catalysts, a low feed residence time was used."
[3] "We note, however, that even for low residence time conditions, there still exists a small amount of deactivation."
[4] "Therefore, the addition of Sn suppresses coke formation, but does not eliminate it completely."
[5] "Furthermore, operating at high residence time to achieve industrially relevant conversions results in higher coke formation on larger particles."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:
1. Utilizing low residence time conditions to minimize deactivation and measure the true initial activity of catalysts.
2. Employing precise control over particle size and composition during synthesis to optimize catalytic performance.
3. Incorporating tin (Sn) as a promoter to reduce coke formation and improve selectivity to ethene.
4. Designing catalysts with geometric and electronic properties that facilitate the dehydrogenation of ethane, particularly on flatter surfaces of larger particles.
5. Addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications through comprehensive studies on the effects of composition and size on deactivation, activity, and selectivity.
