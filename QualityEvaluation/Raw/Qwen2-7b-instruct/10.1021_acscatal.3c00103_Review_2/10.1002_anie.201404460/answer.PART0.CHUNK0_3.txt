The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the synergistic combination of metals and the introduction of promoters. In this study, gallium (Ga) and platinum (Pt) were combined to create a highly active and stable catalyst for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The synergy between Ga and Pt was observed to result in a bifunctional active phase, with coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species functioning as the active species and Pt serving as a promoter. The catalyst materials were characterized using various techniques to ensure uniform dispersion and homogeneity on the support. The results showed that the conversion and selectivity varied significantly between different catalyst materials, indicating the importance of optimizing the composition and structure of the catalyst. The introduction of potassium (K) as an alkali metal dopant was found to increase propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning Brnsted acid sites in the PDH catalysts. The catalysts displayed high stability and resistance to deactivation, even after prolonged use, demonstrating their suitability for industrial applications. The presence of Pt was crucial in enhancing the concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which played a role in the activation of CH bonds. The catalyst was compared with other materials reported in literature and a commercial CrOx catalyst, highlighting its superior activity in terms of propylene yield per weight hourly space velocity.
