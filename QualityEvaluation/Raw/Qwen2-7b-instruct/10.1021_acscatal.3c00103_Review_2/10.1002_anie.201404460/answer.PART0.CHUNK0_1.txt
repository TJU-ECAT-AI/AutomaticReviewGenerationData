[1] "Recently, advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization have focused on enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. These strategies aim to address the challenges in achieving high selectivity, activity, and stability, particularly in the context of industrial applications."
[2] "One key approach involves the incorporation of metal promoters to optimize the activity and stability of the catalyst. In the case of the Pt-Ga-K-containing catalyst materials, it was found that the synergy between Pt and Ga results in a highly active and stable catalyst, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy."
[3] "Another critical aspect is the modification of the catalyst support. Using alumina as the support material in conjunction with the Pt-Ga-K mixture was shown to contribute to the catalyst's enhanced stability and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[4] "The use of a bifunctional active phase, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as a promoter, plays a crucial role in the catalyst's performance. This bifunctional mechanism enhances the dehydrogenation efficiency and stability."
[5] "Furthermore, the addition of alkali metal dopants, such as potassium (K), has been shown to increase propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning Brnsted acid sites present in PDH catalysts. This strategy improves the catalyst's overall stability and performance."
[6] "Operando spectroscopic techniques, such as UV/Vis and Raman spectroscopy, were employed to monitor the deposition of coke on the catalyst materials. These methods allowed for the tracking of catalyst degradation and the development of strategies to mitigate deactivation, thereby enhancing the catalyst's longevity."
[7] "Long-term stability tests, consisting of approximately 150 cycles or 14 days of operation, were performed on the very active Pt3GaK catalyst. The results confirmed the high stability of the catalyst material, demonstrating its capability to maintain consistent performance over extended periods."
[8] "Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with online mass spectrometry (MS) was utilized to investigate the coke deposits formed on the catalyst surface after the eighth cycle. This analysis provided insights into the nature of the coke and helped identify factors contributing to catalyst deactivation."
[9] "The specific nature of the gallium species present on the catalyst was investigated using 71Ga MAS NMR and XPS spectra. These analyses revealed that the presence of Pt results in a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which contributes to the catalyst's activity."
[10] "Comparisons with a wide range of other catalyst materials reported in literature, including a commercial CrOx catalyst, highlighted the superior activity of the Pt3GaK catalyst, further emphasizing its excellent catalytic performance."
