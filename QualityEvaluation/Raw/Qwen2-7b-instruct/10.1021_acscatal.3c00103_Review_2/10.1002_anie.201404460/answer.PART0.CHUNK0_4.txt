[1] "A novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane is presented. The catalyst consists of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina."
[2] "We observed a synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst."
[3] "A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as promoter."
[4] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."
[5] "The catalytic performance of the prepared materials has been tested in a lab-scale reactor for eight successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[6] "Evidently, both Pt and Ga are required to obtain a highly active selective and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst."
[7] "The catalyst materials under investigation have been prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (99.995%), Ga(NO3)3 (99.9%), and KNO3 (>99%) as metal precursors and alumina as the support material."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the synergistic combination of platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) with potassium (K) dopants supported on alumina. This combination leads to the formation of a bifunctional active phase where coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species act as the active dehydrogenation element while Pt functions as a promoter. This synergy ensures high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The use of gallium as the active dehydrogenation element is particularly innovative, as previous catalyst systems considered gallium to primarily function as a promoter rather than an active dehydrogenation agent. The preparation of these catalysts involves the incipient wetness impregnation method using specific metal precursors and alumina as the support material. The stability and performance of these catalysts have been rigorously tested through lab-scale reactor experiments, including repeated dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, to ensure their robustness under practical industrial conditions.

最近开发的用于增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及铂（Pt）和镓（Ga）与钾（K）掺杂剂的协同组合，这些掺杂剂支持在氧化铝上。这种组合导致形成一个双功能活性相，其中 coordinately 不饱和 Ga3+ 离子作为活性脱氢化元素发挥作用，而 Pt 则作为促进剂发挥作用。这种协同作用确保了丙烷到丙烯的高活性和选择性脱氢。特别创新的是使用镓作为脱氢化活性元素，因为以前的催化剂系统认为镓主要作为促进剂而不是活性脱氢化剂发挥作用。这些催化剂的制备采用浸渍湿法，使用特定的金属前体和氧化铝作为支撑材料。通过实验室规模反应器实验，包括重复的脱氢再生循环测试，以确保在实际工业条件下催化剂的稳定性和性能。
