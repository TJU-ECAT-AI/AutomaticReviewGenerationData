This document discusses the development of a novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene. The catalyst is composed of 1000ppm platinum (Pt), 3wt% gallium (Ga), and 0.25wt% potassium (K) supported on alumina. It highlights the synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst. The catalyst material features a bifunctional active phase where coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species act as the active species for dehydrogenation, while Pt serves as a promoter. The catalyst is resistant to coking and maintains its activity over prolonged reaction times. A complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character is revealed through structural, morphological, and surface characterization studies. It is noted that the presence of Pt leads to a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface, allowing for the active sites to be available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles.

<p>Currently, the USA is at the lowest level of crude oil imports in 25 years.1 While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale.2 This new source of hydrocarbons has the potential to impact the worldwide supply of natural gas, because shale formations are found throughout the world. A recent study estimates that there are 207 trillion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas globally. China is estimated to have the world's largest reserves in shale at 32 trillion cubic meters.3 Although most shale gas outside of the USA is not currently produced, it is reasonable to expect that these low-cost feedstocks for chemicals and fuels production will become available worldwide. These developments will without a doubt impose significant technical and economic challenges and opportunities on the chemical industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on-purpose production of propene.4 Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17 PDH units may be built in China.5 The majority of these projects is based on one of the two primary existing technologies for PDH; i.e., the Oleflex process from UOP and the CATOFIN process from CB&I Lummus.6 Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome.</p>
<p>Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3. A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element.7 This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element. A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking.</p>

To address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent strategies have focused on enhancing the stability and selectivity of supported metal catalysts. Key advancements include the development of new catalyst materials and the utilization of synergistic interactions between metals. In the context of propane dehydrogenation, researchers have explored the combination of platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) on alumina supports, aiming to create catalysts that offer improved activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation. This approach contrasts with previous catalyst systems where Ga was primarily viewed as a promoter, while Pt was considered the active dehydrogenation element. The synergy between Pt and Ga in the new catalyst materials leads to a highly stable catalyst that maintains its performance over multiple dehydrogenation cycles, even in the presence of coke deposition. This highlights the importance of optimizing catalyst composition and structure to overcome limitations in traditional dehydrogenation technologies, thereby addressing the technical and economic challenges faced by the chemical industry in managing the increasing availability of unconventional hydrocarbon resources like shale gas. The development of such catalysts represents a significant opportunity for improving the efficiency and sustainability of petrochemical processes, potentially enabling more effective on-purpose production of valuable products like propene from propane.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the synergistic combination of metals and the introduction of promoters. In this study, gallium (Ga) and platinum (Pt) were combined to create a highly active and stable catalyst for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The synergy between Ga and Pt was observed to result in a bifunctional active phase, with coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species functioning as the active species and Pt serving as a promoter. The catalyst materials were characterized using various techniques to ensure uniform dispersion and homogeneity on the support. The results showed that the conversion and selectivity varied significantly between different catalyst materials, indicating the importance of optimizing the composition and structure of the catalyst. The introduction of potassium (K) as an alkali metal dopant was found to increase propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning Brnsted acid sites in the PDH catalysts. The catalysts displayed high stability and resistance to deactivation, even after prolonged use, demonstrating their suitability for industrial applications. The presence of Pt was crucial in enhancing the concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which played a role in the activation of CH bonds. The catalyst was compared with other materials reported in literature and a commercial CrOx catalyst, highlighting its superior activity in terms of propylene yield per weight hourly space velocity.
