<p>Currently, the USA is at the lowest level of crude oil imports in 25 years.1 While oil production has greatly increased in these shale plays, natural gas has increased even more significantly, with the Energy Information Agency projecting that by 2040, 50% of the natural gas production within the USA will come from shale.2 This new source of hydrocarbons has the potential to impact the worldwide supply of natural gas, because shale formations are found throughout the world. A recent study estimates that there are 207 trillion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas globally. China is estimated to have the world's largest reserves in shale at 32 trillion cubic meters.3 Although most shale gas outside of the USA is not currently produced, it is reasonable to expect that these low-cost feedstocks for chemicals and fuels production will become available worldwide. These developments will without a doubt impose significant technical and economic challenges and opportunities on the chemical industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on-purpose production of propene.4 Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17 PDH units may be built in China.5 The majority of these projects is based on one of the two primary existing technologies for PDH; i.e., the Oleflex process from UOP and the CATOFIN process from CB&I Lummus.6 Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome.</p>
<p>Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3. A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element.7 This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element. A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking.</p>

To address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent strategies have focused on enhancing the stability and selectivity of supported metal catalysts. Key advancements include the development of new catalyst materials and the utilization of synergistic interactions between metals. In the context of propane dehydrogenation, researchers have explored the combination of platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) on alumina supports, aiming to create catalysts that offer improved activity, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation. This approach contrasts with previous catalyst systems where Ga was primarily viewed as a promoter, while Pt was considered the active dehydrogenation element. The synergy between Pt and Ga in the new catalyst materials leads to a highly stable catalyst that maintains its performance over multiple dehydrogenation cycles, even in the presence of coke deposition. This highlights the importance of optimizing catalyst composition and structure to overcome limitations in traditional dehydrogenation technologies, thereby addressing the technical and economic challenges faced by the chemical industry in managing the increasing availability of unconventional hydrocarbon resources like shale gas. The development of such catalysts represents a significant opportunity for improving the efficiency and sustainability of petrochemical processes, potentially enabling more effective on-purpose production of valuable products like propene from propane.
