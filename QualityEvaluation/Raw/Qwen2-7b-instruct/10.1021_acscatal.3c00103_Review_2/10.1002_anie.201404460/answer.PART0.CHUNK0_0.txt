This document discusses the development of a novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene. The catalyst is composed of 1000ppm platinum (Pt), 3wt% gallium (Ga), and 0.25wt% potassium (K) supported on alumina. It highlights the synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst. The catalyst material features a bifunctional active phase where coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species act as the active species for dehydrogenation, while Pt serves as a promoter. The catalyst is resistant to coking and maintains its activity over prolonged reaction times. A complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character is revealed through structural, morphological, and surface characterization studies. It is noted that the presence of Pt leads to a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface, allowing for the active sites to be available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles. The Pt3GaK catalyst demonstrates superior activity, showcasing the exceptional catalytic performance of the material.
