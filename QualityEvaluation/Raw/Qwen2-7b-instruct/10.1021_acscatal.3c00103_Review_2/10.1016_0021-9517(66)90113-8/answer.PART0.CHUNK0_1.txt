[1] "The specific activity for hydrogenation of cyclopropane at 0 C on platinum catalysts was found to be independent of platinum content on two different forms of alumina, independent of the nature of the support with alumina or silica gel, and almost the same for highly dispersed samples in which nearly every platinum atom is a surface atom as for a platinum foil."
[2] "In contradistinction, a very marked susceptibility to oxygen poisoning was found for the well-dispersed catalysts that was not observed for the other samples."

The key strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, as mentioned in the document, involve optimizing the dispersion of metal atoms on the support material. This ensures that the majority of the platinum atoms are surface atoms, which increases the specific activity for hydrogenation of cyclopropane at low temperatures. However, this approach also makes the catalyst susceptible to oxygen poisoning, a challenge that needs to be addressed in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.

文档中提到，提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括优化金属原子在支撑材料上的分散。这确保大多数铂原子为表面原子，从而提高了低温下环丙烷氢化过程的特定活性。然而，这种方法也使得催化剂对氧气中毒极其敏感，这是催化剂设计、制造和性能优化时需要解决的一个挑战。
