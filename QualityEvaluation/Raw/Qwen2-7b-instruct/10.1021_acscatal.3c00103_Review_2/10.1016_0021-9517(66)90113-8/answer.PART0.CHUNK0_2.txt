[1] "The specific activity for hydrogenation of cyclopropane at 0 C on platinum catalysts was found to be independent of platinum content on two different forms of alumina, independent of the nature of the support with alumina or silica gel, and almost the same for highly dispersed samples in which nearly every platinum atom is a surface atom as for a platinum foil."
[2] "In contradistinction, a very marked susceptibility to oxygen poisoning was found for the well-dispersed catalysts that was not observed for the other samples."

The document discusses the specific activity of platinum catalysts for hydrogenating cyclopropane at 0°C, which was found to be independent of platinum content and the type of support material used, whether alumina or silica gel. It also highlights that the specific activity is similar for highly dispersed samples where almost every platinum atom is a surface atom compared to a platinum foil. However, the well-dispersed catalysts showed a significant sensitivity to oxygen poisoning, unlike other samples.

文档讨论了铂催化剂在0°C下氢化环丙烷的特定活性，发现其与铂含量和所用支撑材料类型无关，无论是氧化铝还是硅胶。它还指出，高度分散的样品中，几乎所有铂原子都是表面原子的情况下的特定活性与铂箔相似。然而，高度分散的催化剂对氧中毒表现出显著的敏感性，这与其他样品不同。
