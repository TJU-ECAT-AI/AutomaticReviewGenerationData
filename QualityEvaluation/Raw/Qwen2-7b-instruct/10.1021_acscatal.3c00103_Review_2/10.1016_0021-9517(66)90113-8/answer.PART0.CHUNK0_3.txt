[1] "The specific activity for hydrogenation of cyclopropane at 0 C on platinum catalysts was found to be independent of platinum content on two different forms of alumina, independent of the nature of the support with alumina or silica gel, and almost the same for highly dispersed samples in which nearly every platinum atom is a surface atom as for a platinum foil."
[2] "In contradistinction, a very marked susceptibility to oxygen poisoning was found for the well-dispersed catalysts that was not observed for the other samples."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve focusing on the dispersion of metal atoms on the support material. As demonstrated in the study, the specific activity of hydrogenation of cyclopropane at 0°C on platinum catalysts is independent of the platinum content on two different forms of alumina and silica gel supports. Moreover, it is observed that highly dispersed samples, where nearly every platinum atom is a surface atom, exhibit similar specific activity compared to a platinum foil. However, these well-dispersed catalysts show a significant vulnerability to oxygen poisoning, which is not observed in other samples.

最近开发的关键策略和方法，用于增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，涉及在支撑材料上分散金属原子。正如研究中所示，铂催化剂上氢化环丙烷的特定活动在两种不同形式的氧化铝和支持物与硅胶基质上的铂含量无关。此外，几乎每个铂原子都是表面原子的高度分散样品，在特定活性方面与铂箔相似。然而，这些分散良好的催化剂对氧气中毒表现出显著的敏感性，这是在其他样品中未观察到的。
