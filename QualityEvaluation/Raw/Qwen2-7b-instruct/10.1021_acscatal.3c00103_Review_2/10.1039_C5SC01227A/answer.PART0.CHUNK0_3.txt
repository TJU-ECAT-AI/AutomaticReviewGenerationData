Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes primarily revolve around strategies to mitigate coke formation. Key approaches include:

1. **Alloying**: Introducing metals like Au, Sn, or B into the catalyst matrix. This modifies the surface properties, reducing the formation of coke by altering the adsorption energies and reaction pathways.

2. **Blocking Sites**: Incorporating elements such as K, S, Au, or B to occupy critical sites on the catalyst surface. This prevents the accumulation of carbonaceous species, particularly at step edges where graphene islands typically form.

3. **Modifying Surface Structure**: Adjusting the catalyst composition or structure to inhibit the growth of graphene islands and formation of carbidic phases. For instance, adding B to Co surfaces to prevent the deposition of carbon.

4. **Regulating Reaction Conditions**: Controlling the hydrogen-to-feedstock ratio to balance the dehydrogenation process and coke formation. This ensures that the catalyst operates in a regime that minimizes deep dehydrogenation.

These strategies not only improve the catalyst's lifetime but also maintain its selectivity and activity, making them crucial for enhancing the overall efficiency of dehydrogenation processes in industrial applications.

在直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂稳定性的增强，主要集中在克服焦炭形成问题的策略上。关键方法包括：

1. **合金化**：向催化剂中引入Au、Sn或B等金属。这通过改变表面性质来减少焦炭形成，调整吸附能和反应路径。

2. **封锁位点**：将K、S、Au或B等元素引入到催化剂表面上的关键位置。这可以防止碳沉积物的积累，特别是阻止在台阶边缘形成石墨烯岛。

3. **修改表面结构**：调整催化剂组成或结构以抑制石墨烯岛屿和碳化相的形成。例如，在Co表面上添加B，以防止碳沉积。

4. **调节反应条件**：控制氢气与原料的比例，平衡脱氢过程和焦炭形成。确保催化剂运行在避免深度脱氢的范围内。

这些策略不仅提高了催化剂的使用寿命，而且保持了其选择性和活性，对于提高脱氢过程的整体效率至关重要。
