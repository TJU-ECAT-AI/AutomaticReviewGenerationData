[1] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[2] "The continuing improvements of computer hardware, the development of new functionals, as well as the increasing sophistication of computational electronic structure software have insured the ability of a computational study to access more complicated catalytic systems beyond simple transition-metal surfaces."
[3] "However, there are still limitations for current theoretical calculations to model more realistic catalytic systems."
[4] "In more complicated cases such as oxides, the reacting molecules can induce change of the structure of a catalyst, creating vacancies or oxidizing surface metal atoms, resulting in a large amount of different types of sites for elementary reactions, and dramatically increase the computational complexity."

Recent advancements in computational methods have enabled more sophisticated modeling of catalytic systems. The aim is to optimize catalysts for specific chemical processes. These methods, combined with improved hardware, new functionals, and advanced computational software, allow for the examination of complex systems beyond simple transition metals. Yet, significant challenges remain. Theoretical calculations struggle to accurately model realistic catalysts, particularly in cases involving oxides. Reactants can alter the catalyst's structure, leading to numerous reaction sites and increasing computational demands.
