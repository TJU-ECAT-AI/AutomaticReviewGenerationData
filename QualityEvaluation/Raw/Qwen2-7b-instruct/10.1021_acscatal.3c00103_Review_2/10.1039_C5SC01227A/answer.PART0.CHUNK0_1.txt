[1] "Similar to Ni, experimental and DFT studies on Co have shown that coke can be present as graphene islands as well as in the form of a surface carbide."
[2] "Similar to Ni, it has been shown that the presence of B may prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on Co, comparable to the case for Ni described above."
[3] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes. Recently developed BEP or other linear scaling relationships connect transition states, which are computationally expensive to be located, with simply calculated parameters or so called descriptors, such as reaction energies or binding energies."

1. Experimental and DFT studies on Cobalt (Co) have shown that coke can form in the form of graphene islands and a surface carbide, similar to Nickel (Ni).
2. Boron (B) has been shown to prevent the deposition of carbonaceous species on Cobalt (Co), akin to its effect on Nickel (Ni), by occupying adsorption sites that are preferred for carbon deposition.
3. The main goal of theoretical studies is to find the best catalysts for specific chemical processes. This is being achieved through the use of linear scaling relationships, which connect computationally intensive transition states with easily calculable parameters, such as reaction energies and binding energies.

1. 对钴（Co）的实验和DFT研究显示，焦炭可以以石墨烯岛的形式存在以及表面石墨化形式，类似于镍（Ni）。
2. 氧化硼（B）已被证明能够防止在钴（Co）上沉积碳基物种，类似于其对镍（Ni）的影响，通过占据偏好于碳沉积的吸附位点。
3. 理论研究的主要目标是找到特定化学过程的最佳催化剂。这正在通过建立过渡态与易于计算的参数（如反应能和结合能）之间的线性关系来实现。
