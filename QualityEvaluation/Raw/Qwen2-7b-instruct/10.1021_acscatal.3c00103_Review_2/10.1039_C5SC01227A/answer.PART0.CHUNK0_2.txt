[1] "In order to achieve the ultimate goal of identifying optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes, recently developed BEP or other linear scaling relationships connect transition states, which are computationally expensive to be located, with simply calculated parameters or so called descriptors, such as reaction energies or binding energies."
[2] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[3] "Although low dehydrogenation barrier indicates high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst, too high dehydrogenation activity might result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which in the worst case results in undesired coke formation."
[4] "The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters, the use of alloy catalysts, and the optimization of the support material."
