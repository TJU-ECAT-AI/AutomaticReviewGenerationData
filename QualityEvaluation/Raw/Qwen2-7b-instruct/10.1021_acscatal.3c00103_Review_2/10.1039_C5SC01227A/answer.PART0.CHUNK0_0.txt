[1] "Recently developed BEP or other linear scaling relationships connect transition states, which are computationally expensive to be located, with simply calculated parameters or so called descriptors, such as reaction energies or binding energies. These linear relationships reduce the complexity of a catalytic system from a high dimensional system with rate constants of N elementary steps to a few, in many cases even with only one or two, dimensions of descriptors, which offers a powerful strategy to achieve fast screening of large numbers of new catalysts."
[2] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[3] "Although low dehydrogenation barrier indicates high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst, too high dehydrogenation activity might result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which in the worst case results in undesired coke formation."
[4] "The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of advanced in situ characterizations, controllable synthesis via colloidal chemistry, and the development of computational approaches such as density functional theory (DFT)."
[5] "These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing insights into the active sites, reaction mechanisms, and optimal conditions for dehydrogenation reactions."
