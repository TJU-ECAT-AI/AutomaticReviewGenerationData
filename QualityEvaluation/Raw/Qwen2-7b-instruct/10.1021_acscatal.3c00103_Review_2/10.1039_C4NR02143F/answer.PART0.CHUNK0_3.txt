[1] "The introduction of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate."
[2] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al.17"
[3] "The addition of d-orbital filled Cu resulted in a weakened interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules as well as a higher energy barrier for CC rupture, since the Cu addition altered the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms."
[4] "The promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the incorporation of metal promoters. Promoters like Cu, Sn, La, Ga, and Zn are added to modify the electronic environment of the metal surface, thereby influencing the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products. This approach helps in reducing coke formation, improving selectivity, and enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst. The mechanisms behind these advancements often involve changes in the electronic structure of the metal surface, leading to altered reactivity pathways and energy barriers for key reactions. By doing so, these promoters enable the catalysts to operate more efficiently, especially in terms of selectivity and stability, addressing major challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.
