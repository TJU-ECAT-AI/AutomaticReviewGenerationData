Recent strategies and approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the strategic use of promoters. Promoters like copper (Cu) can be added to existing catalysts to improve their performance. In the case of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, the addition of Cu increases propylene selectivity and yield while reducing catalyst deactivation rates. This is achieved through the promotion of a unique PtCu bimetallic interaction, which inhibits propylene adsorption. This inhibition reduces the likelihood of coke formation and suppresses cracking reactions that lead to the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. The Cu addition also results in a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage, thereby enhancing the catalyst's anti-coking ability and overall stability. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving selectivity, stability, and efficiency in dehydrogenation processes.

Recent strategies and approaches aimed at enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the incorporation of copper (Cu) as a promoter in platinum (Pt)/alumina (Al2O3) catalysts. This approach specifically addresses challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by increasing propylene selectivity and yield, reducing catalyst deactivation rates, and improving anti-coking abilities. Copper addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts leads to an optimized 0.5 wt% loading content that achieves a high propylene selectivity of 90.8% with a corresponding propylene yield of 36.5%. The enhanced stability and selectivity are attributed to the suppression of propylene adsorption, which decreases the likelihood of coke formation and light hydrocarbon cracking reactions. Furthermore, the Cu addition ensures a higher energy barrier for carbon-carbon (CC) bond cleavage, thus promoting propylene selectivity while simultaneously inhibiting methane formation.

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on several key strategies. These include:

1. Modifying the surface properties of catalysts by adjusting metal loading or incorporating co-catalysts. This approach aims to improve the interaction between metals and their support, as well as the electronic environment on the metal surface. This modification can lead to enhanced stability and selectivity.

2. Investigating the synergistic effects of bimetallic systems, such as the PtCu bimetallic catalyst in this case. By introducing a second metal like copper, the catalytic performance can be significantly improved. This is due to the unique interaction between the metals, which can alter the adsorption behavior of reactants and products.

3. Optimizing the preparation methods of the catalysts to achieve better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles. This ensures that the active sites are well distributed and protected, reducing the risk of deactivation and enhancing the overall performance.

4. Conducting in-depth mechanistic studies to understand the fundamental reasons behind the enhanced catalytic properties. This includes characterizing the catalysts before and after use, analyzing the composition of coke deposits, and examining the electronic environment of the metal surface.

These advancements collectively address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and by implementing practical solutions to enhance stability, selectivity, and efficiency.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of promoters such as tin (Sn), lanthanum (La), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn). These additives modify the interfacial characteristics between the metal and support, facilitating the desorption of carbon deposits, improving catalyst stability. For instance, tin (Sn) changes the interface between Pt and ZSM-5 support, aiding in the removal of carbon deposits, while zinc (Zn) doping weakens propylene adsorption, enhancing anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity. Additionally, copper (Cu) addition to Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve n-butane conversion, stability, and C4 olefin selectivity. The optimal Cu loading content of 0.5 wt% significantly boosts propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. This improvement in stability and selectivity is primarily attributed to the unique bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu.
