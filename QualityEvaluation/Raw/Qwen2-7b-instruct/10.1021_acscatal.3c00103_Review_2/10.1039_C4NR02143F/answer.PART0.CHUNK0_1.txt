[1] "The introduction of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate."
[2] "The optimized loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which results in a propylene selectivity of 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%."
[3] "The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."
[4] "Additionally, the Cu addition improves propylene selectivity while suppressing methane formation since a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage is required on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

Recent strategies and approaches aimed at enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the incorporation of copper (Cu) as a promoter in platinum (Pt)/alumina (Al2O3) catalysts. This approach specifically addresses challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by increasing propylene selectivity and yield, reducing catalyst deactivation rates, and improving anti-coking abilities. Copper addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts leads to an optimized 0.5 wt% loading content that achieves a high propylene selectivity of 90.8% with a corresponding propylene yield of 36.5%. The enhanced stability and selectivity are attributed to the suppression of propylene adsorption, which decreases the likelihood of coke formation and light hydrocarbon cracking reactions. Furthermore, the Cu addition ensures a higher energy barrier for carbon-carbon (CC) bond cleavage, thus promoting propylene selectivity while simultaneously inhibiting methane formation.

最近，通过在铂/氧化铝催化剂中引入铜（Cu）作为促进剂，提出了增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略和方法。这种方法特别针对催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，通过提高丙烯选择性和产率、降低催化剂失活速率以及改善抗结焦能力来解决工业应用问题。向铂/氧化铝催化剂添加铜导致了优化的0.5%质量负载量，实现了高达90.8%的丙烯选择性以及相应的丙烯产率为36.5%。增强的稳定性和选择性归因于丙烯吸附的抑制，这降低了焦炭形成的可能性并减少了轻烃裂解反应。此外，铜添加确保了碳-碳（CC）键断裂所需的更高能量壁垒，从而在促进丙烯选择性的同时抑制甲烷形成。
