The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of promoters such as tin (Sn), lanthanum (La), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn). These additives modify the interfacial characteristics between the metal and support, facilitating the desorption of carbon deposits, improving catalyst stability. For instance, tin (Sn) changes the interface between Pt and ZSM-5 support, aiding in the removal of carbon deposits, while zinc (Zn) doping weakens propylene adsorption, enhancing anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity. Additionally, copper (Cu) addition to Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts has been shown to improve n-butane conversion, stability, and C4 olefin selectivity. The optimal Cu loading content of 0.5 wt% significantly boosts propylene selectivity to 90.8% with a propylene yield of 36.5%. This improvement in stability and selectivity is primarily attributed to the unique bimetallic interaction between Pt and Cu.

在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括使用诸如锡（Sn）、镧（La）、镓（Ga）和锌（Zn）等促进剂。这些添加剂改变了金属和支持之间的界面特性，促进了碳沉积物的脱附，提高了催化剂稳定性。例如，锡（Sn）改变了Pt与ZSM-5支持之间的界面，有助于碳沉积物的去除；而锌（Zn）掺杂减弱了丙烯的吸附，增强了抗结焦能力和丙烯选择性。此外，向Pt/Al2O3和Pd/Al2O3催化剂中添加铜（Cu）已被证明可以提高丁烷转化率、稳定性以及C4烯烃选择性。最佳的Cu负载含量为0.5 wt%，显著提高了丙烯选择性至90.8%，丙烯产率为36.5%。这种稳定性和选择性的改善主要归因于Pt和Cu之间独特的双金属相互作用。
