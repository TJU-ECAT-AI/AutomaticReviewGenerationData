[1] "The introduction of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate."
[2] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al.17 The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of PtZn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity."
[3] "The addition of d-orbital filled Cu resulted in a weakened interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules as well as a higher energy barrier for CC rupture, since the Cu addition altered the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms."
[4] "The promotional effect of Cu on the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

Recent strategies and approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the strategic use of promoters. Promoters like copper (Cu) can be added to existing catalysts to improve their performance. In the case of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, the addition of Cu increases propylene selectivity and yield while reducing catalyst deactivation rates. This is achieved through the promotion of a unique PtCu bimetallic interaction, which inhibits propylene adsorption. This inhibition reduces the likelihood of coke formation and suppresses cracking reactions that lead to the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. The Cu addition also results in a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage, thereby enhancing the catalyst's anti-coking ability and overall stability. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving selectivity, stability, and efficiency in dehydrogenation processes.

最近，提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂稳定性的策略和方法涉及使用促进剂。例如，在铂/氧化铝催化剂中添加铜（Cu）可以改善其性能。对于丙烷脱氢的铂/氧化铝催化剂，添加铜增加了丙烯选择性和产率，同时降低了催化剂失活率。这是通过促进独特的铂铜双金属相互作用实现的，这种相互作用抑制了丙烯吸附。这减少了焦炭形成的可能性，并抑制了向轻烃的裂解反应。铜添加还导致了CC键断裂能垒的增加，从而增强了催化剂的抗焦炭能力以及整体稳定性。这些进展解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化在工业应用中的挑战，通过提高选择性、稳定性和脱氢过程的效率来解决这些挑战。
