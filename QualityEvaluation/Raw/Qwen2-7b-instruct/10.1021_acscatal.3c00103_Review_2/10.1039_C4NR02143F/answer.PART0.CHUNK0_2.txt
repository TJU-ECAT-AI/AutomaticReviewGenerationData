[1] "The introduction of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate."
[2] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al.17 The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of PtZn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity."
[3] "The addition of Cu into the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst increases propylene selectivity and yield while decreasing the catalyst deactivation rate."
[4] "The primary origin of the enhancement upon Cu addition can be ascribed to the unique PtCu bimetallic interaction."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on several key strategies. These include:

1. Modifying the surface properties of catalysts by adjusting metal loading or incorporating co-catalysts. This approach aims to improve the interaction between metals and their support, as well as the electronic environment on the metal surface. This modification can lead to enhanced stability and selectivity.

2. Investigating the synergistic effects of bimetallic systems, such as the PtCu bimetallic catalyst in this case. By introducing a second metal like copper, the catalytic performance can be significantly improved. This is due to the unique interaction between the metals, which can alter the adsorption behavior of reactants and products.

3. Optimizing the preparation methods of the catalysts to achieve better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles. This ensures that the active sites are well distributed and protected, reducing the risk of deactivation and enhancing the overall performance.

4. Conducting in-depth mechanistic studies to understand the fundamental reasons behind the enhanced catalytic properties. This includes characterizing the catalysts before and after use, analyzing the composition of coke deposits, and examining the electronic environment of the metal surface.

These advancements collectively address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and by implementing practical solutions to enhance stability, selectivity, and efficiency.
