The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of isolated Pt atoms within a SiOZnOH matrix. This method improves stability and activity compared to traditional supported Pt catalysts. The incorporation of isolated Pt atoms in dealuminated zeolite beta provides an optimal framework for enhanced thermal stability and selectivity towards propylene production. Precise control over Pt atom dispersion and their interaction with the support material, achieved through careful synthesis, enables high-performance catalysis. For industrial applications, performance optimization necessitates continuous monitoring of reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, to maintain optimal catalytic activity.
