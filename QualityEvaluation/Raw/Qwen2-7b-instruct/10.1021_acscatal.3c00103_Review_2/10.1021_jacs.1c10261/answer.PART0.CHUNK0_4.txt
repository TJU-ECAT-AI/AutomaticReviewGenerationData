The recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of novel catalyst structures, such as isolated Pt atoms embedded in SiO-ZnOH nests within dealuminated zeolite beta. These advancements specifically target improvements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization. Key strategies include precise control over the dispersion of metal atoms on the support surface, which leads to enhanced activity and stability. The use of dealuminated zeolite beta provides an effective support structure that facilitates better metal-support interactions, thereby improving the catalyst's selectivity towards desired products, such as ethylene, while maintaining high stability over multiple reaction cycles.
