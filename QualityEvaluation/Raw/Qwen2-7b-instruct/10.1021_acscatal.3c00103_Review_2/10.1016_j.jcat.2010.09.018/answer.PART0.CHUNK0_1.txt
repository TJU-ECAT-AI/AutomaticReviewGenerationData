[1] "The majority of literature work mainly concentrates on the characterization of catalyst systems before and after only one dehydrogenation cycle."
[2] "However, the mechanism by which Sn as promoter modifies the catalytic behavior of Pt remains a matter of debate due to the complicated nature of the PtSn alloy system."
[3] "On the other hand, even though Sn is one of the most efficient promoters, deactivation due to coke formation is not avoidable and results in catalyst materials still exhibiting short lifetimes."
[4] "Therefore, unfortunately to date, it has not been possible to extract conclusive information regarding the basic principles of catalyst operation/deactivation of this important catalyst system under real reaction conditions."
[5] "Based on these new insights, a comprehensive working model for the short- and long-term deactivation of PtSn dehydrogenation catalysts is proposed."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve a combination of improved catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization techniques tailored for industrial applications. This includes the use of advanced characterization tools like in situ time-resolved UVVis, Raman, and high-energy resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy to understand the deactivation behavior of catalysts under realistic conditions. By examining the coke formation processes during dehydrogenation, researchers can correlate activity, stability, and selectivity with the structural and electronic properties of the catalysts. This approach enables the identification of structure-electronic-performance relationships and provides fundamental insights into the dynamics of alloy formation in supported catalysts, particularly in the context of PtSn systems. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of catalyst operation and deactivation mechanisms, which can inform the design of more stable and efficient catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes. This work contributes to addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization, ultimately aiming to extend catalyst lifetimes and enhance the economic viability of dehydrogenation reactions.
