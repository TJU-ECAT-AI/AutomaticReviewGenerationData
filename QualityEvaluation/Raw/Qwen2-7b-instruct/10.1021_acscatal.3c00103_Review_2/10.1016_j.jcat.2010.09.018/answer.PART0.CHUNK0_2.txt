[1] "The catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles has been studied under realistic reaction conditions."
[2] "Combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements were taken in order to follow the coke formation processes during propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "These in situ measurements on coke formation and related catalyst deactivation were supplemented by in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XANES measurements in order to characterize the structural and electronic properties of the supported Pt and PtSn nanoparticles during the successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[4] "This combination of powerful spectroscopic techniques revealed unique information regarding the activity behavior and deactivation mechanism of Pt- and PtSn-based propane dehydrogenation catalysts, enabling us to identify important structure-electronic-performance relationships as well as fundamental insight into the dynamics of PtSn alloy formation processes in Pt nanoparticles at elevated temperatures."
[5] "The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of advanced in situ spectroscopic techniques for real-time monitoring of catalyst behavior. These techniques include combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy for tracking coke formation, in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for characterizing structural and electronic properties, and the development of innovative reactor setups that enable concurrent online activity measurements, product monitoring, and spectroscopic analysis. By integrating these powerful methods, researchers gain unique insights into the activity behavior and deactivation mechanisms of catalysts, identifying critical structure-electronic-performance relationships and understanding the dynamics of alloy formation processes in metal nanoparticles at elevated temperatures. This approach facilitates the optimization of catalyst design, fabrication, and performance for industrial applications.
