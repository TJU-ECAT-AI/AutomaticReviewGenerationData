2.1. "However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation."
2.2. "There are several strategies to improve the catalytic behavior of Pt, including its promotion with a second metal."
2.3. "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability."
2.4. "Therefore, unfortunately to date, it has not been possible to extract conclusive information regarding the basic principles of catalyst operation/deactivation of this important catalyst system under real reaction conditions."
2.5. "The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements."
2.6. "The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed)."
2.7. "During the regeneration process in oxygen to burn-off the formed coke on the catalyst, sintering or segregation of the metals also takes place, causing irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."
2.8. "The XANES spectra obtained for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst after H2 reduction display a characteristic Pt(0) spectrum with the same edge position as a Pt foil reference."
2.9. "The Sn K edge was also measured during H2 treatment. XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2."
2.10. "From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtSn alloy formation is detected."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve:

1. **Improving Metal Stability**: Incorporating a second metal to improve the stability of the catalyst against deactivation due to coke formation. For instance, the addition of tin (Sn) to palladium (Pt) helps in altering the product distribution, inhibiting hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking, and coke formation, thus enhancing the catalyst's selectivity and stability.

2. **Real-Time Characterization Techniques**: Utilizing advanced in situ reactor setups that combine various spectroscopic techniques for real-time monitoring. These setups enable researchers to track the activity, stability, and selectivity of catalysts during dehydrogenation reactions, providing insights into the complex interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and products.

3. **Understanding Coke Formation Dynamics**: By monitoring the formation of coke during dehydrogenation, researchers can correlate the amount and type of coke with the catalyst's performance. This understanding helps in identifying the mechanisms that lead to catalyst deactivation and in developing strategies to mitigate these issues.

4. **Analyzing Structural and Electronic Properties**: Employing X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to analyze the structural and electronic properties of supported metal nanoparticles. This technique reveals the presence of alloys, such as PtSn, and their impact on the catalyst's activity, stability, and selectivity.

5. **Modifying Catalyst Behavior Through Alloy Formation**: Recognizing that the interaction between metals like Pt and Sn leads to the formation of alloys, which can alter the catalyst's electronic properties and activity. This phenomenon can be exploited to create catalysts with improved performance characteristics.

These advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization aim to address the challenges in achieving stable and efficient dehydrogenation processes under industrial conditions. By understanding and controlling the catalyst's behavior, researchers can develop more robust and sustainable catalyst systems for the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce valuable chemicals like propene.
