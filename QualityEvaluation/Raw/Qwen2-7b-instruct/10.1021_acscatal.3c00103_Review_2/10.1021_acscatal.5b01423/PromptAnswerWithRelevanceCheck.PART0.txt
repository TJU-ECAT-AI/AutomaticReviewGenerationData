1. The study focuses on the size-dependent reaction mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts. A series of Pt catalysts with different particle sizes (1 nm, 10 nm, and 50 nm) were synthesized. The reaction mechanism was explored using temperature programmed reaction (TPR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while kinetic parameters, including activation energy and pre-exponential factor, were determined for each size category. The research indicates that the reaction mechanism and kinetics are significantly influenced by the size of the catalyst particles. Smaller particles exhibit a higher reaction rate due to their increased surface area-to-volume ratio, whereas larger particles show a lower reaction rate because of decreased accessibility of reactants and products. Optimal catalyst size was identified for maximizing the dehydrogenation efficiency and stability.
