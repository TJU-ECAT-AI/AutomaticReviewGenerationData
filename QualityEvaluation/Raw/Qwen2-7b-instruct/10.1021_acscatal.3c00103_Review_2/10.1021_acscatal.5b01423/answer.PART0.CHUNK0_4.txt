1. The study focuses on the size-dependent reaction mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts. A series of Pt catalysts with different particle sizes (1 nm, 10 nm, and 50 nm) were synthesized. The reaction mechanism was explored using temperature programmed reaction (TPR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while kinetic parameters, including activation energy and pre-exponential factor, were determined for each size category. The research indicates that the reaction mechanism and kinetics are significantly influenced by the size of the catalyst particles. Smaller particles exhibit a higher reaction rate due to their increased surface area-to-volume ratio, whereas larger particles show a lower reaction rate because of decreased accessibility of reactants and products. Optimal catalyst size was identified for maximizing the dehydrogenation efficiency and stability.

1. 研究主要关注铂催化剂上丙烷脱氢的尺寸依赖性反应机制和动力学。研究合成了一系列不同粒径（1nm、10nm和50nm）的铂催化剂。通过温度程序反应（TPR）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）等技术探索了反应机制，确定了每个粒径类别中的动力学参数，包括活化能和预指数因子。研究结果表明，催化剂颗粒的大小显著影响反应机制和动力学。较小的颗粒由于表面积与体积比增加而表现出更高的反应速率，而较大的颗粒则因为反应物和产物的可接近性降低而表现出较低的反应速率。已确定最佳催化剂粒径，以实现脱氢效率和稳定性最大化。
