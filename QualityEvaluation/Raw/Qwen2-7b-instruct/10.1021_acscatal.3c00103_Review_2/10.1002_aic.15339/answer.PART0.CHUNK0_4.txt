The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve incorporating specific metal elements into the catalyst structure. In this case, gallium (Ga) has been introduced to Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts. This approach aims to simultaneously enhance the redox property of ceria (CeO2) and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles. By doing so, the Ga element improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), specifically increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability. The mechanism involves Ga3+ ions being incorporated into the CeO2 lattice, which increases the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM). This results in higher capability to eliminate coke deposition and improves the catalytic stability. Simultaneously, Ga atoms migrate and incorporate into Pt nanoclusters, forming PtGa alloys. The formation of these alloys contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking low-coordinated defect active sites, suppressing structure-sensitive side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation. Additionally, the Ga atoms donate electrons to Pt atoms, lowering the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors, which helps in hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing more stable and selective catalysts for PDH processes.

最近开发的关键策略和技术，以提高直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性，涉及在催化剂结构中引入特定的金属元素。在这种情况下，已经向Pt/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂中引入了镓（Ga）。这种方法旨在同时增强氧化铈（CeO2）的还原性质，并修改铂（Pt）纳米颗粒的催化性质。通过这种方式，Ga元素提高了Pt催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的催化性能，具体表现为提高了丙烯选择性和增强了催化稳定性。该机制涉及Ga3+离子被集成到CeO2晶格中，这增加了氧存储容量（OSC）和氧流动性（OM）。这导致了更高的能力来消除焦炭沉积并改善催化稳定性。同时，Ga原子迁移到Pt纳米簇中，形成PtGa合金。这些合金的形成归因于几何和电子效应的组合。几何效应使铂簇尺寸减小或阻塞低配位缺陷活性位点，从而抑制结构敏感的副反应，如氢解离和深度脱氢。此外，Ga原子向铂原子捐赠电子，降低了烯烃和焦炭前体的脱附壁垒，帮助阻止烯烃吸附在金属位点上，减少了氢解离和积碳的可能性。这些进步解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，为工业应用提供了更加稳定和选择性的催化剂用于PDH过程。
