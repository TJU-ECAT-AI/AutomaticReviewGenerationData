The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve incorporating specific metal ions, such as gallium (Ga), into the catalyst structure. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Enhancing the reducibility of ceria (CeO2), which leads to higher capability to eliminate coke deposition and thus improves catalytic stability. This is achieved by incorporating Ga3+ cations into the CeO2 lattice structure, increasing the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM).

2. Decorating Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys. This is attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of gallium (Ga). The geometric effect decreases the size of Pt ensembles or blocks low-coordinated defect active sites, suppressing structure-sensitive side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation. The electronic effect lowers the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donating electrons to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption and decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking.

3. Optimizing the amount of gallium (Ga) loading. The optimal loading content of Ga is around 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation. This ensures an optimal balance between the composition of PtGa alloy and the redox properties of Ga-modified CeO2, avoiding excessive Ga atoms that might block Pt active sites.

These strategies and approaches contribute to the development of more stable, selective, and efficient catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近，人们开发的关键策略和方法是将特定金属离子（如镓（Ga））引入催化剂结构中，以增强受支持金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性。这些进展通过以下方式解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战：

1. 提高氧化铈（CeO2）的可还原性，从而提高消除焦炭沉积的能力并改善催化稳定性。这通过将Ga3+离子整合到CeO2晶格结构中来实现，增加氧气存储容量（OSC）和氧动力学（OM）。

2. 通过形成PtGa合金装饰铂纳米粒子。这归因于镓（Ga）的几何和电子效应的结合。几何效应降低了铂簇的尺寸或阻止了低配位缺陷活性位点，抑制了结构敏感的副反应，如氢解离和深脱氢。电子效应通过向铂原子捐赠电子降低烯烃和焦炭前体的脱附壁垒，阻碍烯烃吸附并减少氢解离和结焦的可能性。

3. 最佳化镓（Ga）负载量。最佳的Ga负载量约为3 wt%，可以实现最大丙烯选择性和最佳的抗焦炭沉积催化稳定性。这确保了PtGa合金的组成与Ga改性CeO2的可还原性之间达到最佳平衡，避免了过多的Ga原子可能阻塞Pt活性位点的情况。

这些策略和方法有助于开发更稳定、选择性更高且效率更高的工业应用中的直接脱氢过程催化剂。
