Recent developments in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve incorporating specific elements like gallium (Ga) into the catalyst structure. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving the stability of the catalyst against coke accumulation, which is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the dehydrogenation reactions. Ga doping enhances the redox properties of ceria (CeO2), a common support material, by incorporating Ga3+ ions into its lattice structure. This leads to an increase in the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM), which are beneficial for eliminating coke deposits and supporting active sites.

2. Modifying the catalytic properties of the supported metal, in this case, platinum (Pt), by forming PtGa alloys. The geometric effect of Ga atoms in the alloy can decrease the size of Pt clusters or block low-coordinated defect sites, which helps in suppressing structure-sensitive side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation. 

3. Enhancing the electronic properties of the catalyst by donating electrons from Ga atoms to the Pt active sites, which lowers the desorption barrier of alkene and coke precursors, thereby reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. This leads to improved selectivity towards desired products like propylene.

4. Optimizing the amount of Ga loading to achieve a balance between enhancing the redox properties of CeO2 and modifying the Pt nanoparticles without compromising the catalytic performance. The optimal loading of Ga typically lies around 3 wt %, which maximizes propylene selectivity and catalytic stability against coke accumulation.

In summary, the key strategies involve incorporating Ga into the catalyst structure, which modifies both the ceria support and the metal nanoparticles, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近，在直接脱氢过程中增强支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性的开发涉及将特定元素如镓（Ga）引入催化剂结构中。这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，适用于工业应用：

1. 提高催化剂抵抗焦炭积聚的能力，这对于保持脱氢反应的效率至关重要。Ga掺杂增强了氧化铈（CeO2）的还原性，一种常用的支撑材料，通过在其晶格结构中掺入Ga3+离子来实现。这导致氧气储存容量（OSC）和氧流动性（OM）的增加，有利于清除焦炭沉积并支持活性位点。

2. 通过形成PtGa合金修改支持的金属性质，在这种情况下是铂（Pt）。Ga原子在合金中的几何效应可以减少Pt簇的大小或阻塞低配位缺陷位点，有助于抑制结构敏感的副反应，如氢解离和深度脱氢。

3. 通过从Ga原子向Pt活性位点捐赠电子增强催化剂的电性质，降低了烷烃和焦炭前体的脱附阈值，从而减少了氢解离和结焦反应。这提高了对所需产品如丙烯的选择性。

4. 优化Ga的负载量以实现CeO2的还原特性和Pt纳米粒子的修改之间的平衡，同时不牺牲催化性能。通常，最佳的Ga负载量约为3 wt %，这最大化了丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性，对抗焦炭沉积。

简而言之，关键策略包括在催化剂结构中加入Ga，同时修改CeO2支撑材料和金属纳米颗粒，从而在直接脱氢过程中增强稳定性和选择性。

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve incorporating gallium (Ga) elements into the catalysts. This approach aims to simultaneously improve the redox properties of ceria (CeO2) components and modify the catalytic characteristics of Pt nanoparticles. The incorporation of Ga into the ceria lattice structure increases the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM), which is beneficial for eliminating coke deposition and improving catalytic stability. Moreover, Ga forms PtGa alloys with Pt nanoparticles, which can suppress hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, and coking reactions due to geometric and electronic effects.
