<p>The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability.</p>
<p>According to XRD results, Ga3+ cations are incorporated into the host lattice structure of CeO2.</p>
<p>The OSC and OM results reveal that the doping of Ga enhances the redox property of catalysts.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the addition of Ga is prone to decorate Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys.</p>
<p>The influence of forming PtGa alloys on the catalytic performance can be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects.</p>
<p>The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The electronic effect of promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking.</p>
<p>With the addition of 1 wt % Ga, both the composition of PtGa alloy and the reducibility of Ga-modified CeO2 are not satisfactory, which accounts for the low catalytic stability and poor propylene selectivity over the Pt1Ga/CeAl catalyst.</p>
<p>With excessive Ga addition (e.g., 5 wt %), the ratio of Ga/Pt exceeds the ideal value, which leads to superfluous Ga atoms blocking the Pt active sites gradually.</p>
<p>The optimal loading content of Ga is around 3 wt %, which results in the maximal propylene selectivity together with the best catalytic stability against coke accumulation.</p>

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve incorporating gallium (Ga) elements into the catalysts. This approach aims to simultaneously improve the redox properties of ceria (CeO2) components and modify the catalytic characteristics of Pt nanoparticles. The incorporation of Ga into the ceria lattice structure increases the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM), which is beneficial for eliminating coke deposition and improving catalytic stability. Moreover, Ga forms PtGa alloys with Pt nanoparticles, which can suppress hydrogenolysis, deep dehydrogenation, and coking reactions due to geometric and electronic effects. The optimal loading of Ga is found to be around 3 wt%, resulting in enhanced propylene selectivity and stability against coke accumulation.

最近，为提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，开发的关键策略和方法是将镓（Ga）元素引入催化剂中。这种方法旨在同时增强氧化铈（CeO2）成分的还原性能并修改铂（Pt）纳米颗粒的催化特性。将Ga掺入CeO2晶格结构中增加了氧储存容量（OSC）和氧流动性（OM），有利于消除焦炭沉积并改善催化稳定性。此外，Ga与Pt纳米颗粒形成PtGa合金，由于几何和电子效应，可以抑制氢解离、深度脱氢和结焦反应。发现Ga的最佳负载量约为3 wt%，从而实现丙烯选择性增强和焦炭沉积稳定性最佳。
