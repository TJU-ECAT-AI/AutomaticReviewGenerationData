The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve doping the catalysts with specific elements. In the context of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), gallium (Ga) has been introduced as a promoter to Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts. This approach aims to simultaneously enhance the redox property of ceria (CeO2) and modify the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles. Ga incorporation into the CeO2 lattice structure increases its oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM), contributing to higher capability to eliminate coke deposition and thus improving catalytic stability. Moreover, Ga promotes the formation of PtGa alloys with Pt nanoparticles, which has both geometric and electronic effects. The geometric effect decreases the size of Pt ensembles or blocks low-coordinated defect sites, suppressing structure-sensitive reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation. The electronic effect lowers the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors, hindering their adsorption on metal sites and decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking. The optimal Ga loading of 3 wt% achieves the best balance between propylene selectivity and catalytic stability against coke accumulation. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by enhancing both stability and selectivity in PDH processes.

近年来，为提高直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发了一系列策略和方法。在丙烷脱氢（PDH）的背景下，镓（Ga）已被引入到Pt/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂中作为促进剂。该策略旨在同时增强氧化铈（CeO2）的还原性，并修改铂纳米粒子的性质。Ga嵌入到CeO2晶格结构中，提高了其氧储存容量（OSC）和氧流动性（OM），从而增强了消除焦炭沉积的能力，进而提高了催化稳定性。此外，Ga促进了PtGa合金在铂纳米颗粒中的形成，这具有几何和电子效应。几何效应减少了铂簇的尺寸或阻塞低配位缺陷活性位点，抑制了结构敏感反应如氢解和深脱氢。电子效应降低了烯烃和焦炭前体的脱附壁垒，阻碍了它们在金属位点上的吸附，减少了氢解和焦化的可能性。3 wt%的最佳Ga负载实现了最佳的丙烯选择性和对焦炭积累的催化稳定性。这些进步解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，通过提高稳定性和选择性来优化PDH过程。
