1. The key strategy involves enhancing the activity and selectivity of supported metal catalysts by converting isolated vanadia species into polymeric VOx species through high-temperature oxygen treatment. This approach improves the catalyst's performance in direct dehydrogenation processes by increasing the selectivity towards desired products like C4 dehydrogenation products.

2. The advancement focuses on optimizing catalyst design by leveraging the properties of polymeric VOx species. These species exhibit higher selectivity for C4 dehydrogenation products, offering a significant improvement over isolated vanadia species which have high activity but poor selectivity due to coke formation.

3. The process of transforming V2O5-like surface species into polymeric vanadates is achieved by exposing the catalyst to oxygen at high temperatures. This treatment increases the catalytic activity, making it more effective for dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Regeneration of the catalyst involves removing the polyolefinic coke species through high-temperature treatment. However, this is not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, the main factor leading to deactivation is the presence of tightly bound reaction intermediates that can be removed under mild conditions.

5. The catalyst deactivation is attributed to the removal of tightly bound reaction intermediates rather than the polyolefinic coke species. High-temperature regeneration effectively removes the coke, but the catalyst's performance is still affected by the residual tightly bound intermediates.

2. 这项进展集中在优化催化剂设计，利用聚型VOx物种的特性。这些物种对于C4脱氢产物具有更高的选择性，显著优于活性高但选择性差且易形成焦炭的孤立钒酸盐物种。

3. 将V2O5类表面物种转化为聚型范德华物种的过程通过将催化剂暴露于高温氧气下实现。这种处理增加了催化活性，使其对脱氢反应更为有效。

4. 催化剂再生涉及通过高温处理去除聚烯烃焦炭物种。然而，这不是催化剂失活的主要原因。相反，催化剂失活主要归因于紧固的反应中间体的存在，这些中间体在温和条件下可以被去除。

5. 催化剂失活归因于紧固的反应中间体的去除，而不是聚烯烃焦炭物种。高温再生有效地去除了焦炭，但催化剂性能仍受到残留的紧固中间体的影响。

[1] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."
[2] "The principle reason for these low values is the high selectivities to retained carbon."
[3] "It is clear from Table 4 that reoxidation does not replace 100% of the oxygen removed during reduction, with lower loading catalysts taking up less oxygen."
[4] "These changes affect both the supported vanadia species and the Al2O3 support. Changes in the structure of the VOx units are observed through 51V MAS NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies."
[5] "That less oxygen is required for regeneration than was removed during reduction can be explained if larger aggregates of vanadium were to exist on the reoxidised catalysts than on the as-prepared materials as larger clusters have lower O/V ratios."

1. To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent strategies focus on the manipulation of surface vanadia species to achieve a balance between high activity and selectivity. This involves creating isolated vanadia species for high activity but low selectivity, and polymeric vanadates for better selectivity in C4 dehydrogenation products. High-temperature treatments can transform surface V2O5-like species into more active polymeric vanadates, thus optimizing catalytic performance.

2. The challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications are addressed by carefully controlling the vanadium loading and the structure of the supported vanadate units. This ensures that the catalysts exhibit desirable properties for the specific dehydrogenation reactions, balancing efficiency and selectivity.

3. Regeneration of the catalysts after reaction leads to the restoration of vanadia species through reoxidation, but it does not completely replace the oxygen removed during reduction. Lower loading catalysts require less oxygen for regeneration, indicating that larger clusters of vanadium might form during reoxidation.

4. After regeneration, the structure of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts undergoes changes affecting both the vanadia species and the aluminum oxide support. This includes the formation of more crystalline VOx species and a reduction in the surface area of the support, which alters the catalytic behavior of the regenerated catalysts.

5. The phase transformation of the aluminum oxide support, catalyzed by vanadium, occurs above 823 K during regeneration. This transformation contributes to the changes in catalytic activity observed in the regenerated catalysts compared to the as-prepared materials.

1. 为了提高直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，最近的发展策略集中在调整表面钒化物种，以在高活性与高选择性之间取得平衡。这包括通过创建孤立的钒物种来实现高活性但低选择性，以及通过聚合钒酸盐来提高C4脱氢产物的选择性。高温处理可以将表面V2O5样物种转化为更活跃的聚合钒酸盐，从而优化催化剂性能。

2. 针对工业应用中的催化剂设计、制造和性能优化挑战，通过精确控制范德华负载和支撑钒酸盐单元的结构来解决。确保催化剂具有特定脱氢反应所需的有利性质，平衡效率和选择性。

3. 催化剂再生后，通过氧化还原恢复钒化物种，但不会完全替换在还原期间移除的氧气。负载较低的催化剂需要较少的氧气进行再生，表明在再生过程中可能形成较大的钒簇。

4. 再生后，VOx/Al2O3催化剂的结构发生变化，影响了钒化物种和支持铝氧化物。这包括形成更结晶的VOx物种和支撑材料表面积的减少，从而改变再生催化剂的催化行为。

5. 在再生过程中，由钒催化，铝氧化物发生相变，发生在823 K以上。这种转变导致再生催化剂与原始材料相比观察到的催化活性变化。
