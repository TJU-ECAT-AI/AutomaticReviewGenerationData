[1] "Through the application of a number of analytical techniques we have provided additional insight as to the relationship between surface VOx species and catalytic activity towards n-butane dehydrogenation."
[2] "Isolated vanadia species show high activity, but very low selectivity due to the undesirable formation of coke. Polymeric VOx species however show a greater selectivity towards the desired C4 dehydrogenation products."
[3] "The formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species can be achieved through treatment with O2 at high temperatures, thereby increasing catalytic activity."
[4] "After regeneration, the catalytic activity of the catalysts changes as a result of transformations to both the surface VOx species and the pure support, with vanadium appearing to catalyse a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K."
[5] "The polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature regeneration are not however the principle source of catalyst deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound reaction intermediates."

1. To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, researchers have recently developed strategies focusing on optimizing surface VOx species and improving catalyst design, fabrication, and performance. 

2. The key approach involves achieving high selectivity for desired C4 dehydrogenation products by forming polymeric VOx species from V2O5-like surface species through treatment with oxygen at high temperatures. This enhances catalytic activity.

3. Post-regeneration, catalysts experience changes in activity due to transformations in both surface VOx species and the pure support, indicating that vanadium can catalyze a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K.

4. The primary cause of catalyst deactivation in n-butane dehydrogenation is not polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature regeneration, but rather tightly bound reaction intermediates.

1. 提升直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括优化表面VOx物种并改进催化剂设计、制造和性能。 

2. 关键方法是通过在高温下使用氧气处理从V2O5-like表面物种形成聚态VOx物种，以增强催化活性并实现对所需C4脱氢产物的高选择性。

3. 再生后，催化剂的活性会因表面VOx物种和纯支持的转变而改变，表明在823K以上，钒可以催化Al2O3相变。

4. n-丁烷脱氢过程中催化剂失活的主要原因不是通过高温再生去除的聚烯烃焦油物种，而是紧密吸附的反应中间体。
