[1] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."
[2] "The catalysts employed in this study have been pre-calcined at 823 K. Calcination temperature is known to strongly influence catalyst structure and therefore catalytic performance."
[3] "For instance after 2 h 8 V has lost 37.7 μg/mgcat while 1 V only 24.3 μg/mgcat."
[4] "Despite the apparent reduction of V5+ to V3+, previous UVvis DRS studies have clearly demonstrated the presence of partially reduced V4+ species after reduction in H2."
[5] "It was observed that the catalyst activity differed in the second and subsequent cycles from that seen in the first, e.g. after 15 min on stream n-butane conversion over 3.5 V was 32.9% and 19.1% for the as-prepared and regenerated catalysts, respectively."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:
1. Increasing the domain size of supported vanadate units through adjusting vanadium loading to improve catalyst structure and performance.
2. Modifying calcination temperature to control catalyst structure, affecting catalytic activity and selectivity.
3. Monitoring mass loss and oxidation state changes during reduction to understand catalyst dynamics and behavior.
4. Regeneration at high temperatures to transform catalysts back to their initial state, enhancing catalytic activity.
5. Identifying and removing tightly bound reaction intermediates rather than focusing solely on polyolefinic coke species for catalyst deactivation.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：
1. 通过调整钒负载来增加支持范德华单元的域大小，以改善催化剂结构和性能。
2. 调整煅烧温度来控制催化剂结构，影响催化活性和选择性。
3. 监测还原过程中的质量损失和氧化态变化，以理解催化剂动态行为。
4. 在高温下进行再生，将催化剂恢复到初始状态，增强催化活性。
5. 确定并移除紧密吸附的反应中间体，而不是仅关注聚烯烃焦油物种作为催化剂失活的主要原因。
