[1] "Isolated vanadia species show high activity, but very low selectivity due to the undesirable formation of coke."
[2] "Polymeric VOx species however show a greater selectivity towards the desired C4 dehydrogenation products."
[3] "The formation of polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species can be achieved through treatment with O2 at high temperatures, thereby increasing catalytic activity."
[4] "After regeneration, the catalytic activity of the catalysts changes as a result of transformations to both the surface VOx species and the pure support, with vanadium appearing to catalyse a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K."
[5] "The polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature regeneration are not however the principle source of catalyst deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound reaction intermediates."

1. The key strategy involves enhancing the activity and selectivity of supported metal catalysts by converting isolated vanadia species into polymeric VOx species through high-temperature oxygen treatment. This approach improves the catalyst's performance in direct dehydrogenation processes by increasing the selectivity towards desired products like C4 dehydrogenation products.

2. The advancement focuses on optimizing catalyst design by leveraging the properties of polymeric VOx species. These species exhibit higher selectivity for C4 dehydrogenation products, offering a significant improvement over isolated vanadia species which have high activity but poor selectivity due to coke formation.

3. The process of transforming V2O5-like surface species into polymeric vanadates is achieved by exposing the catalyst to oxygen at high temperatures. This treatment increases the catalytic activity, making it more effective for dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Regeneration of the catalyst involves removing the polyolefinic coke species through high-temperature treatment. However, this is not the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Instead, the main factor leading to deactivation is the presence of tightly bound reaction intermediates that can be removed under mild conditions.

5. The catalyst deactivation is attributed to the removal of tightly bound reaction intermediates rather than the polyolefinic coke species. High-temperature regeneration effectively removes the coke, but the catalyst's performance is still affected by the residual tightly bound intermediates.

1. 提升催化剂活性和选择性的重要策略是通过高温氧处理将孤立的钒酸盐物种转化为聚型VOx物种。这种方法通过提高C4脱氢产物的选择性，从而改善直接脱氢过程中的催化剂性能。

2. 这项进展集中在优化催化剂设计，利用聚型VOx物种的特性。这些物种对于C4脱氢产物具有更高的选择性，显著优于活性高但选择性差且易形成焦炭的孤立钒酸盐物种。

3. 将V2O5类表面物种转化为聚型范德华物种的过程通过将催化剂暴露于高温氧气下实现。这种处理增加了催化活性，使其对脱氢反应更为有效。

4. 催化剂再生涉及通过高温处理去除聚烯烃焦炭物种。然而，这不是催化剂失活的主要原因。相反，催化剂失活主要归因于紧固的反应中间体的存在，这些中间体在温和条件下可以被去除。

5. 催化剂失活归因于紧固的反应中间体的去除，而不是聚烯烃焦炭物种。高温再生有效地去除了焦炭，但催化剂性能仍受到残留的紧固中间体的影响。
