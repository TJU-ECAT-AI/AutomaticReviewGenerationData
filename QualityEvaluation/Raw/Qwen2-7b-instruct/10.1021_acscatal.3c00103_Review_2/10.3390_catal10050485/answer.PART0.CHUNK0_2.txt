[1] "At present, Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, Ce-based catalysts, etc., are mainly novel catalysts developed by researchers [4,5,6]. However, Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity [1,7,8,9,10]."
[2] "The support materials, Al2O3 [11], SiO2 [6], ZrO2 [12,13] and zeolite [3,14], can also affect catalytic performance on account of the significant differences in textural properties."
[3] "Simultaneously, the stability of support plays an important role in reactions. Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks [17,24], growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates [25,26] and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2) [27,28,29]."
[4] "In this paper, the influence of reduction atmospheres on the structural properties and catalytic performance of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO (PtIn/MAZ) catalytic system was studied."
[5] "Since the activities of C3H8/H2/N2- and H2/N2-reduced catalytic systems were much higher than those of the others, the reaction time was extended to 30 h to compare the stability of the C3H8/H2/N2- and H2/N2-reduced catalytic systems."
[6] "This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Utilization of advanced materials such as Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, Ce-based catalysts, and Pt-based catalysts with promoters like In, Sn, Ga, or Zn, which can improve propylene selectivity.
2. Selection of appropriate support materials like Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and zeolites that impact catalytic performance due to variations in textural properties.
3. Stabilization of HT-based catalysts through integration with graphene networks, growth on metal or alloy substrates, or loading onto oxide materials such as γ-Al2O3, ZnO, and SnO2.
4. Investigation of the influence of reduction atmospheres on the structural properties and catalytic performance of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO catalytic system.
5. Extension of reaction times to compare the stability of catalysts reduced under different atmospheres, highlighting the importance of reduction conditions.
6. Enhancement of catalytic stability attributed to high Pt dispersion, a high In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size, which also contribute to a reduced coke deposit content on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on material selection, modification techniques, and reaction conditions to improve stability, selectivity, and efficiency.
