[1] "The preparation and structure studies of catalysts with high efficiency propylene yield become the key point of PDH."
[2] "However, Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity."
[3] "Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates, and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)."
[4] "It is well known that the activity of PDH is susceptible to many factors. Some researchers have studied the preparation conditions of Mg(Al)O support, such as Mg/Al molar ratio, pH value, and calcination temperature of the HT precursor."
[5] "On this basis, ZnO-supported HT was prepared by the hydrothermal method, then In and Pt elements were introduced into the HT layer by sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction."
[6] "The results in Table 1, the 48% dispersion of H2/N2 reduced sample is obviously higher than the 34% dispersion of the C3H8/H2/N2-reduced one. This indicates that the H2/N2-reduced catalyst had a higher utilization of Pt."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of high-efficiency propylene yield catalysts, especially those containing promoters like Indium (In), Tin (Sn), Gallium (Ga), or Zinc (Zn) with Platinum (Pt). Researchers have also focused on stabilizing hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts through various methods such as incorporating graphene networks, growing them on metal substrates like Aluminum (Al) or Nickel (Ni), or loading them onto oxide materials like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, or SnO2. Preparation conditions of Mg(Al)O supports, including Mg/Al molar ratio, pH value, and calcination temperature of the HT precursor, have also been studied. The study uses a ZnO-supported HT, which is prepared through a hydrothermal method. In and Pt elements are then introduced into the HT layer via sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction. The study reveals that the H2/N2 reduction atmosphere leads to a higher Pt dispersion (48%) compared to the C3H8/H2/N2 atmosphere (34%), suggesting better utilization of Pt in the former.

在直接脱氢过程中，提高支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括使用高效丙烯产率催化剂，特别是含有铂（Pt）与促进剂如铟（In）、锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）或锌（Zn）。研究人员还专注于通过各种方式稳定基于水滑石（HT）的催化剂，如引入石墨烯网络、在铝（Al）或镍（Ni）等金属基材上生长，或者负载在氧化物材料如γ-Al2O3、ZnO或SnO2上。研究了镁（Al）氧支持的制备条件，包括镁/铝摩尔比、HT前体的pH值和煅烧温度。通过水热法制备ZnO支持的HT，然后通过顺序浸渍诱导重建将In和Pt元素引入HT层。结果显示，H2/N2还原气氛下的Pt分散度（48%）明显高于C3H8/H2/N2气氛（34%），表明前者更好地利用了Pt。
