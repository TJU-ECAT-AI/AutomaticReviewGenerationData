[1] "In recent years, the dehydrogenation of low alkanes to the corresponding alkenes has drawn great attention from the world, due to their extensive utilization as raw materials and a versatile class of intermediates in the polymer industry."
[2] "However, Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity."
[3] "Simultaneously, the stability of support plays an important role in reactions. Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks [17,24], growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates [25,26] and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2) [27,28,29]."
[4] "Most of the factors have been studied in detail. However, this does not seem to be the case for the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts. Thus, the relationships between reduction atmosphere and catalysts performance deserve to be studied."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing promoters, improving support stability, and optimizing the reduction atmosphere. Promoters like indium (In), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), or zinc (Zn) are incorporated to boost propylene selectivity. Supporting materials such as graphene networks, metals, alloys, or oxides like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, and SnO2 are used to stabilize the catalysts. The reduction atmosphere of the catalysts is another crucial factor that has not been extensively studied, yet it significantly influences their physicochemical properties and catalytic performance. Research focuses on understanding the relationship between the reduction atmosphere and catalyst performance to optimize dehydrogenation processes.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，开发的关键策略和方法包括使用促进剂、改善支撑材料的稳定性以及优化还原气氛。促进剂如铟（In）、锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）或锌（Zn）被引入以提高丙烯选择性。使用石墨烯网络、金属、合金或氧化物（γ-Al2O3、ZnO和SnO2）等作为支持材料来稳定催化剂。还原气氛是催化剂的另一个关键因素，它对催化剂的物理化学性质和催化性能有显著影响。研究重点在于理解还原气氛与催化剂性能之间的关系，以优化脱氢过程。
