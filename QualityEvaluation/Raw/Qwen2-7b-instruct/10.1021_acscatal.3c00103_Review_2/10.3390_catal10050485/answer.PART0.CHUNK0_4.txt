[1] "In recent years, the dehydrogenation of low alkanes to the corresponding alkenes has drawn great attention from the world, due to their extensive utilization as raw materials and a versatile class of intermediates in the polymer industry."
[2] "However, Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity."
[3] "Simultaneously, the stability of support plays an important role in reactions. Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates, and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)."
[4] "However, this does not seem to be the case for the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts. Thus, the relationships between reduction atmosphere and catalysts performance deserve to be studied."
[5] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2 can reach 51% and 97%, respectively, and even stabilize at 45% and 92% after running for 30 h."
[6] "This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."

1. Recently, the dehydrogenation of low alkanes has attracted global interest due to their broad use in the polymer industry as raw materials and versatile intermediates. Platinum-based catalysts, often enhanced with promoters like Indium, Tin, Gallium, or Zinc, are considered the most effective for the PDH process, improving propylene selectivity.

2. The stability of the support material significantly influences the effectiveness of reactions. Researchers have attempted to stabilize hydrotalcite-based catalysts through various methods, such as incorporating graphene networks, growing on metal surfaces (like Aluminum or Nickel), or loading onto oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2).

3. The study of the reduction atmosphere's impact on the performance of Mg(Al)O-supported platinum-based catalysts is a critical area of research. This is because the current understanding of catalyst performance does not adequately consider the role of the reduction atmosphere.

4. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO catalyst, when reduced with H2/N2, demonstrated remarkable performance. It achieved a propane conversion rate of 51% and a propylene selectivity of 97%. After running for 30 hours, the conversion stabilized at 45% and the propylene selectivity at 92%.

5. These outcomes are primarily attributed to the high dispersion of platinum, the ratio of zero-valent Indium to trivalent Indium, a strong interaction between platinum and Indium, and the small size of metal particles. These features contribute to a low coke deposit content on the surface of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2.

1. 近年来，低烷烃脱氢引起了全球的关注，因为它们在聚合物工业中作为原材料和多功能中间体的广泛用途。铂基催化剂，通常与铟、锡、镓或锌等促进剂结合使用，被认为是PDH过程中最有效的催化剂，能进一步提高丙烯选择性。

2. 支持材料的稳定性对反应具有重要影响。研究人员尝试通过多种方法稳定基于水滑石的催化剂，如与石墨烯网络结合、在金属（铝、镍）或合金基板上生长，或负载在氧化物材料（γ-Al2O3、ZnO、SnO2）上。

3. 目前，对于Mg(Al)O支持的铂基催化剂的还原气氛对其性能的影响研究不足。这是因为当前催化剂性能的理解并未充分考虑还原气氛的作用。

4. PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO催化剂，在用H2/N2还原后表现出卓越的性能。它实现了丙烷转化率为51%，丙烯选择性为97%。运行30小时后，转化率稳定在45%，丙烯选择性稳定在92%。

5. 这些结果主要归因于铂的高分散度，零价铟与三价铟的比例，铂与铟之间的强烈相互作用，以及金属颗粒的小尺寸。这些特性有助于表面催化剂减少焦炭沉积物的含量。
