1. Recent advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications focus on developing novel catalysts such as Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, and Ce-based catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts, especially when used with promoters like In, Sn, Ga, or Zn, are considered the most effective for the PDH process. These catalysts are often stabilized through various methods, including combining with graphene networks, growing on metal substrates, or loading onto oxide materials.

2. Researchers have extensively studied several factors affecting the performance of Pt-based catalysts. Nonetheless, the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts appears to be an understudied aspect. The PDH process's activity is sensitive to multiple factors.

3. High Pt dispersion, a high In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size contribute significantly to the stability and propylene selectivity of the catalyst. These characteristics also lead to a lower coke deposit content on the catalyst's surface.

4. After the reaction, the crystallinity of the catalyst can be influenced by the reduction atmosphere. The formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite helps re-disperse metal active sites and adjusts the catalyst's acid-base properties, thereby enhancing its stability and coke resistance.

1. 近期，工业应用中的催化剂设计、制造和性能优化主要集中在开发新型催化剂，如铝铜催化剂、钴/二氧化硅催化剂和铈基催化剂。然而，在PDH过程中，铂基催化剂，尤其是与铟、锡、镓或锌等促进剂结合使用时，被认为是最有效的。这些催化剂通常通过与石墨烯网络结合、在金属基质上生长或负载在氧化物材料（γ-氧化铝、氧化锌、二氧化锡）上来稳定。

2. 研究人员已经对影响Pt基催化剂性能的多个因素进行了大量研究。然而，Mg(Al)O支持的Pt基催化剂的还原气氛似乎是一个未充分研究的方面。PDH过程的活性对多种因素敏感。

3. 高Pt分散度、高In0/In3+摩尔比、强PtIn相互作用和小金属颗粒尺寸显著提高了催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。这些特性还导致催化剂表面的焦炭沉积量较低。

4. 反应后，催化剂的结晶性可能受到还原气氛的影响。高结晶度meixnerite的形成有助于重新分散金属活性位点，并调整催化剂的酸碱性质，从而提高其稳定性和焦炭抵抗力。

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing promoters, improving support stability, and optimizing the reduction atmosphere. Promoters like indium (In), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), or zinc (Zn) are incorporated to boost propylene selectivity. Supporting materials such as graphene networks, metals, alloys, or oxides like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, and SnO2 are used to stabilize the catalysts.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of high-efficiency propylene yield catalysts, especially those containing promoters like Indium (In), Tin (Sn), Gallium (Ga), or Zinc (Zn) with Platinum (Pt). Researchers have also focused on stabilizing hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts through various methods such as incorporating graphene networks, growing them on metal substrates like Aluminum (Al) or Nickel (Ni), or loading them onto oxide materials like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, or SnO2. Preparation conditions of Mg(Al)O supports, including Mg/Al molar ratio, pH value, and calcination temperature of the HT precursor, have also been studied. The study uses a ZnO-supported HT, which is prepared through a hydrothermal method. In and Pt elements are then introduced into the HT layer via sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction. The study reveals that the H2/N2 reduction atmosphere leads to a higher Pt dispersion (48%) compared to the C3H8/H2/N2 atmosphere (34%), suggesting better utilization of Pt in the former.

1. Recently, the dehydrogenation of low alkanes has attracted global interest due to their broad use in the polymer industry as raw materials and versatile intermediates. Platinum-based catalysts, often enhanced with promoters like Indium, Tin, Gallium, or Zinc, are considered the most effective for the PDH process, improving propylene selectivity.

2. The stability of the support material significantly influences the effectiveness of reactions. Researchers have attempted to stabilize hydrotalcite-based catalysts through various methods, such as incorporating graphene networks, growing on metal surfaces (like Aluminum or Nickel), or loading onto oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2).

3. The study of the reduction atmosphere's impact on the performance of Mg(Al)O-supported platinum-based catalysts is a critical area of research. This is because the current understanding of catalyst performance does not adequately consider the role of the reduction atmosphere.

4. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO catalyst, when reduced with H2/N2, demonstrated remarkable performance. It achieved a propane conversion rate of 51% and a propylene selectivity of 97%. After running for 30 hours, the conversion stabilized at 45% and the propylene selectivity at 92%.

5. These outcomes are primarily attributed to the high dispersion of platinum, the ratio of zero-valent Indium to trivalent Indium, a strong interaction between platinum and Indium, and the small size of metal particles. These features contribute to a low coke deposit content on the surface of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2.

2. 支持材料的稳定性对反应具有重要影响。研究人员尝试通过多种方法稳定基于水滑石的催化剂，如与石墨烯网络结合、在金属（铝、镍）或合金基板上生长，或负载在氧化物材料（γ-Al2O3、ZnO、SnO2）上。

3. 目前，对于Mg(Al)O支持的铂基催化剂的还原气氛对其性能的影响研究不足。这是因为当前催化剂性能的理解并未充分考虑还原气氛的作用。

4. PtIn/Mg(Al)O/ZnO催化剂，在用H2/N2还原后表现出卓越的性能。它实现了丙烷转化率为51%，丙烯选择性为97%。运行30小时后，转化率稳定在45%，丙烯选择性稳定在92%。

5. 这些结果主要归因于铂的高分散度，零价铟与三价铟的比例，铂与铟之间的强烈相互作用，以及金属颗粒的小尺寸。这些特性有助于表面催化剂减少焦炭沉积物的含量。
