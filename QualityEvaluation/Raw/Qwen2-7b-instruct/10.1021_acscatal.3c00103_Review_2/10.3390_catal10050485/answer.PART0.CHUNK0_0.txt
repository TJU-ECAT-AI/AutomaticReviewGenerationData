1. Recent advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications focus on developing novel catalysts such as Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, and Ce-based catalysts. However, Pt-based catalysts, especially when used with promoters like In, Sn, Ga, or Zn, are considered the most effective for the PDH process. These catalysts are often stabilized through various methods, including combining with graphene networks, growing on metal substrates, or loading onto oxide materials.

2. Researchers have extensively studied several factors affecting the performance of Pt-based catalysts. Nonetheless, the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts appears to be an understudied aspect. The PDH process's activity is sensitive to multiple factors.

3. High Pt dispersion, a high In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size contribute significantly to the stability and propylene selectivity of the catalyst. These characteristics also lead to a lower coke deposit content on the catalyst's surface.

4. After the reaction, the crystallinity of the catalyst can be influenced by the reduction atmosphere. The formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite helps re-disperse metal active sites and adjusts the catalyst's acid-base properties, thereby enhancing its stability and coke resistance.

1. 近期，工业应用中的催化剂设计、制造和性能优化主要集中在开发新型催化剂，如铝铜催化剂、钴/二氧化硅催化剂和铈基催化剂。然而，在PDH过程中，铂基催化剂，尤其是与铟、锡、镓或锌等促进剂结合使用时，被认为是最有效的。这些催化剂通常通过与石墨烯网络结合、在金属基质上生长或负载在氧化物材料（γ-氧化铝、氧化锌、二氧化锡）上来稳定。

2. 研究人员已经对影响Pt基催化剂性能的多个因素进行了大量研究。然而，Mg(Al)O支持的Pt基催化剂的还原气氛似乎是一个未充分研究的方面。PDH过程的活性对多种因素敏感。

3. 高Pt分散度、高In0/In3+摩尔比、强PtIn相互作用和小金属颗粒尺寸显著提高了催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。这些特性还导致催化剂表面的焦炭沉积量较低。

4. 反应后，催化剂的结晶性可能受到还原气氛的影响。高结晶度meixnerite的形成有助于重新分散金属活性位点，并调整催化剂的酸碱性质，从而提高其稳定性和焦炭抵抗力。
