[1] "Among various metal oxides (vanadium oxide [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] , zinc oxide [13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] , gallium oxide [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] , etc.) used in PDH, gallium oxide (GaOx) with low toxicity and low cost has been emerging as the promising candidate material in PDH process."
[2] "However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application."
[3] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products [6] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ."
[4] "Nevertheless, there is no report on the zeolite-encaged Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst applied for PDH with excellent catalytic activity and stability, not mention to the study of the electronic effect of Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst within zeolite for PDH reaction."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst through alloying with other metals, particularly platinum. This modification weakens the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreases the cracking of CC bonds, improving the catalytic performance. Another approach involves the encapsulation of metal catalysts within zeolites, which provides a stable environment for metal species, enhancing their stability during high-temperature reactions. This study specifically investigates the electronic effect of Ga-Pt bimetallic catalysts within zeolite for PDH reaction, aiming to achieve excellent catalytic activity and stability. The research also discusses the influence of acidity on the reaction and the confinement effect of zeolites, contributing to a better understanding of how these factors impact the catalytic performance of the Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst.

最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发的关键策略和方法包括通过与其他金属（尤其是铂）合金化来修改催化剂的电子结构。这种修改减弱了π键烯烃的吸附并减少了CC键的裂解，从而提高了催化剂的催化性能。另一种方法是将金属催化剂封装在沸石中，这为金属物种提供了一个稳定的环境，在高温反应中增强其稳定性。这项研究特别探讨了Ga-Pt双金属催化剂在沸石内的PDH反应中的电子效应，旨在实现卓越的催化活性和稳定性。研究还讨论了酸性对反应的影响以及沸石的限制效应，有助于更好地理解这些因素如何影响Ga-Pt双金属催化剂的催化性能。
