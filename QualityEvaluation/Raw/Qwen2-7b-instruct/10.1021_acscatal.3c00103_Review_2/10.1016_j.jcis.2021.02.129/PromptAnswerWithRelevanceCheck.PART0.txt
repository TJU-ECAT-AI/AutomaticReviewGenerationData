[1] "Propene is one of the most important feedstocks employed in the production of high valued chemical products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[2] "Growing attention has been focused on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the growing demand of propene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas."
[3] "However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application."
[4] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products."
[5] "Notably, the restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles."
[6] "The electronic effect in GaPt@S-1 catalyst hinders the adsorption of products on metal surfaces, and contributes to the migration of coke precursors from active sites to external channels, thus this catalyst achieves excellent PDH performance."

1. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the utilization of metal alloys, particularly Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters, encapsulated within zeolites. This approach addresses challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving stability, boosting product desorption, and facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites, thereby maintaining high activity and stability over multiple cycles.

2. The strategies involve the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts within silicalite-1 zeolites through a ligand-protected direct H2-reduction method. The resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst exhibits high propene selectivity and formation rate, with a low deactivation constant, indicating improved catalytic performance and stability compared to conventional Ga-based catalysts.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst through alloying with other metals, particularly platinum. This modification weakens the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreases the cracking of CC bonds, improving the catalytic performance. Another approach involves the encapsulation of metal catalysts within zeolites, which provides a stable environment for metal species, enhancing their stability during high-temperature reactions. This study specifically investigates the electronic effect of Ga-Pt bimetallic catalysts within zeolite for PDH reaction, aiming to achieve excellent catalytic activity and stability. The research also discusses the influence of acidity on the reaction and the confinement effect of zeolites, contributing to a better understanding of how these factors impact the catalytic performance of the Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst.
