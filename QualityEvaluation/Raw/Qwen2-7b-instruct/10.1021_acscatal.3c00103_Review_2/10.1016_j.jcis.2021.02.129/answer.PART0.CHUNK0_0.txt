[1] "Propene is one of the most important feedstocks employed in the production of high valued chemical products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile."
[2] "Growing attention has been focused on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the growing demand of propene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas."
[3] "However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application."
[4] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products."
[5] "Notably, the restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles."
[6] "The electronic effect in GaPt@S-1 catalyst hinders the adsorption of products on metal surfaces, and contributes to the migration of coke precursors from active sites to external channels, thus this catalyst achieves excellent PDH performance."

1. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the utilization of metal alloys, particularly Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters, encapsulated within zeolites. This approach addresses challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving stability, boosting product desorption, and facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites, thereby maintaining high activity and stability over multiple cycles.

2. The strategies involve the synthesis of ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts within silicalite-1 zeolites through a ligand-protected direct H2-reduction method. The resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst exhibits high propene selectivity and formation rate, with a low deactivation constant, indicating improved catalytic performance and stability compared to conventional Ga-based catalysts.

1. 近期，提高直接脱氢过程中支撑金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括使用Ga-Pt双金属簇封装在沸石中的方法。这种方法通过改进稳定性、增强产物脱附和促进活性位点附近的焦炭前体迁移来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。

2. 通过在硅酸盐-1沸石中合成超细Ga-Pt纳米催化剂，并采用配体保护的直接H2还原法进行制备。得到的GaPt@S-1催化剂表现出高丙烯选择性和形成速率，以及较低的失活常数，这表明与传统的Ga基催化剂相比，该催化剂具有优异的催化性能和稳定性。
