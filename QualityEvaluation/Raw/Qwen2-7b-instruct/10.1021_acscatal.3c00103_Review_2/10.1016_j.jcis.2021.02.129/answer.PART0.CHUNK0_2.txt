[1] "Among various metal oxides (vanadium oxide [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] , zinc oxide [13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] , gallium oxide [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] , etc.) used in PDH, gallium oxide (GaOx) with low toxicity and low cost has been emerging as the promising candidate material in PDH process."
[2] "However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application."
[3] "The preparation of Ga-based catalysts with superior catalytic performance is very important from both industrial and academic points of view."
[4] "Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds [26] ."
[5] "Most significantly, introducing trace platinum into the non-expensive metal can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst by alloying, thus weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreasing the cracking of CC bonds."
[6] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products [6] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ."
[7] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species."
[8] "In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis [32] ,[33] ,[34] ."
[9] "Recently, Pt and PtM catalysts (M = Zn, Sn) have been encapsulated into zeolites, and the reports have shown that the zeolite-encapsulated supported catalysts with excellent stability are valuable in practical applications [26] ,[34] ,[35] ,[36] ,[37] ."
[10] "Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of gallium oxide (GaOx) as a low-toxicity, low-cost material, and the introduction of trace amounts of platinum to modify the electronic structure of the catalyst through alloying. This modification weakens the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreases the cracking of CC bonds. Zeolites, with their well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability, are utilized as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species. Encapsulating metals such as platinum and gallium within zeolites results in catalysts with unique and remarkable catalytic stability. The electronic effect of the alloy, influenced by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, decreases the metal-adsorbate bond energy, facilitating the desorption of products. The confinement effect of zeolites plays a significant role in enhancing the regeneration stability of the catalyst, allowing the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after multiple cycles.

最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发的关键策略和方法包括使用低毒性、低成本的镓氧化物（GaOx）作为材料，并通过合金化引入少量铂来修改催化剂的电子结构。这种修改削弱了π键烯烃的吸附并减少了CC键的断裂。具有清晰微孔通道结构和优异热稳定性的沸石被用作稳定金属物种的理想载体。将铂和镓等金属封装在沸石中，导致具有独特且显著催化稳定性的催化剂。合金的电子效应，受金属表面价电子能量变化的影响，降低了金属-吸附剂键能，促进了产品的释放。沸石的限制效应在提高催化剂的再生稳定性方面起着重要作用，使催化剂活性在多次循环后保持不变。
