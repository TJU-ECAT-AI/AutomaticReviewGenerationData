[1] "Growing attention has been focused on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the growing demand of propene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas."
[2] "In recent years, Pt-Sn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industrial PDH processes, but the former is expensive and the latter is toxic."
[3] "Moreover, both of them are easily deactivated and require frequent regeneration."
[4] "Among various metal oxides (vanadium oxide [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] , zinc oxide [13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] , gallium oxide [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] , etc.) used in PDH, gallium oxide (GaOx) with low toxicity and low cost has been emerging as the promising candidate material in PDH process."
[5] "However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application."
[6] "The preparation of Ga-based catalysts with superior catalytic performance is very important from both industrial and academic points of view."
[7] "Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds [26] ."
[8] "Most significantly, introducing trace platinum into the non-expensive metal can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst by alloying, thus weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreasing the cracking of CC bonds."
[9] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products [6] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ."
[10] "However, the surface Pt species of this catalyst usually suffer from poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions."
[11] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species."
[12] "In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis [32] ,[33] ,[34] ."
[13] "Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

1. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on developing gallium oxide (GaOx) as a promising material due to its low toxicity and cost-effectiveness. This addresses the challenges of high cost and toxicity in traditional catalysts like platinum-tungsten (Pt-Sn) and chromium oxide (CrOx).

2. To optimize performance, trace amounts of platinum are introduced into cheaper metals through alloying. This modifies the electronic structure of the catalyst, weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and reducing CC bond cleavage. The electronic effects are influenced by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, decreasing the metal-adsorbate bond energy and facilitating product desorption.

3. Challenges in catalyst design and fabrication include the poor recyclability and stability of surface platinum species at high temperatures. Addressing these issues involves the use of zeolites, which have well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability. Zeolites serve as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species and are particularly useful in creating catalysts with remarkable stability in heterogeneous catalysis.

4. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic performance and high stability during propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Its active sites for PDH were confirmed through various analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UVvis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and turnover rate (TOR) calculations. The electronic effect of the GaPt alloy was thoroughly investigated, along with its impact on product desorption. Additionally, the role of acidity and the confinement effect of zeolites in the catalytic process were studied and discussed.
