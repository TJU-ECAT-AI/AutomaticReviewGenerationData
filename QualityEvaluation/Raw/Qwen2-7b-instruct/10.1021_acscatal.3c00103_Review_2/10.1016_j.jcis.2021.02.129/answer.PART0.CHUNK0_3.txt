[1] "Growing attention has been focused on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the growing demand of propene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas."
[2] "However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application."
[3] "In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products."
[4] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species."
[5] "The resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

1. The key strategies recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve modifying the electronic structure of the catalyst through alloying, which weakens the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreases the cleavage of CC bonds. This is achieved by introducing trace amounts of platinum into less expensive metals, altering the valence electron energy of the metal surface, and enhancing the desorption of products. Additionally, using zeolites as supports provides a framework for stabilizing metal species, offering unique and remarkable catalytic stability in heterogeneous catalysis.

2. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic performance and high stability during propane dehydrogenation. Its active sites are confirmed through XRD, DR UVvis, XPS, and turnover rate calculations. The electronic effect of the Ga-Pt bimetallic alloy enhances the desorption of products by hindering product adsorption and facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites to external channels, achieving excellent PDH performance.

1. 近期开发的增强直接脱氢过程中负载型金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括通过合金化修改催化剂的电子结构，这减弱了π键烯烃的吸附并减少了CC键的断裂，从而降低催化性能和限制实际应用。通过在较便宜的金属中引入微量铂，改变金属表面的价电子能量，并提高产物的脱附，实现了这一目标。此外，使用沸石作为支持物提供了一种稳定金属物种的框架，在异相催化中具有独特的显著稳定性。

2. GaPt@S-1催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出卓越的催化性能和高稳定性。其活性位点通过XRD、DR UVvis、XPS和周转率计算得到验证。Ga-Pt二元合金的电子效应通过阻碍产品吸附和促进焦炭前体从活性位点迁移到外部通道来增强产品的脱附，实现了出色的PDH性能。
