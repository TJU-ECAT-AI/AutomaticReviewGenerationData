        Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve doping additional promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn to Pt. These additives increase electron density, weaken product alkenes' adsorption, and reduce coke deposition. Incorporating Sn into the Si-beta framework facilitates the formation of Pt/Sn ultra-small nanoclusters, stabilized by strong Pt-Sn interactions and confined Sn effect. This mechanism enhances propene selectivity and catalytic stability, making Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts robust for industrial applications. Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance catalytic stability involve modifying the geometric and electronic properties of intermetallic compounds, utilizing alloying techniques to dilute potentially reactive Pt ensembles with less active metals, and developing innovative catalyst designs to inhibit undesired side reactions. These strategies address key challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, focusing on improving stability and efficiency in dehydrogenation processes. Recent advancements also focus on using advanced materials like Al-Cu, Co/SiO2, Ce-based, and Pt-based catalysts with promoters, stabilization techniques for HT-based catalysts involving graphene networks, growth on metal or alloy substrates, and loading onto oxides. The activity of the PDH process is sensitive to factors like reduction atmospheres, especially for Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts. High Pt dispersion, an optimal In0/In3+ ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small particle size reduce coke formation. The formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite can improve stability and coke resistance by re-dispersing metal sites and adjusting the catalyst's acid-base properties. Recent studies have also focused on developing strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, targeting optimization of metal dispersion, site isolation, and incorporating ligands or other modifiers onto the metal surface to further enhance stability and selectivity. These advancements in catalyst design and fabrication have led to significant improvements in the efficiency and longevity of industrial dehydrogenation processes. Challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications include minimizing platinum usage while improving catalytic stability, understanding the geometric and electronic effects on catalytic properties, and optimizing catalyst design and fabrication processes. Novel materials and confinement techniques, such as subsurface-regulated PtGa nanoparticles within silicalite-1, have been introduced as innovative approaches for propane dehydrogenation, addressing fabrication challenges and optimizing performance for industrial applications. Recent strategies also focus on adjusting subsurface atoms in 2 nm Pt3Mn nanoparticles to significantly impact catalyst activity and selectivity, suggesting that precise control over subsurface composition could lead to the development of more stable and efficient catalysts. Recent studies have highlighted the role of Sn segregation in Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and the importance of understanding catalyst deactivation mechanisms and stability factors. Advanced synthesis strategies, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and seeded molecular crystal growth (SOMC), have been employed to finely control the structure of active sites, optimizing the catalyst's thermal and chemical stability. Incorporating metal hetero-ions into zeolite frameworks can produce acid sites with multifunctionality, not just serving as active sites for CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking process. Strategies to address catalyst stability issues include fine-tuning electronic properties, utilizing isolation effects to prevent strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating possible coking sites on the selected support. Co-feeding gases such as hydrogen, steam, and soft oxidant CO2 can reduce coke species formation, although hydrogen's effectiveness might vary in certain cases. To maintain dynamic structural stability of active sites during reaction and regeneration, a moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports is crucial, necessitating the development of an efficient pretreatment procedure. Unraveling the origins of synergy effects between ZrO2 and CrOx in supported CrZrOx catalysts for propene formation in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has significantly enhanced the efficiency and stability of the catalytic process. Promoting propane dehydrogenation with CO2 over PtFe bimetallic catalysts by eliminating the non-selective Fe(0) phase has led to a highly active and stable catalyst, demonstrating the effectiveness of these approaches in addressing industrial challenges. The synthesis of novel catalysts, such as those consisting of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina, with a synergy between Ga and Pt, results in a highly active and stable catalyst. This bifunctional active phase, featuring coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species as the dehydrogenation active site and Pt as a promoter, ensures prolonged activity. The presence of Pt increases the concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, facilitating hydrogen atom recombination and making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle. The Pt3GaK catalyst displays superior activity, highlighting its exceptional catalytic performance. Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limits have been developed using silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles. These catalysts can operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene, exceeding 99%. The benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support prevents Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase, avoiding the issues encountered with traditional catalyst supports. The catalyst also does not build up carbon and can run up to 30 hours without deactivation, demonstrating its high productivity and stability. The synthesis process begins with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, preserving atomic mixing of Pt and Sn during reduction and PDH reaction. Under reaction conditions, the thermodynamic limit on propane conversion is achieved, with the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst showing near-thermodynamic conversion and >99% selectivity to propylene. The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid and tin(II) chloride in hydrochloric acid solution forms a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex, characterized by additional UV-Vis absorption peaks at specific wavelengths, indicating the formation of NPs that are essentially alloys of Pt and Sn. The XRD spectra confirm the formation of NPs as Pt1Sn1 and Pt3Sn1 alloys, supporting the presence of XRD peaks corresponding to these stoichiometries. The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts exhibit very high productivity and stability compared to other catalysts, highlighting the importance of precise control over alloy composition and precursor mixing in achieving superior catalytic activity. The recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve developing innovative catalyst compositions, improving support materials, and refining synthesis methodologies. These strategies aim to address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by increasing the catalyst's resistance to deactivation, improving selectivity, and extending operational lifetime. The quotes highlight the importance of these developments in catalysis research, emphasizing the role of advanced materials, novel synthesis techniques, and strategic modifications in enhancing the stability and efficiency of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes.
