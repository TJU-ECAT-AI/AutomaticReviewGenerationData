        Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve developing advanced materials for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Key focus is on synthesizing highly active, selective, and durable catalysts that address the challenge of reaction-induced loss of active sites by incorporating Silicalite-1 as a support material. This leads to improved thermal and chemical stability, enhancing the ZnOx/Silicalite-1 catalysts' activity and durability. Support material selection is crucial for designing efficient, long-lasting catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes, as highlighted in recent studies.

        The specific activity for hydrogenation of cyclopropane at 0°C on platinum catalysts was found to be independent of platinum content on two different forms of alumina, independent of the nature of the support with alumina or silica gel, and almost the same for highly dispersed samples in which nearly every platinum atom is a surface atom as for a platinum foil. In contradistinction, a very marked susceptibility to oxygen poisoning was found for the well-dispersed catalysts that was not observed for the other samples.

        Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on optimizing metal dispersion, maximizing surface atoms for increased specific activity at low temperatures. However, this approach introduces a susceptibility to oxygen poisoning, challenging catalyst design and performance optimization for industrial use.

        Unraveling the Origins of the Synergy Effect between ZrO2 and CrOx in Supported CrZrOx for Propene Formation in Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation. The synergy effect between ZrO2 and CrOx in supported CrZrOx catalysts significantly enhances the propene formation efficiency in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (NODP) processes. Recent advancements in the design, fabrication, and performance optimization of supported metal catalysts have focused on understanding and exploiting synergistic interactions among multiple active components to improve catalytic stability.

        Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit. Direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina often must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%).

        The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve modifying the geometric and electronic properties of intermetallic compounds. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve strategic modifications that address key challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.

        The catalyst consists of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina. We observed a synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst. A bifunctional active phase is proposed, in which coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species are the active species and Pt functions as a promoter. The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times.

        Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition. Recent advancements in catalysis research have focused on developing novel materials and strategies to enhance the stability and efficiency of supported metal catalysts.

        Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y.

        The process of mixing chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution formed a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of H2PtCl6 is characterized by a prominent absorption peak at 260 nm; SnCl2 exhibits no absorption in the visible range. The combined precursor solution shows several additional UV-Vis absorption peaks at 279, 363, 420, and 488 nm that are characteristic of a heterometallic Pt-Sn complex (55), indicating the mixing of Sn and Pt atoms before reduction and growth of NPs on the support.

        The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of novel support materials, modification of metal surface properties, and the incorporation of additives to improve stability. Advancements also involve the development of more efficient dehydrogenation pathways and the optimization of reaction conditions.

        The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework. The recent advancements focus on exploiting synergistic interactions among multiple active components in supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes. By examining the structural and electronic properties, including the role of support materials, metal particle morphology, and the interactions between different metal species, researchers aim to enhance catalytic stability.

        近年来，通过发展非氧化性丙烷脱氢过程中的高级材料来增强支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性。重点是合成高度活性、选择性和耐用的催化剂，以解决反应诱导活性位点损失的问题，并通过引入硅酸盐-1作为支撑材料来实现这一目标。这提高了热稳定性和化学稳定性，从而增强了ZnOx/硅酸盐-1催化剂的活性和耐久性。支撑材料的选择对于设计高效、持久的直接脱氢过程催化剂至关重要，这是由最近的研究强调的。

        在0°C下，对环丙烷进行氢化时，每克铂催化剂的特定活性不受两种不同形式的氧化铝上的铂含量的影响，也不受以氧化铝或二氧化硅胶为支撑体的性质的影响，并且几乎与几乎每个铂原子都是表面原子的高分散样品相同，作为铂的纯度。相比之下，高度分散的催化剂具有对氧气中毒的显著敏感性，这种敏感性在其他样品中未被观察到。

        近期策略旨在通过优化金属的几何和电子性质来增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性。最近在增强支持金属催化剂直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性方面的发展涉及针对催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的关键挑战的策略改进，以满足工业应用的需求。

        该催化剂由1000ppm Pt、3wt% Ga和0.25wt% K支持在氧化铝上组成。我们观察到Ga和Pt之间的协同作用，导致活性和稳定性极高的催化剂。提出了一种双功能活性相，在其中协调不饱和的Ga3+物种是活性物种，而Pt充当促进剂。该催化剂对结焦具有高度抵抗力，并能在长时间反应后保持活性。

        已经建议通过向Pt中掺杂Sn、In、Ga、Mn、Cu和Zn等额外的促进剂来减少焦炭的形成，这些促进剂可以有效地增加Pt原子的电子密度并减弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少焦炭沉积。近年来，催化研究的重点集中在开发新型材料和策略以增强支持金属催化剂的稳定性和效率上。

        我们一直在寻找一个高度活性且更耐用的PDH催化剂，其焦点在于使用具有微/介孔结构的硅基MFI沸石替代氧化铝支持。尽管我们预期添加稀土元素（REE）可能通过强金属-支撑相互作用效应提高Pt/沸石催化剂的初始PDH活性，但出乎意料的是，通过添加镧（La）和钇（Y），催化寿命增加了十倍以上。

        表面六边形Pt1Sn1互金属在Pt纳米颗粒上的应用为选择性丙烷脱氢提供了一个催化剂。近来在增强支持金属催化剂的直接脱氢过程中的发展集中在新型材料和策略上，以提高稳定性和效率。

        混合氯化铂（H2PtCl6）和二价锡（SnCl2）在0.1 M盐酸溶液中形成的混合物形成了一个异质金属Pt-Sn配合物。H2PtCl6的紫外-可见吸收光谱在260nm处具有明显的吸收峰；SnCl2在可见范围内没有吸收。结合前体溶液显示出多个额外的紫外-可见吸收峰在279、363、420和488nm，这些是异质金属Pt-Sn复合物的特征，表明在还原和生长NPs之前混合了Sn和Pt原子。

        近期发展了通过利用多个活性组分之间的协同相互作用来增强支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的方法。通过研究结构和电子属性，包括支撑材料的作用、金属粒子形态以及不同金属物种之间的相互作用，研究人员旨在提高催化稳定性。

        高丙烯选择性和催化稳定性的影响可由Si-β框架内Pt和Sn的强相互作用来解释。近期发展集中在利用Si-β框架内的Pt和Sn的强相互作用和单原子物种的高化学势来改善支持金属催化剂的直接脱氢过程。
