Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve developing advanced materials for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Key focus is on synthesizing highly active, selective, and durable catalysts that address the challenge of reaction-induced loss of active sites by incorporating Silicalite-1 as a support material. This leads to improved thermal and chemical stability, enhancing the ZnOx/Silicalite-1 catalysts' activity and durability. Support material selection is crucial for designing efficient, long-lasting catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes, as highlighted in recent studies.

These approaches directly address fabrication challenges and optimize performance, as required by the question.

        Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on optimizing metal dispersion, maximizing surface atoms for increased specific activity at low temperatures. However, this approach introduces a susceptibility to oxygen poisoning, challenging catalyst design and performance optimization for industrial use.

        Stable and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation operating at thermodynamic limit involve direct dehydrogenation catalysts consisting of platinum-tin alloy nanoparticles supported on alumina. Often, these catalysts must run with hydrogen dilution to avoid carbon buildup and excess tin to avoid alloy segregation. Silica-supported platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles (<2 nanometers in diameter) can operate as a PDH catalyst at thermodynamically limited conversion levels, with excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). Atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the precursor is preserved upon reduction and during catalytic operation, and the benign interaction of these nanoparticles with the silicon dioxide support does not lead to Pt-Sn segregation and formation of a tin oxide phase that can occur over traditional catalyst supports.

        The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve modifying the geometric and electronic properties of intermetallic compounds. Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve strategic modifications that address key challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.

        The catalyst consists of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina. This material features a synergistic relationship between Ga and Pt, forming a bifunctional active phase where Ga acts as the dehydrogenation catalyst, while Pt promotes activity. The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times, with the presence of Pt increasing the concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species. Operando spectroscopy confirms the catalyst's complex structure, indicating a synergistic and bifunctional nature.

        A series of PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by a sequential impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized employing N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffrtaction, temperature programmed reduction, O2 volumetric chemisorption, H2-O2 titration, and transmission electron microscopy. The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability. According to XRD results, Ga3+ cations are incorporated into the host lattice structure of CeO2. Simultaneously, the addition of Ga is prone to decorate Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys.

        The research focuses on the role of Sn segregation in Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind catalyst deactivation and the factors influencing their stability. Strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of novel synthesis methods, the use of advanced materials, and the optimization of operating conditions. Advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization aim to address challenges such as high deactivation rates and limited selectivity. These improvements can lead to increased efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced sustainability in industrial applications.

        Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition. It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C. The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework.

        Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support. Whereas we expected that addition of REEs might improve the initial PDH activity of the Pt/zeolite catalyst owing to the strong metalsupport interaction effect, to our surprise, the catalytic lifetime was increased more than tenfold with the addition of La and Y. The PtREE incorporation in the mesoporous zeolite was conducted by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and either La(NO3)3·6H2O or Y(NO3)3·6H2O, followed by heating under an O2 flow at 350C and subsequently under H2 at 700C (see Methods). However, the formation of Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles that exhibited long catalytic lifetime critically depended on the zeolite synthesis procedures, even when the obtained zeolites were all siliceous and had similar mesoporosity. From this unexpected observation, we speculated that the PtREE alloy formation could occur by incorporating the REEs in the form of single atomic species with high chemical potential. With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid (see Methods and Extended Data Figs. 2, 3). Each of the degallated sites corresponded to a generated silanol nest. In accordance with our hypothesis, the REEs incorporated in this zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as shown in a video taken by AR-HAADF-STEM (see Supplementary Video 1). The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability, as shown in Fig. 2.

        稳定且具有选择性的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢运行在热力学极限下，涉及由铂-锡合金纳米颗粒组成的直接脱氢催化剂支持在氧化铝上。通常，这些催化剂必须用氢稀释以避免碳积累和过量锡以避免合金分离。硅酸盐支持的铂-锡(Pt1Sn1)纳米颗粒(<2纳米直径)可以在热力学限制转换水平上作为PDH催化剂运行，具有出色的稳定性和丙烯选择性(>99%)。铂和锡在前体中的原子混合在还原和催化操作期间得到保留，这些纳米颗粒与硅氧烷支持的良好相互作用不会导致铂-锡分离和在传统催化剂支持上形成的锡氧化物相。

        该催化剂包含1000ppm Pt、3wt% Ga和0.25wt% K在氧化铝上。这种材料具有铂和镓之间的协同关系，形成了一个双功能活性相，其中镓作为脱氢催化剂，而铂则促进活性。催化剂对结焦具有极高的抵抗力，并保持了长时间的反应时间，铂的存在增加了表面四面体Ga3+物种的浓度。原位光谱证实了催化剂的复杂结构，表明了协同和双功能的性质。

        一系列PtGa/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂通过顺序浸渍法制备。制备的催化剂通过N2吸附-脱附、X射线衍射、温度程序还原、氧气体积化学吸附、H2-O2滴定和透射电子显微镜进行了表征。镓的添加提高了铂催化剂在PDH中的性能，包括提高了丙烯选择性和增强了催化稳定性。根据XRD结果，镓3+离子被整合到CeO2的主晶格结构中。同时，镓的添加倾向于通过形成PtGa合金来装饰铂纳米颗粒。此外，PtSn相互作用的强度和Si-beta框架中Sn的约束效应抑制了Pt簇的结焦和聚集，从而实现了在550°C下四次循环后的良好脱氢和再生稳定性，几乎保持了催化活性不变。

        我们在寻找一种高度活跃且更耐用的PDH催化剂的过程中，将一种具有微/介孔结构的硅酸盐MFI沸石作为替代氧化铝支持物进行研究。尽管我们预期添加REEs会由于强金属-支撑相互作用效应而提高Pt/沸石催化剂的初始PDH活性，但出乎意料的是，添加镧和钇后，催化寿命提高了十倍以上。在方法中描述了PtREE的掺杂过程，通过向水中加入Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2溶液和La(NO3)3·6H2O或Y(NO3)3·6H2O溶液，然后在氧气流下加热至350°C，随后在700°C下加热H2。然而，Pt3La和Pt3Y互金属纳米颗粒的形成依赖于沸石合成程序，即使获得的所有沸石都是硅酸盐且具有相似的介孔性也是如此。从这个意外的观察中，我们推测，通过将REEs以高化学潜能的单原子形式整合进来，PtREE合金的形成可能发生。根据这些假设，我们故意通过合成具有介孔镓硅酸盐沸石并随后使用硝酸去除框架Ga原子来生成硅醇巢（见方法和扩展数据图2、3）。每个去镓化站点对应一个生成的硅醇巢。与我们的假设一致，这种沸石中整合的REE确实以原子分散的形式存在，在AR-HAADF-STEM视频中可以看到（见补充视频1）。在去镓化的沸石上形成的Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米颗粒带来了PDH催化性能的所有方面，包括活性、选择性和耐用性，显著提升，如图2所示。
