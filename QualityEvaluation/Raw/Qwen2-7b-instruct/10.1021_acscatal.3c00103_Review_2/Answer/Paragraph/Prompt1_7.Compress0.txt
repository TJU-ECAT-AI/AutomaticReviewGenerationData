This zeolite facilitates enhanced reactivity and stability due to its unique structure, which promotes both efficient reactant and product diffusion and high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) alongside platinum (Pt) into the zeolite structure was found to significantly increase the catalytic lifetime of the Pt/zeolite catalysts. Contrary to initial expectations, the addition of lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) resulted in a more than tenfold increase in catalytic lifetime. The PtREE alloy was formed by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and REE nitrate salts, followed by thermal treatment under oxygen and hydrogen flows. The successful formation of long-lasting Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles was contingent on the synthesis procedure of the zeolite, despite the fact that all obtained zeolites were siliceous and had similar mesoporosity.

Additionally, the co-feeding of gases such as hydrogen, steam, and soft oxidant CO2 can mitigate coke formation, though hydrogen's effectiveness as a coke inhibitor may vary under certain conditions.

Incorporating metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework can produce acid sites with full functionality, beyond just serving as active sites for CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking process. To address stability concerns, strategies include fine-tuning the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides through promoters or supports, employing isolation effects to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating possible active sites responsible for coking on the selected support. Additionally, the co-feeding of gases such as hydrogen, steam, and soft oxidant CO2 can mitigate coke formation, though hydrogen's effectiveness as a coke inhibitor may vary under certain conditions. Maintaining the dynamic structural stability of active sites during reaction and regeneration requires a balanced interaction among metals, promoters, and supports, necessitating the development of an efficient pretreatment procedure.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS01260B"},
