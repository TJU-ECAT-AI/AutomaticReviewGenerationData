          "[1] At present, Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, Ce-based catalysts, etc., are mainly novel catalysts developed by researchers."
          "[2] However, Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity."
          "[3] Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates, and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)."
          "[4] Most of the factors have been studied in detail. However, this does not seem to be the case for the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts."
          "[5] The activity of PDH is susceptible to many factors."
          "[6] This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."
          "[7] In addition, meixnerite can be formed after the reaction, and the crystallinity is influenced by the reduction atmosphere."
          "[8] The formation of the high-crystallinity meixnerite can re-disperse the metal active sites and adjust the acid-base properties of the catalyst, thus improving the stability and coke resistance to some extent."

          Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing advanced materials such as Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, Ce-based catalysts, and Pt-based catalysts with promoters like In, Sn, Ga, or Zn to improve propylene selectivity. Researchers have also focused on stabilizing hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts through various methods, including incorporating graphene networks, growing them on metal or alloy substrates, and loading onto oxide materials. The activity of the PDH process is sensitive to numerous factors, particularly the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts. High Pt dispersion, a high In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size contribute to a lower coke deposit content on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst. Additionally, the formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite after the reaction can re-disperse metal active sites and adjust the catalyst's acid-base properties, leading to improved stability and coke resistance.

          最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，开发的关键策略和方法包括利用先进材料，如Al-Cu催化剂、Co/SiO2催化剂、Ce基催化剂以及添加In、Sn、Ga或Zn等促进剂的Pt基催化剂，以提高丙烯选择性。研究人员还专注于通过多种方法稳定基于水滑石（HT）的催化剂，如引入石墨烯网络、在金属或合金基材上生长，或负载在氧化物材料上。PDH过程的活性对许多因素敏感，特别是Mg(Al)O支持的Pt基催化剂的还原气氛。高Pt分散度、高In0/In3+摩尔比、强PtIn相互作用和小金属颗粒尺寸有助于降低H2/N2还原催化剂表面的焦炭沉积量。此外，反应后形成的高结晶度meixnerite可以重新分散金属活性位点并调整催化剂的酸碱性质，从而在一定程度上提高稳定性并增强抗焦炭能力。

          "[1] The preparation and structure studies of catalysts with high efficiency propylene yield become the key point of PDH."

          "[3] Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates, and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)."
          "[4] On this basis, ZnO-supported HT was prepared by the hydrothermal method, then In and Pt elements were introduced into the HT layer by sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction."
          "[5] The 48% dispersion of H2/N2 reduced sample is obviously higher than the 34% dispersion of the C3H8/H2/N2-reduced one. This indicates that the H2/N2-reduced catalyst had a higher utilization of Pt."

          The focus on catalyst preparation and structure studies aiming for high efficiency in propylene yield is crucial for the PDH process. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly when combined with promoters like Indium (In), Tin (Sn), Gallium (Ga), or Zinc (Zn), are still considered the most effective for the PDH process, enhancing propylene selectivity. Efforts to stabilize hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts involve integrating graphene networks, growing them on metal substrates (such as Aluminum or Nickel), or loading onto oxide materials. Building on this foundation, ZnO-supported HT was synthesized through a hydrothermal process. Subsequently, In and Pt elements were introduced into the HT layer via sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction. The 48% dispersion of the H2/N2-reduced sample is notably greater than the 34% dispersion of the C3H8/H2/N2-reduced sample, indicating that the H2/N2-reduced catalyst utilizes Pt more effectively.

          对于高丙烯产率催化剂的制备和结构研究的重点对于PDH过程至关重要。铂基催化剂，特别是与铟（In）、锡（Sn）、镓（Ga）或锌（Zn）等促进剂结合使用时，仍被视为PDH过程中最有效的催化剂，能够提高丙烯选择性。为了稳定基于水滑石（HT）的催化剂，采用的方法包括集成石墨烯网络、在金属基材（如铝或镍）上生长，或负载在氧化物材料上。在此基础上，通过水热法合成了ZnO支持的HT。随后，通过顺序浸渍诱导重建将In和Pt元素引入HT层。H2/N2还原样品的48%分散度明显高于C3H8/H2/N2还原样品的34%分散度，这表明H2/N2还原催化剂更有效地利用了Pt。
