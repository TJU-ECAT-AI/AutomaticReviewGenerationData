The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the development of intermetallic compounds, the tuning of particle size and shape, and the incorporation of support materials that can stabilize the active phase. These strategies address challenges in catalyst design by providing more stable structures, enhancing surface area and reactivity, and facilitating better control over the reaction conditions. Fabrication techniques such as sol-gel, spray-drying, and electrochemical methods have been employed to achieve precise control over the morphology and composition of the catalysts. Performance optimization involves the selection of appropriate operating conditions, including temperature, pressure, and feedstock ratios, to maximize yield and minimize side reactions.

The recent progress in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications relies on advanced synthesis methodologies such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and seeded molecular crystal growth (SOMC) to precisely control the structure of active sites. These strategies seek to localize metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or zeolite framework to promote the creation of novel active sites involved in a synergistic reaction pathway or an unwanted route. By integrating metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework, it is possible to generate functional acid sites beyond their conventional roles in CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking processes. To tackle stability concerns, strategies encompass fine-tuning the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides through promoters or supports, employing isolation effects to deter the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating potential active sites responsible for coking on the chosen support. Moreover, the concurrent supply of gases like hydrogen, steam, and mild oxidant CO2 can minimize the formation of coke species, albeit with hydrogen's effectiveness as a coke inhibitor potentially diminishing in specific circumstances. Ensuring the dynamic structural integrity of active sites throughout the reaction and regeneration cycles requires a balanced interaction among metals, promoters, and supports, which demands the implementation of an efficient pretreatment protocol.

Recent developments in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the utilization of noble metals like palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) known for their high reactivity and stability under harsh conditions, the creation of catalysts with customized morphology and surface chemistry to improve their interaction with reactants and products, and the exploration of alloy catalysts and mixed-metal systems to synergistically boost the catalytic properties of individual components. Innovations in catalyst preparation techniques, such as sol-gel methods, impregnation, and nanotechnology-based synthesis, further contribute to achieving superior catalytic stability and efficiency.

Recent developments in the field of supported metal catalysts have concentrated on improving their stability and activity in direct dehydrogenation processes. A key strategy involves modifying the support material to enhance electron transfer and coordination properties around the metal center. Another approach employs alloying or doping techniques to create a more stable active site. Structural engineering of the catalyst, using mesoporous supports for instance, has also proven effective in boosting both stability and selectivity. These strategies collectively seek to overcome the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, by enhancing durability, reducing sintering, and accelerating reaction kinetics.
