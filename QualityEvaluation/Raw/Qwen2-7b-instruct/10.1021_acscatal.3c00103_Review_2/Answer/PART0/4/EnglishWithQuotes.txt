These strategies seek to localize metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or zeolite framework to promote the creation of novel active sites involved in a synergistic reaction pathway or an unwanted route. By integrating metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework, it is possible to generate functional acid sites beyond their conventional roles in CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking processes. To tackle stability concerns, strategies encompass fine-tuning the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides through promoters or supports, employing isolation effects to deter the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating potential active sites responsible for coking on the chosen support. Moreover, the concurrent supply of gases like hydrogen, steam, and mild oxidant CO2 can minimize the formation of coke species, albeit with hydrogen's effectiveness as a coke inhibitor potentially diminishing in specific circumstances. Ensuring the dynamic structural integrity of active sites throughout the reaction and regeneration cycles requires a balanced interaction among metals, promoters, and supports, which demands the implementation of an efficient pretreatment protocol.", "Doi": "10.1039/D0CS01260B"},
