          The key strategies and approaches to enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve advanced synthesis methods, surface engineering techniques, and site isolation. Careful control of synthesis conditions allows for the customization of supported nanoparticles' morphology, size, and composition to optimize their catalytic properties. Site isolation, which confines metal atoms within the support material, prevents sintering and maintains high activity over multiple reaction cycles. Incorporating ligands or other modifiers onto the metal surface enhances catalyst stability and selectivity. These advancements have significantly improved the efficiency and longevity of industrial dehydrogenation processes.
