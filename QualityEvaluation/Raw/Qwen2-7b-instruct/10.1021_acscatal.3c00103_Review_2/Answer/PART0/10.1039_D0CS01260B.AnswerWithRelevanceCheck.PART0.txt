          The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the utilization of advanced synthesis techniques such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and seeded molecular crystal growth (SOMC) to precisely control the structure of active sites. These strategies aim to localize metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or zeolite framework to induce the formation of new active sites involved in a synergistic reaction mechanism or an unintended pathway. Incorporating metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework can produce acid sites with full functionality, beyond just serving as active sites for CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking process. To address stability concerns, strategies include fine-tuning the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides through promoters or supports, employing isolation effects to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating possible active sites responsible for coking on the selected support. Additionally, the co-feeding of gases such as hydrogen, steam, and soft oxidant CO2 can mitigate coke formation, though hydrogen's effectiveness as a coke inhibitor may vary under certain conditions. Maintaining the dynamic structural stability of active sites during reaction and regeneration requires a balanced interaction among metals, promoters, and supports, necessitating the development of an efficient pretreatment procedure.

          [1] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated. Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively."
          [2] "In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades."
          [3] "For the PDH reaction at 550 C, the catalyst displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C, while >98% selectivity and 1.46 s1 rate can be achieved at 600 C. The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by the 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), providing a strong interaction with the metal sites for great anti-sintering stability in the long-term reaction."
          [4] "Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size. More than 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction is achieved on this promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst due to favorable diffusion in short paths."

          The challenges in the direct dehydrogenation processes for ethane and propane include the difficulty in activating the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the selectivity control of CH cleavage versus CC cleavage, and the issues of olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anticoke ability. These challenges are common in both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. For the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies, the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts, have been developed in the last few decades. At 550°C, the catalyst shows over 99% propylene selectivity and a specific rate of 0.96 s−1 in the PDH reaction, while at 600°C, over 98% selectivity and a rate of 1.46 s−1 can be achieved. The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), indicating a strong interaction with metal sites for excellent anti-sintering stability in long-term reactions. Considering that these zeolites have micro-pores and cavities at different sizes, a fundamental challenge is to accurately and selectively locate metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another challenge is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reducing atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals leads to the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm in size. A promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst achieves over 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction due to favorable diffusion in short paths.

          The high chemical stability of the CH bonds in ethane and propane necessitates high temperatures for direct dehydrogenation reactions to achieve satisfactory olefin yields. However, for these direct hydrodealkylation (DH) catalysts, multiple issues may still impact their catalytic performance, including selective activation of CH bonds over CC bonds, olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anti-coking ability. To sustain a viable operational lifetime, the routine removal of coke from used catalysts through frequent regeneration processes is necessary, which is often impractical for industrial-scale operations. Hence, significant efforts have been dedicated to the development of Pt-catalyzed PDH processes, focusing on enhancing catalyst efficiency and stability by leveraging insights into the interplay between structure and performance, as well as the catalytic mechanisms.

          The recent progress in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications relies on advanced synthesis methodologies such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) and seeded molecular crystal growth (SOMC) to precisely control the structure of active sites. These strategies seek to localize metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or zeolite framework to promote the creation of novel active sites involved in a synergistic reaction pathway or an unwanted route. By integrating metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework, it is possible to generate functional acid sites beyond their conventional roles in CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking processes. To tackle stability concerns, strategies encompass fine-tuning the electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides through promoters or supports, employing isolation effects to deter the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and eliminating potential active sites responsible for coking on the chosen support. Moreover, the concurrent supply of gases like hydrogen, steam, and mild oxidant CO2 can minimize the formation of coke species, albeit with hydrogen's effectiveness as a coke inhibitor potentially diminishing in specific circumstances. Ensuring the dynamic structural integrity of active sites throughout the reaction and regeneration cycles requires a balanced interaction among metals, promoters, and supports, which demands the implementation of an efficient pretreatment protocol.
