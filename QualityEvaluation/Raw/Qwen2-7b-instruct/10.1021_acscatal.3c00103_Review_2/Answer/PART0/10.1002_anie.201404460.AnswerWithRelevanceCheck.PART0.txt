          This document discusses the development of a novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene. The catalyst is composed of 1000ppm platinum (Pt), 3wt% gallium (Ga), and 0.25wt% potassium (K) supported on alumina. It highlights the synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst. The catalyst material features a bifunctional active phase where coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species act as the active species for dehydrogenation, while Pt serves as a promoter. The catalyst is resistant to coking and maintains its activity over prolonged reaction times. A complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character is revealed through structural, morphological, and surface characterization studies. It is noted that the presence of Pt leads to a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface, allowing for the active sites to be available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles. The Pt3GaK catalyst demonstrates superior activity, showcasing the exceptional catalytic performance of the material.

          最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发了一系列关键策略和方法。这些策略包括引入金属促进剂以优化催化剂的活性和稳定性，修改催化剂载体，利用双功能活性相，其中 coordinately 不饱和Ga3+物种作为活性物种，而Pt作为促进剂发挥作用，添加碱金属掺杂剂如钾（K），以增加丙烯选择性并减少焦炭沉积，通过毒化PDH催化剂上的Brnsted酸位点。原位光谱技术，如紫外可见光谱和拉曼光谱，被用来监测催化剂材料上的焦炭沉积。进行了大约150个周期或14天运行时间的长期稳定性测试，针对非常活跃的Pt3GaK催化剂。热重分析（TGA）结合在线质谱（MS）被用来调查在第八个循环后催化剂表面形成的焦炭沉积物。催化剂上存在的镓物种的特定性质通过71Ga MAS NMR和XPS光谱进行了研究。与文献中报道的其他一系列催化剂材料进行比较，包括商用CrOx催化剂，证明了Pt3GaK催化剂的优越活性。
