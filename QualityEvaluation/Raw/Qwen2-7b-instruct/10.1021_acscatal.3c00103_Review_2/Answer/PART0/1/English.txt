This leads to enhanced catalytic stability, addressing challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing advanced materials such as Al-Cu catalysts, Co/SiO2 catalysts, Ce-based catalysts, and Pt-based catalysts with promoters like In, Sn, Ga, or Zn to improve propylene selectivity. Researchers have also focused on stabilizing hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts through various methods, including incorporating graphene networks, growing them on metal or alloy substrates, and loading onto oxide materials. The activity of the PDH process is sensitive to numerous factors, particularly the reduction atmosphere of Mg(Al)O-supported Pt-based catalysts. High Pt dispersion, a high In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size contribute to a lower coke deposit content on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst. Additionally, the formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite after the reaction can re-disperse metal active sites and adjust the catalyst's acid-base properties, leading to improved stability and coke resistance.

Recent developments in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve incorporating specific elements like gallium (Ga) into the catalyst structure. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving the stability of the catalyst against coke accumulation, which is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the dehydrogenation reactions. Ga doping enhances the redox properties of ceria (CeO2), a common support material, by incorporating Ga3+ ions into its lattice structure. This leads to an increase in the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and oxygen mobility (OM), which are beneficial for eliminating coke deposits and supporting active sites.

2. Modifying the catalytic properties of the supported metal, in this case, platinum (Pt), by forming PtGa alloys. The geometric effect of Ga atoms in the alloy can decrease the size of Pt clusters or block low-coordinated defect sites, which helps in suppressing structure-sensitive side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation.

3. Enhancing the electronic properties of the catalyst by donating electrons from Ga atoms to the Pt active sites, which lowers the desorption barrier of alkene and coke precursors, thereby reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. This leads to improved selectivity towards desired products like propylene.

4. Optimizing the amount of Ga loading to achieve a balance between enhancing the redox properties of CeO2 and modifying the Pt nanoparticles without compromising the catalytic performance. The optimal loading of Ga typically lies around 3 wt %, which maximizes propylene selectivity and catalytic stability against coke accumulation.

In summary, the key strategies involve incorporating Ga into the catalyst structure, which modifies both the ceria support and the metal nanoparticles, leading to enhanced stability and selectivity in direct dehydrogenation processes.

This document discusses the development of a novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane into propene. The catalyst is composed of 1000ppm platinum (Pt), 3wt% gallium (Ga), and 0.25wt% potassium (K) supported on alumina. It highlights the synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst. The catalyst material features a bifunctional active phase where coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species act as the active species for dehydrogenation, while Pt serves as a promoter. The catalyst is resistant to coking and maintains its activity over prolonged reaction times. A complex catalyst material with a synergistic and bifunctional character is revealed through structural, morphological, and surface characterization studies. It is noted that the presence of Pt leads to a higher concentration of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ species, which facilitates the recombination of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface, allowing for the active sites to be available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles. The Pt3GaK catalyst demonstrates superior activity, showcasing the exceptional catalytic performance of the material.

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the development of novel catalyst designs that incorporate specific materials and preparation methods. Key strategies include:

          1. **Using Silica Supports**: The silica support (SiO2) provides a benign environment for the platinum-tin (Pt1Sn1) nanoparticles, preventing segregation and formation of unwanted phases like tin oxide (SnOx).

          2. **Atomically Mixed Precursors**: The synthesis of catalysts involves creating a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex that maintains the atomic mixing of Pt and Sn throughout the catalytic operation, ensuring a stable intermetallic phase.

          3. **Optimized Alloy Formation**: The Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalysts form atomically mixed Pt-Sn NPs upon reduction, resulting in smaller, stable intermetallic particles that do not segregate.

          4. **High Productivity and Stability**: The catalysts achieve high productivity and stability, particularly when operated at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without dilution, offering superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.
