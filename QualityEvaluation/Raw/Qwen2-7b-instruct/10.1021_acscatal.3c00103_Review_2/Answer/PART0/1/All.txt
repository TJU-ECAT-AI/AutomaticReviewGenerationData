This zeolite facilitates enhanced reactivity and stability due to its unique structure, which promotes both efficient reactant and product diffusion and high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) alongside platinum (Pt) into the zeolite structure was found to significantly increase the catalytic lifetime of the Pt/zeolite catalysts. Contrary to initial expectations, the addition of lanthanum (La) and yttrium (Y) resulted in a more than tenfold increase in catalytic lifetime. The PtREE alloy was formed by co-impregnation of aqueous solutions of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and REE nitrate salts, followed by thermal treatment under oxygen and hydrogen flows. The successful formation of long-lasting Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles was contingent on the synthesis procedure of the zeolite, despite the fact that all obtained zeolites were siliceous and had similar mesoporosity.

Each degallated site corresponded to a generated silanol nest, which was confirmed by atomic-resolution analysis.

The successful formation of long-lasting Pt3La and Pt3Y intermetallic nanoparticles was contingent on the synthesis procedure of the zeolite, despite the fact that all obtained zeolites were siliceous and had similar mesoporosity. This unexpected finding led to speculation about the possibility of forming PtREE alloys by incorporating REEs as single atomic species with high chemical potential. To test this hypothesis, silanol nests were intentionally created by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and removing the gallium (Ga) framework atoms with nitric acid. Each degallated site corresponded to a generated silanol nest, which was confirmed by atomic-resolution analysis. The REEs incorporated in this zeolite were indeed atomically dispersed, as demonstrated through AR-HAADF-STEM imaging. The Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles formed on the degallated zeolite showed remarkable enhancements in all aspects of PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and durability, as evidenced by Figure 2.", "Chinese": "近期，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究者们着重探索了一种以硅基MFI沸石作为替代氧化铝支撑物的策略。这种沸石因其独特的层级微/介孔结构而能提供增强的活性和稳定性，它促进了反应物和产物的高效扩散，并在介孔内保持了金属纳米颗粒的高分散度。通过在沸石结构中加入铂（Pt）与稀土元素（REEs），发现这能显著提高Pt/沸石催化剂的催化寿命。出乎意料的是，镧（La）和钇（Y）的添加使催化寿命提高了十倍以上。虽然最初认为添加REEs会因强金属-支撑相互作用而改善Pt/沸石催化剂的初始PDH活性，但实际效果却出人意料。PtREE合金的形成是通过将含Pt（NH3）4(NO3)2的水溶液与La(NO3)3·6H2O或Y(NO3)3·6H2O的水溶液共浸渍，然后在氧气流下加热至350°C，随后在氢气下加热至700°C完成的。尽管所获得的沸石都是硅基且具有相似的介孔性，但长寿命的Pt3La和Pt3Y互金属纳米颗粒的形成仍然依赖于沸石的合成工艺。这一意外的观察促使我们推测，PtREE合金的形成可能是通过将REEs作为具有高化学势的单原子物种整合到沸石中实现的。为了验证这一假设，研究者们通过合成介孔镓硅酸盐沸石并用硝酸去除框架Ga原子来故意生成硅醇巢（silanol nest）。每个去镓化的位置对应一个生成的硅醇巢。根据我们的假说，此沸石中整合的REEs确实呈原子级分散，这通过AR-HAADF-STEM视频（补充视频1）得到了证实。在去镓化的沸石上形成的Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米颗粒在所有方面都显著增强了PDH催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性，如图2所示。", "Doi": "10.1038/s41586-020-2671-4"},

The incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) alongside platinum (Pt) into the zeolite structure was found to significantly increase the catalytic lifetime of the Pt/zeolite catalysts.

This zeolite facilitates enhanced reactivity and stability due to its unique structure, which promotes both efficient reactant and product diffusion and high dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the mesopores. The incorporation of rare earth elements (REEs) alongside platinum (Pt) into the zeolite structure was found to significantly increase the catalytic lifetime of the Pt/zeolite catalysts.
