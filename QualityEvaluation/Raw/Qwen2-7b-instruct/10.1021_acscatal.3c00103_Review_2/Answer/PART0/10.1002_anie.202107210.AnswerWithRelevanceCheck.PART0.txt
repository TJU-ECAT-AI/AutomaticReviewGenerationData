          [1] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
          [2] "The double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
          [3] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH."
          [4] "The strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C."
          [5] "The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."
          [6] "Pb was deposited on the three-fold Pt (and Ga) sites of the PtGa nanoparticles, whereas Ca was placed around the nanoparticles to impart them with an electron-enriched Pt1 site (an active site for highly selective PDH)."

          对纳米颗粒状互金属PtGa进行铅（Pb）和钙（Ca）的双重修饰的催化剂设计被应用于在高温下生产丙烷脱氢（PDH）的超稳定催化剂。通过协同提升几何和电子促进效应，对PtGa进行双重修改可以成为一个有前景的催化剂设计概念，以构建PDH的超稳定催化系统。这些修改的效果是协同的，显著提高了PDH的催化稳定性。该策略使几何和电子促进效应协同作用，而无需改变母体PtGa结构，从而首次提供了一个在600C下具有非凡高催化稳定性的创新催化剂，可持续1个月。PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂的稳定性明显优于已报道的PDH催化剂，即使在600C下也能实现长达1个月的稳定性。
