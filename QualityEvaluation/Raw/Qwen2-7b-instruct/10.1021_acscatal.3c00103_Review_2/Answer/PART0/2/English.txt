It focuses on a particular type of catalyst, subsurface-regulated PtGa nanoparticles confined in silicalite-1 for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss general advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, or performance optimization.

A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature. The double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH. The strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts, achieving month-long stability even at 600C.

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supports, incorporating heteroatoms into the catalyst structure to enhance resistance to poisoning and promote better dehydrogenation efficiency, designing catalysts with tailored surface properties, and optimizing synthesis conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additives to significantly impact catalytic activity and stability.

Key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving both the intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the support material. Strategies include modifying the metal surface chemistry through treatments like thermal annealing or chemical modification to resist deactivation. Using noble metals like palladium and platinum due to their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, incorporating support materials with specific functionalities, optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and co-catalyst presence), and exploring composite catalysts combining different metals or metal oxides to achieve synergistic effects and improve stability play crucial roles in maximizing catalytic efficiency and longevity.

The challenges in the direct dehydrogenation processes for ethane and propane include the difficulty in activating the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the selectivity control of CH cleavage versus CC cleavage, and the issues of olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anticoke ability. These challenges are common in both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. For the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies, the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts, have been developed in the last few decades. At 550°C, the catalyst shows over 99% propylene selectivity and a specific rate of 0.96 s−1 in the PDH reaction, while at 600°C, over 98% selectivity and a rate of 1.46 s−1 can be achieved. The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), indicating a strong interaction with metal sites for excellent anti-sintering stability in long-term reactions. Considering that these zeolites have micro-pores and cavities at different sizes, a fundamental challenge is to accurately and selectively locate metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another challenge is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reducing atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals leads to the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm in size. A promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst achieves over 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction due to favorable diffusion in short paths.

2. The use of Sn as a promoter often fails to provide strong interactions between the metal and the support, leading to Pt sintering, which reduces the activity and regenerability of the catalyst. To address this issue, it is highly desirable to develop new supports that can anchor Sn within their frameworks and enhance the metal-support interaction, thereby facilitating the effective dispersion of Pt species. Additionally, the acidity of beta zeolites can be easily adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, which creates opportunities to anchor metal precursors and generate well-defined bimetallic systems. The unique structure of the BEA-type zeolites enables a shape-selective reaction space for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), promoting the diffusion of propene molecules and inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The confined Sn(iv) sites within the Si-beta framework facilitate the dispersion of Pt clusters and enhance the stability of the catalyst through strong PtSn interactions.

Key strategies involve modifying the structure of catalyst particles, particularly focusing on the arrangement and type of atoms within the particle, to enhance their catalytic stability in direct dehydrogenation processes. These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by providing insights into how subtle structural modifications can significantly impact catalytic efficiency.

The focus on catalyst preparation and structure studies aiming for high efficiency in propylene yield is crucial for the PDH process. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly when combined with promoters like Indium (In), Tin (Sn), Gallium (Ga), or Zinc (Zn), are still considered the most effective for the PDH process, enhancing propylene selectivity. Efforts to stabilize hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts involve integrating graphene networks, growing them on metal substrates (such as Aluminum or Nickel), or loading onto oxide materials. Building on this foundation, ZnO-supported HT was synthesized through a hydrothermal process. Subsequently, In and Pt elements were introduced into the HT layer via sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction. The 48% dispersion of the H2/N2-reduced sample is notably greater than the 34% dispersion of the C3H8/H2/N2-reduced sample, indicating that the H2/N2-reduced catalyst utilizes Pt more effectively.

Operando spectroscopic techniques such as UV/Vis and Raman spectroscopy were employed to monitor the deposition of coke on the catalyst materials. Long-term stability tests, consisting of approximately 150 cycles or 14 days of operation, were conducted on the highly active Pt3GaK catalyst. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with online mass spectrometry (MS) was utilized to investigate the coke deposits formed on the catalyst surface after the eighth cycle.

The focus on catalyst preparation and structure studies aiming for high efficiency in propylene yield is crucial for the PDH process. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly when combined with promoters like Indium (In), Tin (Sn), Gallium (Ga), or Zinc (Zn), are still considered the most effective for the PDH process, enhancing propylene selectivity. Efforts to stabilize hydrotalcite (HT)-based catalysts involve integrating graphene networks, growing them on metal substrates (such as Aluminum or Nickel), or loading onto oxide materials. Building on this foundation, ZnO-supported HT was synthesized through a hydrothermal process. Subsequently, In and Pt elements were introduced into the HT layer via sequential impregnation-induced reconstruction. The 48% dispersion of the H2/N2-reduced sample is notably greater than the 34% dispersion of the C3H8/H2/N2-reduced sample, indicating that the H2/N2-reduced catalyst utilizes Pt more effectively.

The literature does not provide specific strategies and approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. It focuses on a particular type of catalyst, subsurface-regulated PtGa nanoparticles confined in silicalite-1 for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss general advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, or performance optimization.

A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature. The double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH. The strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts, achieving month-long stability even at 600C.

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supports, incorporating heteroatoms into the catalyst structure to enhance resistance to poisoning and promote better dehydrogenation efficiency, designing catalysts with tailored surface properties, and optimizing synthesis conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of additives to significantly impact catalytic activity and stability.

Key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving both the intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the support material. Strategies include modifying the metal surface chemistry through treatments like thermal annealing or chemical modification to resist deactivation. Using noble metals like palladium and platinum due to their high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, incorporating support materials with specific functionalities, optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and co-catalyst presence), and exploring composite catalysts combining different metals or metal oxides to achieve synergistic effects and improve stability play crucial roles in maximizing catalytic efficiency and longevity.

The challenges in the direct dehydrogenation processes for ethane and propane include the difficulty in activating the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the selectivity control of CH cleavage versus CC cleavage, and the issues of olefin desorption, catalyst structure stability, and anticoke ability. These challenges are common in both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. For the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies, the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts, have been developed in the last few decades. At 550°C, the catalyst shows over 99% propylene selectivity and a specific rate of 0.96 s−1 in the PDH reaction, while at 600°C, over 98% selectivity and a rate of 1.46 s−1 can be achieved. The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), indicating a strong interaction with metal sites for excellent anti-sintering stability in long-term reactions. Considering that these zeolites have micro-pores and cavities at different sizes, a fundamental challenge is to accurately and selectively locate metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another challenge is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reducing atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals leads to the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm in size. A promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst achieves over 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction due to favorable diffusion in short paths.

2. The use of Sn as a promoter often fails to provide strong interactions between the metal and the support, leading to Pt sintering, which reduces the activity and regenerability of the catalyst. To address this issue, it is highly desirable to develop new supports that can anchor Sn within their frameworks and enhance the metal-support interaction, thereby facilitating the effective dispersion of Pt species. Additionally, the acidity of beta zeolites can be easily adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, which creates opportunities to anchor metal precursors and generate well-defined bimetallic systems. The unique structure of the BEA-type zeolites enables a shape-selective reaction space for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), promoting the diffusion of propene molecules and inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The confined Sn(iv) sites within the Si-beta framework facilitate the dispersion of Pt clusters and enhance the stability of the catalyst through strong PtSn interactions.
