The document discusses the application of machine learning (ML) methods to predict the d-band center for metals and bimetallic compounds. The aim is to demonstrate the potential of ML methods in catalysis, offering a faster and more precise alternative to first-principles calculations. The study reports sufficient predictability of the d-band center using a small set of readily available properties of metals as descriptors. A fully data-driven approach based on ML is quantitatively investigated, enabling the inference of the d-band center of a metal or a bimetal from those of other metals and bimetals.
