[1] "The d-band centers for eleven metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) and their pairwise bimetals for two different structures (1% metal doped- or overlayer-covered metal surfaces) are statistically predicted using machine learning methods from readily available values as descriptors for the target metals."
[2] "The predictive accuracy of four regression methods with different numbers of descriptors and different test-set/training-set ratios are quantitatively evaluated using statistical cross validations."
[3] "It is shown that the d-band centers are reasonably well predicted by the gradient boosting regression (GBR) method with only six descriptors, even when we predict 75% of the data from only 25% given for training (average root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.5 eV)."
[4] "This demonstrates a potential use of machine learning methods for predicting the activity trends of metal surfaces with a negligible CPU time compared to first-principles methods."

Machine learning methods, particularly the gradient boosting regression (GBR) method, were employed to predict the d-band centers for metals and bimetals. Six descriptors were found to be sufficient for predicting the d-band centers with a root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.5 eV for 75% of the data trained from 25% of the available data. This approach offers a potential use for predicting the activity trends of metal surfaces with minimal computational resources compared to traditional first-principles methods.

机器学习方法，尤其是梯度提升回归（GBR）方法，被用来预测金属和二元合金的d能带中心。仅使用六个描述符就足以预测d能带中心，对于从训练集中的25%数据得到的75%的数据，根均方误差（RMSE）小于0.5 eV。这种方法可能用于用最少的计算资源预测金属表面的活性趋势与传统的第一原理方法相比。
