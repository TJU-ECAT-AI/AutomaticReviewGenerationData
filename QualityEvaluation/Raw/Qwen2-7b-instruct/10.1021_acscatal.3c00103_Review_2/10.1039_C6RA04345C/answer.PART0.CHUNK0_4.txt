[1] "The d-band center for metals and bimetals has been widely used in order to understand activity trends in metal-surface-catalyzed reactions in terms of the linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation and HammerNrskov d-band model."
[2] "In this paper, the d-band centers for eleven metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) and their pairwise bimetals for two different structures (1% metal doped- or overlayer-covered metal surfaces) are statistically predicted using machine learning methods from readily available values as descriptors for the target metals (such as the density and the enthalpy of fusion of each metal)."
[3] "It is shown that the d-band centers are reasonably well predicted by the gradient boosting regression (GBR) method with only six descriptors, even when we predict 75% of the data from only 25% given for training (average root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.5 eV)."
[4] "Considering that first-principles calculations are too time-consuming to explore the full spectrum of possibilities, and on the other hand, a great amount of data is being generated and accumulated in the field, ML methods can give a fast and high-precision alternative to the first-principles models."

This study employs machine learning techniques to predict the d-band center for various metals and bimetals. The d-band center, crucial for understanding catalytic activity, is statistically forecasted using machine learning methods from readily available properties of the metals as descriptors. The gradient boosting regression (GBR) method, utilizing just six descriptors, demonstrates significant predictive accuracy, even when predicting 75% of the data from only 25% of the provided dataset. This showcases the potential for machine learning in catalysis, offering a faster and more precise alternative to traditional first-principles computational methods.

本研究采用机器学习方法预测金属和双金属的d带中心。利用现有金属属性作为描述符，从机器学习方法中统计预测d带中心，以理解催化活性趋势。使用仅六个描述符的梯度增强回归（GBR）方法，即使在仅使用25%提供的数据集训练75%的数据时，也能显示出显著的预测准确性。这表明机器学习在催化领域的潜力，提供了一种比第一原理计算方法更快、更精确的替代方案。
