[1] "In this paper, the d-band centers for eleven metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) and their pairwise bimetals for two different structures (1% metal doped- or overlayer-covered metal surfaces) are statistically predicted using machine learning methods from readily available values as descriptors for the target metals."
[2] "The d-band centers are calculated by first principles independently for each metal or bimetal in conventional situations."
[3] "Our result shows sufficient predictability of d-band center by ML methods using a small set of readily available properties of metals as descriptors."
[4] "This would suggest the promising role of ML methods that bypass or complement the first-principles calculations."
[5] "Regarding the choice of descriptors for metals, we pre-tested several candidates and chose nine physical properties (Table 3), which are readily available from the periodic table and a handbook."
[6] "From a practical point of view, it is important to choose readily accessible but characteristic values as descriptors in order to effectively bypass time-consuming DFT calculations with keeping good prediction accuracy."

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of machine learning methods for predicting the d-band center of metals and bimetals. By employing readily available properties such as density, enthalpy of fusion, and ionization energy as descriptors, the d-band center can be statistically predicted using machine learning techniques like gradient boosting regression. This approach allows for a data-driven prediction of catalytic activity trends with minimal computational resources compared to traditional first-principles methods. The selection of descriptors is crucial for achieving high prediction accuracy while bypassing time-consuming density functional theory calculations. This method demonstrates the potential for using machine learning to optimize catalyst design, fabrication, and performance for industrial applications in dehydrogenation processes.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，最近发展出的关键策略和方法是利用机器学习方法预测金属和二元合金的d带中心。通过使用周期表和手册中可获取的属性，如密度、熔化热和电负性作为描述符，可以使用机器学习技术（如梯度增强回归）对d带中心进行统计预测。这种方法允许在几乎不需要计算资源的情况下，根据数据驱动的方法预测催化活性趋势，与传统的第一原理方法相比。描述符的选择对于实现高预测精度以及跳过耗时的密度泛函理论计算至关重要。这一结果表明，机器学习可以用于优化催化剂设计、制造和工业应用中的性能。
