[1] "The introduction of promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Precisely speaking, both the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation exhibited the linear relationships as a function of the quantity of lattice oxygen in the catalysts."
[3] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[4] "On the other hand, In performed the best among the additives as it could efficiently promote the reduction of Pt species. More importantly, it was able to stabilize the surface Pt particles simultaneously."
[5] "The In additive could promote the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilize the metallic Pt particles. Furthermore, the In oxides were also reduced according to the surface analysis, indicating that more oxygen vacancies could be formed via the prereduction."
[6] "Nevertheless, sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were still the main reasons for catalytic deactivation. All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates from 9.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat. compared with the base Pt/SSF sample (9.2 (μmol/s)/gcat.) and improved propylene generation rates from 8.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat.."

1. Key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve introducing promoters like Ce, In, La, and Fe to the Pt/SSF sample. These additives significantly influence the initial activity and stability by affecting the lattice oxygen capacity, which is crucial for propane consumption and propylene generation.

5. Indium (In) effectively reduces surface Pt oxides and stabilizes metallic Pt particles. Surface analysis confirms the reduction of In oxides, suggesting an increase in oxygen vacancies that contributes to enhanced catalytic performance.

6. Sintering of active phases and coke deposition remain primary causes of catalytic deactivation. Promoted catalysts demonstrate improved initial propane consumption rates (9.9 to 12.7 μmol/s/gcat.) and propylene generation rates (8.9 to 12.7 μmol/s/gcat.) compared to the base Pt/SSF sample.

1. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the introduction of promoters like cerium (Ce), indium (In), lanthanum (La), and iron (Fe) into the base Pt/SSF catalyst. These additives significantly influence the initial activity and catalytic stability by affecting the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and coke deposition.

2. Lattice oxygen capacity, which is calculated from hydrogen consumption in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, plays a crucial role in determining the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation. This indicates that the presence of promoters favors the generation of more lattice oxygen, which is essential for activating CH bonds in propane and enhancing the production of propylene.

3. Promoters like Ce and In possess exceptional abilities to prevent the growth of metallic Pt crystallites under reaction conditions, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. This ability contrasts with the effects observed in La- and Fe-promoted catalysts, where the Pt crystallite size increases significantly during the reaction.

4. The sintering of active metallic Pt and coke deposition remain the primary reasons behind the catalytic deactivation. These phenomena contribute to the loss of catalyst activity and efficiency in the direct dehydrogenation of propane.

5. Iron (Fe)-promoted catalysts exhibit a high level of lattice oxygen capacity, which correlates directly with the initial conversion of propane. This highlights the importance of redox properties, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition in achieving better catalytic stability.

6. The indium (In)-promoted catalyst InPt/SSF demonstrates its capability to improve the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, offering significant potential for the activation of light alkanes. This catalyst shows remarkable performance in maintaining stability over prolonged reaction times, with minimal loss in propane conversion and a high propylene selectivity.

2. 来自温度程序化减少（TPR）测量的氢消耗计算出的晶格氧容量，在确定丙烷消耗的初始速率和丙烯生成的最终速率中起着重要作用。这表明促进剂的存在有利于产生更多的晶格氧，这对于激活丙烷中的CH键并增强丙烯的生产至关重要。

3. 如同X射线衍射(XRD)结果所示，Ce和In具有阻止Pt结晶体在反应条件下生长的超强大能力，与La-和Fe促进剂相比，这种能力在催化剂中表现得尤为明显。这一发现与La-和Fe促进剂中Pt结晶体大小显著增加的现象形成了鲜明对比。

4. 活性金属Pt的烧结和焦炭沉积仍然是导致催化剂失活的主要原因。这些现象导致催化剂活性和效率的丧失，并对丙烷直接脱氢过程产生不利影响。

5. 铁(Fe)-促进催化剂显示出高水平的晶格氧容量，这直接与丙烷的初始转化率相关联。这强调了氧化还原性质、抗聚集能力和抵抗焦炭沉积能力在实现更好催化稳定性中的重要性。

6. 研究表明，以In-促进剂为特色的催化剂InPt/SSF能够提高丙烷脱氢的催化稳定性，为轻烷烃的活化提供了巨大的潜力。这种催化剂在长时间反应中表现出良好的稳定性，丙烷转化率损失较小，丙烯选择性保持稳定。

1. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the incorporation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters. These metals affect the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and coke deposition, thus impacting the catalytic activity and stability.
