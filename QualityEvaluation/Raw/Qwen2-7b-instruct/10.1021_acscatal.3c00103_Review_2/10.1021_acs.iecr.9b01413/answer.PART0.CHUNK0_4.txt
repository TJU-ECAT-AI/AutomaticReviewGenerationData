[1] "The introduction of promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene, which could be easily found from the correlations presented in Figure 13."
[3] "Concerning the catalytic stability of propane dehydrogenation reaction, Pt/SSF showed good resistance to the coke deposition, while the sintering of metallic Pt was mainly responsible for the catalytic deactivation as suggested by H2-TPD measurements."
[4] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[5] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition. FePt/SSF showed the highest level of coke deposition which was 5 times as many as Pt/SSF, and CePt/SSF showed the lowest level but still a little bit higher than the pristine one."
[6] "In order to explore more information on the role of promotor and to understand well the key factors that could affect the catalytic stability, the change in crystallite size during the reaction determined by XRD, the number of surface Pt species associated with the TPR and XPS, the quantity of deposited coke tested by running the TG measurements in diluted oxygen over the spent samples, and the variation of propane conversion were gathered in Figure 15 for a comparison study."
[7] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[8] "In this work, the In promoted catalyst InPt/SSF showed its good ability in improving the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, which also offered great potential for its application to the activation of light alkanes."

1. Strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the introduction of promoters like Ce, In, La, and Fe. These additives affect the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, thereby influencing the catalytic activity and stability.

2. Lattice oxygen capacity, derived from hydrogen consumption in TPR measurements, significantly impacts the initial propane conversion and final propylene yield, providing insights into the catalytic performance enhancement.

3. Pt/SSF demonstrates good resistance towards coke deposition, but the sintering of metallic Pt contributes significantly to the catalyst deactivation. This is evidenced by hydrogen consumption patterns in TPD measurements.

4. Promoters like Ce and In effectively prevent the growth of Pt crystallites under reaction conditions, as observed through XRD analysis. This prevents the aggregation of active Pt sites.

5. Despite improvements in other aspects, the introduction of promoters does not necessarily enhance the catalyst's ability to resist coke deposition. For instance, Fe promoted catalysts show higher coke deposition levels compared to the pristine catalyst.

6. Comparative studies involving changes in Pt crystallite size, surface Pt species, coke deposition, and propane conversion variations help understand the factors affecting catalytic stability. 

7. The Fe promoted catalyst shows a high level of lattice oxygen capacity, directly linked to the initial propane conversion rate, highlighting the role of lattice oxygen in catalytic activity.

8. The In promoted catalyst, InPt/SSF, exhibits superior catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, offering promising potential for activating light alkanes.

1. 最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发了一些策略和方法，包括引入诸如Ce、In、La和Fe这样的促进剂。这些添加剂会影响还原性、基本性质、表面Pt含量、金属Pt粒子的稳定性以及焦炭沉积，从而影响催化活性和稳定性。

2. 来自TPR测量的晶格氧容量可以显著影响丙烷的初始转化率和丙烯的最终产率，为提高催化性能提供了线索。

3. Pt/SSF显示出对焦炭沉积的良好抵抗力，但金属Pt的结块是导致催化剂失活的主要原因。这通过TPD测量中的氢消耗模式得到证据。

4. 例如，Ce和In有效地防止了在反应条件下Pt晶粒的生长，根据XRD分析观察到这一点。这阻止了活性Pt位点的聚集。

5. 尽管在其他方面有所改进，但促进剂的引入并不一定增强催化剂抵抗焦炭沉积的能力。例如，Fe促进催化剂的焦炭沉积水平高于原始催化剂。

6. 比较研究涉及Pt晶粒大小的变化、表面Pt物种、焦炭沉积量以及丙烷转化率的变化，有助于理解影响催化稳定性的因素。

7. Fe促进催化剂显示了高晶格氧容量，直接与初始丙烷转化率相关联，突出了晶格氧在催化活性中的作用。

8. In促进催化剂，InPt/SSF，表现出良好的催化稳定性用于丙烷脱氢，为激活轻烷烃提供了有前景的潜力。
