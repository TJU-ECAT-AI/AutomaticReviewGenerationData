[1] "The addition of the promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Lattice oxygen capacity, calculated from consumed hydrogen in TPR measurements, played an important role in determining the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation."
[3] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."
[4] "On the other hand, it could be easily found that the sintering of active metallic Pt and the coke deposition were still the main reasons responsible for the catalytic deactivation."
[5] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[6] "In this work, the In promoted catalyst InPt/SSF showed its good ability in improving the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, which also offered great potential for its application to the activation of light alkanes."

1. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the introduction of promoters like cerium (Ce), indium (In), lanthanum (La), and iron (Fe) into the base Pt/SSF catalyst. These additives significantly influence the initial activity and catalytic stability by affecting the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and coke deposition.

2. Lattice oxygen capacity, which is calculated from hydrogen consumption in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, plays a crucial role in determining the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation. This indicates that the presence of promoters favors the generation of more lattice oxygen, which is essential for activating CH bonds in propane and enhancing the production of propylene.

3. Promoters like Ce and In possess exceptional abilities to prevent the growth of metallic Pt crystallites under reaction conditions, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results. This ability contrasts with the effects observed in La- and Fe-promoted catalysts, where the Pt crystallite size increases significantly during the reaction.

4. The sintering of active metallic Pt and coke deposition remain the primary reasons behind the catalytic deactivation. These phenomena contribute to the loss of catalyst activity and efficiency in the direct dehydrogenation of propane.

5. Iron (Fe)-promoted catalysts exhibit a high level of lattice oxygen capacity, which correlates directly with the initial conversion of propane. This highlights the importance of redox properties, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition in achieving better catalytic stability.

6. The indium (In)-promoted catalyst InPt/SSF demonstrates its capability to improve the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, offering significant potential for the activation of light alkanes. This catalyst shows remarkable performance in maintaining stability over prolonged reaction times, with minimal loss in propane conversion and a high propylene selectivity.

1. 最近发展起来用于提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及在基底Pt/SSF催化剂中引入铈(Ce)、铟(In)、镧(La)和铁(Fe)等促进剂。这些添加剂显著影响初始活性和催化稳定性，通过影响可还原性、基本性质、表面Pt含量、金属Pt颗粒稳定性以及焦炭沉积来实现这一目标。

2. 来自温度程序化减少（TPR）测量的氢消耗计算出的晶格氧容量，在确定丙烷消耗的初始速率和丙烯生成的最终速率中起着重要作用。这表明促进剂的存在有利于产生更多的晶格氧，这对于激活丙烷中的CH键并增强丙烯的生产至关重要。

3. 如同X射线衍射(XRD)结果所示，Ce和In具有阻止Pt结晶体在反应条件下生长的超强大能力，与La-和Fe促进剂相比，这种能力在催化剂中表现得尤为明显。这一发现与La-和Fe促进剂中Pt结晶体大小显著增加的现象形成了鲜明对比。

4. 活性金属Pt的烧结和焦炭沉积仍然是导致催化剂失活的主要原因。这些现象导致催化剂活性和效率的丧失，并对丙烷直接脱氢过程产生不利影响。

5. 铁(Fe)-促进催化剂显示出高水平的晶格氧容量，这直接与丙烷的初始转化率相关联。这强调了氧化还原性质、抗聚集能力和抵抗焦炭沉积能力在实现更好催化稳定性中的重要性。

6. 研究表明，以In-促进剂为特色的催化剂InPt/SSF能够提高丙烷脱氢的催化稳定性，为轻烷烃的活化提供了巨大的潜力。这种催化剂在长时间反应中表现出良好的稳定性，丙烷转化率损失较小，丙烯选择性保持稳定。
