1. The key strategies and approaches that have been developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the incorporation of various metals such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into Pt/Sn-SBA-15. These additives affect the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and the coke deposition, ultimately influencing the catalytic activity and stability for the production of propylene.

2. The lattice oxygen capacity plays a crucial role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene. The introduction of promoters facilitates the generation of more lattice oxygen, which acts as a key catalyst in activating CH bonds in propane for propylene production.

3. The In promoter helps to form more surface Pt oxides and promotes their reduction, stabilizing the metallic Pt under reaction conditions. This is beneficial for improving propylene selectivity and stability.

4. Fe promotes the largest amount of lattice oxygen, directly affecting the initial propane conversion and linking it to the catalytic activity and lattice oxygen capacity.

5. Sintering of active phases and coke deposition remain the primary causes of catalytic deactivation in the direct dehydrogenation of propane.

6. The promoted catalysts demonstrate higher initial propane consumption and propylene generation rates, offering improved catalytic stability.

7. The In-promoted catalyst, InPt/SSF, shows superior stability in propane dehydrogenation, making it suitable for the activation of light alkanes.

8. The advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization address the challenges by incorporating promoters that enhance the catalytic stability and efficiency in direct dehydrogenation processes.
