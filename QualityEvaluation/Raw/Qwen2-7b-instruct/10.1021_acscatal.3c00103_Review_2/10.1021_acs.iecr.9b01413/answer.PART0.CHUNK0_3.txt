[1] "Various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 as highly stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The results further implied that the lattice oxygen played an important role in determining the initial activity in propane dehydrogenation as a linear relationship was achieved."
[3] "The addition of the promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "On the other hand, the introduction of promotors did not improve the ability against coke deposition."
[5] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[6] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions."
[7] "All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates from 9.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat. compared with the base Pt/SSF sample (9.2 (μmol/s)/gcat.)."
[8] "The In promotor helped the reaction stabilize in shorter time (3 h) and performed better in the long term catalytic stability test as the conversion lost only 12.8% and the selectivity of propylene was kept nearly constant in maximum of about 99.0% during 33 h time on stream."

1. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the incorporation of various metals (Ce, In, La, and Fe) as promoters. These metals affect the reducibility, basicity, surface content of Pt, stability of metallic Pt particles, and coke deposition, thus impacting the catalytic activity and stability.

2. Lattice oxygen capacity, determined by consumed hydrogen in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements, plays a significant role in determining the initial conversion of propane and the final yield of propylene. The linear relationship between lattice oxygen capacity and catalytic performance suggests that more lattice oxygen promotes higher initial activity and propylene yield.

3. The addition of promoters such as Ce, In, La, and Fe can profoundly affect the initial activity and catalytic stability of propane dehydrogenation reactions. In particular, the introduction of In as a promoter is beneficial in forming larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, promoting their reduction, stabilizing the metallic Pt, and enhancing propylene selectivity and stability.

4. The introduction of promoters does not necessarily improve the catalyst's ability to resist coke deposition. Instead, they may influence other aspects of catalytic performance, such as reducing the sintering of active phases.

5. The Fe-promoted catalyst FePt/SSF exhibits a high level of lattice oxygen, which is directly linked to the initial conversion of propane. This highlights the importance of lattice oxygen capacity in determining catalytic activity.

6. The In additive is advantageous in promoting the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilizing the metallic Pt under reaction conditions. It also contributes to the formation of more oxygen vacancies, which can improve propylene selectivity and stability.

7. Promoted catalysts generally show higher initial propane consumption rates and improved propylene generation rates compared to the base Pt/SSF sample. The In-promoted catalyst InPt/SSF, in particular, helps stabilize the reaction in a shorter time and maintains high propylene selectivity during long-term catalytic stability testing.

8. The In promoter leads to better catalytic stability, as evidenced by the InPt/SSF catalyst losing only 12.8% of propane conversion and maintaining nearly constant propylene selectivity (around 99%) over 33 hours of reaction time.

1. 近期，提高直接脱氢过程中负载型金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括将铈(Ce)、铟(In)、镧(La)和铁(Fe)等几种金属作为促进剂。这些金属可以显著影响催化剂的可还原性、基本性质、铂(Pt)表面含量、金属Pt颗粒稳定性以及焦炭沉积等，从而影响催化活性和稳定性。

2. 催化剂晶格氧容量（通过温度程序还原（TPR）测定消耗的氢气量确定），在决定丙烷脱氢反应初期丙烷转化率和最终丙烯产率方面起着重要作用。发现晶格氧容量与催化性能之间存在线性关系，意味着更多的晶格氧能促进更高的初期活性和丙烯产率。

3. 将Ce、In、La、Fe等促进剂添加到纯Pt/SSF样品中，可以显著影响丙烷脱氢反应的初始活性和催化剂稳定性。尤其是In添加剂有助于形成更大数量的表面Pt氧化物，并促进它们的还原和稳定金属Pt，在反应条件下有利于提升丙烯选择性和稳定性。

4. 添加促进剂不一定能改善催化剂抵抗焦炭沉积的能力。相反，它们可能会影响其他方面的催化性能，如减少活性位点的团聚。

5. Fe促进剂的催化剂FePt/SSF表现出较高的晶格氧水平，这与初期丙烷转化率直接相关。这表明晶格氧容量对于确定催化活性的重要性。

6. In添加剂的优点在于促进表面Pt氧化物的还原并稳定金属Pt，同时也有助于形成更多氧空位，这些都能提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。

7. 含有促进剂的催化剂通常具有比基质Pt/SSF样品更高的初始丙烷消耗速率和改进的丙烯生成速率。其中，In促进剂的催化剂InPt/SSF特别有助于在较短时间内稳定反应，并维持丙烯选择性（约为99%）长达33小时的催化稳定性测试。

8. In促进剂导致更好的催化稳定性，因为InPt/SSF催化剂仅损失12.8%的丙烷转化率，并在整个33小时内保持丙烯选择性几乎不变。
