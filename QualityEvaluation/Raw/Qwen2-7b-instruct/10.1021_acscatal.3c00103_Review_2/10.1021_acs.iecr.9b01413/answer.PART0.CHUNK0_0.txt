[1] "The introduction of promotors such as Ce, In, La, and Fe into the pristine sample Pt/SSF could profoundly affect the initial activity and the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "Precisely speaking, both the initial rate of propane consumption and the final rate of propylene generation exhibited the linear relationships as a function of the quantity of lattice oxygen in the catalysts."
[3] "Fe promoted catalyst FePt/SSF involved most lattice oxygen which was directly linked to the initial conversion of propane by correlating the catalytic activity and the lattice oxygen capacity."
[4] "On the other hand, In performed the best among the additives as it could efficiently promote the reduction of Pt species. More importantly, it was able to stabilize the surface Pt particles simultaneously."
[5] "The In additive could promote the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilize the metallic Pt particles. Furthermore, the In oxides were also reduced according to the surface analysis, indicating that more oxygen vacancies could be formed via the prereduction."
[6] "Nevertheless, sintering of active phases and the coke deposition were still the main reasons for catalytic deactivation. All promoted catalysts showed higher initial propane consumption rates from 9.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat. compared with the base Pt/SSF sample (9.2 (μmol/s)/gcat.) and improved propylene generation rates from 8.9 to 12.7 (μmol/s)/gcat.."
[7] "In this work, the In promoted catalyst InPt/SSF showed its good ability in improving the catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, which also offered great potential for its application to the activation of light alkanes."

1. Key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve introducing promoters like Ce, In, La, and Fe to the Pt/SSF sample. These additives significantly influence the initial activity and stability by affecting the lattice oxygen capacity, which is crucial for propane consumption and propylene generation.

2. There exists a linear relationship between the initial and final conversion rates of propane and the amount of lattice oxygen in the catalysts. This highlights the importance of lattice oxygen in catalytic efficiency.

3. Iron (Fe) promotes the highest amount of lattice oxygen, which correlates directly with the initial conversion of propane, thereby influencing catalytic activity and lattice oxygen capacity.

4. Among the additives, Indium (In) performs exceptionally well. It promotes the reduction of Pt species, stabilizes the surface Pt particles, and generates more oxygen vacancies through pre-reduction, which improves propylene selectivity and stability.

5. Indium (In) effectively reduces surface Pt oxides and stabilizes metallic Pt particles. Surface analysis confirms the reduction of In oxides, suggesting an increase in oxygen vacancies that contributes to enhanced catalytic performance.

6. Sintering of active phases and coke deposition remain primary causes of catalytic deactivation. Promoted catalysts demonstrate improved initial propane consumption rates (9.9 to 12.7 μmol/s/gcat.) and propylene generation rates (8.9 to 12.7 μmol/s/gcat.) compared to the base Pt/SSF sample.

7. The In-promoted catalyst, InPt/SSF, exhibits superior ability in enhancing catalytic stability for propane dehydrogenation, offering promising applications in activating light alkanes.

1. 提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括向Pt/SSF样品中引入Ce、In、La和Fe等促进剂。这些添加剂显著影响初始活性和稳定性，通过影响晶格氧容量，这对于丙烷消耗和丙烯生成至关重要。

2. 烯烃和最终丙烯生成速率与催化剂中晶格氧量成线性关系，表明晶格氧在催化效率中的重要性。

3. 铁（Fe）促进了最高量的晶格氧，这直接与丙烷的初始转化率相关联，从而影响催化活性和晶格氧容量。

4. 其中，铟（In）表现得最为出色。它有效地促进了Pt物种的还原，稳定了表面Pt颗粒，并通过预还原生成更多的氧空位，从而提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。

5. 镧（La）和铁（Fe）在催化剂表面上形成了更大的Pt氧化物，而铟（In）不仅促进了这些氧化物的还原，还稳定了金属Pt颗粒。表面分析证实了In氧化物的还原，暗示着氧空位的增加，这有助于增强催化性能。

6. 活性相的烧结和焦炭沉积仍然是催化剂失活的主要原因。促进剂催化剂显示出改善的初始丙烷消耗率（9.9至12.7 μmol/s/gcat.）和丙烯生成率（8.9至12.7 μmol/s/gcat.），与基底Pt/SSF样本相比。

7. In促导的催化剂，InPt/SSF，在提高丙烷脱氢催化稳定性方面表现出优越的能力，为激活轻烷烃提供了有前景的应用。
