[1] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."
[2] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."
[3] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[4] "The facile reducing nature of VO bonds in the VZr catalyst can be interpreted by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared with Al, which causes the difference of the interaction between VOx and the support."
[5] "DFT calculations also confirm that low coordinated V species are more active in CH activation, which is consistent with the highest TOF and the lowest CH activation temperature for VZr observed in the catalytic performance and C3H8-TPSR tests."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include utilizing vanadium oxide supported on zirconia (ZrO2) over aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as a support material. This approach leverages the lower electronegativity of zirconia compared to aluminum, which facilitates easier reduction of vanadium-oxygen bonds, leading to the formation of lower coordinated vanadium species. These species are more active in CH activation, thereby improving the catalytic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the notion that low coordinated vanadium species are more active in CH activation, aligning with the observed high turnover frequency (TOF) and low CH activation temperature for the VZr catalyst. This strategy addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by offering a cost-effective and less toxic alternative to platinum-based and chromium oxide-based catalysts, while maintaining or surpassing their performance.

最近发展起来的增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括使用氧化钒在氧化锆（ZrO2）上的支持材料代替氧化铝（Al2O3）。这种方法利用了锆的电负性低于铝的特性，使得氧化钒键更容易被还原，从而形成较低配位的钒物种。这些物种在CH活化中更为活跃，进而提高了催化剂性能。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持了低配位的钒物种在CH激活中更为活跃的观点，这与观察到的VZr催化剂的高周转频率（TOF）和低CH激活温度相一致。这一策略通过提供一种成本效益高且毒性较低的替代品，同时保持或超越铂基和铬氧化物基催化剂的性能，解决了催化剂设计、制造和工业应用中的性能优化挑战。

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the interaction between the active metal species and the support material. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on the specific properties of the support that facilitate the reduction of metal bonds, leading to the formation of more active and stable metal species. The study highlights that in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, the reactivity is significantly influenced by the bond strength between the metal oxide (VOx) and the support material (ZrO2), as opposed to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. This interaction allows for the facile reduction of metal bonds, which in turn promotes the formation of lower coordinated metal species that exhibit better performance in PDH. The work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, demonstrating that the interaction between the metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic stability and activity.

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the structure and composition of the catalyst, particularly focusing on the interaction between the metal oxide (VOx) and the support material. This includes:

1. **Improving the Support Material**: Utilizing ZrO2 as the support has been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic performance compared to γ-Al2O3. This is due to the unique interaction between VOx and ZrO2, which facilitates the reduction of VO bonds, leading to the formation of more active lower coordinated V species.

2. **Optimizing Bond Reduction**: The facile reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV, and VOZr, on the ZrO2 support is crucial. This is facilitated by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared to Al, which results in a higher electron density on the VOS bond, making it more susceptible to reduction. This process leads to the formation of low coordinated V species that exhibit superior performance in CH activation.

3. **Understanding Structure-Performance Correlation**: Detailed analysis of the structure of VOx in a reduced state, using techniques like in situ Raman spectroscopy and XPS, has provided insights into how the structure of the catalyst influences its performance. This has led to a better understanding of the role of VO bonds and their reduction in enhancing catalytic activity.

4. **Quantitative Analysis of Bond Types**: DFT calculations have been employed to quantitatively assess the impact of different types of bonds (VO, VOV, VOZr) on the catalytic performance, specifically in terms of their contribution to CH activation and the energy barriers involved in the dehydrogenation process.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the catalytic activity of VOx-based catalysts. They enable the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及优化催化剂的结构和组成，特别是聚焦于金属氧化物（VOx）与支撑材料之间的相互作用。这些包括：

1. **改善支撑材料**：将ZrO2用作支撑材料已被证明可以显著提高催化性能，与γ-Al2O3相比。这种改进归功于VOx与ZrO2之间的独特相互作用，它促进了VO键的减少，导致形成更多活性较低配位的V物种。

2. **优化键的减少**：ZrO2支持上VO键（包括VO、VOV和VOZr）的易于减少是关键。这归因于Zr的低电负性与Al相比，导致VOS键的电子密度更高，使其更容易被还原。这一过程导致形成活性更高的低配位V物种，它们在CH激活中表现出优越性能。

3. **理解结构-性能相关性**：通过原位拉曼光谱和XPS等技术对VOx在还原气氛下的结构进行详细分析，提供了关于催化剂结构如何影响其性能的见解。这有助于更好地理解VO键及其在增强催化活性中的作用。

4. **不同键类型的定量分析**：使用第一原理计算（DFT）来定量评估不同类型键（VO、VOV、VOZr）对催化性能的影响，特别是在CH激活和脱氢过程中涉及的能量壁垒方面的贡献。

这些进展通过提供关于控制VOx基催化剂活性的机制的更深层次理解，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。它们使开发更高效稳定的催化剂成为可能，适用于工业应用中的直接脱氢过程。

The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the interaction between the active metal oxide (VOx) and the support material. Specifically, the research highlights the importance of tailoring the support material to facilitate easier reduction of the VO bonds in VOx, which in turn generates more active, lower coordinated V species. This approach improves the catalytic performance by enhancing the activation of the reactants, such as CH bonds in propane dehydrogenation. The use of ZrO2 as a support material, as opposed to Al2O3, was found to significantly increase the turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst, leading to improved efficiency in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided a theoretical confirmation of the enhanced catalytic activity, showing that partially reduced catalysts with low coordinated V species have lower energy barriers for CH activation, contributing to their superior performance.

The research offers a new perspective on the structure-performance correlation in VOx-based catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, providing insights into how support identity can significantly impact the reactivity and stability of the catalysts. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding the structural evolution of VOx under reducing atmospheres, as this knowledge can guide the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications.
