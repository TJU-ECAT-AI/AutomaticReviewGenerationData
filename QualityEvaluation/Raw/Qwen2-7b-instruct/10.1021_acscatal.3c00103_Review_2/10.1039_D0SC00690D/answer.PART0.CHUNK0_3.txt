[1] "Previous studies have confirmed that several factors could influence the performance of VOx-based catalysts such as polymerization forms of VOx, chemical states of V and the identity of the support."
[2] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[3] "This paper describes the structure and catalytic properties of the VOx/ZrO2 catalyst. When using ZrO2 as the support, the catalyst shows six times higher turnover frequency (TOF) than using commercial γ-Al2O3."
[4] "In situ Raman spectroscopic measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to determine the structure evolution of VOx under a reducing atmosphere, and they show that many more VO bonds on ZrO2 (VO, VOV and VOZr) are consumed during reduction."
[5] "Considering the activity is also influenced by V density, the TOFs of VZr and VAl were also compared based on V density (Fig. 2c and Table S2)."
[6] "Along with catalytic activity being linearly related to the amount of V, which directly proves VOx is responsible for the activity, we suggest VOx rather than Zrcus to be the main active phase."
[7] "DFT calculations also confirm that the CH rupture energy barrier is lower for partially reduced VZr with low coordinated V species."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the structure and composition of the catalyst, particularly focusing on the interaction between the metal oxide (VOx) and the support material. This includes:

1. **Improving the Support Material**: Utilizing ZrO2 as the support has been shown to significantly enhance the catalytic performance compared to γ-Al2O3. This is due to the unique interaction between VOx and ZrO2, which facilitates the reduction of VO bonds, leading to the formation of more active lower coordinated V species.

2. **Optimizing Bond Reduction**: The facile reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV, and VOZr, on the ZrO2 support is crucial. This is facilitated by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared to Al, which results in a higher electron density on the VOS bond, making it more susceptible to reduction. This process leads to the formation of low coordinated V species that exhibit superior performance in CH activation.

3. **Understanding Structure-Performance Correlation**: Detailed analysis of the structure of VOx in a reduced state, using techniques like in situ Raman spectroscopy and XPS, has provided insights into how the structure of the catalyst influences its performance. This has led to a better understanding of the role of VO bonds and their reduction in enhancing catalytic activity.

4. **Quantitative Analysis of Bond Types**: DFT calculations have been employed to quantitatively assess the impact of different types of bonds (VO, VOV, VOZr) on the catalytic performance, specifically in terms of their contribution to CH activation and the energy barriers involved in the dehydrogenation process.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the catalytic activity of VOx-based catalysts. They enable the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中增强支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及优化催化剂的结构和组成，特别是聚焦于金属氧化物（VOx）与支撑材料之间的相互作用。这些包括：

1. **改善支撑材料**：将ZrO2用作支撑材料已被证明可以显著提高催化性能，与γ-Al2O3相比。这种改进归功于VOx与ZrO2之间的独特相互作用，它促进了VO键的减少，导致形成更多活性较低配位的V物种。

2. **优化键的减少**：ZrO2支持上VO键（包括VO、VOV和VOZr）的易于减少是关键。这归因于Zr的低电负性与Al相比，导致VOS键的电子密度更高，使其更容易被还原。这一过程导致形成活性更高的低配位V物种，它们在CH激活中表现出优越性能。

3. **理解结构-性能相关性**：通过原位拉曼光谱和XPS等技术对VOx在还原气氛下的结构进行详细分析，提供了关于催化剂结构如何影响其性能的见解。这有助于更好地理解VO键及其在增强催化活性中的作用。

4. **不同键类型的定量分析**：使用第一原理计算（DFT）来定量评估不同类型键（VO、VOV、VOZr）对催化性能的影响，特别是在CH激活和脱氢过程中涉及的能量壁垒方面的贡献。

这些进展通过提供关于控制VOx基催化剂活性的机制的更深层次理解，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。它们使开发更高效稳定的催化剂成为可能，适用于工业应用中的直接脱氢过程。
