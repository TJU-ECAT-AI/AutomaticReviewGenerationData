[1] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[2] "The support effect works in an entirely different way in the PDH process because not only active sites but also reaction mechanisms are distinct from those of the ODH process."
[3] "The facile reducing nature of VO bonds in the VZr catalyst can be interpreted by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared with Al, which causes the difference of the interaction between VOx and the support."
[4] "DFT calculations also confirm that low coordinated V species are more active in CH activation, which is consistent with the highest TOF and the lowest CH activation temperature for VZr observed in the catalytic performance and C3H8-TPSR tests."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the interaction between the metal oxide and the support, specifically focusing on the reduction of metal oxide bonds and the creation of low-coordinated metal sites. These advancements aim to improve the reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts by facilitating the formation of more active sites and altering the electron state of the active sites through the support. By leveraging the unique properties of the support materials, such as their electronegativity, researchers can tailor the catalytic performance for specific dehydrogenation processes, like propane dehydrogenation, leading to improved efficiency and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the structure of the active sites and their influence on catalytic performance, confirming that low coordinated metal species are more active in CH activation, thus enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

最近，为了增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，人们采取的策略集中在优化金属氧化物与支撑材料之间的相互作用，特别是降低金属氧化物键和形成低配位金属中心。这些进步旨在通过调整活性位点和活性位点的电子状态来提高催化剂的反应性和选择性，从而通过定制支撑材料的特性（如电负性）为特定的脱氢过程（例如丙烷脱氢）改进效率和稳定性。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提供了关于活性位点结构及其对催化性能影响的见解，证实了低配位金属物种在CH激活中更活跃，因此增强了催化剂的整体活性。
