The key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the interaction between the active metal oxide (VOx) and the support material. Specifically, the research highlights the importance of tailoring the support material to facilitate easier reduction of the VO bonds in VOx, which in turn generates more active, lower coordinated V species. This approach improves the catalytic performance by enhancing the activation of the reactants, such as CH bonds in propane dehydrogenation. The use of ZrO2 as a support material, as opposed to Al2O3, was found to significantly increase the turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst, leading to improved efficiency in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided a theoretical confirmation of the enhanced catalytic activity, showing that partially reduced catalysts with low coordinated V species have lower energy barriers for CH activation, contributing to their superior performance.

The research offers a new perspective on the structure-performance correlation in VOx-based catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation, providing insights into how support identity can significantly impact the reactivity and stability of the catalysts. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding the structural evolution of VOx under reducing atmospheres, as this knowledge can guide the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications.

在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及优化活性金属氧化物（VOx）与支撑材料之间的相互作用。具体来说，研究强调了调整支撑材料以促进VOx中VO键的更容易还原的重要性，这进而产生更多活性、低配位的V物种。这种方法通过增强反应物（如丙烷脱氢中的CH键）的活化，提高了催化剂的性能。发现使用ZrO2作为支持材料相比Al2O3显著增加了催化剂的周转频率（TOF），从而改善了非氧化性丙烷脱氢的效率。此外，密度泛函理论（DFT）计算为这一增强的催化活性提供了理论确认，显示部分还原的催化剂与低配位V物种具有更低的CH激活能垒，从而促进了其优越的性能。

这项研究为VOx基催化剂在非氧化性丙烷脱氢过程中的结构-性能相关性提供了一个新的视角，为了解如何支撑身份对催化剂的反应性和稳定性的影响提供了见解。研究还强调了理解VOx在还原气氛下结构演变的重要性，因为这种知识可以指导设计更高效稳定的催化剂用于工业应用。
