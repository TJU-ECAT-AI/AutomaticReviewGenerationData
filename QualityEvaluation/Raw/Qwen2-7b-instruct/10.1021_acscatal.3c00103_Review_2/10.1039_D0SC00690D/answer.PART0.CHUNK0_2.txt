[1] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[2] "In contrast, better reactivity and selectivity, especially excellent regeneration stability can be achieved when supported VOx catalysts are used in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process."
[3] "However, the support effect works in an entirely different way in the PDH process because not only active sites but also reaction mechanisms are distinct from those of the ODH process."
[4] "Previous studies found that the reactivity of PDH is dependent on the bond strength of VOS."
[5] "In addition, the support identity also influences the behavior of carbon deposition on VOx based catalysts, which inversely affects activity and on-stream stability."
[6] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[7] "Considering the dramatic performance achieved through the interaction between VOx and ZrO2, our work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve optimizing the interaction between the active metal species and the support material. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by focusing on the specific properties of the support that facilitate the reduction of metal bonds, leading to the formation of more active and stable metal species. The study highlights that in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, the reactivity is significantly influenced by the bond strength between the metal oxide (VOx) and the support material (ZrO2), as opposed to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. This interaction allows for the facile reduction of metal bonds, which in turn promotes the formation of lower coordinated metal species that exhibit better performance in PDH. The work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, demonstrating that the interaction between the metal oxide and the support plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic stability and activity.
