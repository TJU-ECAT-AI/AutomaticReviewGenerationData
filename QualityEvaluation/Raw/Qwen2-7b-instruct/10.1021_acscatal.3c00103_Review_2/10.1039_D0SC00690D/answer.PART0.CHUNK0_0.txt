[1] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."
[2] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."
[3] "The remarkable improvement of reactivity has not been reported in previous studies."
[4] "The facile reducing nature of VO bonds in the VZr catalyst can be interpreted by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared with Al, which causes the difference of the interaction between VOx and the support."
[5] "DFT calculations also confirm that low coordinated V species are more active in CH activation, which is consistent with the highest TOF and the lowest CH activation temperature for VZr observed in the catalytic performance and C3H8-TPSR tests."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include utilizing vanadium oxide supported on zirconia (ZrO2) over aluminum oxide (Al2O3) as a support material. This approach leverages the lower electronegativity of zirconia compared to aluminum, which facilitates easier reduction of vanadium-oxygen bonds, leading to the formation of lower coordinated vanadium species. These species are more active in CH activation, thereby improving the catalytic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the notion that low coordinated vanadium species are more active in CH activation, aligning with the observed high turnover frequency (TOF) and low CH activation temperature for the VZr catalyst. This strategy addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by offering a cost-effective and less toxic alternative to platinum-based and chromium oxide-based catalysts, while maintaining or surpassing their performance.

最近发展起来的增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括使用氧化钒在氧化锆（ZrO2）上的支持材料代替氧化铝（Al2O3）。这种方法利用了锆的电负性低于铝的特性，使得氧化钒键更容易被还原，从而形成较低配位的钒物种。这些物种在CH活化中更为活跃，进而提高了催化剂性能。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持了低配位的钒物种在CH激活中更为活跃的观点，这与观察到的VZr催化剂的高周转频率（TOF）和低CH激活温度相一致。这一策略通过提供一种成本效益高且毒性较低的替代品，同时保持或超越铂基和铬氧化物基催化剂的性能，解决了催化剂设计、制造和工业应用中的性能优化挑战。
