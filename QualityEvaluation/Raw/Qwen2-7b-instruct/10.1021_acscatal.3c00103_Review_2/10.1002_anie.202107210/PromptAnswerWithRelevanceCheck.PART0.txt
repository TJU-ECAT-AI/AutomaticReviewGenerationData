1. The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve modifying the geometric and electronic properties of intermetallic compounds. This is achieved through the double-decoration technique, where metals like lead (Pb) and calcium (Ca) are used to block the active sites (Pt3) and introduce electron-enriched sites (Pt1), respectively. This synergistic effect leads to a catalyst with high stability, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. Lead (Pb) is strategically placed on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, ensuring that the active sites remain available for the reaction. Meanwhile, calcium (Ca) is introduced around the nanoparticles to create electron-enriched Pt1 sites, which are highly selective and durable active sites for PDH.

3. The double modification of PtGa, by combining Pb and Ca, is proposed as a promising catalyst design concept for constructing an ultra-stable catalytic system in PDH. It is emphasized that the geometric and electronic effects must be compatible and not alter the parent PtGa intermetallic structure.

4. The geometric and electronic effects of Pb and Ca are considered to be compatible in the double decoration concept, ensuring that the catalyst remains stable even at high temperatures, such as 600°C, for prolonged periods.

5. The synergy between Pb and Ca significantly enhances the catalyst's stability, with the double-decorated PtGaCaPb catalyst showing a much longer mean lifetime (τ = 3067 hours) compared to the PtGaPb catalyst (τ = 149 hours). This indicates the potent stabilizing effect of the double-decoration strategy, particularly when using calcium.

6. The unique character of calcium as a modifier for PtGa intermetallics stands out, as it has been found to be the only additive that effectively improves both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Other basic additives and supports failed to match the positive effects of calcium.

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve strategic modifications that address key challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. This includes the utilization of alloying techniques to dilute potentially reactive Pt ensembles with less active metals, such as Sn, Ga, In, and Zn, to mitigate undesired side reactions. Another innovative approach is the development of a novel catalyst design concept called 'double decoration', where intermetallic compounds like PtGa are modified with two elements, Pb and Ca, in a manner that synergizes geometric and electronic effects without altering the parent PtGa structure. This unique strategy results in a catalyst that demonstrates exceptional stability, achieving unparalleled longevity of up to 1 month at high temperatures (600°C) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The Pb decoration blocks Pt3 sites, while Ca introduces electron-enriched Pt1 sites, thus optimizing the catalytic performance and stability.
