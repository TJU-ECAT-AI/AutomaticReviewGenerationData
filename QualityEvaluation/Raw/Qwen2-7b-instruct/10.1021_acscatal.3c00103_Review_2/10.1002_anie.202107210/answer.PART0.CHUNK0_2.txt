[1] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[2] "Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."
[3] "Moreover, since large PtPt ensembles are well-known activators of undesired side reactions, the dilution of such ensembles (also known as the ensemble effect) by alloying Pt with inactive metals such as Sn,4-6 Ga,7-9 In,10 and Zn11, 12 has been generally applied to prevent side reactions."
[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca."
[5] "This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."
[6] "Pb was deposited on the three-fold Pt (and Ga) sites of the PtGa nanoparticles, whereas Ca was placed around the nanoparticles to impart them with an electron-enriched Pt1 site (an active site for highly selective PDH)."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve strategic modifications that address key challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. This includes the utilization of alloying techniques to dilute potentially reactive Pt ensembles with less active metals, such as Sn, Ga, In, and Zn, to mitigate undesired side reactions. Another innovative approach is the development of a novel catalyst design concept called 'double decoration', where intermetallic compounds like PtGa are modified with two elements, Pb and Ca, in a manner that synergizes geometric and electronic effects without altering the parent PtGa structure. This unique strategy results in a catalyst that demonstrates exceptional stability, achieving unparalleled longevity of up to 1 month at high temperatures (600°C) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The Pb decoration blocks Pt3 sites, while Ca introduces electron-enriched Pt1 sites, thus optimizing the catalytic performance and stability.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发出了一些策略。这些策略旨在解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的关键挑战，并适用于工业应用。这包括使用合金化技术，通过与较不活跃的金属（如Sn、Ga、In和Zn）结合稀释可能引发副反应的大量Pt团簇，以减少副反应。另一种创新方法是开发一种称为“双重装饰”的新型催化剂设计概念，其中将互金属化合物（如PtGa）与两种元素Pb和Ca相结合，以协同几何和电子效应，而不改变母体PtGa结构。这种独特的方法产生了一种催化剂，它在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中表现出极高的稳定性，能够在高达600°C的温度下持续长达1个月。Pb修饰阻断了Pt3位点，而Ca则引入了电子富集的Pt1位点，从而优化了催化性能和稳定性。
