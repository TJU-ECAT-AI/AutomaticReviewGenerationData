[1] "The novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca, enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C."
[2] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[3] "The double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[4] "Crucially, the considered geometric and electronic effects for the double decoration concept should be compatible and not change the parent PtGa intermetallic structure."
[5] "The combination of Pb and Ca exerted a synergistic effect on the stability of the catalyst. The mean catalyst lifetime (reciprocal deactivation constant: kd1=τ=233h) of PtGaCaPb was much longer than that of PtGaPb (τ=149h), thus highlighting the further enhancement of the catalytic stability via the double decoration by CaPb, which afforded the electron-enriched Pt1."
[6] "No other basic additives and supports than Ca did not work as effective modifiers for PtGa intermetallics, highlighting the specific character of Ca for the double-decoration strategy."

1. The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve modifying the geometric and electronic properties of intermetallic compounds. This is achieved through the double-decoration technique, where metals like lead (Pb) and calcium (Ca) are used to block the active sites (Pt3) and introduce electron-enriched sites (Pt1), respectively. This synergistic effect leads to a catalyst with high stability, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. Lead (Pb) is strategically placed on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, ensuring that the active sites remain available for the reaction. Meanwhile, calcium (Ca) is introduced around the nanoparticles to create electron-enriched Pt1 sites, which are highly selective and durable active sites for PDH.

3. The double modification of PtGa, by combining Pb and Ca, is proposed as a promising catalyst design concept for constructing an ultra-stable catalytic system in PDH. It is emphasized that the geometric and electronic effects must be compatible and not alter the parent PtGa intermetallic structure.

4. The geometric and electronic effects of Pb and Ca are considered to be compatible in the double decoration concept, ensuring that the catalyst remains stable even at high temperatures, such as 600°C, for prolonged periods.

5. The synergy between Pb and Ca significantly enhances the catalyst's stability, with the double-decorated PtGaCaPb catalyst showing a much longer mean lifetime (τ = 3067 hours) compared to the PtGaPb catalyst (τ = 149 hours). This indicates the potent stabilizing effect of the double-decoration strategy, particularly when using calcium.

6. The unique character of calcium as a modifier for PtGa intermetallics stands out, as it has been found to be the only additive that effectively improves both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Other basic additives and supports failed to match the positive effects of calcium.

1. 最近，用于直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的策略和方法涉及修改互金属化合物的几何和电子特性。通过双装饰技术实现这一目标，其中铅（Pb）和钙（Ca）被用来阻塞活性位点（Pt3），并引入电子丰富的位点（Pt1），从而形成了一个具有高稳定性的催化剂，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中。

2. 铅（Pb）被战略性地放置在PtGa纳米颗粒的三个折点Pt3位点上以阻止它们，确保活性位点保持可用状态。同时，钙（Ca）被引入到纳米颗粒周围，以创造电子丰富的Pt1位点，这些位点对于PDH高度选择性和耐用。

3. 结合铅和钙的双修改是构建PDH超稳定催化系统的有希望的催化剂设计概念。强调了几何和电子效应必须兼容，并且不会改变母体PtGa互金属结构。

4. Pb和Ca的几何和电子效应在双装饰概念中被认为是兼容的，保证催化剂即使在高温（如600°C）下也能长时间保持稳定。

5. Pb和Ca之间的协同作用显著增强了催化剂的稳定性，双修饰的PtGaCaPb催化剂的平均寿命（τ = 3067小时）远超过PtGaPb催化剂（τ = 149小时）。这表明双装饰策略的强效稳定化效果，特别是当使用钙时。

6. 钙作为PtGa互金属的修饰剂的独特特征突出，因为它被发现是唯一能够有效改善催化剂活性和稳定性的添加剂。其他基本添加剂和支持失败了与钙相匹配的积极效果。
