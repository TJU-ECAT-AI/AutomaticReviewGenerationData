[1] "To achieve this milestone, an innovative catalyst design must be developed to completely inhibit the occurrences of undesired side reactions."
[2] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
[3] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[4] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH."
[5] "The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of double-decoration techniques. Specifically, researchers have applied the decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca. Pb is used to block the three-fold Pt3 sites, while Ca provides an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, enhancing the stability of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at high temperatures. The synergy of these geometric and electronic modifications significantly improves the catalytic stability, achieving month-long stability at 600°C, surpassing the performance of previously reported catalysts in this area.

最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已经开发出了一些关键策略和方法。这些策略主要涉及双重修饰技术的应用。研究人员采用对纳米颗粒状互金属PtGa进行铅(Pb)和钙(Ca)的双重修饰。铅用于封堵Pt3位点，而钙则提供了一个电子富集的单原子类Pt1活性位点，这在高温度下的丙烷脱氢（PDH）中提高了催化剂的稳定性。这些几何和电子效应的协同作用显著提高了催化剂的催化稳定性，实现了600°C下长达一个月的稳定运行，超过了之前报道的催化剂性能。
