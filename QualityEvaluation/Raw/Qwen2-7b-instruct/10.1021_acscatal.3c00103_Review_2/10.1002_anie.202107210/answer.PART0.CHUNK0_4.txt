[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene."
[2] "However, the Pt-based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at 600C by side reactions and coke formation."
[3] "A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature."
[4] "PtGaCaPb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1 month."
[5] "The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one."
[6] "Thus, materials possessing isolated Pt sites with high thermal stability should be utilized for continuous working at a high temperature (600C)."
[7] "Crucially, the considered geometric and electronic effects for the double decoration concept should be compatible and not change the parent PtGa intermetallic structure."
[8] "This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600C."
[9] "Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH."
[10] "Pb was deposited on the three-fold Pt (and Ga) sites of the PtGa nanoparticles, whereas Ca was placed around the nanoparticles to impart them with an electron-enriched Pt1 site (an active site for highly selective PDH)."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Utilizing a double-decoration technique involving the addition of multiple elements to the catalyst surface. This technique aims to optimize both the geometric and electronic properties of the catalyst.

2. Depositing lead (Pb) on the three-fold Pt (and gallium, Ga) sites of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles. This action blocks the Pt3 sites, preventing unwanted reactions.

3. Placing calcium (Ca) around the nanoparticles to introduce an electron-enriched Pt1 site, which acts as an active site for highly selective propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

4. Ensuring that the geometric and electronic effects are compatible and do not alter the parent PtGa intermetallic structure.

5. Synergistically enhancing the stability of the catalyst through the combined effects of Pb and Ca, resulting in a catalyst with outstanding stability at high temperatures (up to 600°C) and prolonged operational life.

6. Optimizing the catalyst design concept to maximize the stability of the catalytic system, particularly in alkane dehydrogenation processes.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by improving stability, reducing deactivation, and enabling efficient operation at high temperatures.

最近，为提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性所发展的一些关键策略和方法包括：

1. 使用双装饰技术，通过向催化剂表面添加多种元素来优化催化剂的几何和电子性质。

2. 在互金属PtGa纳米颗粒的三个折线Pt（以及镓，Ga）点上沉积铅（Pb）。这一行动阻止了Pt3点，防止了不必要的反应。

3. 将钙（Ca）放置在纳米颗粒周围，引入一个富电子的Pt1点，该点作为高度选择性丙烷脱氢（PDH）的活性位点。

4. 确保几何和电子效应兼容，并且不改变母体PtGa互金属结构。

5. 通过Pb和Ca的组合效果协同增强催化剂的稳定性，从而获得在高达600°C的高温下具有出色稳定性和长时间操作寿命的催化剂。

6. 优化催化剂设计概念以最大化催化系统的稳定性，特别是在烷烃脱氢过程中。

这些进步解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，通过提高稳定性、减少失活并使高效操作成为可能，在工业应用中实现高温度条件下的应用。
