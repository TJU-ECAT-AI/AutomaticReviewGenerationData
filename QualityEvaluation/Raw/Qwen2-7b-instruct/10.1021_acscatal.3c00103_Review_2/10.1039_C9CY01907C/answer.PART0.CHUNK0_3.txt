[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[2] "However, it failed to provide strong metalsupport interactions, leading to Pt sintering, thereby reducing the activity and regenerability."
[3] "Therefore, it is highly desirable to exploit a new support, which can be used for anchoring Sn within its framework and enhancing the metalsupport interaction, and thus, facilitating the dispersion of Pt species effectively."
[4] "Moreover, the acidity of beta zeolites could be easily adjusted through removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework."
[5] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[6] "For comparison, Pt species supported on the Sn-H-beta catalyst exhibit much lower catalytic performance for PDH and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta."
[7] "The confined Sn(iv) sites promote the high dispersion of Pt clusters and improve the catalyst stability by strong PtSn interactions."

1. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, including doping promoters like tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) into platinum (Pt). These additives can increase the electron density of Pt atoms, weaken the adsorption of product alkenes, and reduce coke deposition.

2. The use of Sn as a promoter often fails to provide strong interactions between the metal and the support, leading to sintering of the Pt clusters, which reduces both the activity and regenerability of the catalyst.

3. New supports are being sought to anchor Sn within their frameworks, thereby enhancing the metal-support interaction. This facilitates the effective dispersion of Pt species, potentially leading to improved stability and performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Zeolites, particularly beta zeolites, offer a means to adjust acidity by removing aluminum (Al) atoms from their framework, which can create opportunities for anchoring metal precursors and generating well-defined bimetallic systems.

5. The strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework leads to the dispersion of Pt species into ultra-small nanoclusters, which improves the stability of the catalyst.

6. Compared to Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta, those on Pt/Sn-Si-beta exhibit higher catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) with better selectivity and stability.

7. The confinement of Sn(iv) sites within the Si-beta framework promotes the dispersion of Pt clusters and enhances the stability of the catalyst by strengthening the PtSn interaction.

8. This research could provide guidance for designing and synthesizing stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high selectivity and stability, addressing challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.

1. 多种策略已被开发用于增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括将锡（Sn）、铟（In）、镓（Ga）、锰（Mn）、铜（Cu）和锌（Zn）等促进剂添加到铂（Pt）中。这些添加剂可以增加Pt原子的电子密度，减弱产物烯烃的吸附，并减少结焦沉积。

2. 使用Sn作为促进剂通常无法提供金属与载体之间的强大相互作用，导致Pt簇的烧结，从而降低催化剂的活性和再生性。

3. 正在寻求新的支持材料来锚定Sn在其框架内，从而增强金属-支持相互作用。这有助于有效分散Pt物种，可能提高脱氢反应的稳定性和性能。

4. 硅铝酸盐，尤其是硅贝塔型，通过从其框架中移除铝（Al）原子来调整酸性，为锚定金属前体和生成定义明确的双金属系统提供了机会。

5. Si-beta框架内Pt和Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用导致Pt物种分散成超小型纳米团簇，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。

6. 相比于在Sn-H-beta上支持的Pt物种，在Pt/Sn-Si-beta上的Pt物种在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的催化性能更高，选择性更好且稳定性更强。

7. Si-beta框架内被限制的Sn(iv)位点促进了Pt簇的分散并通过加强PtSn相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性。

8. 这项研究可能为设计和合成具有高选择性和稳定性的脱氢催化剂提供指导，以解决催化剂设计、制造和工业应用中性能优化的挑战。
