1. Several strategies have been developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. These include doping additional promoters like Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn to Pt, which can increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of product alkenes, thus reducing coke deposition. However, these promoters often fail to provide strong metal-support interactions, leading to Pt sintering and decreased activity and regenerability. A new support is sought that can anchor Sn within its framework, enhancing metal-support interactions and facilitating the dispersion of Pt species.

2. Zeolites, particularly beta zeolites, have been utilized as catalysts and supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface areas, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity. Beta zeolites feature three-dimensional structures with 12-ring channel systems, providing a shape-selective reaction space for PDH that promotes the diffusion of propene molecules, inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The acidity of beta zeolites can be adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, creating opportunities to anchor metal precursors.

3. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to exhibit good reactivity and stability for PDH due to its unique structure. This structure facilitates the dispersion of Pt clusters and improves the catalyst stability through strong interactions between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework. 

4. The high propene selectivity and catalytic stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst can be attributed to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework. This interaction likely prevents the conversion of propene into deep dehydrogenation products, reducing the formation of coke and improving the selectivity of propene in PDH.

1. 多种策略已被提出以增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性。这些策略包括向铂中掺杂额外的促进剂，如锡、铟、镓、锰、铜和锌等，这可以有效增加铂原子的电子密度并减弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少焦炭沉积。然而，这些促进剂往往无法提供强大的金属支撑相互作用，导致铂团聚，进而降低活性和再生能力。寻求一种新的支撑体，用于将锡锚定在其框架内并增强金属支撑相互作用，同时促进铂物种的有效分散，是至关重要的。

2. 硅铝酸盐，特别是贝塔硅铝酸盐，因其高比表面、明确的通道、良好的热稳定性和可调的酸性，在异质催化中被广泛用作催化剂和支持体。贝塔硅铝酸盐具有三维结构和12环通道系统，提供了PDH的形状选择性反应空间，促进了丙烯分子的扩散，抑制了副反应和焦炭形成。贝塔硅铝酸盐的酸性可以通过从硅铝酸盐框架中去除铝原子来调整，从而创造机会锚定金属前体，并通过引入其他金属与支持金属纳米粒子之间的相互作用来生成清晰的双金属体系。

3. Pt/Si-beta催化剂预计将在PDH中表现出良好的活性和稳定性，这是因为其独特的结构能够促进铂簇的分散并通过Pt和Si-beta框架内限制的Sn之间的强相互作用提高催化剂稳定性。

4. Pt/Si-beta催化剂的高丙烯选择性和催化稳定性可以归因于Pt和Si-beta框架内限制的Sn之间的强相互作用。这种相互作用可能阻止丙烯转化为深度脱氢产物，减少焦炭的形成并提高PDH过程中丙烯的选择性。
