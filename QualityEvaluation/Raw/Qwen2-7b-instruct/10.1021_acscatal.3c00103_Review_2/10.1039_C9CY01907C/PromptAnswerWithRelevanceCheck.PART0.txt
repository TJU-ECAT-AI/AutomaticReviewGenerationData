1. Several strategies have been developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. These include doping additional promoters like Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn to Pt, which can increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of product alkenes, thus reducing coke deposition. However, these promoters often fail to provide strong metal-support interactions, leading to Pt sintering and decreased activity and regenerability. A new support is sought that can anchor Sn within its framework, enhancing metal-support interactions and facilitating the dispersion of Pt species.

2. Zeolites, particularly beta zeolites, have been utilized as catalysts and supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface areas, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity. Beta zeolites feature three-dimensional structures with 12-ring channel systems, providing a shape-selective reaction space for PDH that promotes the diffusion of propene molecules, inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The acidity of beta zeolites can be adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, creating opportunities to anchor metal precursors.

3. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to exhibit good reactivity and stability for PDH due to its unique structure. This structure facilitates the dispersion of Pt clusters and improves the catalyst stability through strong interactions between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework. 

4. The high propene selectivity and catalytic stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst can be attributed to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework. This interaction likely prevents the conversion of propene into deep dehydrogenation products, reducing the formation of coke and improving the selectivity of propene in PDH.

1. 多种策略已被提出以增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性。这些策略包括向铂中掺杂额外的促进剂，如锡、铟、镓、锰、铜和锌等，这可以有效增加铂原子的电子密度并减弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少焦炭沉积。然而，这些促进剂往往无法提供强大的金属支撑相互作用，导致铂团聚，进而降低活性和再生能力。寻求一种新的支撑体，用于将锡锚定在其框架内并增强金属支撑相互作用，同时促进铂物种的有效分散，是至关重要的。

2. 硅铝酸盐，特别是贝塔硅铝酸盐，因其高比表面、明确的通道、良好的热稳定性和可调的酸性，在异质催化中被广泛用作催化剂和支持体。贝塔硅铝酸盐具有三维结构和12环通道系统，提供了PDH的形状选择性反应空间，促进了丙烯分子的扩散，抑制了副反应和焦炭形成。贝塔硅铝酸盐的酸性可以通过从硅铝酸盐框架中去除铝原子来调整，从而创造机会锚定金属前体，并通过引入其他金属与支持金属纳米粒子之间的相互作用来生成清晰的双金属体系。

3. Pt/Si-beta催化剂预计将在PDH中表现出良好的活性和稳定性，这是因为其独特的结构能够促进铂簇的分散并通过Pt和Si-beta框架内限制的Sn之间的强相互作用提高催化剂稳定性。

4. Pt/Si-beta催化剂的高丙烯选择性和催化稳定性可以归因于Pt和Si-beta框架内限制的Sn之间的强相互作用。这种相互作用可能阻止丙烯转化为深度脱氢产物，减少焦炭的形成并提高PDH过程中丙烯的选择性。

[2] "It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
[3] "However, most of the Sn species dispersed on the exterior surface of the support by these methods, where Sn(iv) species tend to be reduced to metallic Sn during the reaction process due to the low melting point of Sn species, leading to the loss of the catalytic activity and regenerability."
[4] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."
[5] "For comparison, Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta were also prepared, exhibiting much lower catalytic performance and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta for PDH."
[6] "These demonstrate that the highly dispersed Pt clusters on the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst could improve the catalytic performance, while the improved stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst might be ascribed to the interaction between Pt and Sn species confined in the Si-beta zeolite framework."
[7] "As shown in Fig. 6a, the initial propene formation rate for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is 1.9 times of that for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, at the same time, the propane conversion increases to 27.1% for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta compared with 14.0% for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta."

1.

These additives effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of product alkenes, thereby reducing coke deposition. Another strategy involves using materials with high pentacoordinate Al3+ ions in the support, which can stabilize PtSn clusters through strong interactions between metals and supports. However, it is crucial to anchor Sn species within the framework of the support to avoid their reduction to metallic Sn, which leads to loss of catalytic activity and regenerability. The BEA-type structure of zeolites offers a shape-selective reaction space that promotes the diffusion of propene molecules, inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. This structure allows for the adjustment of acidity through removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, creating opportunities to anchor metal precursors and generate well-defined bimetallic systems. The confinement of Sn species in the Si-beta framework facilitates the dispersion of Pt species and enhances the stability of the catalysts by strong PtSn interactions.

2. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show superior catalytic performance for PDH, with a high propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity greater than 99% at 550°C. This performance is significantly better than that of Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta, which exhibits lower catalytic activity and stability for PDH. The enhanced stability of Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts can be attributed to the strong interactions between Pt and Sn species confined in the Si-beta framework, which inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

1. 最近发展起来的增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括将Sn、In、Ga、Mn、Cu和Zn等添加剂添加到Pt中。这些添加剂能够有效增加Pt原子的电子密度，减弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少结焦沉积。另一种策略是使用含有大量五配位Al3+离子的支持材料，通过金属与支持材料之间的强相互作用来稳定PtSn簇。然而，锚定Sn物种在支持材料的框架内至关重要，以避免它们还原为金属Sn，这导致催化活性和再生能力的丧失。具有三维结构的BEA型沸石提供了一种选择性反应空间，促进了丙烯分子的扩散，抑制了副反应和结焦形成。这种结构允许通过从沸石框架中移除Al原子来调整酸度，从而创造机会来锚定金属前体并生成定义明确的双金属系统。Sn物种在Si-beta框架内的限定使Pt物种得到分散，并通过强PtSn相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性。

2. Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH过程中显示出优异的催化性能，初始丙烯生成速率高达2.3 mol g1Pt h1，丙烯选择性超过99%，在550°C时接近平衡转化率。这一性能远优于Sn-H-beta上支持的Pt物种，后者在PDH中的催化活性和稳定性明显较低。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂增强的稳定性可归因于Si-beta框架内限制的Pt和Sn物种之间的强相互作用，这抑制了结焦和Pt簇的聚集。
