          [1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, 812 In, 13,14 Ga, 7,15,16 Mn, 17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
          [2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
          [3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
          [4] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."
          [5] "The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework."

          1. Strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include doping additional promoters like tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) to platinum (Pt). These additives effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms, weaken the adsorption of product alkenes, and reduce coke deposition. The incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated beta zeolite (Si-beta) and the formation of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites in the Si-beta framework contribute to the stabilization of Pt clusters, inhibiting coke formation and sintering. The high propene selectivity and catalytic stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst can be attributed to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework.

          1. 提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略和方法包括向铂（Pt）中添加额外的促进剂，如锡（Sn）、铟（In）、镓（Ga）、锰（Mn）、铜（Cu）和锌（Zn）。这些添加剂能够有效增加Pt原子的电子密度，减弱产物烯烃的吸附，并减少结焦沉积。Sn物种被集成到去铝化贝塔沸石（Si-beta）的框架中，并且由于Si-beta框架内Pt和Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用，在Pt/Sn-Si-beta上形成了超小型纳米簇，这有助于稳定Pt簇，抑制结焦和烧结。Pt/Si-beta催化剂的高丙烯选择性和催化稳定性可归因于Si-beta框架内限制的Pt和Sn之间的强相互作用。

          [1] "However, it failed to provide strong metalsupport interactions, leading to Pt sintering, thereby reducing the activity and regenerability."
          [2] "Therefore, it is highly desirable to exploit a new support, which can be used for anchoring Sn within its framework and enhancing the metalsupport interaction, and thus, facilitating the dispersion of Pt species effectively."
          [3] "Moreover, the acidity of beta zeolites could be easily adjusted through removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework."
          [4] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."
          [5] "The confined Sn(iv) sites promote the high dispersion of Pt clusters and improve the catalyst stability by strong PtSn interactions."

          2. The use of Sn as a promoter often fails to provide strong interactions between the metal and the support, leading to Pt sintering, which reduces the activity and regenerability of the catalyst. To address this issue, it is highly desirable to develop new supports that can anchor Sn within their frameworks and enhance the metal-support interaction, thereby facilitating the effective dispersion of Pt species. Additionally, the acidity of beta zeolites can be easily adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, which creates opportunities to anchor metal precursors and generate well-defined bimetallic systems. The unique structure of the BEA-type zeolites enables a shape-selective reaction space for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), promoting the diffusion of propene molecules and inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The confined Sn(iv) sites within the Si-beta framework facilitate the dispersion of Pt clusters and enhance the stability of the catalyst through strong PtSn interactions.

          2. 使用Sn作为促进剂往往无法提供金属与支撑之间的强相互作用，导致Pt烧结，从而降低活性和再生能力。为了解决这个问题，开发新的支撑体以锚定Sn在其框架内并增强金属-支撑相互作用是极为必要的，从而促进Pt物种的有效分散。此外，通过从沸石框架中移除Al原子，可以轻松调整beta沸石的酸性，从而为锚定金属前体和生成定义明确的双金属系统提供机会。BEA型沸石的独特结构为丙烷脱氢（PDH）提供了形状选择性反应空间，促进丙烯分子的扩散并抑制副反应和结焦形成。Si-beta框架内的限制的Sn(iv)位点促进了Pt簇的分散并通过强PtSn相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性。
