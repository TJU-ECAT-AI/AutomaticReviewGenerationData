[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, 812 In, 13,14 Ga, 7,15,16 Mn, 17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[4] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."
[5] "The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework."

1. Strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include doping additional promoters such as tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) to platinum (Pt). These additives can increase the electron density of Pt atoms, weaken the adsorption of product alkene, and thus reduce coke deposition. 

2. Sn species that exist in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta zeolite (Si-beta).

3. Pt species are dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework.

4. Strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, maintaining the catalytic activity and stability of the dehydrogenation process after four cycles at 550 C.

5. The high propene selectivity and stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst can be explained by the strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework.

1. 提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略和方法包括向铂（Pt）中添加额外的促进剂，如锡（Sn）、铟（In）、镓（Ga）、锰（Mn）、铜（Cu）和锌（Zn）。这些添加剂可以增加Pt原子的电子密度，削弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少焦炭沉积。

2. 存在于四面体配合状态的Sn物种被集成到去铝化贝塔沸石（Si-beta）的框架中。

3. 由于Pt和Si-beta框架中Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用，Pt物种在Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂上以超小型纳米团簇的形式分散。

4. 强的PtSn相互作用和Si-beta框架中Sn的限制效应抑制了Pt簇的焦炭和烧结，保持了脱氢过程的催化活性和稳定性，在550 C下经过四个周期后。

5. Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂的高丙烯选择性和稳定性可以通过限制在Si-beta框架中固定的Pt和Sn之间的强相互作用来解释。
