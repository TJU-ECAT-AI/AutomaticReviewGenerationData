[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[2] "It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports."
[3] "However, most of the Sn species dispersed on the exterior surface of the support by these methods, where Sn(iv) species tend to be reduced to metallic Sn during the reaction process due to the low melting point of Sn species, leading to the loss of the catalytic activity and regenerability."
[4] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."
[5] "For comparison, Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta were also prepared, exhibiting much lower catalytic performance and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta for PDH."
[6] "These demonstrate that the highly dispersed Pt clusters on the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst could improve the catalytic performance, while the improved stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst might be ascribed to the interaction between Pt and Sn species confined in the Si-beta zeolite framework."
[7] "As shown in Fig. 6a, the initial propene formation rate for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is 1.9 times of that for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, at the same time, the propane conversion increases to 27.1% for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta compared with 14.0% for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta."

1. Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include doping additional promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn to Pt. These additives effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of product alkenes, thereby reducing coke deposition. Another strategy involves using materials with high pentacoordinate Al3+ ions in the support, which can stabilize PtSn clusters through strong interactions between metals and supports. However, it is crucial to anchor Sn species within the framework of the support to avoid their reduction to metallic Sn, which leads to loss of catalytic activity and regenerability. The BEA-type structure of zeolites offers a shape-selective reaction space that promotes the diffusion of propene molecules, inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. This structure allows for the adjustment of acidity through removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework, creating opportunities to anchor metal precursors and generate well-defined bimetallic systems. The confinement of Sn species in the Si-beta framework facilitates the dispersion of Pt species and enhances the stability of the catalysts by strong PtSn interactions.

2. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show superior catalytic performance for PDH, with a high propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 and a propene selectivity greater than 99% at 550°C. This performance is significantly better than that of Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta, which exhibits lower catalytic activity and stability for PDH. The enhanced stability of Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts can be attributed to the strong interactions between Pt and Sn species confined in the Si-beta framework, which inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

1. 最近发展起来的增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括将Sn、In、Ga、Mn、Cu和Zn等添加剂添加到Pt中。这些添加剂能够有效增加Pt原子的电子密度，减弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少结焦沉积。另一种策略是使用含有大量五配位Al3+离子的支持材料，通过金属与支持材料之间的强相互作用来稳定PtSn簇。然而，锚定Sn物种在支持材料的框架内至关重要，以避免它们还原为金属Sn，这导致催化活性和再生能力的丧失。具有三维结构的BEA型沸石提供了一种选择性反应空间，促进了丙烯分子的扩散，抑制了副反应和结焦形成。这种结构允许通过从沸石框架中移除Al原子来调整酸度，从而创造机会来锚定金属前体并生成定义明确的双金属系统。Sn物种在Si-beta框架内的限定使Pt物种得到分散，并通过强PtSn相互作用增强了催化剂的稳定性。

2. Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH过程中显示出优异的催化性能，初始丙烯生成速率高达2.3 mol g1Pt h1，丙烯选择性超过99%，在550°C时接近平衡转化率。这一性能远优于Sn-H-beta上支持的Pt物种，后者在PDH中的催化活性和稳定性明显较低。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂增强的稳定性可归因于Si-beta框架内限制的Pt和Sn物种之间的强相互作用，这抑制了结焦和Pt簇的聚集。
