[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, 812 In, 13,14 Ga, 7,15,16 Mn, 17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[2] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[3] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[4] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

1. Various strategies have been proposed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. These strategies involve doping additional promoters like tin (Sn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) into the platinum (Pt) catalyst. The aim is to increase the electron density of Pt atoms, weaken the adsorption of alkene products, and consequently reduce coke formation. 

2. Tetrahedrally coordinated Sn species were successfully incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta zeolite (Si-beta).

3. Ultra-small Pt nanoclusters were formed on the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst due to the strong interaction between Pt and confined Sn(IV) sites within the Si-beta framework.

4. The strong Pt-Sn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework prevent coke formation and Pt sintering, ensuring high stability in dehydrogenation and regeneration processes at 550 C for four cycles.

1. 多种策略被提议用于增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性。这些策略包括向铂（Pt）催化剂中添加额外的掺杂剂，如锡（Sn）、铟（In）、镓（Ga）、锰（Mn）、铜（Cu）和锌（Zn）。目标是增加Pt原子的电子密度，减弱产物烯烃的吸附，并从而减少焦炭的形成。

2. 四面体配合态Sn物种成功地被纳入去铝化β沸石（Si-beta）的框架中。

3. 由于Pt与Si-beta框架内受限的Sn(IV)位点之间的强烈相互作用，在Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂上形成了超小型Pt纳米簇。

4. Pt-Sn相互作用的强度和Si-beta框架内限制的Sn的作用防止了焦炭的形成和Pt团聚，确保了在550°C下进行四次循环时的高稳定性。
