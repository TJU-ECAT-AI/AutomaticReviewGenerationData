This study aimed to understand the catalytic activity and reactivity of supported metal catalysts by investigating the geometric and electronic structures of the catalytically active sites. It focused on platinum and platinum-tin (PtSn) nanoparticles, employing advanced spectroscopic techniques such as Pt L3 high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). The research highlighted that the addition of tin to platinum significantly affected the catalyst's performance, particularly in hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption properties. Specifically, the PtSn nanoparticles exhibited altered electronic structures, characterized by a narrower and shifted-down d band of platinum relative to the Fermi level compared to pure platinum nanoparticles. This alteration influenced the bonding characteristics, leading to changes in the adsorption properties for hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Notably, after the adsorption of carbon monoxide, the geometric structures of both systems became remarkably similar, indicating that strong adsorption of carbon monoxide could alter the particle geometry. Furthermore, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst showed notably lower values for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, highlighting the impact of the PtSn alloy on the catalytic performance.

本研究旨在通过分析催化活性位点的几何和电子结构来理解这些催化剂的活性和反应性。它专注于铂和铂锡（PtSn）纳米颗粒，利用高级光谱技术如铂L3高能分辨率荧光检测X射线吸收光谱（HERFD XAS）和共振激发X射线散射（RIXS）。研究指出，向铂中添加锡显著影响了催化剂的性能，尤其是在氢气和一氧化碳吸附性质方面。具体而言，PtSn纳米颗粒表现出改变的电子结构，铂的d带相对于费米能级更窄且向下移动与纯铂纳米颗粒相比。这种改变影响了键合特性，导致氢气和一氧化碳吸附性质的变化。值得注意的是，在一氧化碳吸附后，两个系统的几何结构变得非常相似，表明强一氧化碳吸附可以改变颗粒几何形状。此外，PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的氢气和一氧化碳吸附值明显低于Pt/Al2O3催化剂，凸显了PtSn合金对催化性能的影响。
