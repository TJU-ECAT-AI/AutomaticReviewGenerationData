This study focuses on the electronic structure of supported platinum and platinum-tin nanoparticles under hydrogen and carbon monoxide environments. The incorporation of tin into the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in their ability to adsorb both hydrogen and carbon monoxide due to the enrichment of tin on the surface. The Pt L3 high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) were utilized to investigate the electronic structure of these nanoparticles. The Pt d band of the platinum-tin particles was narrower and shifted down relative to the Fermi level in comparison to the pure platinum particles. The difference in electronic structure between the pure and alloyed particles persisted after adsorption of hydrogen. The PtH antibonding state was identified for the pure platinum particles. After adsorption of carbon monoxide, the geometric structure of the PtSn particles changed.

The recent strategies and approaches for enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve understanding and optimizing their structureactivity relationships. This includes developing methods to tailor the electronic and geometric configurations of the catalyst surfaces to better facilitate specific reactions. For instance, the identification of the PtH antibonding state in pure platinum particles highlights the importance of electronic structure in determining catalytic activity. Additionally, the observation that the geometric structures of the systems become similar after carbon monoxide adsorption suggests that modifying the catalyst's geometry can improve its stability and efficiency. Room temperature adsorption effects on the structure of platinum catalysts indicate the need for understanding how different adsorbates influence the catalyst's performance under practical conditions.

This study aimed to understand the catalytic activity and reactivity of supported metal catalysts by investigating the geometric and electronic structures of the catalytically active sites. It focused on platinum and platinum-tin (PtSn) nanoparticles, employing advanced spectroscopic techniques such as Pt L3 high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). The research highlighted that the addition of tin to platinum significantly affected the catalyst's performance, particularly in hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption properties. Specifically, the PtSn nanoparticles exhibited altered electronic structures, characterized by a narrower and shifted-down d band of platinum relative to the Fermi level compared to pure platinum nanoparticles. This alteration influenced the bonding characteristics, leading to changes in the adsorption properties for hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Notably, after the adsorption of carbon monoxide, the geometric structures of both systems became remarkably similar, indicating that strong adsorption of carbon monoxide could alter the particle geometry. Furthermore, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst showed notably lower values for hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, highlighting the impact of the PtSn alloy on the catalytic performance.

This study focuses on the development of methods to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts, particularly in direct dehydrogenation processes. The authors utilize advanced spectroscopic techniques like HERFD XAS and RIXS to investigate the structure of nanoscale platinum and platinum-tin particles. By analyzing the changes in the electronic and geometric structures of these particles before and after adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, they identify that alloying platinum with tin leads to a narrowing and downward shift of the platinum d-band relative to the Fermi level. This modification results in reduced adsorption capacity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the bimetallic system compared to the monometallic system. Furthermore, the study reveals that the electronic and geometric structures of platinum are significantly altered after hydrogen adsorption, whereas they exhibit a greater degree of similarity after carbon monoxide absorption. These findings suggest that the strong adsorption of carbon monoxide modifies the particle geometry and the distribution of platinum-tin elements.
