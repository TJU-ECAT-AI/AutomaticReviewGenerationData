1. The study investigates the electronic structure of supported platinum and platinum-tin nanoparticles under hydrogen and carbon monoxide environments using Pt L3 high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). 

2. The introduction of tin into the catalysts reduces their ability to adsorb both hydrogen and carbon monoxide, likely due to tin enrichment on the surface.

3. The study identifies the presence of the PtH antibonding state in pure platinum particles.

4. Upon carbon monoxide adsorption, the geometric structures of both the monometallic and bimetallic systems become similar.

5. Room temperature adsorption of carbon monoxide impacts the structure of platinum catalysts.
