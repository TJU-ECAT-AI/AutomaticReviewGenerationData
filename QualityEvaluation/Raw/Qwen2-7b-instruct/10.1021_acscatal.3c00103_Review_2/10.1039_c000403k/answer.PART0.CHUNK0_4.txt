This study focuses on the development of methods to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts, particularly in direct dehydrogenation processes. The authors utilize advanced spectroscopic techniques like HERFD XAS and RIXS to investigate the structure of nanoscale platinum and platinum-tin particles. By analyzing the changes in the electronic and geometric structures of these particles before and after adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, they identify that alloying platinum with tin leads to a narrowing and downward shift of the platinum d-band relative to the Fermi level. This modification results in reduced adsorption capacity for hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the bimetallic system compared to the monometallic system. Furthermore, the study reveals that the electronic and geometric structures of platinum are significantly altered after hydrogen adsorption, whereas they exhibit a greater degree of similarity after carbon monoxide absorption. These findings suggest that the strong adsorption of carbon monoxide modifies the particle geometry and the distribution of platinum-tin elements.

这项研究主要集中在提升支持型金属催化剂在直接脱氢过程中的催化稳定性方法的发展上。作者利用先进的光谱技术如高分辨荧光检测X射线吸收光谱（HERFD XAS）和共振激发X射线散射（RIXS）来研究纳米尺度铂和铂锡颗粒的结构。通过分析这些颗粒在吸附氢气和一氧化碳之前和之后的电子和几何结构变化，他们发现将铂与锡合金化导致铂d带的狭窄和向下移动相对于费米能级。这种修改导致双金属系统中氢和一氧化碳的吸附能力比单金属系统低。此外，研究揭示，在氢气吸附后，铂的电子和几何结构发生了显著改变，而在一氧化碳吸附后，它们显示出更大的相似性。这些发现表明，强一氧化碳吸附改变了颗粒几何形状和铂-锡元素分布。
