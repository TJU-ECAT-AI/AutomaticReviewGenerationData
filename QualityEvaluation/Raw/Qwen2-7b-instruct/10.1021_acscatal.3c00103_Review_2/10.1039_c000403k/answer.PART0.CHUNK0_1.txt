[1] "The structure of supported noble metal catalysts is essential for understanding their origin of activity and reactivity."
[2] "Many experimental and theoretical studies have shown a higher activity for the bimetallic alloys compared to monometallic materials due to electronic modification of the primary metal sites after alloying."
[3] "Adsorption of reactants is the first and one of the essential steps for any catalytic process."
[4] "The structure of monometallic and bimetallic systems changes significantly after adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide."
[5] "The adsorption of carbon monoxide resulted in a similar electronic and geometric structure of platinum for both samples."
[6] "These changes in the structure result in lower adsorption of hydrogen and carbon monoxide over the bimetallic system than the monometallic system."

This study focuses on the electronic structure of supported platinum and platinum-tin nanoparticles under hydrogen and carbon monoxide environments. The incorporation of tin into the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in their ability to adsorb both hydrogen and carbon monoxide due to the enrichment of tin on the surface. The Pt L3 high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) were utilized to investigate the electronic structure of these nanoparticles. The Pt d band of the platinum-tin particles was narrower and shifted down relative to the Fermi level in comparison to the pure platinum particles. The difference in electronic structure between the pure and alloyed particles persisted after adsorption of hydrogen. The PtH antibonding state was identified for the pure platinum particles. After adsorption of carbon monoxide, the geometric structure of the PtSn particles changed. The strong adsorption of carbon monoxide affected the structure of the platinum catalysts at room temperature.

本研究主要关注在氢气和一氧化碳环境下的支持型铂和铂-锡纳米颗粒的电子结构。向纳米颗粒中引入锡导致它们吸附氢气和一氧化碳的能力下降，这是由于表面锡的富集造成的。通过铂L3高能分辨率荧光检测X射线吸收光谱（HERFD XAS）和共振非弹性X射线散射（RIXS）技术，对这些纳米颗粒的电子结构进行了研究。与纯铂颗粒相比，铂-锡合金颗粒的Pt d带更窄且向下移动至费米能级以下。吸附氢气后，纯和合金颗粒之间的电子结构差异仍然存在。纯铂颗粒中可以识别到PtH的反键态。吸附一氧化碳后，PtSn颗粒的几何结构发生变化。一氧化碳的强烈吸附影响了铂催化剂的结构。
