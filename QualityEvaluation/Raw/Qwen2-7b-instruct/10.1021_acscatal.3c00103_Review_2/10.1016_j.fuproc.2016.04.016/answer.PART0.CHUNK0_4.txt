Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. At present, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the main technologies used for industrial production ethene and propene. With these technologies, ethene production rate is higher than that of propene. However, market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future [7] . Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes.

Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] .

Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.

In the autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.

The main objective of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach can be readily achieved using the oxidative dehydrogenation approach with a less complicated reactor design and process controls. However, the performances of oxidative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are not yet attractive for industrial operations.

Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts.

Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.

Insights from the homogeneous catalyst systems can provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. Also sMMO and pMMO enzymes have been known to activate CH bonds at very mild conditions. Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 have been implicated to contain sites that mimic the active sites of these enzymes.

Answer: The key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. **Utilizing Zeolites**: Incorporating zeolites can stabilize platinum nanoparticles, improving the stability of the catalyst and enhancing its activity through the rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework, which can boost the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.

2. **Autothermal Dehydrogenation**: Although still in the concept stage, autothermal dehydrogenation aims to reduce the external energy input needed for dehydrogenation, although it faces challenges due to the complexity of reactor design and process operations.

3. **Oxidative Dehydrogenation**: This approach offers a simpler reactor design and process controls, aiming to match the objectives of autothermal dehydrogenation but with current limitations in catalyst performance for industrial applications.

4. **VOx-Based Catalysts**: VOx-based catalysts are considered promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes, with the critical factor being the nature of the VOx phase to optimize performance.

5. **Electrophilic and Nucleophilic CH Activation**: Catalysts such as NiOLiCl/SZ, MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc., suggest a range of CH activation mechanisms, from electrophilic (Ni-center) to nucleophilic (chloride or fluoride centers), which can be tailored to enhance selectivity and efficiency.

6. **Homogeneous Catalyst Insights**: Drawing lessons from homogeneous catalysts, which activate CH bonds at mild conditions, can inspire new perspectives for developing more efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

7. **Enzyme Mimics**: Materials like Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5, which contain sites resembling those of sMMO and pMMO enzymes, offer potential for catalytic sites that mimic enzyme-like activity for CH bond activation.

These strategies and approaches address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on enhanced stability, simplified reactor designs, improved selectivity, and leveraging insights from both homogeneous catalysis and enzyme-like activities to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
