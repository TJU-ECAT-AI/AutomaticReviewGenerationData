Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.

The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.

The main objective of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach can be readily achieved using the oxidative dehydrogenation approach with a less complicated reactor design and process controls. However, the performances of oxidative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are not yet attractive for industrial operations. Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes.

Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts. Thus CH activation on heterogeneous catalysts can be a continuum from an electrophilic to ambiphilic to nucleophilic attack on the substrate, depending on the metal center and the surface oxygen species of ligands.

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes have focused on exploiting the unique properties of materials like zeolites. Zeolites can stabilize platinum nanoparticles, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst stability over multiple cycles. Additionally, the incorporation of a redox-active adatom within a zeolite framework can boost the CH activation activity via a Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism. This addresses the challenge of maintaining high activity and selectivity over time.

The autothermal dehydrogenation approach aims to reduce the energy input needed for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly over platinum-based catalysts. However, this approach is currently at an early stage and faces challenges related to reactor design and operational complexity. It's noted that the autothermal strategy might be more efficiently achieved through oxidative dehydrogenation, which uses less complex reactor configurations. 

Among the catalysts studied, vanadium oxide (VOx) systems have shown promise for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. VOx catalysts are considered more promising than alternatives in this context. The analysis of Ni-based catalysts, lithium-doped magnesium oxide, and halide-containing catalysts (such as MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3) has revealed diverse activation mechanisms, ranging from electrophilic to nucleophilic attacks on the substrate. These findings suggest a continuum of CH activation mechanisms that can be tailored based on the specific metal center and surface oxygen species.

These strategies and approaches address the challenges of catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on enhancing stability, improving selectivity, and simplifying reactor designs. The advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms of CH activation and the properties of various catalyst materials contribute to more efficient and industrially viable dehydrogenation processes.

近期，为了提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究人员采取了一系列策略和方法。例如，利用沸石等材料稳定铂纳米颗粒可以增强催化剂的稳定性，并通过在沸石框架中合理引入具有还原氧化活性的辅助原子来提升Lewis碱辅助去质子化机制下的CH激活活性。这有助于解决催化剂在多次循环中保持高活性和选择性的挑战。

自动热脱氢方法旨在减少非氧化性脱氢烷烃过程所需的外部能量输入，特别是针对铂基催化剂。然而，这种方法仍处于概念阶段，由于需要多个催化剂床、流体以及过程控制，使得反应器设计和操作过程更加复杂，从而不被工业界广泛采用。值得注意的是，自动热脱氢目标可能通过氧化脱氢方法更容易实现，该方法使用更简单的反应器配置和过程控制。

在探索的催化剂中，二氧化钒（VOx）系统在丙烷氧化脱氢方面显示出巨大潜力。VOx催化剂被认为比其他替代品在这一领域更具前景。对镍基催化剂、锂掺杂镁氧化物和含卤素催化剂（如MgDyLiCl、CeO2/2CeF3）的分析揭示了从亲电到亲核攻击的连续性CH激活机制，这取决于特定的金属中心和表面氧物种。这些发现表明，CH激活机制可以基于材料的具体性质进行调整，以适应不同的需求。

这些策略和方法通过增强稳定性、提高选择性和简化反应器设计来解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。对CH激活机制的理解加深以及各种催化剂材料属性的研究进展为更高效、更实用的脱氢过程提供了支持。

Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers. At present, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are the main technologies used for industrial production ethene and propene. With these technologies, ethene production rate is higher than that of propene. However, market projections indicate a continued rise in the demand for ethene and propene, and growth in demand for propylene derivatives may outpace that for ethylene derivatives in the near future [7] . Hence, there is a strong motive to develop technologies for direct conversion of lower alkanes to the corresponding lower alkenes.

Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics. The temperature required at one atmosphere pressure to obtain the same conversion decreases with alkane chain length and branching ( Fig. 2 ) [8] .

Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.

In the autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.

The main objective of the autothermal dehydrogenation approach can be readily achieved using the oxidative dehydrogenation approach with a less complicated reactor design and process controls. However, the performances of oxidative alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are not yet attractive for industrial operations.

Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts.

Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms. Electrophilic CH activation occurs over the electron-deficient Ni-center in the NiOLiCl/SZ catalyst, while nucleophilic CH activations occur through the [OX, where X = Cl, F] centers in Mg-Dy-Li-Cl and CeO2/2CeF3 catalysts.

Insights from the homogeneous catalyst systems can provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. Also sMMO and pMMO enzymes have been known to activate CH bonds at very mild conditions. Fe-ZSM-5 and Cu-ZSM-5 have been implicated to contain sites that mimic the active sites of these enzymes.
