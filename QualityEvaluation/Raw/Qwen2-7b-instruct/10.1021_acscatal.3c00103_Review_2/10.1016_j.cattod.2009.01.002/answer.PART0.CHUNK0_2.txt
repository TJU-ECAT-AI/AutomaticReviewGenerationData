[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "Despite extensive studies, the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive and therefore it has been a subject of debate for many years."
[3] "However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. The former reduces the selectivity to propylene and the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst."
[4] "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."
[5] "Based on these results, the following main conclusions can be drawn:"
[6] "• Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."
[7] "• The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles."
[8] "• Higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation on smaller Pt particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW) than on the larger (Pt-SBA-15-IW) are due to higher surface roughness of the former than that of the latter."
[9] "• Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."
[10] "• Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

1. Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve understanding the role of tin (Sn) on the dispersion of platinum (Pt) in SBA-15 catalysts. This includes gaining insights into the influence of Sn on the dehydrogenation of propane activity, selectivity to propylene, coking, and catalyst stability. The study aims to clarify the role of Sn in bimetallic catalysts.

2. The role of Sn in bimetallic catalysts is still debated due to its elusive nature, which has been a subject of discussion for many years.

3. Challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications involve issues related to the cracking of long-chain hydrocarbons and coke formation. These problems reduce the selectivity to propylene and cause the deactivation of the catalyst.

4. The study makes an attempt to shed light on the role of Sn in bimetallic catalysts.

5. Main conclusions drawn from the study are:
   - Sn enhances Pt dispersion through alloy formation, resulting in smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW compared to Pt-SBA-15-IW, as evidenced by TEM, XRD, and H2-chemisorption.
   - Surface roughness, or surface site heterogeneity, differs between particles, affecting the nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites.
   - Smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibit higher surface roughness compared to larger particles in Pt-SBA-15-IW, leading to higher propane conversion and coke formation.
   - Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles.
   - This results in a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking.

1. 最近，为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究人员致力于理解锡（Sn）在SBA-15催化剂中铂（Pt）分散度的影响。这包括深入了解Sn对丙烷脱氢活性、丙烯选择性、结焦和催化剂稳定性的影响。研究旨在澄清Sn在双金属催化剂中的作用。

2. Sn在双金属催化剂中的作用仍然存在争议，因为它的作用机制仍不明确，这是多年来讨论的话题。

3. 在催化剂设计、制造和工业应用性能优化过程中遇到的挑战包括长链烃裂解和结焦问题，这些问题降低了丙烯选择性和催化剂失活。

4. 研究试图阐明Sn在双金属催化剂中的作用。

5. 研究的主要结论是：
   - Sn通过合金形成增强了Pt分散度，导致在Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW中的Pt颗粒比在Pt-SBA-15-IW中的颗粒更小，通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）、X射线衍射（XRD）和氢吸附实验可以证明这一点。
   - 颗粒表面粗糙度或表面位点异质性不同，影响表面Pt位点的性质和活性。
   - 在Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW中的较小Pt颗粒具有比在Pt-SBA-15-IW中的较大颗粒更高的表面粗糙度，导致较高的丙烷转化率和结焦。
   - Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW由于Pt-Sn双金属颗粒表面上的烃吸附力较弱，显示出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的催化剂稳定性。
   - 这种效果导致一种排水效应，使活性位点保持清洁，免受结焦。
