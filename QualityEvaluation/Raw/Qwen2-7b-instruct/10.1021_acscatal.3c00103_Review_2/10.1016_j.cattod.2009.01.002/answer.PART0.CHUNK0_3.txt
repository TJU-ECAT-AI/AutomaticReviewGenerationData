[1] "Recently, we have shown that Pt particle size does not only influence the catalyst activity but also plays a crucial role in determining selectivity and catalyst stability."
[2] "Smaller Pt particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation than larger Pt particles however, the former are less selective and stable than the latter."
[3] "Additionally, it is also evident from the literature that the effect of Sn on the induced electronic properties of Pt depends on the Pt particle sizes, it being significant for smaller particles than larger ones."
[4] "Therefore, it was concluded that by preferential covering of these high energetic Pt sites by Sn reduces the catalytic cracking activity and hence increases the selectivity and catalyst stability."
[5] "However, despite higher amount of coke formation on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW, it still exhibits much higher selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability than its counter part Pt-SBA-15-IW, which cannot be explained by the effect of the size of Pt particles."
[6] "But these observations can be explained by a combination of electronic and drain-off effects rather than by the electronic effect alone."
[7] "In Pt-Sn-SBA-15, Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously."
[8] "Consequently, the degree of unsaturation in the coordination sphere of Pt sites decreases and interactions between Pt and Sn increase which modifies electronic properties and, thus, catalytic properties of Pt sites."
[9] "Interactions between Pt and Sn weaken the chemisorption properties of Pt sites, leading to weaker interactions between the Pt sites and hydrocarbons."
[10] "Accordingly, we assume weaker interactions between Pt sites and propane, this in turn has two implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favoured over CC and CH bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propylene and (ii) coke precursors such as (partly)dehydrogenated hydrocarbons can easily move on the surface of Pt-Sn particles and thus they migrate from active sites to the support before being completely converted into coke."
[11] "Therefore, bimetallic catalyst Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher selectivity to propylene and much better stability than its counter monometallic catalyst Pt-SBA-15-IW, albeit high amount of coke formation."
[12] "Such a low initial specific activity (in DHP) of Pt in Pt-Sn-SiO2 with that in Pt-SiO2 was also observed previously and attributed to the formation of alloy of PtSn and hence the modified electronic configuration of Pt sites."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve focusing on the dispersion and size of the active metal particles. The literature highlights that:

1. Sn can lead to higher dispersion of Pt by forming an alloy, which results in smaller Pt particles. This impacts the activity, selectivity, coking, and stability of the catalysts.
2. The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites differ due to variations in surface roughness among particles. This is influenced by the modification of electronic properties of Pt sites by Sn in bimetallic Pt-Sn alloy particles.
3. The higher propane conversion and coke formation on smaller Pt particles can be attributed to higher surface roughness. However, the effect of Sn on coke formation is not fully ruled out.
4. The selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability of Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW compared to Pt-SBA-15-IW is due to the weakening of interactions between Pt sites and hydrocarbons, which facilitates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking.
5. The initial specific activity of Pt in Pt-Sn-SiO2 is lower than in Pt-SiO2 due to the formation of a PtSn alloy with a modified electronic configuration of Pt sites.

These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by carefully controlling the size and dispersion of active metal particles, modifying their electronic properties, and enhancing their stability through strategic alloy formation and surface engineering.

近期，为提高直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，已开发的关键策略和方法主要集中在活性金属颗粒的分散性和大小。文献指出：

1.Sn可以导致Pt的更高分散，形成合金，从而产生更小的Pt颗粒。这影响了催化剂的活性、选择性、结焦和稳定性。
2.表面Pt位点的性质和活性特性因粒子表面粗糙度的变化而不同。这是由在双金属Pt-Sn合金颗粒中Pt位点的电子性质通过Sn的修改所影响的。
3.较小的Pt颗粒上的更高丙烷转化率和结焦，可归因于更高的表面粗糙度。然而，Sn对结焦的影响尚未完全排除。
4.Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW与Pt-SBA-15-IW相比，选择性更高的丙烯和更好的稳定性，是由于Pt位点与碳氢化合物之间的相互作用减弱，促进了将活性位点保持清洁并防止结焦的排水效果。
5.Pt-Sn-SiO2中Pt的初始特定活性低于Pt-SiO2，由于形成了PtSn合金，具有Pt位点的修改电子配置。

这些进展通过精确控制活性金属颗粒的大小和分散性、修改其电子性质以及通过战略合金形成和表面工程增强稳定性，解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战。
