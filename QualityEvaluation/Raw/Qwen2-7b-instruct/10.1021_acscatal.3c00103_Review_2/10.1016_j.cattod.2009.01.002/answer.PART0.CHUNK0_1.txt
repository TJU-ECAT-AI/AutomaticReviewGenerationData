• "The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles."
• "Additionally, catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."
• "Higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation on smaller Pt particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW) than on the larger (Pt-SBA-15-IW) are due to higher surface roughness of the former than that of the latter."
• "However, the promoting effect of Sn on coke formation is not completely ruled out."
• "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."
• "Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving the dispersion of metals, modifying the electronic properties of the metal sites, and controlling the surface roughness of the particles. These advancements address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by enabling higher selectivity to desired products, reducing coke formation, and maintaining high activity and stability over time. Specifically, the use of bimetallic alloys like Pt-Sn can lead to higher dispersion and formation of smaller metal particles, which in turn affects the surface properties and interactions with reactants. The promotion of a 'draining-off' effect by the presence of Sn in the Pt-Sn alloy helps in keeping the active sites clean from coke precursors, thus enhancing the catalyst's lifetime and efficiency in industrial dehydrogenation processes.

最近开发的关键策略和方法，用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的稳定性，包括改进金属的分散性、修改金属位点的电子性质以及控制粒子的表面粗糙度。这些进步解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化在工业应用中的挑战，通过提高所需产品的选择性、减少焦炭形成并保持高活性和稳定性。具体来说，使用如Pt-Sn这样的双金属合金可以导致更高的分散性和更小的金属颗粒形成，这反过来影响表面特性和与反应物的相互作用。Sn在Pt-Sn合金中的促进“排水”效应有助于保持活性位点远离焦炭前体，从而增强催化剂的使用寿命和工业脱氢过程的效率。
