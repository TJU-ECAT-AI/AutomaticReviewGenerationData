• "Despite extensive studies, the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive and therefore it has been a subject of debate for many years."
• "The catalysts activity, selectivity, coking and stability were simultaneously studied by tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) which is coupled to an on-line GC."
• "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formed is almost three times higher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than on its counterpart Pt-SBA-15-IW, albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
• "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."
• "In contrast, our recent studies on DHP over monometallic Pt catalysts are pointing towards the same conclusion."
• "Smaller Pt particles are more active for propane conversion and coke formation than larger Pt particles however, the former are less selective and stable than the latter."
• "Additionally, it is also evident from the literature that the effect of Sn on the induced electronic properties of Pt depends on the Pt particle sizes, it being significant for smaller particles than larger ones."
• "As such the electronic effect has been extensively discussed."
• "However, the possibility of the promoting effect of Sn on the formation of coke cannot be completely ruled out."
• "Therefore, it was concluded that by preferential covering of these high energetic Pt sites by Sn reduces the catalytic cracking activity and hence increases the selectivity and catalyst stability."
• "Additionally, it is also evident from the literature that the effect of Sn on the induced electronic properties of Pt depends on the Pt particle sizes, it being significant for smaller particles than larger ones."
• "Therefore, we propose the modified drain-off effect which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."
• "This in turn has two implications: (i) selective CH bond activation is favoured over CC and CH bond rupture, leading to high selectivity to propylene and (ii) coke precursors such as (partly)dehydrogenated hydrocarbons can easily move on the surface of Pt-Sn particles and thus they migrate from active sites to the support before being completely converted into coke."

To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, researchers have adopted several innovative strategies and approaches. These advancements primarily focus on improving catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. The key strategies include:

1. **Enhancing Dispersion**: By incorporating tin (Sn) into platinum (Pt)-supported catalysts, the dispersion of Pt particles can be improved, leading to smaller and more uniformly distributed Pt particles. This enhancement facilitates better contact between the catalyst and reactants, improving the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

2. **Particle Size Optimization**: The size of the Pt particles significantly impacts catalytic performance. Smaller particles tend to offer higher reactivity due to increased surface area, but they may also lead to decreased selectivity and stability. Optimizing particle size helps strike a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. **Electronic Property Modification**: The electronic properties of Pt sites can be altered by the presence of tin. This modification can reduce the strength of interactions between Pt and hydrocarbons, facilitating selective CH bond activation over CC and CH bond ruptures. This leads to higher selectivity in the production of desired products, such as propylene.

4. **Drain-Off Effect**: Researchers have proposed a modified drain-off effect, which combines electronic and drain-off effects. This mechanism suggests that tin (Sn) can act as a scavenger to keep active sites clean from coke by draining off coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, acting as a reservoir for coke deposits. This reduces coke formation and enhances catalyst stability.

5. **Stability and Selectivity Enhancement**: By improving the dispersion and modifying the electronic properties of Pt sites, catalysts can exhibit higher selectivity to propylene and superior stability. This is achieved through the controlled migration of coke precursors and the promotion of selective CH bond activation, which minimizes unwanted side reactions and ensures prolonged catalyst life.

6. **Integration of Modern Techniques**: Utilization of advanced characterization techniques, such as tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with online gas chromatography, enables simultaneous monitoring of activity, selectivity, coking, and catalyst stability. This integrated approach provides comprehensive insights into catalyst performance and facilitates the development of more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

These strategies collectively address the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications, aiming to enhance the efficiency and economic viability of dehydrogenation processes.

为了提高直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，研究人员采用了多种创新策略和方法。这些进步主要集中在改进催化剂设计、制造和工业应用的性能优化。关键策略包括：

1. **提高分散性**：通过在铂(Pt)-支持的催化剂中加入锡(Sn)，可以改善Pt颗粒的分散性，导致更小且分布均匀的Pt颗粒。这种增强使催化剂与反应物接触更加充分，提高了脱氢过程的效率。

2. **颗粒尺寸优化**：Pt颗粒的大小对催化性能有显著影响。较小的颗粒由于表面积增加，往往表现出更高的活性，但它们可能降低选择性和稳定性。优化颗粒尺寸有助于在活性、选择性和稳定性之间找到平衡。

3. **电子性质修改**：Sn的存在可以改变Pt位点的电子性质。这种修改可以降低Pt与碳氢化合物之间的相互作用强度，促进CH键的选择性激活而非CC和CH键断裂。这导致了更高选择性的产品生产，如丙烯。

4. **排水效应**：研究人员提出了结合电子和排水效应的修改排水效应机制。这一机制表明，Sn可以作为清除剂，将附近活性位点的焦化前体从活性位点排水到支持，作为焦化的储存库。这减少了焦化的形成并增强了催化剂稳定性。

5. **稳定性和选择性增强**：通过改善分散性和修改Pt位点的电子性质，催化剂可以表现出更高的丙烯选择性和优越的稳定性。这是通过控制焦化前体的迁移和促进选择性的CH键激活实现的，从而最小化不需要的副反应并确保催化剂寿命的延长。

6. **现代技术整合**：利用高级表征技术，如尖端元件振荡微天平（TEOM）结合在线气相色谱法，可以同时监控活性、选择性、结焦和催化剂稳定性。这种综合方法提供了催化剂性能的全面洞察，并促进了更有效脱氢过程的发展。

这些策略共同解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战，旨在提高脱氢过程的效率和经济可行性。
