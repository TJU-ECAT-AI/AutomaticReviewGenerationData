[1] "Having said that, DHP is a challenging reaction as it is equilibrium limited and highly endothermic thus high temperatures are usually required for reasonable propane conversion."
[2] "Despite extensive studies, the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elusive and therefore it has been a subject of debate for many years."
[3] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formed is almost three times higher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than on its counterpart Pt-SBA-15-IW, albeit the former exhibits considerably higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propylene and stability than the latter."
[4] "Therefore, in this study we have made an attempt to bring some clarity on the role of Sn."
[5] "Based on these results, the following main conclusions can be drawn:"

Key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving the dispersion of the active metal, modifying the electronic properties of the active sites, and controlling the particle size and surface roughness of the catalyst. These advancements aim to optimize the catalytic performance by addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications. The role of tin (Sn) in modifying the dispersion of platinum (Pt) and affecting the activity, selectivity, coking, and stability of Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts has been investigated. The results indicate that Sn leads to higher Pt dispersion by forming an alloy, resulting in smaller Pt particles. This affects the nature and activity properties of the surface Pt sites due to differences in surface roughness and modification of electronic properties by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles. Higher propane conversion and coke formation on smaller Pt particles than on larger ones are attributed to higher surface roughness of the former. Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles, creating a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking.

最近开发的关键策略和方法，以增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性，包括改进活性金属的分散性，修改活性位点的电子性质，以及控制催化剂的颗粒大小和表面粗糙度。这些进步旨在通过解决催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战来优化催化性能，以适应工业应用的需求。锡（Sn）在修改铂（Pt）的分散性和影响活性、选择性和稳定性方面的作用已被研究。结果表明，Sn导致更高的Pt分散性，并形成合金，导致更小的Pt颗粒。这影响了表面Pt位点的性质和活性，由于表面粗糙度的差异和Sn在双金属PtSn合金颗粒中的电子性质的修改。较小的Pt颗粒比较大颗粒具有更高的丙烷转化率和焦炭形成，归因于前者的更高表面粗糙度。Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW与Pt-SBA-15-IW相比，显示出更高的丙烯选择性和更好的催化剂稳定性，由于在Pt-Sn双金属颗粒表面Pt位点上吸附能力较弱的烃类分子，形成了一种从活性位点清除焦炭的排水效应，保持了活性位点的清洁。
