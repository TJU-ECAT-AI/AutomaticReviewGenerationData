1. Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the use of advanced materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets to disperse and stabilize metal clusters. This approach maintains the unique geometry and electronic state of the clusters, providing an ideal dehydrogenation center for the production of propylene. 

2. The advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications aim to minimize the usage of precious metals like platinum while maximizing catalytic activity. This is achieved by using materials that can effectively disperse and stabilize the active metal species, thereby enhancing their stability and efficiency.

3. The key to achieving high catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane lies in the unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters. This interaction promotes the stability and efficiency of the catalyst, leading to improved performance in the dehydrogenation process.
