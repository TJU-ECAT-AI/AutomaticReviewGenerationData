1. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets to disperse and stabilize metal clusters. These advancements aim to optimize catalyst design, fabrication, and performance by leveraging the unique properties of materials such as h-BN nanosheets, which offer abundant fault edges and strong bonding interactions with metals, thereby maintaining the desired geometry and electronic state of the active metal clusters. This approach allows for the efficient activation of reactants like propane, enabling high conversions and selectivities, even with minimal metal loading.

2. The advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications focus on minimizing the usage of precious metals like platinum while maximizing their catalytic activity. This is achieved through strategies such as creating metal clusters that are dispersed and stabilized by materials that offer unique interactions with the metal surfaces, ensuring that the active sites for reactions like dehydrogenation are maintained effectively. The use of h-BN nanosheets in this context demonstrates an effective method to promote the utilization efficiency of platinum in the dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in high specific activities of propylene formation and enhancing the overall catalytic performance.
