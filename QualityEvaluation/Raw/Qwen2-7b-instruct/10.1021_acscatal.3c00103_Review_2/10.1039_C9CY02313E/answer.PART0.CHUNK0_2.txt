[1] "In this study, we demonstrate that the h-BN nanosheet has excellent ability to disperse and stabilize Pt/Cu clusters. The abundant fault edges of the h-BN nanosheets and strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintain the unique geometry and electronic state of the Pt/Cu clusters, providing an ideal dehydrogenation center for propane to produce propylene."
[2] "This unique bonding interaction integrated with its influence on the structure of the Pt/Cu cluster should be the origin of the promotional effect in propane dehydrogenation of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst."
[3] "Through washing treatment, the initial conversion of propane and propylene selectivity basically recovered to the initial values over the fresh Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst, and the evolution of these catalytic indexes during the 6-hour dehydrogenation reaction was also similar to that of the fresh catalyst."

1. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve utilizing materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. These materials are capable of dispersing and stabilizing metal clusters, such as Pt/Cu, by maintaining the unique geometry and electronic state of the clusters. This ensures that the clusters serve as an ideal dehydrogenation center for propane to produce propylene.

2. The advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications address the challenges by integrating unique properties of materials like h-BN. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects on the h-BN nanosheets is a critical factor that contributes to the promotional effect in propane dehydrogenation, enhancing the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

3. After the dehydrogenation reaction, the spent catalyst undergoes a washing treatment to remove covering layers, primarily composed of BOx species. This treatment allows the catalyst to recover its initial conversion efficiency and propylene selectivity, demonstrating the catalyst's regenerability and prolonged operational life.
