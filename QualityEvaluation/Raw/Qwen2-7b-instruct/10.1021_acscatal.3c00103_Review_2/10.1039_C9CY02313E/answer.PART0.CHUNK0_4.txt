1. Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes often focus on optimizing the structure of the catalyst system. This includes minimizing the bulk phase of alloys to expose more active platinum surfaces, thereby improving catalytic efficiency. Tailoring the structure of the Pt/Cu catalytic system, as mentioned, allows for better dispersion and stabilization of platinum, leading to improved stability and activity.

2. The advancements in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization aim to reduce the usage of precious metals like platinum while maintaining or enhancing catalytic activity. This approach not only addresses the scarcity and high cost of platinum but also extends the applicability of these catalyst systems to other energy-related processes that require platinum catalysts. By minimizing platinum usage and maximizing activity, these novel catalyst systems offer a sustainable and efficient solution for industrial applications.
