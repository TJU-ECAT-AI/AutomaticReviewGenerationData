[1] "To quantitatively evaluate the platinum utilization efficiency in the dehydrogenation of propane, we normalized the catalytic activity of propylene formation using a specific content of platinum, i.e., moles of propylene formed per mole of platinum per second; the results are listed in Table 1 and S1."
[2] "This unique bonding interaction integrated with its influence on the structure of the Pt/Cu cluster should be the origin of the promotional effect in propane dehydrogenation of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst."
[3] "On the one hand, the induction of boric oxide can promote the dispersion of copper."
[4] "These covering layers most likely consisted of BOx species, which precipitated under the reaction conditions."

1. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve using materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets to disperse and stabilize Pt/Cu clusters. The focus is on maintaining the unique geometry and electronic state of the Pt/Cu clusters, which provides an ideal dehydrogenation center for propane to produce propylene. This approach addresses the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity.

2. The strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects in h-BN nanosheets maintains the unique geometry and electronic state of the Pt/Cu clusters, which is the origin of the promotional effect in propane dehydrogenation of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst.

3. Inducing boric oxide can play a role in enhancing the dispersion of copper, which contributes to the stability and efficiency of the catalyst.

4. The covering layers on the spent catalyst consist of BOx species, which precipitated under the reaction conditions, potentially affecting the catalytic activity.
