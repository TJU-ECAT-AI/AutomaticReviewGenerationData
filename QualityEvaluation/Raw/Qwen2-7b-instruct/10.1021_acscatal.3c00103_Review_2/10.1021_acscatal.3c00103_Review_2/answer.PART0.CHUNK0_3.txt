[1] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."
[2] "Promoters can greatly impact the catalytic behaviors in PDH catalysts, showing advantages in suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, stabilizing active compounds and so on."
[3] "Several metals (Sn, Ga, In, Zn, and Cu) were developed as effective promoters, as discussed above."
[4] "Introducing metal promoters into the Pt-based catalysts can adjust the geometric and electronic properties of Pt species, significantly improving the catalytic stability."
[5] "The presence of alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal promoters could increase the dispersion of the active phase and help immobilize the oxidative active sites by forming strong interactions."
[6] "A trace amount of Pt-modified ZnO supported on mesoporous Al2O3 catalyst was synthesized, in which the Pt acted as the promoter while Zn2+ species were identified as active sites."
[7] "With a mere 1000 ppm Pt addition, high catalytic activity and selectivity coupled with excellent durability were achieved due to the existence of bifunctional active phases."

1. Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the introduction of promoters. These promoters effectively regulate active compounds in Pt-based and metal oxide-based catalysts, offering benefits such as suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, and stabilizing active compounds.

2. The key approaches involve utilizing specific metals as promoters, such as Sn, Ga, In, Zn, and Cu, which can adjust the geometric and electronic properties of Pt species, thereby significantly improving catalytic stability.

3. Alkali metal and alkaline-earth metal promoters increase the dispersion of active phases and help immobilize oxidative active sites through strong interactions, enhancing the overall performance of catalysts.

4. Trace amounts of noble metals like Pt can modify metal oxides, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation performance. For instance, Pt-modified ZnO catalysts show improved activity, stability, and selectivity towards propylene.

5. The strategic use of metal promoters allows for the optimization of catalyst performance by fine-tuning the active site properties, promoting the desired reaction pathways, and preventing undesirable side reactions, ultimately leading to more efficient and stable catalytic systems.
