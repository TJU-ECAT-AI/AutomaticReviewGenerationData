To enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes, recent strategies have focused on the introduction of promoters. These promoters can effectively regulate the active compounds in both platinum (Pt)-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts, offering benefits such as suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, and stabilization of active compounds. Specific metals, including tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), have emerged as effective promoters. Promoting metal oxides, especially through the addition of other metal oxides or noble metals, has also proven advantageous. Subsurface regulation of metal alloys has been explored as a promising method to fine-tune adsorptive properties and boost catalytic performance. Supported metal oxide-based catalysts, such as cobalt oxide (CoOx), zinc oxide (ZnOx), vanadium oxide (VOx), and chromium oxide (CrOx), have been extensively studied for their role in dehydrogenation reactions. Introducing additional metal oxides to create mixed oxide compounds enhances dispersion and catalytic stability. Alkali and alkaline earth metal promoters can increase the dispersion of active phases and immobilize oxidative sites, while noble metals like platinum (Pt) can modify the coordination and electronic states of host metal oxide sites, leading to improved dehydrogenation performance.
