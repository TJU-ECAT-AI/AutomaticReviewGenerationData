The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the strategic use of promoters. These promoters effectively regulate the active compounds in both platinum (Pt)-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. They offer significant advantages in suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, and stabilizing active compounds. By introducing promoters into the catalysts, the geometric and electronic properties of the active components can be adjusted, leading to improved catalytic stability. Metal oxide promoters are commonly used alongside noble metals to stabilize active compounds and modify the valence of metal oxides, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. The selection of an effective metal oxide or noble metal based on the specific catalytic system is crucial for this design strategy.
