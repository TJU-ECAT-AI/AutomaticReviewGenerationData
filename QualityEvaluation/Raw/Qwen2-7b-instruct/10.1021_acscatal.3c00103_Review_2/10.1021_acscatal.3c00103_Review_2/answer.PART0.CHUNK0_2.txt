The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include the strategic introduction of metal promoters into both platinum (Pt)-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts. These promoters effectively regulate the active compounds, leading to advantages such as the suppression of side reactions, inhibition of coke deposition, and stabilization of active compounds. Specifically, introducing promoters like tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) into Pt-based catalysts can adjust the geometric and electronic properties of the Pt species, significantly improving the catalytic stability. Similarly, for metal oxide-based catalysts, the use of metal oxide promoters can enhance the dispersion of active species and adjust the valence of metal oxides, thereby improving the catalytic performance. The introduction of MgO as a stabilizer in ZnOx-based catalysts also helps control the reaction-induced loss of active Zn components, maintaining high catalytic activity over multiple reaction cycles. The use of noble metals like Pt in conjunction with metal oxides like ZnOx and GaOx can further improve the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene, demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies in addressing the challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications.
