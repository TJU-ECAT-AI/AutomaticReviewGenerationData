Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on the strategic introduction of promoters. These promoters effectively regulate active compounds in both platinum-based (Pt-based) catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts, offering advantages such as suppressing side reactions, inhibiting coke deposition, and stabilizing active compounds. Notably, the use of promoters has been shown to significantly improve the stability and performance of these catalysts.

For instance, the introduction of tin (Sn) and gallium (Ga) as promoters in Pt-based catalysts has led to notable enhancements in catalytic stability and selectivity towards propylene. Tin promotes the dispersion and anti-sintering ability of Pt sites, while gallium affects the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites. Moreover, multipromoter systems, incorporating multiple metals, have also been developed to further boost catalytic performance and stability.

In metal oxide-based catalysts, promoters like zinc oxide (ZnO) and chromium oxide (CrO) have been employed to stabilize active compounds and adjust their valence. The addition of metals such as magnesium oxide (MgO) acts as a stabilizer, controlling the reaction-induced loss of active components. Noble metals, including platinum (Pt), have also been used to modify metal oxides, enhancing their dehydrogenation performance.

These strategies involve the synthesis of novel catalyst compositions through coimpregnation, impregnation, and sequential wetness impregnation methods, leading to the development of advanced catalysts with superior stability and selectivity. The use of promoters allows for the fine-tuning of catalytic properties, enabling the design of more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

近期，在直接脱氢过程中的支持金属催化剂催化稳定性增强方面，重点是通过引入促进剂策略。这些促进剂有效地调节铂基（Pt基）催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂中的活性化合物，提供了抑制副反应、抑制焦炭沉积、稳定活性化合物等优势。值得注意的是，促进剂的应用已显示出显著提高这些催化剂稳定性和性能的能力。

例如，在铂基催化剂中引入锡（Sn）和镓（Ga）作为促进剂，导致催化稳定性和丙烯选择性显着增强。锡促进了Pt位点的分散和抗聚集能力，而镓影响了宿主金属氧化物位点的配位和电子状态。此外，多促进剂系统，结合多种金属，也被开发用于进一步提升催化性能和稳定性。

在金属氧化物基催化剂中，如锌氧化物（ZnO）和铬氧化物（CrO）的使用被用来稳定活性成分并调整其价态。镁氧化物（MgO）的添加作为一种稳定剂，控制了活性成分在反应过程中的损失。贵金属，如铂（Pt），也被用于修改金属氧化物，增强它们的脱氢性能。

这些策略涉及通过共浸渍、浸渍和连续湿浸渍方法合成新型催化剂组成，导致高级催化剂的发展，具有优越的稳定性和选择性。通过引入促进剂，可以精确调整催化特性，使设计更高效的耐久催化剂成为可能。
