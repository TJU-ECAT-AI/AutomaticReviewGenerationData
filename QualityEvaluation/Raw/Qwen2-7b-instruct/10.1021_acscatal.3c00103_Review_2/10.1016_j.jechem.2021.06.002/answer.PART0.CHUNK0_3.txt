The key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the stabilization of the metal particles on the support surface. Specifically, the use of Al3+penta sites in mesoporous Al2O3 supports has been found to significantly improve the stability and regenerability of Pt-based catalysts. These sites allow for strong anchoring of Pt atoms via the formation of Al-O-Pt bonds, preventing agglomeration of the Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. This leads to improved performance, as evidenced by higher propane conversion rates and propylene selectivities. Additionally, the ability to fully restore the catalytic performance through a simple calcination treatment addresses the challenge of deactivation due to coke formation, contributing to the overall efficiency and sustainability of the catalyst in industrial applications.

增强直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的关键策略和方法涉及在支撑表面上稳定金属颗粒。特别是，在介孔Al2O3支持材料中的Al3+penta位点已被发现显著提高了Pt基催化剂的稳定性与再生能力。这些位点允许通过形成Al-O-Pt键牢固锚定Pt原子，防止Pt-Sn2簇聚集成更大粒径的纳米粒子，在连续的脱氢-再生周期中。这导致了性能的改善，如更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。此外，通过简单的煅烧处理完全恢复催化性能的能力解决了由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活问题，从而为工业应用的整体效率和可持续性做出了贡献。
