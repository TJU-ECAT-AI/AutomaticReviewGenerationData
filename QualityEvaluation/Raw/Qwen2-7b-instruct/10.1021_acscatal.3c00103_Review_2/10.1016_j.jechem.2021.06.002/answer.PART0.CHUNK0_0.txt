[4] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."
[6] "Pt-Sn clusters anchored on the Al3+penta sites of mesoporous Al2O3 show high sinter-resistance and regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving the structure of the support material and anchoring mechanisms. Specifically, the incorporation of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate aluminum (Al3+penta) sites in the support, such as mesoporous alumina, plays a crucial role. These sites can strongly anchor platinum (Pt) and tin (Sn) clusters via the formation of Al-O-Pt bonds, stabilizing the particle structure and preventing sintering during dehydrogenation reactions. This leads to enhanced sinter-resistance and regenerability of the catalyst. Additionally, the regeneration process through simple calcination treatments helps in restoring the catalytic performance, addressing the challenge of deactivation due to coke formation. These advancements improve catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by ensuring more stable and reusable catalysts.

在直接脱氢过程中提高支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性的一些关键策略和方法涉及改进支撑材料的结构以及锚定机制。具体来说，在支撑材料中引入协同饱和五配位铝（Al3+penta）位点，如介孔氧化铝，发挥着至关重要的作用。这些位点可以通过形成Al-O-Pt键强烈地锚定铂（Pt）和锡（Sn）簇，稳定颗粒结构并防止在脱氢反应期间发生聚集。这导致了催化剂的高耐聚集性和可再生性。此外，通过简单的煅烧处理进行的再生过程有助于恢复催化剂的催化性能，解决了由于焦炭形成导致的活性降低问题。这些进展改善了催化剂的设计、制造和工业应用中的性能优化，确保了更稳定的可重复使用的催化剂。
