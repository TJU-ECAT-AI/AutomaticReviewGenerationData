1. The key strategies involve fabricating highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with varying levels of Al3+penta sites to anchor Pt-Sn2 clusters, ensuring enhanced stability and regenerability of the catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation process.
2. The stability and regenerability of the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 catalyst are significantly influenced by the content of Al3+penta sites within the Al2O3 structure, with higher levels of Al3+penta sites preventing the aggregation of Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger Pt nanoparticles during consecutive cycles.
3. By optimizing the content of Al3+penta sites, the catalyst demonstrates superior performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a 40% conversion rate and a propylene selectivity above 98% at 570°C with a 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed.
4. The catalyst's performance can be fully restored through a simple calcination treatment after dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, indicating effective sinter-resistance and regenerability.

1. 关键策略包括制备具有不同Al3+penta位点含量的有序介孔Al2O3支持材料，以锚定Pt-Sn2簇，确保催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的增强稳定性和再生性。
2. Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3催化剂的稳定性和再生性显著依赖于Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量，较高的Al3+penta位点含量能有效防止Pt-Sn2簇聚集成较大的Pt纳米颗粒，在连续脱氢-再生循环中。
3. 通过优化Al3+penta位点的含量，催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出优越性能，实现40%的转化率和98%以上的丙烯选择性，在570°C下使用10 vol%C3H8和10 vol%H2进料。
4. 在脱氢-再生循环后，通过简单的煅烧处理可以完全恢复催化剂的性能，表明其具有有效的结焦抵抗性和再生性。
