The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve improving the structure of the support material and anchoring mechanisms. Specifically, the incorporation of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate aluminum (Al3+penta) sites in the support, such as mesoporous alumina, plays a crucial role. These sites can strongly anchor platinum (Pt) and tin (Sn) clusters via the formation of Al-O-Pt bonds, stabilizing the particle structure and preventing sintering during dehydrogenation reactions. This leads to enhanced sinter-resistance and regenerability of the catalyst. Additionally, the regeneration process through simple calcination treatments helps in restoring the catalytic performance, addressing the challenge of deactivation due to coke formation. These advancements improve catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by ensuring more stable and reusable catalysts.
