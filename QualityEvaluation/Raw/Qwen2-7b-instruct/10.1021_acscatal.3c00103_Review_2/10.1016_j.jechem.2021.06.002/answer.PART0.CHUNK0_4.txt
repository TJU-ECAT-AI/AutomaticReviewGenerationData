[1] "Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."
[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."
[3] "A high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."
[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

1. The key strategies and approaches that have been recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes involve the use of specific support materials that can stabilize the metal particles. In this study, Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites were fabricated. These sites serve as anchoring points for Pt-Sn2 clusters, preventing their sintering and aggregation under harsh conditions.

2. The approach taken to fabricate the Al2O3 supports with varying levels of Al3+penta sites allows for the stabilization of Pt-based particles through the formation of Al-O-Pt bonds. This results in enhanced stability and regenerability of the catalyst, particularly when dealing with consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

3. The presence of a high level of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure is crucial for preventing the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger Pt nanoparticles. This prevents the loss of catalytic activity that often occurs due to particle growth and aggregation.

4. The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst, which has the highest level of Al3+penta sites (50.8%), demonstrates superior performance in propane dehydrogenation. It achieves a propane conversion rate of 40% and maintains a high propylene selectivity above 98% at a temperature of 570°C, using a feed mixture of 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2. This catalyst shows remarkable stability and regenerability, even after multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

5. The slow deactivation observed in this catalyst is attributed to the formation of coke, which is a common issue in dehydrogenation processes. However, the catalytic performance can be fully restored through a simple calcination treatment, indicating the regenerability of the catalyst.

1. 最近发展起来的增强直接脱氢过程中支持型金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括使用特定支撑材料来稳定金属颗粒。在这项研究中，制备了含有不同水平Al3+penta位点的Al2O3支撑材料。这些位点作为Pt-Sn2簇的锚定点，防止在恶劣条件下Pt颗粒的聚集。

2. 制备Al2O3支撑材料的方法，通过不同的Al3+penta位点水平，允许通过形成Al-O-Pt键来稳定Pt基颗粒。这导致催化剂的增强稳定性和再生能力，特别是在连续脱氢再生周期中。

3. Al2O3结构中高水平的Al3+penta位点对于防止Pt-Sn2簇聚集成为更大的Pt纳米颗粒至关重要。这防止了由于颗粒增长和聚集导致的催化活性损失。

4. 具有最高Al3+penta位点水平（50.8%）的Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优越性能。它实现了40%的丙烷转化率，并保持了高于98%的丙烯选择性，在570°C的温度下，使用10 vol% C3H8和10 vol% H2的混合物。这种催化剂即使在多次脱氢再生循环后也能显示出卓越的稳定性和可再生性。

5. 观察到的催化剂缓慢失活归因于焦炭的形成，这是脱氢过程中常见的问题。然而，通过简单的煅烧处理可以完全恢复催化性能，表明催化剂的可再生性。
