[1] "Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 based catalysts are found to be more efficient than others in this reaction [39]."
[2] "HZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
[3] "The activity of the HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreased sharply with the increase of Si/Al ratio of the support, which is in agreement with NH3-TPD results."
[4] "As a consequence, the initial propylene yield has the sequence of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) > Ga2O3/HZSM-48(160) > Ga2O3/HZSM-48(220)."
[5] "However, the selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."
[6] "The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions."
[7] "The initial propane conversion increases a little after the introduction of CO2, while the initial propene yield decreases because of the reduction of propene selectivity."
[8] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5, especially at low propane conversion, due to its weaker acidity."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit distinct reactivity and selectivity profiles, primarily influenced by their acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites. For instance, the acidic nature of Ga2O3 facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the basic sites can promote unwanted side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its unique Lewis acid sites, demonstrates enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, leading to improved propene yields and selectivity compared to other polymorphs. However, its stability is compromised due to its unidimensional pore structure, which facilitates coke deposition, hindering long-term catalytic performance.

The acidity and basicity of Ga2O3 polymorphs play a crucial role in determining their catalytic behavior. Specifically, the acidity affects the dehydrogenation of propane, while the basicity influences the selectivity towards propene, often leading to side reactions if not controlled properly. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, despite its enhanced activity, shows reduced stability due to its weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure, which are conducive to coke deposition. This results in a trade-off between initial activity and long-term stability.

The introduction of CO2 to the reaction environment has a dual effect on the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs. It slightly increases the initial propane conversion, but simultaneously reduces the initial propene yield due to a decrease in propene selectivity. This outcome suggests that CO2 can mitigate the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, thereby improving the stability of the catalysts. However, the extent of this improvement varies across different Ga2O3 polymorphs, with some exhibiting better resistance to coke formation than others.

In summary, the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its enhanced activity and ability to control coke formation, stands out among the various Ga2O3 polymorphs. However, its stability remains a challenge due to its unidimensional pore structure and weak acid sites. The addition of CO2 to the reaction environment can improve the stability of these catalysts by facilitating coke removal and promoting propylene desorption, but the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the specific Ga2O3 polymorph used.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-, β-, γ-, δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸中心对其CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生了影响。这些晶型在酸性、碱性和Lewis酸中心方面的差异导致了它们在反应过程中的活性和选择性的不同。例如，Ga2O3的酸性促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，而碱性位点则可能促进一些不希望的副反应，如聚合、环化和芳香化。β-Ga2O3晶型由于其独特的Lewis酸中心，在CO2存在下显示出增强的活性，从而导致与其它晶型相比更高的丙烯产率和选择性。然而，它的稳定性受到损害，因为其一维孔结构更容易被焦炭沉积堵塞，影响长期催化性能。

Ga2O3晶型的酸性和碱性对催化行为起着关键作用。具体而言，酸性影响丙烷的脱氢反应，而碱性影响丙烯的选择性，通常会导致如果控制不当就会发生副反应。β-Ga2O3晶型，尽管其活性较高，但由于其弱酸位点和一维孔结构，其稳定性较差，易于焦炭沉积，从而影响长期稳定性。

CO2的引入对Ga2O3晶型的催化性能产生双重影响。它稍微增加了初始丙烷转化率，但同时减少了初始丙烯产率，因为丙烯选择性降低。这一结果表明，CO2可以促进催化剂表面焦炭的去除，从而改善催化剂的稳定性。但是，这种改进的程度因不同的Ga2O3晶型而异，一些晶型比其他晶型更能抵抗焦炭形成。

综上所述，Ga2O3晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸中心的影响。β-Ga2O3晶型以其增强的活性和控制焦炭形成的潜力，在各种Ga2O3晶型中脱颖而出。然而，其稳定性仍然是一个挑战，因为它的一维孔结构和弱酸位点。向反应环境中加入CO2可以改善这些催化剂的稳定性，通过促进焦炭去除和丙烯脱附，但这种策略的有效性取决于所使用的特定Ga2O3晶型。
