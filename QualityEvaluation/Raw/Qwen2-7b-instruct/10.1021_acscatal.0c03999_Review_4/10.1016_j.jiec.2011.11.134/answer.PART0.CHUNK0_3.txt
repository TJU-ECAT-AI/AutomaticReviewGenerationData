2. The activity of the HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreased sharply with the increase of Si/Al ratio of the support, which is in agreement with NH3-TPD results. The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much lower than that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, which also indicates the weaker acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts.
3. The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller.
4. Both catalysts deactivate during the reaction, but the deactivation rates are quite different. Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200) deactivates slowly and the propane conversion and the propene yield remain stable after 50 h. While for Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130), the reduction in the propane conversion and the propene yield is very small during the first 10 h, and then becomes more abruptly afterwards.

The acidity and surface properties of the catalysts play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the dehydrogenation of propane. As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-48 support increases, the acidity of the catalyst decreases, leading to a reduction in activity. However, the selectivity towards propene increases at lower propane conversions. This is attributed to the suppression of side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization due to the weaker acidity of the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts. During the reaction, the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts exhibit lower stability compared to Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts, which can be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The addition of CO2 to the reaction improves the stability of the catalysts by eliminating coke through the Boudouard reaction and promoting the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface.

酸性和表面性质对丙烷脱氢反应催化剂的性能至关重要。随着HZSM-48支持物中Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的酸性降低，导致活性下降。然而，在较低的丙烷转化率下，丙烯的选择性增加。这归因于由于Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的弱酸性抑制了副反应，如聚合、环化和芳构化。在反应过程中，Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的稳定性低于Ga2O3/HZSM-5催化剂，这可能归因于它们丰富的弱酸位点和一维孔结构。向反应中添加CO2可以改善催化剂的稳定性，通过Boudouard反应消除焦炭，并促进丙烯从催化剂表面的脱附。
