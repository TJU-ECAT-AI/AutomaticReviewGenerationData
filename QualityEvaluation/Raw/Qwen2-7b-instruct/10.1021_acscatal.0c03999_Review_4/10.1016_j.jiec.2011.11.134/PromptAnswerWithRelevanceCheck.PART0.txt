[1] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."
[2] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
[3] "Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures."
[4] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."
[5] "Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, which reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising too much on initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-, β-, γ-, δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位点，对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生显著影响。α-, β-, γ-, δ-Ga2O3晶型由于其晶体结构的不同，导致Lewis酸位点分布和可接近性的差异，从而影响反应活性。更高的酸性和碱性倾向于增强Ga2O3晶型的初始活性，加快反应速率。然而，这种增加的活性可能导致更多的焦炭形成，进而使催化剂失活。丙烯选择性受到酸性和碱性平衡的影响，更酸性的支持物有利于丙烯生成，但可能因焦炭形成而缩短催化剂寿命。HZSM-48支持的Ga2O3催化剂相对于HZSM-5支持的催化剂具有较高的丙烯选择性，这是由于前者较弱的酸强度，减少了不希望的副反应如芳构化，从而提高了丙烯选择性而不牺牲太多的初始活性。这些催化剂的稳定性也受到孔结构的影响；具有单向孔结构的催化剂的稳定性较低，因为更容易出现焦炭沉积于表面。

[1] "Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 based catalysts are found to be more efficient than others in this reaction [39]."
[2] "HZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit distinct reactivity and selectivity profiles, primarily influenced by their acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites. For instance, the acidic nature of Ga2O3 facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the basic sites can promote unwanted side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its unique Lewis acid sites, demonstrates enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, leading to improved propene yields and selectivity compared to other polymorphs. However, its stability is compromised due to its unidimensional pore structure, which facilitates coke deposition, hindering long-term catalytic performance.

The acidity and basicity of Ga2O3 polymorphs play a crucial role in determining their catalytic behavior. Specifically, the acidity affects the dehydrogenation of propane, while the basicity influences the selectivity towards propene, often leading to side reactions if not controlled properly. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, despite its enhanced activity, shows reduced stability due to its weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure, which are conducive to coke deposition. This results in a trade-off between initial activity and long-term stability.

The introduction of CO2 to the reaction environment has a dual effect on the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs. It slightly increases the initial propane conversion, but simultaneously reduces the initial propene yield due to a decrease in propene selectivity. This outcome suggests that CO2 can mitigate the formation of coke on the catalyst surface, thereby improving the stability of the catalysts. However, the extent of this improvement varies across different Ga2O3 polymorphs, with some exhibiting better resistance to coke formation than others.

In summary, the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is significantly influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its enhanced activity and ability to control coke formation, stands out among the various Ga2O3 polymorphs. However, its stability remains a challenge due to its unidimensional pore structure and weak acid sites. The addition of CO2 to the reaction environment can improve the stability of these catalysts by facilitating coke removal and promoting propylene desorption, but the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the specific Ga2O3 polymorph used.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-, β-, γ-, δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸中心对其CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生了影响。这些晶型在酸性、碱性和Lewis酸中心方面的差异导致了它们在反应过程中的活性和选择性的不同。例如，Ga2O3的酸性促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，而碱性位点则可能促进一些不希望的副反应，如聚合、环化和芳香化。β-Ga2O3晶型由于其独特的Lewis酸中心，在CO2存在下显示出增强的活性，从而导致与其它晶型相比更高的丙烯产率和选择性。然而，它的稳定性受到损害，因为其一维孔结构更容易被焦炭沉积堵塞，影响长期催化性能。

Ga2O3晶型的酸性和碱性对催化行为起着关键作用。具体而言，酸性影响丙烷的脱氢反应，而碱性影响丙烯的选择性，通常会导致如果控制不当就会发生副反应。β-Ga2O3晶型，尽管其活性较高，但由于其弱酸位点和一维孔结构，其稳定性较差，易于焦炭沉积，从而影响长期稳定性。

CO2的引入对Ga2O3晶型的催化性能产生双重影响。它稍微增加了初始丙烷转化率，但同时减少了初始丙烯产率，因为丙烯选择性降低。这一结果表明，CO2可以促进催化剂表面焦炭的去除，从而改善催化剂的稳定性。但是，这种改进的程度因不同的Ga2O3晶型而异，一些晶型比其他晶型更能抵抗焦炭形成。

综上所述，Ga2O3晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸中心的影响。β-Ga2O3晶型以其增强的活性和控制焦炭形成的潜力，在各种Ga2O3晶型中脱颖而出。然而，其稳定性仍然是一个挑战，因为它的一维孔结构和弱酸位点。向反应环境中加入CO2可以改善这些催化剂的稳定性，通过促进焦炭去除和丙烯脱附，但这种策略的有效性取决于所使用的特定Ga2O3晶型。

2. The activity of the HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreased sharply with the increase of Si/Al ratio of the support, which is in agreement with NH3-TPD results. The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is much lower than that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, which also indicates the weaker acid strength of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts.
3. The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller.
4. Both catalysts deactivate during the reaction, but the deactivation rates are quite different. Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200) deactivates slowly and the propane conversion and the propene yield remain stable after 50 h. While for Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130), the reduction in the propane conversion and the propene yield is very small during the first 10 h, and then becomes more abruptly afterwards.

The acidity and surface properties of the catalysts play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the dehydrogenation of propane. As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-48 support increases, the acidity of the catalyst decreases, leading to a reduction in activity. However, the selectivity towards propene increases at lower propane conversions. This is attributed to the suppression of side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization due to the weaker acidity of the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts. During the reaction, the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts exhibit lower stability compared to Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts, which can be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The addition of CO2 to the reaction improves the stability of the catalysts by eliminating coke through the Boudouard reaction and promoting the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface.

酸性和表面性质对丙烷脱氢反应催化剂的性能至关重要。随着HZSM-48支持物中Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的酸性降低，导致活性下降。然而，在较低的丙烷转化率下，丙烯的选择性增加。这归因于由于Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的弱酸性抑制了副反应，如聚合、环化和芳构化。在反应过程中，Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的稳定性低于Ga2O3/HZSM-5催化剂，这可能归因于它们丰富的弱酸位点和一维孔结构。向反应中添加CO2可以改善催化剂的稳定性，通过Boudouard反应消除焦炭，并促进丙烯从催化剂表面的脱附。
