[1] "The catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation over HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was investigated, and compared with that of HZSM-5 supported ones."
[2] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
[3] "However, the selectivity to propene is not high enough because of the aromatization of propene during the dehydrogenation."
[4] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
[5] "The initial activity of supported catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-48, while the propene selectivity shows an opposite tendency."
[6] "Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 shows the best propene yield of 22.2%."
[7] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5, especially at low propane conversion, due to its weaker acidity."
[8] "However, the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with Ga2O3/ HZSM-5, which may be caused by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. This weak acidity helps suppress the aromatization of propene during the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher selectivity for propene. However, the stability of these catalysts is lower compared to HZSM-5 supported ones, which might be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures.

不同Ga2O3（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）晶相的结构特性和表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。HZSM-48支持的Ga2O3催化剂比HZSM-5支持的催化剂在相似丙烷转化率下表现出更高的丙烯选择性，这是由于它们的弱酸强度。这种弱酸性有助于抑制丙烯在脱氢过程中的异构化，从而导致更高的丙烯选择性。然而，这些催化剂的稳定性低于HZSM-5支持的催化剂，这可能归因于它们丰富的弱酸位点和单向孔结构。
