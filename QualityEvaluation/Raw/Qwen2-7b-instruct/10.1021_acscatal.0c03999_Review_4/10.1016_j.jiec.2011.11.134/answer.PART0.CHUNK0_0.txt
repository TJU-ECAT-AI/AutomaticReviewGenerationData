[1] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."
[2] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
[3] "Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures."
[4] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."
[5] "Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, which reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising too much on initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-, β-, γ-, δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位点，对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生显著影响。α-, β-, γ-, δ-Ga2O3晶型由于其晶体结构的不同，导致Lewis酸位点分布和可接近性的差异，从而影响反应活性。更高的酸性和碱性倾向于增强Ga2O3晶型的初始活性，加快反应速率。然而，这种增加的活性可能导致更多的焦炭形成，进而使催化剂失活。丙烯选择性受到酸性和碱性平衡的影响，更酸性的支持物有利于丙烯生成，但可能因焦炭形成而缩短催化剂寿命。HZSM-48支持的Ga2O3催化剂相对于HZSM-5支持的催化剂具有较高的丙烯选择性，这是由于前者较弱的酸强度，减少了不希望的副反应如芳构化，从而提高了丙烯选择性而不牺牲太多的初始活性。这些催化剂的稳定性也受到孔结构的影响；具有单向孔结构的催化剂的稳定性较低，因为更容易出现焦炭沉积于表面。
