1. The catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation over HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts was investigated, comparing it with HZSM-5 supported catalysts. The acidity of these catalysts was assessed through NH3-TPD method.

2. Two distinct desorption peaks were observed on the TPD profiles of the Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) catalyst.

3. The total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts was comparable to those on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, but it had significantly fewer medium to strong acid sites, suggesting a weaker acid strength for Ga2O3/HZSM-48.

4. The catalytic activity of HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts declined sharply with an increase in Si/Al ratio of the support, aligning with the NH3-TPD results.

5. The selectivity to propene in the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 system was enhanced compared to the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 system due to the suppression of side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization.

6. The selectivity towards propene on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was notably higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5, particularly at lower propane conversion levels.

7. The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) catalyst might be attributed to its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure, which facilitate coke deposition.

8. The introduction of CO2 into the reaction improved the stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts by suppressing coke formation and enhancing propylene desorption from the catalyst surface.

1. 研究了在二氧化碳存在的条件下，HZSM-48负载的Ga2O3催化剂对丙烷脱氢的催化性能，并将其与HZSM-5负载催化剂进行了比较。

2. Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130)催化剂的TPD谱图上出现了两个明显的脱附峰。

3. Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂上的酸位总数与Ga2O3/HZSM-5相似，但中强酸位较少，表明Ga2O3/HZSM-48的酸强度较弱。

4. 随着支持物Si/Al比的增加，HZSM-48支持的Ga2O3催化剂的活性急剧下降，这与NH3-TPD结果一致。

5. 由于抑制了如聚合、环化和芳构化等副反应，Ga2O3/HZSM-48系统的丙烯选择性高于Ga2O3/HZSM-5系统。

6. 在低丙烷转化率下，Ga2O3/HZSM-48的丙烯选择性明显高于Ga2O3/HZSM-5。

7. Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130)催化剂的较低稳定性可能是由其丰富的弱酸位和一维孔结构导致的，这些结构易于被焦炭沉积堵塞。

8. 添加CO2到反应中改善了Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的稳定性，通过促进焦炭的去除和提高丙烯从催化剂表面的脱附。
