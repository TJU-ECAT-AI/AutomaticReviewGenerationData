The document highlights the interest in gallium oxides and gallium-based oxides due to their catalytic properties, particularly as strong acids. Gallium oxide is noted as a promising system for mesostructuring and is effective in processes like the aromatization of ethane and the dehydrogenation of alkanes. It has also been studied as a catalyst in epoxidation reactions. The mesoporous gallium oxide phases prepared in the study display high surface areas and unimodal pore size distributions, reaching up to 221 m2/g and 515 nm, respectively.
