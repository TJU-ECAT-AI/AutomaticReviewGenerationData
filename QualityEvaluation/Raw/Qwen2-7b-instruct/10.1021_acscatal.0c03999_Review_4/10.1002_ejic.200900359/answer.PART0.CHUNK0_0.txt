1. Gallium oxides and gallium-based oxides are significant in the field of heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique catalytic properties. They are active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and the selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen. They are also effective in the aromatization of ethane in the presence of CO2. 

2. The synthesis methods for gallium oxide mesophases employ self-assembly of inorganic precursors in the presence of liquid crystalline phases, offering a route to overcome limitations in catalytic performance. This method eliminates the need for high synthesis temperatures and allows for the synthesis of thermally stable mesoporous oxides with controlled morphological, textural, and structural properties.

3. Evaporation-Induced Self-Assembly (EISA) is a suitable technique for preparing ordered mesophases with precisely tuned structural and morphological characteristics.

4. The use of F127 and P123 as structure directing agents in EISA synthesis results in the formation of porous, non-homogeneous spheres of gallium oxide. The samples prepared with CTAB show irregular morphologies.

5. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distributions for nanocrystalline mesoporous gallium oxide phases synthesized using CTAB, F127, and P123 as structure directing agents are illustrated in Figure 6.

6. The high-angle X-ray diffraction patterns for gallium oxide mesophases synthesized using CTAB, F127, and P123 as structure directing agents are depicted in Figure 7.

7. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and intensity profile measurements for the gallium oxide synthesized by SAHA employing F127 as the structure directing agent are presented in Figure 8.

8. An HRTEM image of nanocrystals on the surface of the spheres synthesized with F127 as the structure directing agent is shown in Figure 9.

9. The samples synthesized with F127 as the SDA exhibit the highest surface areas among those prepared using CTAB or P123.

10. By adjusting the concentration of ethylene glycol, the textural properties of the resultant mesoporous gallium oxide phases can be finely tuned.
