<quotes>
Textural properties such as surface areas and pore sizes were effectively fine-tuned by the nature and relative concentration of the structure directing agents. Due to their high surface areas, tunability of pore sizes and the nature of the wall structure, these gallium oxide mesophases could find potential applications as heterogeneous catalysts.
