The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of mesoporous gallium oxide phases with high surface areas and tunable pore sizes, which are of great interest in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique and remarkable catalytic properties. These phases were synthesized using structure directing agents such as CTAB, F127, and P123 through evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and self-assembly hydrothermal-assisted (SAHA) methods. The resulting mesophases display various structural characteristics, surface properties (including acidity and Lewis acid sites), and pore sizes, which influence their catalytic performance in reactions such as CO2-ODHP. The acidity of the gallium oxide catalysts plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, selective catalytic reduction of NOx, and aromatization of ethane. The literature also highlights the use of surfactants as structure directing agents in the synthesis of mesoporous gallium oxide, leading to improved control over structural, morphological, and textural properties compared to traditional methods. The catalytic performance of different gallium oxide polymorphs, such as α-, β-, γ-, and δ-, is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites, affecting their activity and selectivity in various catalytic reactions. The literature provides detailed information on the synthesis, characterization, and potential applications of mesoporous gallium oxide in catalysis.
