<p>Since the global warming mainly due to carbon dioxide was recognized as one of the most serious problems in the world.</p>
<p>The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed, but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in Cr2O3/SiO2.</p>
<p>The activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the selectivities for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield.</p>
<p>The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>This suggests that the partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the yield of C3H6 during the reaction in a stream of CO2 and in a stream of He. The C3H6 yield at the first pulse and the second pulse in the presence of CO2 was found to be higher than those in the absence of CO2.</p>

1. The authors conducted research on the impact of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation over various Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. They discovered that CO2 had promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed only the phases of the respective supports. However, in the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed. 

3. The activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was significantly higher compared to its absence, with a surprising 40% increase.

4. Over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the selectivities for CO and H2 remained unchanged regardless of the yield of C3H6.

5. As the Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst increased, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased.

6. The addition of CO2 resulted in a lesser decrease in the yield of C3H6 compared to its absence, suggesting that CO2 could suppress catalyst deactivation.

7. Pulse reaction studies revealed that the yield of C3H6 was higher during the reaction in a stream of CO2 compared to a stream of He, indicating that CO2 enhances the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

8. The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst showed higher activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 compared to a reduced catalyst. This enhanced activity was attributed to the maintenance of the surface of Cr2O3 partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

1. 研究人员对二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢作用于几种Cr2O3催化剂（支持在Al2O3、活性碳和SiO2上）进行了研究。他们发现，二氧化碳在二氧化硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂上有促进作用。

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 和 Cr2O3/AC 的XRD 图像仅显示了各自支持物的相位。然而，在Cr2O3/SiO2的情况下，观察到了Cr2O3相和无定形SiO2相。

3. 在二氧化碳存在的情况下，Cr2O3/SiO2 催化剂的活性比其不存在时高出令人惊讶的40%。

4. 对于Cr2O3/SiO2 催化剂，无论C3H6产率如何，CO和H2的选择性保持不变。

5. 随着Cr2O3在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中的含量增加，存在CO2与不存在CO2条件下C3H6产率的比率降低。

6. 与不存在CO2的情况相比，CO2的存在导致C3H6产率的减少更少，这表明CO2可以抑制催化剂失活。

7. 脉冲反应研究表明，与氦气流相比，在二氧化碳流中进行反应时C3H6的产率更高，这表明CO2可以加快C3H8在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的脱氢速率。

8. 部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的脱氢活性高于还原状态的催化剂。这种增强的活性归因于反应过程中Cr2O3表面部分氧化的维持。
