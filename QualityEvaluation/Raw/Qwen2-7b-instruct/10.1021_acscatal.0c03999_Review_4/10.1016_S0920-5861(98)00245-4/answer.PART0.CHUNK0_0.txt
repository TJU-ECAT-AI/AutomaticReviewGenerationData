[1] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
[3] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study found that carbon dioxide (CO2) has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts. This promotion is observed specifically on SiO2-supported catalysts, enhancing the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The presence of CO2 maintains the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 to be partially oxidized during the reaction, contributing to its enhanced performance.

研究发现，二氧化碳（CO2）对硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂的丙烷脱氢反应具有促进作用。这种促进仅在SiO2支持的催化剂上观察到，它提高了丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。CO2的存在使Cr2O3/SiO2表面保持部分氧化状态，在反应过程中，这有助于提高其性能。
