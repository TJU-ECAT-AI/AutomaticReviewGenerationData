The scientific literature discusses the promotion of propane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide (CO2) specifically over silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts. It highlights that CO2 enhances the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppresses catalyst deactivation. The study found that the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts increased by 40% when exposed to CO2 compared to when CO2 was absent. Additionally, the selectivity for hydrogen (H2) decreased, while the selectivity for carbon monoxide (CO) increased as the yield of C3H6 increased over Al2O3-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promotion effect of CO2 was attributed to its role at the interfaces between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles. Pulse reaction studies further confirmed that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts are more active for the dehydrogenation of propane than reduced catalysts, suggesting that the presence of CO2 maintains the surface of the catalyst partially oxidized, enhancing its performance.

文献研究了二氧化碳（CO2）对丙烷脱氢反应的促进作用，特别是对于二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂。它强调，CO2可以增加丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。研究发现，与没有CO2的情况下相比，当暴露于CO2时，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性提高了40%。此外，当丙烷在铝酸盐支持的Cr2O3催化剂上转化时，氢（H2）的选择性降低，而碳氧化合物（CO）的选择性随着丙烯（C3H6）产率的增加而增加。CO2的促进效果归因于其在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒界面的作用。脉冲反应研究表明，部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原催化剂更活跃，用于丙烷脱氢，这表明CO2的存在维持催化剂表面部分氧化，从而增强其性能。
