The study found that carbon dioxide (CO2) has promoting effects on the dehydrogenation of propane over silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts. This promotion is observed specifically on SiO2-supported catalysts, enhancing the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The presence of CO2 maintains the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 to be partially oxidized during the reaction, contributing to its enhanced performance.

The scientific literature discusses the promotion of propane dehydrogenation by carbon dioxide (CO2) specifically over silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts. It highlights that CO2 enhances the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppresses catalyst deactivation. The study found that the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts increased by 40% when exposed to CO2 compared to when CO2 was absent. Additionally, the selectivity for hydrogen (H2) decreased, while the selectivity for carbon monoxide (CO) increased as the yield of C3H6 increased over Al2O3-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promotion effect of CO2 was attributed to its role at the interfaces between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles. Pulse reaction studies further confirmed that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts are more active for the dehydrogenation of propane than reduced catalysts, suggesting that the presence of CO2 maintains the surface of the catalyst partially oxidized, enhancing its performance.

文献研究了二氧化碳（CO2）对丙烷脱氢反应的促进作用，特别是对于二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂。它强调，CO2可以增加丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。研究发现，与没有CO2的情况下相比，当暴露于CO2时，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性提高了40%。此外，当丙烷在铝酸盐支持的Cr2O3催化剂上转化时，氢（H2）的选择性降低，而碳氧化合物（CO）的选择性随着丙烯（C3H6）产率的增加而增加。CO2的促进效果归因于其在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒界面的作用。脉冲反应研究表明，部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂比还原催化剂更活跃，用于丙烷脱氢，这表明CO2的存在维持催化剂表面部分氧化，从而增强其性能。

The structural characteristics, particularly the support material, play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. Carbon dioxide exhibits promoting effects on the catalyst only when it is supported on SiO2. These effects lead to an enhancement in the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized state of the Cr2O3 on the SiO2 surface is advantageous for the dehydrogenation process. In the presence of CO2, the surface of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst might maintain a partially oxidized state, which contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

The study investigated the impact of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. It was found that only SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed promoting effects from carbon dioxide. The CO2 enhanced the yield of propylene and suppressed catalyst deactivation. The presence of CO2 led to a significant difference in activity between the Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, with the latter showing a 40% higher activity in CO2 presence. The ratio of propylene yield in CO2 presence compared to its absence decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting a crucial role for the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles in the CO2 effect. Additionally, CO2 was found to reduce catalyst deactivation and maintain the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst partially oxidized during the reaction.

研究了二氧化碳对丙烷在Al2O3、活性碳和SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上的脱氢化作用。发现只有SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进效果。二氧化碳提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。二氧化碳的存在导致了Cr2O3/Al2O3和Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂之间显著的活性差异，后者在二氧化碳存在下的活性比无二氧化碳时高40%。丙烯产量在二氧化碳存在与不存在之间的比率随着Cr2O3含量的增加而降低在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中，这表明Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界在二氧化碳效应中的关键作用。此外，二氧化碳被发现减少了催化剂的失活，并在反应过程中保持Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂表面部分氧化。

1. The authors conducted research on the impact of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation over various Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. They discovered that CO2 had promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed only the phases of the respective supports. However, in the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed. 

3. The activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was significantly higher compared to its absence, with a surprising 40% increase.

4. Over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, the selectivities for CO and H2 remained unchanged regardless of the yield of C3H6.

5. As the Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst increased, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased.

6. The addition of CO2 resulted in a lesser decrease in the yield of C3H6 compared to its absence, suggesting that CO2 could suppress catalyst deactivation.

7. Pulse reaction studies revealed that the yield of C3H6 was higher during the reaction in a stream of CO2 compared to a stream of He, indicating that CO2 enhances the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

8. The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst showed higher activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 compared to a reduced catalyst. This enhanced activity was attributed to the maintenance of the surface of Cr2O3 partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

2. Cr2O3/Al2O3 和 Cr2O3/AC 的XRD 图像仅显示了各自支持物的相位。然而，在Cr2O3/SiO2的情况下，观察到了Cr2O3相和无定形SiO2相。

3. 在二氧化碳存在的情况下，Cr2O3/SiO2 催化剂的活性比其不存在时高出令人惊讶的40%。

4. 对于Cr2O3/SiO2 催化剂，无论C3H6产率如何，CO和H2的选择性保持不变。

5. 随着Cr2O3在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中的含量增加，存在CO2与不存在CO2条件下C3H6产率的比率降低。

6. 与不存在CO2的情况相比，CO2的存在导致C3H6产率的减少更少，这表明CO2可以抑制催化剂失活。

7. 脉冲反应研究表明，与氦气流相比，在二氧化碳流中进行反应时C3H6的产率更高，这表明CO2可以加快C3H8在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上的脱氢速率。

8. 部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的脱氢活性高于还原状态的催化剂。这种增强的活性归因于反应过程中Cr2O3表面部分氧化的维持。
