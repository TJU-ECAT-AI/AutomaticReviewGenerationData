<p>The promoting effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Since the selectivities for C3H6 were more than 90%, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 should be the main reaction both in the presence of CO2 and in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>The activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2.</p>
<p>The effect of CO2 addition on the deactivation of a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was also examined.</p>
<p>The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst.</p>
<p>In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction.</p>

The study investigated the impact of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane over Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. It was found that only SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed promoting effects from carbon dioxide. The CO2 enhanced the yield of propylene and suppressed catalyst deactivation. The presence of CO2 led to a significant difference in activity between the Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts, with the latter showing a 40% higher activity in CO2 presence. The ratio of propylene yield in CO2 presence compared to its absence decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting a crucial role for the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles in the CO2 effect. Additionally, CO2 was found to reduce catalyst deactivation and maintain the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst partially oxidized during the reaction.

研究了二氧化碳对丙烷在Al2O3、活性碳和SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂上的脱氢化作用。发现只有SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进效果。二氧化碳提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。二氧化碳的存在导致了Cr2O3/Al2O3和Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂之间显著的活性差异，后者在二氧化碳存在下的活性比无二氧化碳时高40%。丙烯产量在二氧化碳存在与不存在之间的比率随着Cr2O3含量的增加而降低在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中，这表明Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界在二氧化碳效应中的关键作用。此外，二氧化碳被发现减少了催化剂的失活，并在反应过程中保持Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂表面部分氧化。
