The structural characteristics, particularly the support material, play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. Carbon dioxide exhibits promoting effects on the catalyst only when it is supported on SiO2. These effects lead to an enhancement in the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized state of the Cr2O3 on the SiO2 surface is advantageous for the dehydrogenation process. In the presence of CO2, the surface of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst might maintain a partially oxidized state, which contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity.

结构特性，特别是支撑材料，对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的丙烷脱氢性能至关重要。二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的催化剂上表现出促进作用。这些效果导致丙烯（C3H6）产率提高和催化剂失活抑制。Cr2O3在SiO2表面的部分氧化状态有利于脱氢过程。在二氧化碳的存在下，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的表面可能保持部分氧化状态，这有助于增强催化活性。
