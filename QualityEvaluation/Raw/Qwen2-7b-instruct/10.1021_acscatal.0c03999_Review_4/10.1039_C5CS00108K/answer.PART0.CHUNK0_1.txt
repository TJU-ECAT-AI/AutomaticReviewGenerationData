[1] "The discovery and development of the zeolite-based SCR catalysts are relatively recent, having occurred over the last 25+ years."
[2] "In 1986, Iwamoto and coworkers published a milestone paper14 describing high and stable activity of Cu2+ exchanged ZSM-5 in NO decomposition into N2 and O2."
[3] "Due partly to the need for more durable zeolite-based catalysts, but mostly due to the need for more efficient hydrocarbon activation in HC-SCR, FeZSM-5 became the next research focus."
[4] "The very recent reports of their improved performance for NH3-SCR relative to metal-exchanged ZSM-5 and beta42,43,48 have sparked considerable interest in and debate about the fundamental materials and chemical properties of these metal-exchanged CHA zeolites."

1. The development of metal-exchanged zeolites for vehicle applications, particularly for lean-NOx emission control, is a recent advancement, with progress occurring over the last 25+ years. 
2. In 1986, Iwamoto and colleagues reported high and stable activity of copper (Cu2+) exchanged ZSM-5 in the decomposition of NO into N2 and O2.
3. The need for more durable zeolite-based catalysts and more efficient activation of hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR) prompted researchers to shift focus to iron (Fe)-loaded zeolites, specifically FeZSM-5.
4. The recent improvements in the performance of metal-exchanged CHA zeolites for ammonia-selective catalytic reduction (NH3-SCR) compared to metal-exchanged ZSM-5 and beta zeolites have sparked interest and debate regarding the fundamental materials and chemical properties of these CHA zeolites.
