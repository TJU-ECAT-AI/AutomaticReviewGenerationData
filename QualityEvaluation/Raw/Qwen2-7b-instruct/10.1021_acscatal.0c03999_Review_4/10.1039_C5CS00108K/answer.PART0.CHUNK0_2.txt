[1] "The discovery and development of the zeolite-based SCR catalysts are relatively recent, having occurred over the last 25+ years."
[2] "Prior to zeolite catalysts, a wide variety of other materials, e.g.,supported noble metals, coinage metal oxides and salts, and early transition metal oxides, have been examined."
[3] "Due partly to the need for more durable zeolite-based catalysts, but mostly due to the need for more efficient hydrocarbon activation in HC-SCR, FeZSM-5 became the next research focus."
[4] "The very recent reports of their improved performance for NH3-SCR relative to metal-exchanged ZSM-5 and beta42,43,48 have sparked considerable interest in and debate about the fundamental materials and chemical properties of these metal-exchanged CHA zeolites."
[5] "To accommodate sufficient amounts of Cu2+ ions and to ensure sufficient hydrothermal stability, the current generation of a commercial CuSSZ-13 catalyst has a Si/Al ratio of B15."
[6] "The presence of three tetrahedral elements (instead of two for zeolites) and the possible existence of silica islands within SAPO-34 make this material intrinsically more complex than SSZ-13."

1. The development of zeolite-based SCR catalysts started around 25 years ago, and they are still a relatively new area of research.
2. Before zeolite catalysts, researchers had explored a variety of materials, including supported noble metals, coinage metal oxides, salts, and early transition metal oxides.
3. The need for more durable zeolite-based catalysts and more efficient hydrocarbon activation in HC-SCR led to the focus on FeZSM-5.
4. The recent improvement in performance of metal-exchanged CHA zeolites for NH3-SCR has sparked interest and debate about their fundamental properties.
5. The current commercial CuSSZ-13 catalyst uses a Si/Al ratio of approximately 15 to accommodate Cu2+ ions and ensure hydrothermal stability.
6. The SAPO-34 material is more complex than SSZ-13 due to the presence of three tetrahedral elements and potential silica islands within its structure.

1. 用于选择性催化还原（SCR）的沸石基催化剂的研究开始于大约25年前，仍然属于相对较新的研究领域。
2. 在沸石催化剂之前，研究人员探索了包括支持的贵金属、铜合金氧化物和盐以及早期过渡金属氧化物在内的各种材料。
3. 对更耐用的沸石基催化剂的需求以及对HC-SCR中更高效的烃激活的需求导致了FeZSM-5的研究重点转移。
4. 最近，金属交换的CHA沸石在氨-SCR中的性能改善引起了对这些材料基本特性的兴趣和辩论。
5. 当前的商业CuSSZ-13催化剂使用约15的Si/Al比来容纳Cu2+离子并确保热稳定性。
6. SAPO-34材料比SSZ-13更为复杂，因为其结构中存在三个四面体元素以及潜在的硅岛。
