The ever increasing demand to develop highly fuel efficient engines coincides with the need to minimize air pollution originating from the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines. Dramatically improved fuel efficiency can be achieved at air-to-fuel ratios much higher than stoichiometric. In the presence of oxygen in large excess, however, traditional three-way catalysts are unable to reduce NOx. Among the number of lean-NOx reduction technologies, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by NH3 over Cu- and Fe-ion exchanged zeolite catalysts has been extensively studied over the past 30+ years. Despite the significant advances in developing a viable practical zeolite-based catalyst for lean NOx reduction, the insufficient hydrothermal stabilities of the zeolite structures considered cast doubts about their real-world applicability.
During the past decade renewed interest in zeolite-based lean NOx reduction was spurred by the discovery of the very high activity of CuSSZ-13 (and the isostructural CuSAPO-34) in the NH3-SCR of NOx. These new, small-pore zeolite-based catalysts not only exhibited very high NOx conversion and N2 selectivity, but also exhibited exceptionally high hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In this review we summarize the key discoveries of the past B5 years that led to the introduction of these catalysts into practical applications. This review first briefly discusses the structure and preparation of the CHA structure-based zeolite catalysts, and then summarizes the key learnings of the rather extensive (but not complete) characterisation work. Then we summarize the key findings of reaction kinetic studies, and provide some mechanistic details emerging from these investigations. At the end of the review we highlight some of the issues that still need to be addressed in automotive exhaust control catalysis.
1. Introduction
The abatement of environmentally harmful compounds (e.g.,hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and sulfur (SOx),and CO), emitted from mobile or stationary power sources, has been a remarkable success story for the catalysis R&D community.1 In particular, for mobile (automotive exhaust emission control) applications, the three-way catalyst that is the active component of the catalytic converter, a standard component on vehicles in the US and Europe for over 30 years, has contributed to a remark- able drop in emissions of CO, HC and NOx from gasoline-powered vehicles. We now take for granted the dramatic improvements that the introduction of the catalytic converter technology has made in air quality and, correspondingly, human health.
Unfortunately, the three-way catalytic converter technology is not suitable for application on so-called lean-burn engines that operate at high air/fuel ratios, including diesel-powered vehicle engines. Although these engine technologies are inher- ently more fuel efficient than stoichiometric gasoline power- trains, their wide-spread application for vehicles has been limited by the inability of the three-way catalyst to reduce NOx emissions at high air/fuel ratios. As such, in the last 1015 years a significant R&D focus has been on this problem of lean-NOx emission control.28 Based on this recent work, significant achievements have been realized with the very recent commer- cialization of two new nano-materials-based catalytic emission control applications for diesel-powered vehicles: the NOx storage/ reduction (NSR) catalyst and the selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH3-SCR) using metal-exchanged zeolites. Because these are such newly introduced technologies, many challenges remain to improve performance, enhance stability, and lower costs. Indeed, many of the practical concerns with these new lean-NOx catalyst technologies stem from a relatively poor fundamental understanding of catalyst structure/activity and reaction mechanisms. a Department of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AJ, UK b UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, OX11 0FA, UK c Institute for Integrated Catalysis, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA.

This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 In this review, we summarize the results of recent studies of zeolite-based catalysts for the SCR of NOx using NH3 as a reductant. First we will give an overview of the development of zeolite-based SCR catalysts, then briefly discuss the most important parameters of the CHA-based zeolite synthesis proto- col, and provide key structural information of these materials. In the following section we will summarize the key findings of the extensive characterization work that have appeared over the past B5 years on Cu and FeSSZ-13 catalysts. This will be followed by a section detailing the key findings of kinetic studies over these materials and present some of the mechanistic proposals based on both the structural characterization and detailed kinetic measurements. Finally we present some of the future challenges we are facing in the field of automotive exhaust control catalysis.
1.1.
Development of metal-exchanged zeolites for vehicle applications The development of SCR using metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts for automotive applications is by no means an isolated event.
Prior to zeolite catalysts, a wide variety of other materials, e.g.,supported noble metals, coinage metal oxides and salts, and early transition metal oxides, have been examined.911 The identifi- cation of ammonia as a particularly efficient reductant for NOx removal even dates back to the 1950s.12 The most relevant and useful prior knowledge comes from the development of oxide supported vanadia SCR systems for stationary NOx removal applications (e.g., in coal-fired power plants), initiated in Japan in the early 1970s and adopted worldwide at present.10,11 Our understanding of fundamental SCR chemistry on zeolite catalysts

View Article Online This journal is The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 Chem. Soc. Rev. also largely originates from studies on supported vanadia catalysts.10 As a result of the considerable experience with vanadia-based SCR catalysts in stationary applications, it has been under consideration for vehicle applications for quite some time and, in fact, this catalyst system has been commer- cialized in Europe.13 Due to concerns in the U.S. about vanadia wastes from production activities as well as issues with low hydrothermal durability, low activity/selectivity outside its optimal operational temperature window, and undesired activity in catalyzing SO2 oxidation to SO3 of these catalysts, metal- exchanged zeolites are now being more widely used for vehicle NH3-SCR applications.
The discovery and development of the zeolite-based SCR cata- lysts are relatively recent, having occurred over the last 25+ years.
In 1986, Iwamoto and coworkers published a milestone paper14 describing high and stable activity of Cu2+ exchanged ZSM-5 in NO decomposition into N2 and O2. This was followed by a surge of research interest in NO decomposition which, in fact, would be an ideal reaction for NOx removal as it does not require a secondary reductant.2 It was soon realized, however, that the efficiency of this process was so low that practical application for catalytic NO decomposition was not likely. In fact, Schneider and coworkers have demonstrated on thermodynamic grounds that such a pro- cess could not meet emission standards for lean-burn engines.15 Investigations of CuZSM-5 as an SCR catalyst with hydrocarbon or NH3 reductants began in the early 1990s, and interest in these materials quickly heightened due to the comparable, and in certain cases superior performance for fresh CuZSM-5 as compared to the commercialized vanadiatitania SCR catalysts.12,1619 In particular, the use of hydrocarbons as reductants (HC-SCR) received special interest because hydrocarbons are readily available in the exhaust from incomplete combustion of fuels.17 Unfortunately, it was soon realized that CuZSM-5 deactivates rapidly under hydrothermal conditions typically encountered in practical vehicle exhaust environments.20,21 Due partly to the need for more durable zeolite-based catalysts,but mostly due to the need for more efficient hydrocarbon activation in HC-SCR, FeZSM-5 became the next research focus. The hydro- thermal stabilities were, indeed, somewhat improved, especially for ZSM-5 based catalysts formulated with high Fe loadings.2227 However, the durability of these FeZSM-5 materials was still not satisfactory for practical vehicle applications. Furthermore,it was becoming clear during this time that SCR with NH3 over these zeolite-based catalysts provided significantly better per- formance for NOx reduction than HC-SCR.28,29 Subsequently, Cu- and Fe-beta for NH3-SCR have been extensively studied because they show better durability than ZSM-5 based catalysts.3035 Still, there were concerns that metal- exchanged beta zeolites would not maintain their high activities to meet the regulated durability requirements (100 000 miles or more in the U.S. standards).36 Another practical concern with these candidate SCR catalysts became apparent with testing in real engine exhaust.36 Notably, some of the exhaust hydrocarbons from the incompletely burned fuel appeared to act as catalyst poisons in part because they strongly adsorb in zeolites. Periodic high temperatures encountered on the vehicle can also lead to the highly exothermic combustion of the adsorbed hydrocarbons resulting in locally very high temperatures sufficient to degrade the zeolite structure.
1.2.
Metal-exchanged CHA zeolites It seems likely that the issues with unburned hydrocarbons in large-pore beta zeolites may have motivated the exploration of small-pore materials. Prior to the development of Cu-containing CHA-type materials for SCR applications, HSAPO-34 (i.e. a silicoaluminophosphate material isostructural to SSZ-13 zeolite) has been successfully used as a commercial methanol-to-olefin catalyst.37,38 To our knowledge, however, the SSZ-13 zeolite has never been widely used as an industrial catalyst. While both materials show strong Brnsted acidity, experimental39,40 as well as theoretical studies41 seem to suggest that HSSZ-13 displays stronger acidity. In any case, metal-exchanged CHA-type micro- porous materials were developed simultaneously by BASF and Johnson-Matthey Inc. in the mid- to late-2000s for lean-NOx NH3- SCR in Diesel-powered vehicles.4245 These CHA-based catalysts,first commercialized for NOx emission control in 2010, are now the most common choice for SCR of NOx with NH3 (provided by urea solutions) in vehicle applications. CHA zeolites (structural model is shown in Fig. 1) have been known since the 1950s,46 and viable synthesis procedures for SSZ-13 were invented by Stacy Zones at Chevron in the mid-1980s.47 The very recent reports of their improved performance for NH3-SCR relative to metal-exchanged ZSM-5 and beta42,43,48 have sparked consider- able interest in and debate about the fundamental materials and chemical properties of these metal-exchanged CHA zeolites.
The remainder of this review will focus mainly on what has been learned, primarily over the last five years, and what is currently proposed about CuCHA zeolites with regard to their structure and catalytic chemistry for NH3-SCR. The much less studied FeCHA SCR catalysts will also be described, although in less detail.

2. Cu(Fe)CHA synthesis
SSZ-13 is readily synthesized hydrothermally. Detailed synthesis recipes based on the original Zones patent47 can be found in the recent literature,4951 in which, N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamant- ammonium iodide/hydroxide has been chosen as a structure directing agent (SDA). The hydroxide form is commercially available from Sachem, Inc. In principle, the chabasite struc- ture can be constructed with Si/Al ratios from 1 to infinity. By varying Si/Al ratios of the precursor, one can readily synthesize SSZ-13 with various Si/Al ratios. It is important to note that the Si/Al ratio is an important criterion for determining kinetics,stability and the catalyst operating window for CuSSZ-13 cata- lysts. To accommodate sufficient amounts of Cu2+ ions and to ensure sufficient hydrothermal stability, the current generation of a commercial CuSSZ-13 catalyst has a Si/Al ratio of B15.52 CuSSZ-13 is readily generated via a traditional aqueous solution ion-exchange method that has also been described in detail in recent publications.4851,53 SAPO-34 is also synthesized hydro- thermally using a vast number of organic and inorganic Al and Si sources and SDAs (alkylamines and morpholine). Previous studies have discovered the following important parameters that affect the properties of synthesized SAPO-34: (1) the SDA chosen;(2) the Al and Si sources; (3) the molar ratios of Si/Al/P/SDA of the gel; (4) gel aging time/temperature; (5) reaction time/ temperature.5459 Among these, SDAs play decisive roles in affecting crystallite size, Si distribution and, therefore, frame- work charge density, while the choice of inorganic Al and Si sources and maintaining continuous stirring during synthesis are important to form products with high crystallinity. The presence of three tetrahedral elements (instead of two for zeolites) and the possible existence of silica islands within SAPO-34 make this material intrinsically more complex than SSZ-13. CuSAPO-34 can also be generated via a traditional solution ion-exchange method.
Note that although calcined SAPO-34 is in the H-form, to facilitate Cu2+ ion incorporation, it is still necessary to exchange it into the NH4-form.5961 Furthermore, the generation of CuSAPO-34 from this method is not trivial due to the moisture sensitivity of this material at temperatures lower than 100 1C.59,6264 FeCHA can be prepared similarly using NH4-CHA and solution of a Fe(II) salt;however, care must be taken to avoid Fe2+ oxidation to Fe3+ which leads to bulky Fe-complexes (i.e. iron oxyhydroxides) during ion exchange. This was achieved by N2 protection during ion exchange,which is discussed in more details elsewhere.65 A few alternative CuCHA synthesis methods were developed in the past few years. Ren et al. discovered that the Cu2+ tetraethylenepentamine complex (CuTEPA), owing to its stabi- lity, proper size and charge-balancing nature, can be used as a SDA for one-pot CuSSZ-13 synthesis.66 There is, unfortunately,a clear drawback when CuTEPA is used alone as the SDA: in the final product, the Cu content can readily be too excessive,because multiple SDA molecules are required to generate one CHA unit cell. As will be shown below, excessive Cu loading is detrimental to the hydrothermal stability of CuCHA. To lower the Cu content, a reverse ion-exchange step is required to remove some of the Cu2+ ions.67 It is important to note that this approach avoids the expensive traditional SDAs for SSZ-13 synthesis. CuTEPA was also found to be an efficient SDA for one-pot CuSAPO-34 synthesis. In this case, it can be used as a co-SDA, together with other low cost SDAs, to allow Cu loadings to be readily controlled.68,69 Another method successfully used to synthesize CuCHA is the so-called solid-state ion exchange (SSIE) method. For example, heating up a CuO and SSZ-13/ SAPO-34 mixture to an elevated temperature (700 1C and above) allows for the formation of extra-framework Cu2+ according to the following reactions:70,71 2H+ + CuO = Cu2+ + H2O (1) H+ + CuO = [Cu(OH)]+ (2) This method is rather straightforward and allows facile Cu loading control. However, incomplete CuO reaction and partial damage of the zeolites at such high temperatures are the draw- backs. Very recently, Shwan et al. discovered that NH3 and/or a standard NH3-SCR feed allow SSIE at much lower temperatures (250 1C).72 The mobility of Cu at low temperatures has been proposed to be related to the formation of [CuI(NH3)x]+ (x Z 2) complexes.
3. Characterisation of CuCHA
3.1.
X-ray techniques X-rays have a long standing history in the characterisation of heterogeneous catalysts by their virtue of being highly penetra- tive thereby allowing sample interrogation under appropriate conditions relevant to heterogeneous catalysis (etc. correct gas composition, temperature and more recently pressure).73 The principle techniques that have been used to characterize ion- exchanged CHA catalysts to date are X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the K-edges which for Cu and Fe are Fig. 1 Structural model and possible cation locations in the CHA framework.

Rev. found at 8977 and 7120 eV, respectively, and in many cases during the SCR reaction (defined as being under operando conditions when catalytic activity is verified using a residual gas analyser i.e. a mass spectrometer). Much less studied (in general) are the L-edges for these elements which are too low in energy to allow for facile in situ interrogation.
As with all K-edge spectroscopy, it is possible to obtain detailed insight into the local environment of Cu in terms of both the coordination (number and to some extent ligand-type) and oxidation state which for Cu is dominated by 0, +1 and +2.
The tendency for the 4s ground state to remain unoccupied often results in XANES spectra with multiple resonances. For the investigation of CuCHA materials X-ray techniques have been primarily employed to identify the nature and type of Cu-containing species during all stages of the catalyst lifetime i.e. from characterising the material before, during and after the reaction.
3.1.1.
XANES. It is known that after calcination and expo-
sure to the atmosphere CuCHA materials contain [Cu(H2O)6]2+ species that are JahnTeller distorted. Evidence for the presence of this species can be seen in a typical Cu K-edge XANES by virtue of a weak pre-edge feature at around 8977 eV due to a 1s3d (2T2g) transition which, since Dl 4 1, is dipole forbidden but quadrupole allowed; the transition is especially weak since it is also forbidden on symmetry grounds by virtue of the Cu coordi- nation possessing a centre of inversion (either Oh or else if the JahnTeller distortion is very strong D4h) as well as a reduced transition probability by virtue of the d9 electronic configuration.
In contrast, a weak pre-edge peak results in a strong intensity of the rising absorption edge since, importantly, this transition between the 1s and the unoccupied 4p is both dipole and parity (symmetry) allowed; around and even beyond this point the spectral features become dominated by multiple scattering around the absorber as a consequence of the low mean free path of the excited electron; the more neighbours around the absorber the more intense the multiple scattering and the sharper the features. Interestingly then the intensity of the rising absorption edge (in conjunction with the change in the pre-edge peak intensity) is a quick indicator of the coordination around Cu species in zeolites having been shown to reduce in intensity as the coordination number decreases, particularly the formation of undercoordinated Cu species.74 Heating of CuCHA leads to progressive dehydration of Cu which results in an increase in the intensity of the pre-edge peak and a simultaneous decrease of the white line, both changes characteristic of a reduction in the coordination number as the dehydrated Cu2+ ions adopt specific positions in the framework with a lower symmetry. An illustration of the changes in the XANES data as this process occurs is given in Fig. 2 where, in addition to the changes in the pre-edge peak and white line, a newly appearing pre-edge shoulder assigned to 1s/4p transitions in the 89858990 eV range and the Cu2+ fingerprint peak at ca. 8977.5 eV which is also consistent with a less symmetric Cu coordination geometry.51,75,76 XANES has also been used to detect the presence of Cu oxides (CuxOy)  notably Bates et al. demonstrated the presence of these additional species by virtue of a pre-edge feature at 8987 eV within samples whereby the Cu/Altot atomic ratio 4 0.2;importantly for XANES data, corresponding evidence for a second- ary species could also be found in the form of a reduced white line intensity. At low concentrations this can be more easily observed when examining 1st derivative XANES spectra.77 XANES is also sensitive to a change in the ligand type around the absorber; for example, a change from all O ligands to N ligands in [Cu(NH3)4]2+ results in a spectrum containing a dip in white line intensity with two features appearing at 8994 eV and 8998 eV respectively.78 These features have even been observed under pre-SCR conditions and where they have also been proposed as evidence for NH3 adsorption on the Cu site at low temperatures during standard SCR.51 The pre-edge position of Cu+ was also shown to be sensitive to its coordination environ- ment. The pre-edge energy of Cu+ with adsorbed CO shifted to lower energy by about 1.5 eV in comparison to the adsorbate-free Cu+ ion.75 A second notable pre-edge feature pertinent to the under- standing of Cu behaviour under SCR conditions is the observa- tion of a feature at B8982 eV and is thought to be due to a transition from a 1s to the doubly degenerate 4pxy orbitals in two-coordinate Cu+ systems. This feature is very evident in the data reported by Deka et al. in CuSSZ-13 samples prepared via a CVD method which resulted in the formation of significant amounts of CuAlO2 and consequently large amounts of unwanted N2O in the NH3-SCR reaction of NO.79 Significant amounts of Cu+ were also observed in the study reported by Kispersky et al. who studied CuSSZ-13 and CuZSM-5 under standard SCR conditions and concluded from a linear combination fitting of
