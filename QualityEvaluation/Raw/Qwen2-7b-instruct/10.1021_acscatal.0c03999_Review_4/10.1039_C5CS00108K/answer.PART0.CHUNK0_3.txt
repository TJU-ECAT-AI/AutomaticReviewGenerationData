Answer: The development of SCR catalysts using metal-exchanged zeolites is not an isolated event. Prior to the use of zeolites, a wide variety of materials such as supported noble metals, coinage metal oxides, salts, and early transition metal oxides were examined. The discovery and development of zeolite-based SCR catalysts are relatively recent, having occurred over the last 25+ years. In 1986, a milestone paper was published describing high and stable activity of Cu2+ exchanged ZSM-5 in NO decomposition into N2 and O2. Since then, Cu- and Fe-beta zeolites have been extensively studied for NH3-SCR because they exhibit better durability than ZSM-5 based catalysts.

开发使用金属交换沸石催化剂的SCR技术并非孤立事件。在使用沸石之前，已经对多种材料进行了研究，如支持的贵金属、半金属氧化物和盐以及早期过渡金属氧化物。沸石基SCR催化剂的发现和发展相对近期，大约在过去25年以上的时间内。1986年，一篇里程碑性的论文描述了Cu2+交换的ZSM-5在NO分解为N2和O2过程中的高稳定活性。自那时以来，Cu-和Fe-beta沸石被广泛研究用于NH3-SCR，因为它们比ZSM-5基催化剂更耐用。
