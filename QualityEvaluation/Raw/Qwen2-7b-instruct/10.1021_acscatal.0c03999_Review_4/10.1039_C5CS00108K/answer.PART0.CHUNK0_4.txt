1. The development of zeolite-based SCR catalysts is relatively recent, with advancements occurring over the last 25+ years. Before zeolites, various materials such as supported noble metals, coinage metal oxides, salts, and early transition metal oxides were examined for SCR purposes.

2. In 1986, Iwamoto and colleagues published a significant paper on the high and stable activity of copper(II)-exchanged ZSM-5 in the decomposition of NO into N2 and O2.

3. The need for more durable zeolite-based catalysts and more efficient hydrocarbon activation led researchers to focus on FeZSM-5 as the next material.

4. SSZ-13 zeolite, despite being known since the 1950s, has not been widely used as an industrial catalyst.

5. Hydrothermal synthesis is a common method for preparing SSZ-13 zeolites, with detailed recipes available in recent literature.

6. CuSSZ-13 catalysts are readily produced through a conventional aqueous solution ion-exchange process, with methods documented in recent publications.

7. Preparation of FeCHA catalysts involves using NH4-CHA and a Fe(II) salt solution, but precautions must be taken to prevent Fe2+ from oxidizing to Fe3+, which can lead to the formation of bulky iron complexes during ion exchange.

8. XANES is a technique that has been utilized to detect the presence of copper oxides (CuxOy) in samples, with a pre-edge feature at 8987 eV indicating the presence of these additional species.

1. 佐埃利特基SCR催化剂的发展相对较新，过去25多年中取得了进展。在佐埃利特之前，各种材料，如支持的贵金属、钱币金属氧化物、盐和早期过渡金属氧化物，被用于研究SCR。

2. 1986年，佐威马和他的同事发表了一篇关于铜(II)-交换ZSM-5在NO分解为N2和O2过程中高稳定性的里程碑论文。

3. 鉴于对更耐用的佐埃利特基催化剂的需求和更高效的烃类激活的需求，研究人员将研究重点转向了FeZSM-5。

4. 尽管SSZ-13自20世纪50年代以来就被知晓，但这种材料尚未广泛应用于工业催化剂。

5. SSZ-13的水热合成是一种常见的制备方法，最近的文献中有详细的合成方案。

6. CuSSZ-13催化剂通过传统的水溶液离子交换过程易于产生，该方法在近期的出版物中有详细描述。

7. 制备FeCHA催化剂时使用的是NH4-CHA和Fe(II)盐溶液，但在离子交换过程中需要小心避免Fe2+氧化为Fe3+，这可能导致形成大块铁复合物。

8. XANES技术被用来检测样品中的铜氧化物（CuxOy）的存在，一个在8987 eV处的预边峰表示这些额外物种的存在。
