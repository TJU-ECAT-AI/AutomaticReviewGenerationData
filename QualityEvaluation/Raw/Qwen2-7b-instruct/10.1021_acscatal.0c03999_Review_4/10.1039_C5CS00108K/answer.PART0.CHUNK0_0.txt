[1] "Unfortunately, the three-way catalytic converter technology is not suitable for application on so-called lean-burn engines that operate at high air/fuel ratios, including diesel-powered vehicle engines."
[2] "As such, in the last 1015 years a significant R&D focus has been on this problem of lean-NOx emission control."
[3] "These new, small-pore zeolite-based catalysts not only exhibited very high NOx conversion and N2 selectivity, but also exhibited exceptionally high hydrothermal stability at high temperatures."
[4] "Indeed, many of the practical concerns with these new lean-NOx catalyst technologies stem from a relatively poor fundamental understanding of catalyst structure/activity and reaction mechanisms."

Answer: The recent developments in automotive catalysis for NOx emission control using small-pore microporous materials aim to address the limitations of traditional three-way catalysts, particularly in handling lean-burn engines with high air/fuel ratios. New zeolite-based catalysts, like CuSSZ-13 and CuSAPO-34, offer high NOx conversion, N2 selectivity, and exceptional hydrothermal stability, which are crucial for practical applications. However, the field faces challenges in improving performance, enhancing stability, and reducing costs, due to a lack of fundamental understanding of catalyst structure, activity, and reaction mechanisms.

答案：近来，用于减少NOx排放的汽车催化技术在使用微孔材料方面取得了进展，以解决传统三元催化剂在处理高空气与燃料比的所谓稀燃发动机时的局限性。新开发的沸石基催化剂，如CuSSZ-13和CuSAPO-34，不仅表现出极高的NOx转化率和N2选择性，而且在高温下展现出极高的水热稳定性，这对于实际应用至关重要。然而，该领域面临挑战，需要提高性能、增强稳定性和降低生产成本，主要是由于对催化剂结构、活性和反应机制的基本理解不足。
