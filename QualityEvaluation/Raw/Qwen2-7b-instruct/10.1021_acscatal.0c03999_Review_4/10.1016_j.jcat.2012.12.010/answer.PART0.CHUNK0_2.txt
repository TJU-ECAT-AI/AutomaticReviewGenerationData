[1] "The critical function of the structure of Fe counter-ion species, Brnsted sites and crystal size of Fe-ZSM-5 for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene and N2O decomposition was elucidated by using two series of Fe-zeolites with crystal size 0.15 and 2 μm differing in population of the individual Fe and Brnsted sites."

The structure of Fe counter-ion species, Brnsted sites, and crystal size of Fe-ZSM-5 play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the zeolite in the reactions of propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene and N2O decomposition. The study utilized two series of Fe-zeolites with varying crystal sizes (0.15 μm and 2 μm) and differing populations of Fe and Brnsted sites to elucidate these functions.

[1] "Steaming of these Fe-zeolites at 600 °C resulted in a low concentration of Fe(II) ions and Fe-oxo species in the cationic sites. Predominant part of Fe was Td-coordinated Fe(III) (43-47%) bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species, and as Fe-oxide particles (30-33%)."

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在600°C下蒸气处理这些Fe-沸石导致了催化位点中Fe(II)离子和Fe-氧物种的浓度降低。大部分Fe以Td配位的Fe(III)离子形式存在（43%-47%），并被束缚在额外框架FeAAlASi物种内，以及作为Fe-氧化物颗粒（30%-33%）。
