[1] "The structure and population of ion-exchanged Fe ions, Fe-oxo species, and Fe-oxo oligomers and Fe2O3 oxide particles and the concentration of acid sites in non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 were elucidated using semi-quantitative Mssbauer and FTIR analysis supplemented by UVVis and H2-TPR."
[2] "The differences in the concentration of the individual Fe species and acid sites were related to the activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in decomposition of N2O and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O."
[3] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
[4] "Bare counter Fe ions balanced by AlASiASiAAl sequences in 6MRs of the framework undergo reversible redox Fe(III)O/Fe(II) cycle during N2O/evacuation treatments and represent the most active site in the decomposition of N2O to molecular components."
[5] "In contrast, both mono-, dinuclear Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(III)-oxo oligomers are reduced by propane to Fe(II) at conditions of the C3H8/N2O reaction."
[6] "The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."
[7] "Thus, high concentration of counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is critical for high activity in N2O decomposition, whereas high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O is achieved regardless of population of the individual dispersed Fe species."
[8] "The low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites, not supporting propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5."

1. The structure and population of ion-exchanged Fe ions, Fe-oxo species, and Fe-oxo oligomers, along with the concentration of acid sites in Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites, were studied using Mssbauer, FTIR, UVVis, and H2-TPR techniques. These characteristics were related to the activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in N2O decomposition and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O.

2. The redox state of Fe in Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites was influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and propane/N2O. Bare Fe ions balanced by AlASiASiAAl sequences in the framework 6-member rings were identified as the most active site for N2O decomposition.

3. Mono-, dinuclear Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(III)-oxo oligomers were reduced by propane to Fe(II) under the conditions of the C3H8/N2O reaction. 

4. High concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites facilitated the oligomerization of propene, leading to a decrease in its yield and an increase in the retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke.

5. High concentration of counter Fe(III)-oxo species easily reducible to Fe(II) is crucial for high activity in N2O decomposition, while high yield of propene in C3H8/N2O reactions is achieved irrespective of the population of individual dispersed Fe species.

6. Low concentration of protonic sites and small crystallites of zeolites prevent propene oligomerization, accumulation of polyolefins in the pores, and their easy oxidation to CO/CO2, which are necessary conditions for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Fe-ZSM-5.

1. 使用Mssbauer、FTIR、UVVis和H2-TPR技术研究了Fe-ZSM-5分子筛中离子交换铁离子、Fe-氧物种和Fe-氧物种的结构与数量，以及酸性位点的浓度。这些特性与Fe-分子筛在N2O分解和丙烷N2O氧化脱氢化反应中的活性和停留时间行为相关联。

2. Fe-ZSM-5分子筛中Fe的还原状态受N2O分解和丙烷/N2O反应条件的影响。在框架六元环中由AlASiASiAAl序列平衡的裸Fe离子被识别为N2O分解过程中的最活跃位点。

3. 在C3H8/N2O反应条件下，单核、二核Fe(III)-氧物种和Fe(III)-氧物种寡聚体被丙烷还原为Fe(II)。

4. 高浓度的Brnsted位点和大晶体尺寸的FeH-ZSM-5分子筛促进了丙烯的聚合并导致其产量降低，同时增加了聚烯烃等至聚芳香族焦炭的保留量。

5. 高浓度的反相Fe(III)-氧物种容易还原为Fe(II)，这对N2O分解具有高活性至关重要；而在C3H8/N2O反应中，无论分散Fe物种的数量如何，丙烯的高产率仍然可以实现。

6. 低浓度的质子位点和小晶体尺寸的分子筛阻止了丙烯聚合，避免了聚烯烃在孔隙中的积累，并且使其容易氧化成CO/CO2，这些都是在Fe-ZSM-5上选择性氧化脱氢化丙烷以生成丙烯所必需的条件。
