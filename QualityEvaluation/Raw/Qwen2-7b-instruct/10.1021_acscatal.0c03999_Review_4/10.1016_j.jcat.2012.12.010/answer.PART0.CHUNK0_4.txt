[1] "The structure and population of ion-exchanged Fe ions, Fe-oxo species, and Fe-oxo oligomers and Fe2O3 oxide particles and the concentration of acid sites in non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 were elucidated using semi-quantitative Mssbauer and FTIR analysis supplemented by UVVis and H2-TPR."
[2] "Differences in the concentration of the individual Fe species and acid sites were related to the activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in decomposition of N2O and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O."
[3] "The steaming of both FeH-zeolites was accompanied by changes in the state of the Fe ions reflected in broadening of the CT absorption of the Fe(III) ions."
[4] "While the steaming at 600 C led to a substantial decrease in the concentration of the Brnsted sites consistent with the release of Al from the framework."
[5] "Fe(II) ions balanced by AlO 4 tetrahedra in the framework are highly stabilized and did not undergo reduction by hydrogen up to approximately 700 C."
[6] "The steaming results in fewer Fe(II) ions capable of binding an oxygen atom from N2O (Fe(III)AO) and also in a decrease in the population of Fe(III)AOn- AFe(III) species connected with the cationic sites (300400 C), and an increase in polynuclear oligomeric Fe-oxo species and Fe-oxide- like species, reduced above 450 C."
[7] "All these specific features of Fe counter-ion species related to changes in the structure and population of the Fe species,their redox behavior, and population of acid sites during Fe-zeolite steaming were observed for both FeH-ZSM-5 samples regardless of the crystal size."
[8] "The steaming of both FeH-zeolites was accompanied by changes in the state of the Fe ions reflected in broadening of the CT absorption of the Fe(III) ions."
[9] "The steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites with low concentration of acidic protons, low concentration of Fe(II) in cationic sites and high population of Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in the FeAAlASi extra-framework species and small Fe-oxide particles have been obtained for investiga- tion into their behavior in reactions of nitrous oxide (for summary see Fig. 7)."

1. The structure and population of Fe ions, Fe-oxo species, and Fe-oxo oligomers in Fe-ZSM-5 were studied using various spectroscopic techniques. The concentration of acid sites was also examined.

2. Differences in Fe species and acid site concentration correlate with the activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in N2O decomposition and propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Steaming altered the state of Fe ions in Fe-zeolites, causing broadening of the CT absorption of Fe(III) ions.

4. Steaming led to a decrease in the concentration of Brnsted sites, consistent with the release of Al from the framework.

5. Fe(II) ions in the framework are highly stabilized and do not reduce at temperatures up to 700°C.

6. Steaming decreased the population of Fe(II) ions capable of binding oxygen from N2O, increased polynuclear Fe-oxo species, and formed Fe-oxide-like particles.

7. Changes in Fe species structure, redox behavior, and acid site population during steaming were observed across FeH-ZSM-5 samples regardless of crystal size.

8. Steaming broadened the CT absorption of Fe(III) ions.

9. Steamed Fe-zeolites showed a low concentration of acidic protons, a low concentration of Fe(II) in cationic sites, and a high population of Td-coordinated Fe(III) ions in extra-framework species and Fe-oxide particles.

1. 使用多种光谱技术研究了Fe-ZSM-5中Fe离子、Fe-氧化物物种和Fe-氧化物寡聚体的结构和分布。酸性位点的浓度也进行了检查。

2. Fe物种和酸性位点的浓度差异与Fe-沸石在N2O分解和丙烷氧化脱氢化过程中的活性和时间-流行为相关。

3. 焙烧导致了Fe-沸石中Fe离子状态的变化，使Fe(III)离子的CT吸收宽度增加。

4. 焙烧导致Brnsted位点浓度下降，与框架中Al的释放一致。

5. 在700°C以下温度下，框架中的Fe(II)离子高度稳定且不会减少。

6. 焙烧减少了能够结合N2O中的氧原子的Fe(II)离子数量，增加了聚核Fe-氧化物物种，并形成了Fe-氧化物粒子。

7. 不论晶粒大小，FeH-ZSM-5样品中的Fe物种结构、还原行为和酸性位点分布均显示出在焙烧期间的变化。

8. 焙烧使Fe(III)离子的CT吸收宽度增加。

9. 焙烧后Fe-沸石表现出低浓度的酸性位点、低浓度的Fe(II)在阳离子位点、以及FeAAlASi额外框架物种中Td协调的高Fe(III)离子数量和Fe-氧化物颗粒。
