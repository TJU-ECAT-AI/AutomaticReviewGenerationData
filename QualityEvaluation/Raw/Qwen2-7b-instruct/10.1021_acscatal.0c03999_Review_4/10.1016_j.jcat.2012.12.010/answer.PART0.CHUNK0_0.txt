[1] "Steaming of these Fe-zeolites at 600°C resulted in a low concentration of Fe(II) ions and Fe-oxo species in the cationic sites. Predominant part of Fe was Td-coordinated Fe(III) (43-47%) bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species, and as Fe-oxide particles (30-33%)."

2.After steaming at 600°C, the concentration of Fe(II) ions and Fe-oxo species in the cationic sites of the Fe-zeolites decreased. The majority of Fe was Td-coordinated Fe(III) (43-47%) bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species and as Fe-oxide particles (30-33%).

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

2.在600°C蒸气处理后，Fe-沸石中催化性Fe(II)离子和Fe-氧物种的浓度降低。大部分Fe为Td配位的Fe(III)（43%-47%），位于额外框架FeAAlASi物种内，以及作为Fe-氧化物颗粒（30%-33%）。

[1] "The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. That was mainly caused by the low concentration of protonic sites limiting propene oligomerization."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

4.The increased and stable propene yields were achieved because the steamed Fe-zeolites had a lower concentration of protonic sites, which limited propene oligomerization.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

4.更高的且更稳定的丙烯产率是因为蒸煮后的Fe-沸石中具有较低的质子位点浓度，这限制了丙烯的聚合。

[1] "The higher and stable yields of propene were achieved over the steamed Fe-zeolites. On contrary, with FeH-ZSM-5 and particularly of larger crystals, retention of more reactive polyolefins in the pores in TOS increases their oxidation to CO/CO2."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

7.Higher and more stable propene yields were obtained with the steamed Fe-zeolites. Conversely, in FeH-ZSM-5, especially in larger crystals, the retention of more reactive polyolefins in the pores during time-on-stream increases their oxidation to CO/CO2.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

7.在蒸煮后的Fe-沸石上，得到了更高且更稳定的丙烯产率。相反，在FeH-ZSM-5中，特别是在较大晶体中，孔中保留的更活泼的聚烯烃在时间上增加到CO/CO2的氧化。
