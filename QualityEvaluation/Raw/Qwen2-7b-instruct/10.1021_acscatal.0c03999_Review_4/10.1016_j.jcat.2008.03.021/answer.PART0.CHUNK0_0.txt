[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
[5] "Com-paring the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

1. This research focused on studying the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 using a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides.
2. The highest initial activity and propylene yield were found at x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 series.
3. A notable discovery was the significantly improved stability of Ga5Al5O15 at high conversion levels.
4. The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides is attributed to the presence of numerous specific surface acid sites associated with tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites, which arise from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solutions within these mixed-oxide systems.
5. By comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity, it was determined that weak surface acidity, specifically the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and stability.

1. 此研究专注于使用一系列GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物来研究丙烷在二氧化碳存在或不存在情况下的催化脱氢。
2. 在GaxAl10xO15系列中，x=8时表现出最高的初始活性和丙烯产率。
3. 一个显著发现是Ga5Al5O15在高转化率水平下表现出显著增强的稳定性。
4. GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的增强催化活性归因于其表面酸位点的存在，这些酸位点与四面体表面Ga3+离子相关联，并且源自Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体在混合体系中的形成。
5. 通过比较NH3-TPD结果和丙烷脱氢化活性，确定了弱表面酸性，特别是表面弱Lewis酸位密度，在实现高活性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。
