[2] "In this respect, an important reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "This was prompted by Nakagawa's reports of exceptionally high activity of the commercial Ga2O3 for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours."
[5] "In the present study, we investigated the development of a new, efficient Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution system exhibiting significantly enhanced activity and stability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[6] "Our results demonstrate that the formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the favorable creation of a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity, which makes the Ga2O3-based catalysts highly active and stable for the reaction."
[7] "The participation of surface Ga3+ Lewis sites in gallia-based catalysts for hydrocarbon activation has been reported."
[8] "In this context, it has been suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeds on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, which may play a role in the chemical activation of propane by proton abstraction, leading to the formation of propyl-gallium adspecies."
[9] "For all of the catalysts, propane conversion decreased with increasing reaction time."
[10] "The amounts of coke deposited on the four Ga-containing catalysts in both processes evaluated by TGA, given in Table 1, indicate that the markedly enhanced stability of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency as a function of time on stream, which appears to be rather unique in this type of application."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 have distinct effects on the reaction. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorph exhibits the highest activity and stability due to the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution, which leads to an abundance of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ sites. These sites contribute to the weak Lewis acidity of the surface, which is crucial for achieving high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorph shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, indicating the superior thermal stability of the Ga2O3Al2O3 materials compared to simple γ-Ga2O3.
