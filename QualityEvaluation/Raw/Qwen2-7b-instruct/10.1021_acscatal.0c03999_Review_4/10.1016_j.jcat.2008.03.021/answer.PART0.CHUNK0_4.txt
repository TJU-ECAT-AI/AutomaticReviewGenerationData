[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[4] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
[5] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

1. The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, γ-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest catalytic activity, while α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3 show lower activity due to their different surface properties and Lewis acid sites.
2. The maximum initial activity and propylene yield for the dehydrogenation of propane were observed at x = 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides. This indicates that the optimal composition of the mixed oxides is critical for achieving high catalytic performance.
3. The significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15 is attributed to the formation of a Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution, which creates abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites.
4. The catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides is linked to the abundance of specific surface acid sites, particularly weak Lewis acid sites associated with tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites, resulting from the formation of the Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems.
5. The comparison of the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity indicates that weak surface acidity, specifically the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface, plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and stability.

1. 不同的Ga2O3晶型（α-，β-，γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质在CO2-ODHP反应中对其催化性能产生影响。具体而言，γ-Ga2O3显示出最高的催化活性，而α-、β-和δ-Ga2O3由于其不同的表面性质和Lewis酸位点表现出较低的活性。
2. 在GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物中，x = 8时观察到最大初始活性和丙烯产量。这表明混合氧化物的最佳组成对于实现高催化性能至关重要。
3. Ga5Al5O15在高转化水平下表现出显著增强的稳定性，这是由于形成了Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体，该固溶体创造了与四面体表面Ga3+位点相关的丰富特定表面酸位点。
4. GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的催化活性与丰富的特定表面酸位点有关联，特别是与四面体表面Ga3+位点相关的弱Lewis酸位点，这些位点来自于形成在混合氧化物体系中的Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体。
5. 比较NH3-TPD结果和丙烷脱氢化活性表明，弱表面酸性，特别是表面弱Lewis酸位点的密度，在实现高活性和稳定性中起着关键作用。
