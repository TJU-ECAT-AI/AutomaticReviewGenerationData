[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks."
[2] "In this respect, an important reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "This was prompted by Nakagawa's reports of exceptionally high activity of the commercial Ga2O3 for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2."
[4] "Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours."
[5] "In the present study, we investigated the development of a new, efficient Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution system exhibiting significantly enhanced activity and stability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[6] "Our results demonstrate that the formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the favorable creation of a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity, which makes the Ga2O3-based catalysts highly active and stable for the reaction."
[7] "The participation of surface Ga3+ Lewis sites in gallia-based catalysts for hydrocarbon activation has been reported."
[8] "In this context, it has been suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeds on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, which may play a role in the chemical activation of propane by proton abstraction, leading to the formation of propyl-gallium adspecies."
[9] "For all of the catalysts, propane conversion decreased with increasing reaction time."
[10] "The amounts of coke deposited on the four Ga-containing catalysts in both processes evaluated by TGA, given in Table 1, indicate that the markedly enhanced stability of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency as a function of time on stream, which appears to be rather unique in this type of application."

1. The dehydrogenation of alkanes is significant for producing alkenes from inexpensive and reactive feedstocks. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a key process in this context.
2. Ga2O3 has been reported to exhibit exceptionally high activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2.
3. Extensive efforts have been made to understand the reaction mechanism and controlling factors for dehydrogenation, but Ga2O3-based catalysts often lose activity rapidly.
4. A new Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution system was developed to enhance the activity and stability of propane dehydrogenation.
5. The formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 creates a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity, making the Ga2O3 catalysts highly active and stable.
6. Surface Ga3+ Lewis sites play a crucial role in the activation of hydrocarbons, potentially enabling the proton abstraction from propane.
7. Propane conversion decreased over time for all catalysts tested.
8. The enhanced stability of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 is attributed to their low coking tendency over time, a unique feature in this application.

1. 对于从反应性低且成本低廉的饱和前体中制备烯烃，烷烃脱氢化是一个极其重要的过程。丙烷脱氢化为丙烯是这一领域中的关键过程。
2. Nakagawa报告称，商业Ga2O3在CO2存在下对乙烷脱氢化至乙烯表现出极高的活性。
3. 已经进行了大量努力来理解脱氢化反应机制和控制因素，但基于Ga2O3的催化剂通常在其活性急剧下降后不久就失去活性。
4. 研究人员开发了一种新的Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体系统，以增强丙烷脱氢化的活性和稳定性。
5. 在Ga2O3和Al2O3之间形成的镓铝氧化物固溶体可以产生更多的表面镓位点，具有较弱的路易斯酸性，使得Ga2O3基催化剂具有高活性和稳定性。
6. 表面Ga3+路易斯位点在镓基催化剂中参与烃类激活的作用已经被报道，这可能使丙烷通过质子抽取激活。
7. 所有催化剂的丙烷转化率随反应时间增加而减少。
8. 在CO2存在的条件下，GaxAl10xO15催化剂表现出显著增强的稳定性，其归因于这些催化剂随时间降低的结焦倾向，这是此类应用中的一种独特特性。
