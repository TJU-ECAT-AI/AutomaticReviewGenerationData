[1] "The present work studied the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of CO2 over a series of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides."
[2] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum initial activity and propylene yield were observed at x = 8."
[3] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[4] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 have distinct effects on the reaction. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorph exhibits the highest activity and stability due to the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution, which leads to an abundance of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ sites. These sites contribute to the weak Lewis acidity of the surface, which is crucial for achieving high activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorph shows significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels, indicating the superior thermal stability of the Ga2O3Al2O3 materials compared to simple γ-Ga2O3.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-, β-, γ-, 和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，尤其是酸碱性和Lewis酸性位点，在CO2-ODHP反应中对其催化性能产生影响。γ-Ga2O3表现出最高活性和稳定性，这归因于Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体的形成，这导致表面富含与四面体Ga3+位点相关的酸性位点。这些位点为表面提供了弱Lewis酸性，这对于在丙烷脱氢过程中实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。γ-Ga2O3显示出在高转化率水平下显著增强的稳定性，表明Ga2O3Al2O3材料具有比简单γ-Ga2O3更好的热稳定性。
