[1] "Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts exhibit different catalytic behavior for the two dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "Correlation between catalytic activity for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 and surface acidity and basicity of GZ catalysts has been found."

The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by these factors. Specifically, the catalytic activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 correlates with the surface acidity and basicity of the Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts. This correlation is due to the role of acidic sites in enhancing the adsorption and activation of ethylbenzene molecules, while basic sites facilitate the abstraction of hydrogen atoms to form styrene.

不同Ga2O3相态（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，包括酸性和碱性，显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。这些因素解释了反应初期和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性。特别是，Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂上表面酸性和碱性与乙基苯脱氢反应在CO2存在的催化活性之间存在相关性。这种相关性是由于酸性位点在增强乙基苯分子吸附和活化方面的作用，同时碱性位点有助于氢原子的抽象形成苯乙烯。
