[1] "Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts exhibit different catalytic behavior for the two dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "According to this reaction mechanism, both acid and base sites are necessary for the reaction."
[3] "The same variation trend of GZ catalysts for EB dehydrogenation activity, the number of medium to strong acid sites and total base sites with the Ga2O3 content is observed."
[4] "Moreover, the selectivity to propene is lower than that to styrene, indicating that the side reaction of cracking is more serious during the dehydrogenation of propane."
[5] "In the absence of CO2, EB conversion and propane conversion over the 15GZ catalyst are 32.3% and 26.1%, respectively, lower than those in the presence of CO2."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by the presence of both acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surfaces. As Ga2O3 content increases, the number of medium to strong acid sites and total base sites also increases, correlating with enhanced catalytic activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. In contrast, the dehydrogenation of propane exhibits lower selectivity towards propene, indicating a more severe side reaction of cracking. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation reaction through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and facilitates the elimination of coke via the Boudouard reaction.

不同Ga2O3多晶形态的结构特征、表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有着显著影响。在反应的初始和稳态阶段，活性趋势和选择性的解释基于催化剂表面存在的酸性和碱性位点。随着Ga2O3含量的增加，中强酸位和总碱位的数量也增加，与乙基苯脱氢化活性增强相关。相反，丙烷脱氢化选择性向丙烯较低，表明裂解副反应更为严重。CO2通过逆水煤气变换反应促进了脱氢反应，并通过布杜瓦尔反应促进焦炭的消除。
