How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

[1] "Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts exhibit different catalytic behavior for the two dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "According to this reaction mechanism, both acid and base sites are necessary for the reaction."
[3] "The same variation trend of GZ catalysts for EB dehydrogenation activity, the number of medium to strong acid sites and total base sites with the Ga2O3 content is observed."
[4] "Moreover, the selectivity to propene is lower than that to styrene, indicating that the side reaction of cracking is more serious during the dehydrogenation of propane."
[5] "In the absence of CO2, EB conversion and propane conversion over the 15GZ catalyst are 32.3% and 26.1%, respectively, lower than those in the presence of CO2."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by the presence of both acidic and basic sites on the catalyst surfaces. As Ga2O3 content increases, the number of medium to strong acid sites and total base sites also increases, correlating with enhanced catalytic activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation. In contrast, the dehydrogenation of propane exhibits lower selectivity towards propene, indicating a more severe side reaction of cracking. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation reaction through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and facilitates the elimination of coke via the Boudouard reaction.

不同Ga2O3多晶形态的结构特征、表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有着显著影响。在反应的初始和稳态阶段，活性趋势和选择性的解释基于催化剂表面存在的酸性和碱性位点。随着Ga2O3含量的增加，中强酸位和总碱位的数量也增加，与乙基苯脱氢化活性增强相关。相反，丙烷脱氢化选择性向丙烯较低，表明裂解副反应更为严重。CO2通过逆水煤气变换反应促进了脱氢反应，并通过布杜瓦尔反应促进焦炭的消除。

The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by these factors. Specifically, the catalytic activity for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 correlates with the surface acidity and basicity of the Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts. This correlation is due to the role of acidic sites in enhancing the adsorption and activation of ethylbenzene molecules, while basic sites facilitate the abstraction of hydrogen atoms to form styrene.

不同Ga2O3相态（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，包括酸性和碱性，显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。这些因素解释了反应初期和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性。特别是，Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂上表面酸性和碱性与乙基苯脱氢反应在CO2存在的催化活性之间存在相关性。这种相关性是由于酸性位点在增强乙基苯分子吸附和活化方面的作用，同时碱性位点有助于氢原子的抽象形成苯乙烯。

Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2 has been investigated and compared. Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts exhibit different catalytic behavior for the two dehydrogenation reactions. 

Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene is of increasing significance due to the growing demand for propene.

In order to understand the role of CO2 in the reaction, the amount of CO in the reaction product on 15GZ as a representative catalyst was measured. For EB dehydrogenation, the amount of CO formed is 1.5 as much as that of hydrocarbon products (styrene, benzene and toluene) after 30 min on stream. For propane dehydrogenation, the amount of CO formed is 2.8 as much as that of hydrocarbon products (propane, methane, ethane and ethene) after 10 min on stream.

In the absence of CO2, EB conversion and propane conversion over the 15GZ catalyst are 32.3% and 26.1%, respectively, lower than those in the presence of CO2. Therefore, one role of CO2 is to promote the dehydrogenation reaction through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. The other role of CO2 could be the elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction.

This research investigates the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts in the presence of CO2. The catalysts show differing behaviors for these two reactions. The amount of CO generated in the reaction varies depending on whether the reactants are ethylbenzene or propane. The presence of CO2 plays a dual role: it enhances the dehydrogenation reaction through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and aids in coke removal through the Boudouard reaction.

[1] "In this work, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated and compared."
[2] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the intensity of diffractive peaks for GZ catalysts is weakened,suggesting that the degree of crystalline ZrO2 order is decreased."
[3] "The above observation is in consistence with the XRD results."
[4] "The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is enhanced markedly after the incorporation of gallium oxide, whereas the selectivity to styrene declines to some extent."
[5] "Moreover, the selectivity to propene is lower than that to styrene, indicating that the side reaction of cracking is more serious during the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane was studied using Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts. As the concentration of Ga2O3 increases, the intensity of diffraction peaks decreases, indicating a reduction in the crystalline order of ZrO2. 

2. Incorporating gallium oxide into the ZrO2 catalyst significantly boosts its activity for dehydrogenation reactions. However, this leads to a slight decrease in styrene selectivity.

3. During the propane dehydrogenation process, the selectivity for propene is lower than for styrene, suggesting a more severe side reaction of cracking occurs.

1. 对于乙基苯和丙烷的脱氢反应，使用了Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂进行了研究。随着Ga2O3浓度的增加，衍射峰的强度降低，表明ZrO2的结晶秩序有所减少。

2. 在加入镓氧化物后，ZrO2催化剂的活性显著提高，但这导致了对苯乙烯的选择性略有下降。

3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烯的选择性低于苯乙烯，这表明裂解的副反应更为严重。
