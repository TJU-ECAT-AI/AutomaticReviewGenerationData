[1] "In this work, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane over Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated and compared."
[2] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the intensity of diffractive peaks for GZ catalysts is weakened,suggesting that the degree of crystalline ZrO2 order is decreased."
[3] "The above observation is in consistence with the XRD results."
[4] "The activity of the ZrO2 catalyst is enhanced markedly after the incorporation of gallium oxide, whereas the selectivity to styrene declines to some extent."
[5] "Moreover, the selectivity to propene is lower than that to styrene, indicating that the side reaction of cracking is more serious during the dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and propane was studied using Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts. As the concentration of Ga2O3 increases, the intensity of diffraction peaks decreases, indicating a reduction in the crystalline order of ZrO2. 

2. Incorporating gallium oxide into the ZrO2 catalyst significantly boosts its activity for dehydrogenation reactions. However, this leads to a slight decrease in styrene selectivity.

3. During the propane dehydrogenation process, the selectivity for propene is lower than for styrene, suggesting a more severe side reaction of cracking occurs.

1. 对于乙基苯和丙烷的脱氢反应，使用了Ga2O3ZrO2催化剂进行了研究。随着Ga2O3浓度的增加，衍射峰的强度降低，表明ZrO2的结晶秩序有所减少。

2. 在加入镓氧化物后，ZrO2催化剂的活性显著提高，但这导致了对苯乙烯的选择性略有下降。

3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，丙烯的选择性低于苯乙烯，这表明裂解的副反应更为严重。
