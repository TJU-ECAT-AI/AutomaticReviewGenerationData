1. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the α-Ga2O3 polymorph showed the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through its specific Lewis acid sites. Meanwhile, β-Ga2O3 demonstrated better selectivity towards the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favored the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 was noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it suitable for prolonged use in industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 had a moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

1. 不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能有显著影响。具体而言，α-Ga2O3晶型显示出最高的活性，因为它通过特定的Lewis酸中心有效地促进了氧化脱氢过程。另一方面，β-Ga2O3因其独特的表面性质显示出了更好的产物选择性，这有利于形成产物而不是副产品。γ-Ga2O3被注意到在反应条件下具有稳定性，使其适合工业应用中的长时间使用。最后，δ-Ga2O3的催化性能适中，受到其酸性和碱性之间的平衡的影响。
