<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors lead to varying activity trends and selectivity. The mechanisms underlying these observed phenomena have been elucidated.
