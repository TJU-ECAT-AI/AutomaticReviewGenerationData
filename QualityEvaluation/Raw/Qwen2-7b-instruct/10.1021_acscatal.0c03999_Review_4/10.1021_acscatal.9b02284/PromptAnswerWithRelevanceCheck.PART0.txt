[1] "The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) have significant influences on their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions."
[2] "The α-Ga2O3 polymorph showed the highest activity due to its specific Lewis acid sites which promote the oxidative dehydrogenation process efficiently."
[3] "β-Ga2O3, on the other hand, displayed better selectivity towards the desired product thanks to its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts."
[4] "γ-Ga2O3 was noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it suitable for prolonged use in industrial applications."
[5] "δ-Ga2O3 was found to have a moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity."

1. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the α-Ga2O3 polymorph showed the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through its specific Lewis acid sites. Meanwhile, β-Ga2O3 demonstrated better selectivity towards the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favored the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 was noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it suitable for prolonged use in industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 had a moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

1. 不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能有显著影响。具体而言，α-Ga2O3晶型显示出最高的活性，因为它通过特定的Lewis酸中心有效地促进了氧化脱氢过程。另一方面，β-Ga2O3因其独特的表面性质显示出了更好的产物选择性，这有利于形成产物而不是副产品。γ-Ga2O3被注意到在反应条件下具有稳定性，使其适合工业应用中的长时间使用。最后，δ-Ga2O3的催化性能适中，受到其酸性和碱性之间的平衡的影响。
