Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. It also does not propose mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
