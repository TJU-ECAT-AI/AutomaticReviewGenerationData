The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The acidity and basicity of the surface determine the catalyst's activity and selectivity, while Lewis acid sites facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction can be attributed to the unique structural and surface properties of each Ga2O3 polymorph.

不同Ga2O3晶相的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及路易斯酸中心，对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂性能产生影响。表面的酸性和碱性决定了催化剂的活性和选择性，而路易斯酸中心则促进脱氢氧化过程。在初始阶段和稳态阶段的反应中观察到的活性趋势和选择性，可以归因于每种Ga2O3晶相的独特结构和表面性质。
