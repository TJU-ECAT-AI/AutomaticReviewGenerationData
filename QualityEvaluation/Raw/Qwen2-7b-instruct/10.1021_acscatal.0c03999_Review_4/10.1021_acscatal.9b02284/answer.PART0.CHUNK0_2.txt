The structural characteristics, surface properties (specifically acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors affect the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction, leading to distinct activity trends and selectivity patterns during both the initial and steady-state stages. Mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate these effects, highlighting the role of each property in enhancing or hindering the reaction process.
