"The conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites [l - 71."
[L35]
"When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[L36]
"The above mechanism would account for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga@-HZSM-5 in comparison to HZSM-5 and Ga- NaZSM-5 catalysts, and indeed is compatible with all the experimental findings; propene hydrogenation was not observed during a D,--C,H, exchange study in the range 413 - 503 K [ 131."

The document discusses the catalytic activity of Ga2O3 and its influence on the dehydrogenation of propane into propene over HZSM-5 zeolites. The study indicates that the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5 compared to Ga2O3 on Na-ZSM-5 catalysts is attributed to a bifunctional reaction mechanism involving both Ga2O3 and H+.

The key points are:
1. Gallium or zinc incorporation into HZSM-5 zeolites significantly improves the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics.
2. The dehydrogenation of propane into propene is catalyzed by protons over HZSM-5. The conversion increases with the acidity of HZSM-5, indicated by its Al content.
3. Gallium oxide-supported zeolites show additional dehydrogenation of propane, suggesting a dual site mechanism involving both Ga2O3 and H+.
4. The mechanism explains how the gallium alkoxide intermediate rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the propyl carbenium ion, facilitating propene formation.
5. The bifunctional mechanism accounts for the enhanced dehydrogenating activity of Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5 compared to Ga2O3 on Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, and it is consistent with all experimental findings.

The document does not discuss the influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions or provide details on the mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

文档讨论了Ga2O3及其在HZSM-5沸石催化剂上的脱氢活性对丙烷转化为丙烯的影响。研究表明，Ga2O3支持在HZSM-5上的增强脱氢活性与H+的存在有关，这归因于一个双功能反应机制，涉及Ga2O3和H+。

主要观点包括：
1. 铟或锌的引入显著提高了低烷烃转化为芳香族化合物的转化率。
2. 在HZSM-5上，丙烷脱氢为丙烯由质子催化。随着HZSM-5酸性的增加（通过其Al含量表示），丙烷的转化率提高。
3. Ga2O3支持的沸石显示额外的丙烷脱氢，暗示了一个涉及Ga2O3和H+的双重位点机制。
4. 机制解释了在HZSM-5上支持的Ga2O3的增强脱氢活性相对于Na-ZSM-5上的Ga2O3催化剂，并且与所有实验结果一致，丙烯氢化未在413-503K范围内观察到。
5. 双功能机制解释了Ga2O3支持在HZSM-5上的增强脱氢活性相对于Na-ZSM-5上的Ga2O3催化剂的原因，并且与所有实验结果相符合。

文档没有讨论不同形态的Ga2O3对CO2-ODHP反应的影响，也没有提供关于活动趋势和反应初始及稳态阶段选择性的机制细节。
