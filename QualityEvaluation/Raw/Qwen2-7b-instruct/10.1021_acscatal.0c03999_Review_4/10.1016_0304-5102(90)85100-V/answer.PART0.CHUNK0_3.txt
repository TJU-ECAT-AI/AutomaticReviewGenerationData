[L31] "It is well established that the conversion of lower alkanes into aro- matics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites [l - 71."
[L32] "Furthermore,it was shown that H, was heterolytically dissociated over Gaz03 [lo]."
[L33] "Since it was considered that the dehydrogenation of propane is difficult over H+ but rather rapid over Zn2+-HZSM-5 [2] or Ga-HZSM-5 [3, 51."
[L34] "The striking feature ob- served in this study is the role of the acidity on the apparent activity of GazOs for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[L35] "When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl surface migration reaction:"
[L36] "Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is to bypass the slow step (4): GaOCsH, --+ GaOH + C&H,which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6)."

The acidity of the zeolite supports the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3 in propane conversion. Ga2O3 on HZSM-5 exhibits a bifunctional mechanism, combining the action of Ga2O3 and the acidity of the zeolite. This allows for the rapid formation of propyl carbenium ions, which then exchange with a zeolite proton to form propene. The presence of both Ga2O3 and the zeolite acidity facilitates a faster conversion process than observed with pure Ga2O3 or HZSM-5 alone.

酸性对沸石支持的Ga2O3在丙烷转化中的活性至关重要。在HZSM-5上，Ga2O3表现出双功能机制，结合了Ga2O3和沸石的酸性作用。这允许快速形成丙基碳烯离子，然后与沸石质子交换形成丙烯。Ga2O3的存在以及沸石的酸性共同促进了一个比纯Ga2O3或单独的HZSM-5更快的转化过程。
