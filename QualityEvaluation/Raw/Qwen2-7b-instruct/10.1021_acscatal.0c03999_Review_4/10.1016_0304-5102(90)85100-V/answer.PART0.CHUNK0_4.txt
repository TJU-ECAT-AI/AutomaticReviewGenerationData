The introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites significantly improves the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics. Chemical composition measurements were performed using absorption spectrophotometry. Catalytic tests were executed at atmospheric pressure with a continuous fixed-bed microreactor. Table 1 demonstrates the propane conversion over various ZSM-5-based catalysts at 773 K and atmospheric pressure.
