[1] "Introduction It is well established that the conversion of lower alkanes into aro- matics is considerably enhanced by the introduction of gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites [l - 71."
[2] "It was found that the con- version of propane increased with the acidity of HZSM-5, i.e., with Al content."
[3] "Furthermore,it was shown that H, was heterolytically dissociated over Gaz03 [lo]."
[4] "In order to study the role of H+ and GazOs in the formation of propene from propane,it was importt to minimize the consecutive oligomeriza- tion and aromatization of the propene."
[5] "Indeed,by converting the GazOs-Na form (sample A) into the Ga20s-H form (sample A) a two-fold increase in the rate of dehydrogenation into propene is observed."
[6] "Prop- ylene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium:"

The document discusses the role of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and proton acidity on the dehydrogenating activity of Ga2O3-supported HZSM-5 catalysts. It highlights that the conversion of lower alkanes into aromatics is significantly enhanced by incorporating gallium or zinc into HZSM-5 zeolites. The acidity of the zeolite, represented by its aluminum content, plays a crucial role in increasing the conversion of propane into propene. Gallium oxide is shown to heterolytically dissociate hydrogen. To investigate the role of hydrogen and gallium oxide in propane dehydrogenation, the study aimed to minimize consecutive oligomerization and aromatization of propene. A two-fold increase in the rate of dehydrogenation into propene is observed when gallium oxide in the Na-form is converted into the Ga2O3-H form. Propylene formation results from a rapidly established equilibrium.

文档讨论了镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和质子酸性在Ga2O3支持的HZSM-5催化剂中的脱氢活性作用。它指出，通过在HZSM-5沸石中加入镓或锌，可以显著增强低烷烃转化为芳香族化合物。质子酸性，由其铝含量表示，对丙烷转化为丙烯的转化具有重要作用。显示了镓氧化物的氢异裂解。为了研究氢和镓氧化物在丙烷脱氢的作用，研究旨在最小化丙烯的连续多聚化和芳构化。观察到当在Na形式的镓氧化物转换为Ga2O3-H形式时，脱氢率增加两倍。当在Na形式中存在镓氧化物时，丙烷脱氢率提高两倍。丙烯的形成是由迅速建立的平衡决定的。
