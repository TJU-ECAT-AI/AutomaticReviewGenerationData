[1] "The highest propane conversion achieved on GA-HS catalyst was 35.2%, which was much higher than that of GA-GM (8.7%) prepared using grind-mixture method and GA-CP (26.2%) prepared using coprecipitation method."
[2] "Moreover, propylene selectivity over GA-HS was highest among these catalysts during the whole reaction time."
[3] "It is deduced that the reduced Ga species are probably generated by the hydrothermal synthesis."
[4] "This process made more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites expose on the surface of GA-HS, which contributed to formation of surface Lewis acid sites."
[5] "The texture of GA-HS was largely recovered with air regeneration even after 9 h reaction time well."
[6] "Higher surface area and larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+) related to strong Lewis acid sites were responsible for the superior activity of GA- HS catalyst."

1. The Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst prepared using hydrothermal synthesis method, named GA-HS, showed excellent activity for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. It achieved the highest propane conversion rate of 35.2%, significantly higher than those prepared by grind-mixture (8.7%) and coprecipitation (26.2%) methods. 

2. Propylene selectivity over GA-HS was the highest among the tested catalysts throughout the entire reaction duration.

3. The hydrothermal synthesis process likely led to the creation of reduced Ga species on the catalyst surface.

4. The hydrothermal process exposed more tetrahedral Ga3+ ions on the surface of GA-HS, facilitating the formation of surface Lewis acid sites.

5. Even after 9 hours of reaction time, the texture of GA-HS was largely restored upon air regeneration.

6. The superior activity of GA-HS catalyst was attributed to its larger surface area and a higher concentration of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and possibly Gaδ+) associated with strong Lewis acid sites.

1. 使用水热合成方法制备的Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂，命名为GA-HS，对于二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢表现出优异的活性。其丙烷转化率最高达到35.2%，显著高于通过磨混合（8.7%）和共沉淀（26.2%）方法制备的催化剂。

2. GA-HS催化剂在整个反应时间内，丙烯选择性最高。

3. 水热合成过程可能产生了催化剂表面的还原Ga物种。

4. 水热处理使得GA-HS表面上更多的四面体Ga3+离子暴露出来，促进了表面Lewis酸位点的形成。

5. 即使在9小时的反应时间后，GA-HS的纹理在空气再生后仍能大量恢复。

6. GA-HS催化剂的优越活性归因于其更大的表面积和更多四面体Ga离子（Ga3+和可能的Gaδ+）与强Lewis酸位点的高浓度。
