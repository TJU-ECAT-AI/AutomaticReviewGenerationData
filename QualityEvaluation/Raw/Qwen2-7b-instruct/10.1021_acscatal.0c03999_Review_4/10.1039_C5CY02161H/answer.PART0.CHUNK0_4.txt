[1] "Hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a highly active Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS),which displayed superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2). The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much higher than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%)."
[2] "These catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques."
[3] "It can be seen that GA-HS possesses more Ga3+ ions in the tetrahedral sites than GA-GM and GA-CP because of more number of Lewis acid sites on GA-HS inferred from by NH3-TPD,thereby showing better catalytic performance substantially."
[4] "On the other hand,60 propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of time on stream on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 are some low in comparison with that on fresh GA-HS, implying that the coke can be partly eliminated with CO2 through Boudouard reaction."

1. The hydrothermal synthesis method led to the creation of a Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS) that showed superior performance in converting propane to propylene in the presence of CO2, achieving a conversion rate of 35.2%, significantly higher than catalysts prepared using other methods like grind-mixture or coprecipitation, which achieved 8.7% and 26.2% respectively.

2. The catalysts' properties were analyzed using a variety of techniques including N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR, and 71Ga MAS NMR. 

3. The analysis revealed that GA-HS had a higher concentration of Ga3+ ions in tetrahedral positions, which contributed to the formation of more Lewis acid sites, enhancing its catalytic activity.

4. After regenerating GA-HS with CO2, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity decreased over time, indicating that CO2 helped remove coke deposits through the Boudouard reaction, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness.

1. 水热合成方法制备的Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂（GA-HS）在二氧化碳存在下，表现出优越的丙烷脱氢为丙烯性能，最高转化率达到35.2%，远高于使用研磨混合或沉淀法等其他方法制备的催化剂，后者的转化率分别为8.7%和26.2%。

2. 催化剂的性质通过N2物理吸附、ICP-AES、XRD、TGA、TEM、SEM、DRIFT、Py-FTIR、NH3-TPD、XPS、27Al MAS NMR和71Ga MAS NMR等多种技术进行了分析。

3. 分析结果显示，GA-HS中的Ga3+离子在四面体位置的浓度更高，从而形成了更多的酸性位点，显著提高了其催化活性。

4. 对于再生后的GA-HS，在使用二氧化碳再生后，随着反应时间的推移，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性有所下降，表明二氧化碳通过布杜瓦德反应帮助去除焦炭沉积，减少了催化剂的效率。
