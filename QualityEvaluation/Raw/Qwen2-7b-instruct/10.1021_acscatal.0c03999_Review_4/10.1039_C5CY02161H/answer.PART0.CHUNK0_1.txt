[1] "Hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a highly active Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS),which displayed superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2)."

[2] "The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much higher than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%)."

[3] "Moreover, propylene selectivity over GA-HS catalyst was higher than that over other catalysts in a period of 9 h reaction."

[4] "These catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques."

[5] "The characterization data indicated that hydrothermal treatment increased the surface area, expanded the pore size and promoted the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and generation of more medium-strong Lewis acid sites."

[6] "The superior activity of GA-HS was attributed to higher surface area of this catalyst and larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+) related to medium-strong Lewis acid sites."

The study reports that a Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst prepared through hydrothermal synthesis demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The catalyst achieved a propane conversion rate of 35.2%, significantly surpassing those prepared using grind-mixture (8.7%) or coprecipitation methods (26.2%). Propylene selectivity over this catalyst was also notably higher than other catalysts over a 9-hour reaction period. The catalyst's activity is attributed to an increased surface area, expanded pore size, and the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and medium-strong Lewis acid sites following hydrothermal treatment. These factors contributed to the catalyst's superior performance in the CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation process.

研究显示，采用水热合成法制备的Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下展现出卓越的丙烷脱氢为丙烯的催化性能。该催化剂的丙烷转化率高达35.2%，显著优于通过研磨混合法（8.7%）或共沉淀法（26.2%）制备的催化剂。此外，在9小时的反应时间内，该催化剂的丙烯选择性也明显高于其他催化剂。催化剂的活性归因于水热处理后表面面积的增加、孔径的扩展以及形成更多四面体Ga离子和中等强度Lewis酸位点，这些因素共同促进了其在CO2辅助下的丙烷脱氢过程的优越表现。
