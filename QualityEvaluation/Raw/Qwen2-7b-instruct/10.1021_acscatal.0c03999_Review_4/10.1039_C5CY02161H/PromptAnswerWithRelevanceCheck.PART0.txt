[1] "Hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a highly active Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS),which displayed superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2)."
[2] "The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much higher than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%)."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. In particular, the hydrothermal synthesis of Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts (GA-HS) led to a high surface area, expanded pore size, and the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and medium-strong Lewis acid sites. This resulted in a superior catalytic performance, as evidenced by a high propane conversion of 35.2% on GA-HS, significantly higher than those of catalysts prepared using grind-mixture (8.7%) or coprecipitation (26.2%) methods. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of GA-HS facilitated the activation of propane, forming propyl-Ga species, which then underwent subsequent decomposition to generate dehydrogenation products. The activity of GA-HS was attributed to the higher surface area and the larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and possibly Gaδ+ with δ< 2) associated with medium-strong Lewis acid sites.

不同Ga2O3相态（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响。特别是在采用水热合成法制备的Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂（GA-HS）中，高表面积、孔径扩展以及更多四面体Ga离子和中等强Lewis酸位点的形成，导致了优异的催化性能。GA-HS上的Lewis酸位点促进了丙烷的活化，形成了丙基-Ga物种，随后进一步分解生成脱氢产物。GA-HS的活性归因于其更高的表面积和更多的四面体Ga离子（Ga3+和可能的Gaδ+，δ< 2）与中等强Lewis酸位点相关联。通过这些特性，GA-HS实现了高达35.2%的丙烷转化率，远高于采用研磨混合法（8.7%）或共沉淀法（26.2%）制备的催化剂。

The study reports that a Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst prepared through hydrothermal synthesis demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The catalyst achieved a propane conversion rate of 35.2%, significantly surpassing those prepared using grind-mixture (8.7%) or coprecipitation methods (26.2%). Propylene selectivity over this catalyst was also notably higher than other catalysts over a 9-hour reaction period. The catalyst's activity is attributed to an increased surface area, expanded pore size, and the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and medium-strong Lewis acid sites following hydrothermal treatment. These factors contributed to the catalyst's superior performance in the CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation process.

研究显示，采用水热合成法制备的Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下展现出卓越的丙烷脱氢为丙烯的催化性能。该催化剂的丙烷转化率高达35.2%，显著优于通过研磨混合法（8.7%）或共沉淀法（26.2%）制备的催化剂。此外，在9小时的反应时间内，该催化剂的丙烯选择性也明显高于其他催化剂。催化剂的活性归因于水热处理后表面面积的增加、孔径的扩展以及形成更多四面体Ga离子和中等强度Lewis酸位点，这些因素共同促进了其在CO2辅助下的丙烷脱氢过程的优越表现。
