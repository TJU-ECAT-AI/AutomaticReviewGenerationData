[1] "The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much higher than the catalysts prepared using grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%)."
[2] "Propylene selectivity over GA-HS catalyst was higher than that over other catalysts in a period of 9 h reaction."
[3] "These catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques."
[4] "The characterization data indicated that hydrothermal treatment increased the surface area, expanded the pore size and promoted the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and generation of more medium-strong Lewis acid sites."
[5] "The superior activity of GA-HS was attributed to higher surface area of this catalyst and larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+) related to medium-strong Lewis acid sites."
[6] "The presence of carbon dioxide is not positive to promote the dehydrogenation of propane as expected."
[7] "It is thought that the low-coordinated GaT cations contributed to the activity of Ga2O3- containg catalysts for DHP-CO2."
[8] "The content of total GaT ions of GA-HS is higher than GA-GM and GA-CP."
[9] "The surface Ga/Al ratio of GA- GM is lower than bulk Ga/Al ratio, while the surface Ga/Al ratios of GA-CP and GA-HS are higher than their bulk Ga/Al ratios."
[10] "It can be seen that the GA-CP and GA-HS only show one oxidation state, and Ga 2p1/2 binding energy (BE) value for GA-CP is higher than that for GA- GM."
[11] "The spent GA-HS with or without CO2 shows two binding energy peaks in Ga 3d XPS spectra at about 24.1 eV and 20.8 eV assigned to O2s and Ga3+ 3d bands respectively, and yet the original low-energy peak at 19.6 eV attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ< 2) disappears."

1. GA-HS catalyst showed significantly higher propane conversion (35.2%) compared to those prepared by grind-mixture (8.7%) or coprecipitation (26.2%) methods. 
2. Propylene selectivity over GA-HS was superior to other catalysts during a 9-hour reaction period.
3. Various characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the catalysts' properties.
4. Hydrothermal treatment enhanced surface area, pore size, and facilitated the formation of tetrahedral Ga ions and medium-strong Lewis acid sites.
5. The enhanced activity of GA-HS was linked to its higher surface area and greater concentration of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and possibly Gaδ+).
6. Carbon dioxide was found not to positively influence propane dehydrogenation as anticipated.
7. Low-coordinated GaT ions were implicated in enhancing catalyst activity for DHP-CO2 reactions.
8. The total content of GaT ions in GA-HS was higher than in GA-GM and GA-CP.
9. The surface Ga/Al ratio of GA-GM was lower than the bulk ratio, while that of GA-CP and GA-HS was higher.
10. GA-CP and GA-HS displayed a single oxidation state, with GA-CP having a higher Ga 2p1/2 binding energy than GA-GM.
11. After exposure to CO2, the spent GA-HS showed two binding energy peaks in Ga 3d XPS spectra, indicative of the disappearance of the low-energy peak associated with Gaδ+ species.

1.GA-HS催化剂在丙烷转化率上的表现（35.2%）明显优于通过研磨混合方法（8.7%）或沉淀法（26.2%）制备的催化剂。
2.在持续9小时的反应过程中，GA-HS催化剂的丙烯选择性高于其他催化剂。
3.采用了多种表征技术来评估催化剂的性能。
4.水热处理提高了表面面积、孔径，并促进了四面体镓离子和强Lewis酸位点的生成。
5.GA-HS的高活性归因于其较高的表面面积和更多的四面体镓离子（Ga3+和可能的Gaδ+）。
6.碳二酸并未如预期那样对丙烷脱氢反应产生正面影响。
7.低配位的GaT离子被认为有助于Ga2O3-系催化剂的DHP-CO2反应活性。
8.GA-HS中的总GaT离子含量高于GA-GM和GA-CP。
9.GA-GM的表面Ga/Al比低于其内部比例，而GA-CP和GA-HS的表面比率高于内部比率。
10.GA-CP和GA-HS仅表现出单一氧化状态，GA-CP的Ga 2p1/2结合能高于GA-GM。
11.暴露于CO2之后，GA-HS的废弃样品在Ga 3d XPS光谱中显示出两个结合能峰，在约24.1 eV和20.8 eV分别对应O2s和Ga3+ 3d带，原先与低能峰（对应Gaδ+物种，δ< 2）相关的低能量峰消失。
