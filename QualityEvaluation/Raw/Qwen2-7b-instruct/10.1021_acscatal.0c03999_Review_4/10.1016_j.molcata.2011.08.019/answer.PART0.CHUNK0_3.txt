[1] "Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure."
[2] "The combination of different techniques (chemical analysis with BunsenRupp method, ICP, XRD, UVvis DRS and quantitative/qualitative H2-TPR) in the characterization of the calcined catalysts revealed that the chromium species anchored on the surface of mesoporous supports show structural properties similar to those on the conventional silicas, but a higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved using mesoporous supports due to their much higher SBET."
[3] "In situ UVvis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites, similar as in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[4] "The reduction of Cr6+ species generates dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites at the beginning of the DHPCO2 that participate in nonoxidative pathway of propene formation."
[5] "In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

The study compared the catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts supported on different siliceous supports, including conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p and SiO2-a) and mesoporous siliceous sieves (SBA-1 and SBA-15). These catalysts contained 0.77 wt.% of Cr. The researchers used a variety of characterization techniques to assess the structural properties and dispersion of chromium species on the surfaces of these supports. They found that while the structural properties of the chromium species on mesoporous supports were similar to those on conventional silicas, a higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved with the use of mesoporous supports due to their higher surface area. The study also highlighted the role of Cr6+ species in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, noting that they were rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, suggesting that they act as precursors rather than active sites in this process. Additionally, the study suggested that the presence of Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites could facilitate an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and contribute to the consumption of hydrogen produced in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane via reverse water-gas shift reaction.

研究比较了不同硅基支持物上负载的铬氧化物催化剂的催化性能，包括常规无定形二氧化硅（SiO2-p和SiO2-a）和多孔硅质筛（SBA-1和SBA-15）。这些催化剂含有0.77 wt.%的Cr。研究人员使用多种表征技术评估了这些支撑物表面的铬物种的结构特性和分散性。他们发现，虽然多孔支撑物上的铬物种的结构特性与常规二氧化硅相似，但由于其更高的比表面积，可以在多孔支撑物上实现更高分散的铬物种。研究还强调了在CO2存在的条件下丙烷脱氢过程中Cr6+物种的作用，指出它们被快速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，表明它们在该过程中作为前体而不是活性位点。此外，研究提出，在存在CO2的情况下，Cr3+和Cr2+位点可能参与丙烯形成过程中的另一种氧化途径，并有助于非氧化性丙烷脱氢过程中由逆水煤气变换反应产生的氢的消耗。
