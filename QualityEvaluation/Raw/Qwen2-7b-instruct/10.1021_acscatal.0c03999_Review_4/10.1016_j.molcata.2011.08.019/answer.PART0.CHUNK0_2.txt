The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propene (1) or the consumption of hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation (3).

The first, direct oxidative pathway with CO2 was proposed in the case of redox oxides (Cr, V, and Fe), whereas in the case of non-redox materials, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 participates mainly in the removal of H2 in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

(ii) The oxide catalysts which are active in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective.

(iii) Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties. This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials. CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8, 9, 13].

In the case of gallium oxide materials, CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation activity of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst but suppresses that of the Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts [17].

The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., isoelectric point IEP) [29–31].

Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2, 4, 32–35].

When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, what makes it useless as a catalyst [30].

The document provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane, detailing the different pathways involved, particularly focusing on the role of CO2 in direct oxidation and reverse water-gas shift reactions. It highlights the importance of Cr and Ga in catalysts for dehydrogenation processes. The document also discusses the dependence of catalytic activity on the support properties and the specific oxidation states of Cr species. It suggests that CO2 can have both promoting and inhibitory effects on catalyst activity depending on the type of support used.
