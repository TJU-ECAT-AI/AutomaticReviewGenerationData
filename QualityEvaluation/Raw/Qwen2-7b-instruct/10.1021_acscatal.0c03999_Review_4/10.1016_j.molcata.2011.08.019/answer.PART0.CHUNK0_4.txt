[1] "Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure."
[2] "The combination of different techniques (chemical analysis with BunsenRupp method, ICP, XRD, UVvis DRS and quantitative/qualitative H2-TPR) in the characterization of the calcined catalysts revealed that the chromium species anchored on the surface of mesoporous supports show structural properties similar to those on the conventional silicas, but a higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved using mesoporous supports due to their much higher SBET."
[3] "In situ UVvis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites, similar as in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[4] "The reduction of Cr6+ species generates dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites at the beginning of the DHPCO2 that participate in nonoxidative pathway of propene formation."
[5] "In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

The structural characteristics of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-form typically shows higher activity due to its specific surface area and the presence of more Lewis acid sites, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants. β-Ga2O3 might exhibit lower activity due to a less favorable arrangement of the oxygen atoms that hinder the reaction pathways. γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs are known for their stability and resistance to sintering, which can contribute to their catalytic performance, especially in terms of longevity. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 forms under high pressures and temperatures, often showing unique catalytic properties related to its crystal structure, which can affect its reactivity with CO2 and other reactants in the ODHP process. These observations suggest that the structure and surface chemistry of Ga2O3 polymorphs play critical roles in determining their efficiency in CO2-ODHP reactions, influencing both the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的催化性能存在显著差异。α型通常表现出更高的活性，因为其具有较大的比表面积和更多的Lewis酸位点，这有利于反应物的吸附与活化。β-Ga2O3可能显示出较低的活性，因为氧原子的排列不利于反应途径的进行。γ-Ga2O3晶型因其稳定性及抗烧结性而著称，这些特性有助于其在催化性能上的表现，尤其是在耐久性方面。最后，δ-Ga2O3在高压高温条件下形成，其独特的晶体结构可能导致其对CO2和其他反应物在ODHP过程中的反应性产生独特影响。这些观察结果表明，Ga2O3晶型的结构和表面化学性质在其CO2-ODHP反应效率中扮演着关键角色，不仅影响初始阶段还影响稳定状态阶段的反应。
