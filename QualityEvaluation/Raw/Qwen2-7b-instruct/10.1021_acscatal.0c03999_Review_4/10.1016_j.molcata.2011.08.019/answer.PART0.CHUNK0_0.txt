The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways.

The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propene (1) or the consumption of hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation (3).

C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O (1)
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O (2)
C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (3)

The first, direct oxidative pathway with CO2 was proposed in the case of redox oxides (Cr, V, and Fe), whereas in the case of non-redox materials, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 participates mainly in the removal of H2 in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

(ii) The oxide catalysts which are active in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective.

(iii) Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties.

This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials.

CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13].

In the case of gallium oxide materials, CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation activity of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst but suppresses that of the Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts [17].

The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction.

These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., isoelectric point IEP).

For obtaining a high activity, a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved.

Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species.

These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure.

In this work, we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica.

Using various physicochemical characterization techniques, we investigated the influence of Cr loading and supports properties on the surface composition and Cr dispersion.

Finally, based on the characterization results of catalysts, we discussed the catalytic performance in the DHPCO2 process.

The study presents a comparative analysis of chromium oxide catalysts supported on different siliceous supports, specifically focusing on mesoporous materials with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structures, alongside conventional amorphous silicas. The authors explore how chromium species anchored on the surface of these supports exhibit similar structural properties compared to those on conventional silicas, but with enhanced dispersion attributed to the higher specific surface areas of mesoporous supports. This enhanced dispersion is crucial for the stabilization of Cr6+ species, which are considered essential for high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHPCO2). The Cr6+ species facilitate the formation of propene via a non-oxidative pathway, and their rapid reduction during the DHPCO2 process suggests they serve as precursors rather than active sites. Additionally, the presence of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicates a role in an alternative oxidative pathway and hydrogen consumption, highlighting the versatility of chromium species in these catalytic processes.

The authors also discuss the influence of CO2 on the catalytic properties of the different chromium oxide-based catalysts, noting that CO2 can have both promoting and poisoning effects depending on the nature of the support. This effect is particularly evident in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials, where CO2 influences the dehydrogenation activity of catalysts containing Cr2O3, Ga2O3, TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 differently. The study underscores the importance of considering factors such as the type of chromium precursor, preparation conditions, chromium content, and the properties of the silica support when aiming to achieve high activity in dehydrogenation reactions with CO2, emphasizing the potential benefits of utilizing high surface area mesoporous materials for dispersing chromium species effectively.

本研究对不同硅基支持物上负载的铬氧化物催化剂进行了比较分析，特别关注具有立方（SBA-1）和六角形（SBA-15）孔结构的多孔材料，以及商用硅胶。作者探索了这些支持物表面上锚定的铬物种与传统硅胶上物种在结构性质上的相似性，但通过更高特定表面积的多孔材料实现了更高的铬物种分散度。这种增强的分散度对于稳定Cr6+物种至关重要，而Cr6+物种被认为是DHPCO2过程中高活性的关键因素。Cr6+物种促进丙烷非氧化性脱氢形成丙烯，并且在DHPCO2过程中的快速还原表明它们作为前体而非活性位点发挥作用。此外，Cr3+和Cr2+物种的存在表明在另一种氧化途径中参与丙烯形成并消耗由非氧化性脱氢过程产生的氢气，突显了铬物种在这类催化过程中的多功能性。

作者还讨论了CO2对不同铬氧化物基催化剂催化性能的影响，指出CO2可以产生促进或毒化效应，具体取决于支持物的性质。这一效应在支持铬、镓氧化物材料的情况下尤为明显，在Cr2O3/Al2O3、Cr2O3/SiO2、Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂中表现出不同的影响。研究强调了在实现CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应时考虑因素如铬前体类型、制备条件、铬含量以及二氧化硅支持物属性的重要性，特别是在利用高表面面积多孔材料有效分散铬物种方面。

本研究通过使用各种物理化学表征技术，考察了催化剂中Cr负载量和支撑物特性对表面组成和Cr分散度的影响，并基于催化剂表征结果讨论了DHPCO2过程中的催化性能。
