Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure.

The combination of different techniques (chemical analysis with BunsenRupp method, ICP, XRD, UVvis DRS, and quantitative/qualitative H2-TPR) in the characterization of the calcined catalysts revealed that the chromium species anchored on the surface of mesoporous supports show structural properties similar to those on the conventional silicas, but a higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved using mesoporous supports due to their much higher SBET.

This reflects in higher content of Cr6+ species stabilized in comparison with conventional silicas.

The Cr6+ species was found to be crucial for high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHPCO2).

The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts.

In situ UVvis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites, similar as in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).

The reduction of Cr6+ species generates dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites at the beginning of the DHPCO2 that participate in nonoxidative pathway of propene formation.

In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1. Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts were prepared with different SBET values ranging from 261 to 1181 m^2/g for conventional amorphous silicas and from 477 to 750 m^2/g for mesoporous siliceous sieves. These catalysts contained 0.77 wt.% of chromium. The SBET value refers to the specific surface area, highlighting the increased surface area in the mesoporous supports.

2. The calcined catalysts showed that the chromium species anchored on the surface of mesoporous supports displayed similar structural properties compared to those on conventional silicas. However, a higher dispersion of chromium species was achieved with mesoporous supports due to their significantly higher specific surface area.

3. The content of Cr6+ species was higher in the catalysts prepared with mesoporous supports compared to those with conventional silicas. The presence of Cr6+ species was crucial for the high activity of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

4. The rate of propene formation was found to increase almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts. 

5. In situ UVvis DRS measurements during the DHPCO2 process indicated that the Cr6+ species were rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species when exposed to a stream of CO2 and propane. This suggests that the Cr6+ species serve as precursors rather than active sites, similar to their role in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

6. The reduction of Cr6+ species generated dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites at the beginning of the DHPCO2 process, which participated in the nonoxidative pathway of propene formation. In the presence of CO2, these Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites could also contribute to an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and the consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP through a reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1. 准备了四系列含0.77 wt.%铬的铬氧化物基催化剂，其中常规无定形二氧化硅的SBET值从261 m^2/g到1181 m^2/g，而介孔硅质筛子的SBET值从477 m^2/g到750 m^2/g。这些催化剂的SBET值表明，介孔支持材料具有更高的表面面积。

2. 焙烧后的催化剂显示，锚定在介孔支持材料表面上的铬物种与常规二氧化硅表面的结构特性相似，但通过介孔支持材料实现的铬物种的分散性更高，这归因于它们显著较高的特定表面积。

3. 介孔支持材料制备的催化剂中Cr6+物种的含量高于常规二氧化硅制备的催化剂。Cr6+物种对于在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢的高活性至关重要。

4. 丙烯形成速率发现几乎与焙烧催化剂中的Cr6+物种浓度成正比增加。

5. 在DHPCO2过程中进行的原位紫外可见光谱测量表明，当暴露于二氧化碳和丙烷流时，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种。这表明Cr6+物种作为前体而不是活性位点，类似于它们在非氧化脱氢过程中丙烷的作用。

6. Cr6+物种的还原在DHPCO2过程初期生成了分散的Cr3+和Cr2+位点，参与了丙烯的非氧化形成途径。在二氧化碳的存在下，这些Cr3+和Cr2+位点也可能参与一种替代的氧化丙烯形成途径，并通过DHP中的逆水煤气变换反应消耗生成的氢气。
