The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2, propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways.

The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propene (1) or the consumption of hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation (3).

C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O (1)
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O (2)
C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (3)

The first, direct oxidative pathway with CO2 was proposed in the case of redox oxides (Cr, V, and Fe), whereas in the case of non-redox materials, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 participates mainly in the removal of H2 in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

(ii) The oxide catalysts which are active in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2.

Among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective.

(iii) Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promoting or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties.

This can be seen most clearly in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials.

CO2 has a negative effect on the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, while a promoting effect is observed over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst [8,9,13].

In the case of gallium oxide materials, CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation activity of the Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst but suppresses that of the Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts [17].

The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction.

These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., isoelectric point IEP).

For obtaining a high activity, a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved.

Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species.

These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure.

In this work, we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica.

Using various physicochemical characterization techniques, we investigated the influence of Cr loading and supports properties on the surface composition and Cr dispersion.

Finally, based on the characterization results of catalysts, we discussed the catalytic performance in the DHPCO2 process.

The study presents a comparative analysis of chromium oxide catalysts supported on different siliceous supports, specifically focusing on mesoporous materials with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structures, alongside conventional amorphous silicas. The authors explore how chromium species anchored on the surface of these supports exhibit similar structural properties compared to those on conventional silicas, but with enhanced dispersion attributed to the higher specific surface areas of mesoporous supports. This enhanced dispersion is crucial for the stabilization of Cr6+ species, which are considered essential for high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHPCO2). The Cr6+ species facilitate the formation of propene via a non-oxidative pathway, and their rapid reduction during the DHPCO2 process suggests they serve as precursors rather than active sites. Additionally, the presence of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicates a role in an alternative oxidative pathway and hydrogen consumption, highlighting the versatility of chromium species in these catalytic processes.

The authors also discuss the influence of CO2 on the catalytic properties of the different chromium oxide-based catalysts, noting that CO2 can have both promoting and poisoning effects depending on the nature of the support. This effect is particularly evident in the case of supported chromium and gallium oxide materials, where CO2 influences the dehydrogenation activity of catalysts containing Cr2O3, Ga2O3, TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 differently. The study underscores the importance of considering factors such as the type of chromium precursor, preparation conditions, chromium content, and the properties of the silica support when aiming to achieve high activity in dehydrogenation reactions with CO2, emphasizing the potential benefits of utilizing high surface area mesoporous materials for dispersing chromium species effectively.

本研究对不同硅基支持物上负载的铬氧化物催化剂进行了比较分析，特别关注具有立方（SBA-1）和六角形（SBA-15）孔结构的多孔材料，以及商用硅胶。作者探索了这些支持物表面上锚定的铬物种与传统硅胶上物种在结构性质上的相似性，但通过更高特定表面积的多孔材料实现了更高的铬物种分散度。这种增强的分散度对于稳定Cr6+物种至关重要，而Cr6+物种被认为是DHPCO2过程中高活性的关键因素。Cr6+物种促进丙烷非氧化性脱氢形成丙烯，并且在DHPCO2过程中的快速还原表明它们作为前体而非活性位点发挥作用。此外，Cr3+和Cr2+物种的存在表明在另一种氧化途径中参与丙烯形成并消耗由非氧化性脱氢过程产生的氢气，突显了铬物种在这类催化过程中的多功能性。

作者还讨论了CO2对不同铬氧化物基催化剂催化性能的影响，指出CO2可以产生促进或毒化效应，具体取决于支持物的性质。这一效应在支持铬、镓氧化物材料的情况下尤为明显，在Cr2O3/Al2O3、Cr2O3/SiO2、Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂中表现出不同的影响。研究强调了在实现CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应时考虑因素如铬前体类型、制备条件、铬含量以及二氧化硅支持物属性的重要性，特别是在利用高表面面积多孔材料有效分散铬物种方面。

本研究通过使用各种物理化学表征技术，考察了催化剂中Cr负载量和支撑物特性对表面组成和Cr分散度的影响，并基于催化剂表征结果讨论了DHPCO2过程中的催化性能。

Four series of chromium oxide-based catalysts containing 0.77 wt.% of Cr were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of conventional amorphous silicas (SiO2-p; SBET = 261 m2 g−1 and SiO2-a; SBET = 477 m2 g−1) and mesoporous siliceous sieves with cubic (SBA-1; SBET = 1181 m2 g−1) and hexagonal (SBA-15; SBET = 750 m2 g−1) pore structure.

The combination of different techniques (chemical analysis with BunsenRupp method, ICP, XRD, UVvis DRS, and quantitative/qualitative H2-TPR) in the characterization of the calcined catalysts revealed that the chromium species anchored on the surface of mesoporous supports show structural properties similar to those on the conventional silicas, but a higher dispersion of chromium species could be achieved using mesoporous supports due to their much higher SBET.

This reflects in higher content of Cr6+ species stabilized in comparison with conventional silicas.

The Cr6+ species was found to be crucial for high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHPCO2).

The rate of propene formation increases almost proportionally to the concentration of Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts.

In situ UVvis DRS measurements during DHPCO2 process evidences that the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly (in a stream of CO2 + propane) to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species indicating that the Cr6+ species are rather precursor than active sites, similar as in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).

The reduction of Cr6+ species generates dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites at the beginning of the DHPCO2 that participate in nonoxidative pathway of propene formation.

In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, may participate additionally in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and in a consumption of hydrogen produced in the DHP by reverse water-gas shift reaction.

However, a higher dispersion of chromium species was achieved with mesoporous supports due to their significantly higher specific surface area.

3. The content of Cr6+ species was higher in the catalysts prepared with mesoporous supports compared to those with conventional silicas. The presence of Cr6+ species was crucial for the high activity of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

1. 准备了四系列含0.77 wt.%铬的铬氧化物基催化剂，其中常规无定形二氧化硅的SBET值从261 m^2/g到1181 m^2/g，而介孔硅质筛子的SBET值从477 m^2/g到750 m^2/g。这些催化剂的SBET值表明，介孔支持材料具有更高的表面面积。

2. 焙烧后的催化剂显示，锚定在介孔支持材料表面上的铬物种与常规二氧化硅表面的结构特性相似，但通过介孔支持材料实现的铬物种的分散性更高，这归因于它们显著较高的特定表面积。

3. 介孔支持材料制备的催化剂中Cr6+物种的含量高于常规二氧化硅制备的催化剂。Cr6+物种对于在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢的高活性至关重要。

4. 丙烯形成速率发现几乎与焙烧催化剂中的Cr6+物种浓度成正比增加。

5. 在DHPCO2过程中进行的原位紫外可见光谱测量表明，当暴露于二氧化碳和丙烷流时，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种。这表明Cr6+物种作为前体而不是活性位点，类似于它们在非氧化脱氢过程中丙烷的作用。

6. Cr6+物种的还原在DHPCO2过程初期生成了分散的Cr3+和Cr2+位点，参与了丙烯的非氧化形成途径。在二氧化碳的存在下，这些Cr3+和Cr2+位点也可能参与一种替代的氧化丙烯形成途径，并通过DHP中的逆水煤气变换反应消耗生成的氢气。

These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and the properties of the silica support (e.g., isoelectric point IEP) [29–31].

Cr species on 3+, 5+, and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2, 4, 32–35].

When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage, amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed [35]. The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3, which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase, is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water [30]. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules. Moreover, crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, what makes it useless as a catalyst [30].

The structural characteristics of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-form typically shows higher activity due to its specific surface area and the presence of more Lewis acid sites, which facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants. β-Ga2O3 might exhibit lower activity due to a less favorable arrangement of the oxygen atoms that hinder the reaction pathways. γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs are known for their stability and resistance to sintering, which can contribute to their catalytic performance, especially in terms of longevity. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 forms under high pressures and temperatures, often showing unique catalytic properties related to its crystal structure, which can affect its reactivity with CO2 and other reactants in the ODHP process. These observations suggest that the structure and surface chemistry of Ga2O3 polymorphs play critical roles in determining their efficiency in CO2-ODHP reactions, influencing both the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中的催化性能存在显著差异。α型通常表现出更高的活性，因为其具有较大的比表面积和更多的Lewis酸位点，这有利于反应物的吸附与活化。β-Ga2O3可能显示出较低的活性，因为氧原子的排列不利于反应途径的进行。γ-Ga2O3晶型因其稳定性及抗烧结性而著称，这些特性有助于其在催化性能上的表现，尤其是在耐久性方面。最后，δ-Ga2O3在高压高温条件下形成，其独特的晶体结构可能导致其对CO2和其他反应物在ODHP过程中的反应性产生独特影响。这些观察结果表明，Ga2O3晶型的结构和表面化学性质在其CO2-ODHP反应效率中扮演着关键角色，不仅影响初始阶段还影响稳定状态阶段的反应。
