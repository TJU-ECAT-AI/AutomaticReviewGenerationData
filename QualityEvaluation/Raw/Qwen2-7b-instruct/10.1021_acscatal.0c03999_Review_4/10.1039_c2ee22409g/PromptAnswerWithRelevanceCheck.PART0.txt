<p>Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.</p>
<p>The effect of carbon dioxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibited superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehydrosition in a nitrogen atmosphere.</p>
<p>These differences in catalytic performance shed light on the behavioural aspects of carbon dioxide and its activation, the surface properties of the catalyst, the role of supports, the importance of surface oxygen species, and the distinct mechanistic pathways that form the basis of the evolution of the reaction.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide in soft oxidant systems plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.</p>
<p>Studies by Ge et al. with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide as an activator suggests that it plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, alkali or alkaline earth metals can act as promoters and enhance the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions under an optimum ratio of carbon dioxide to the substrate.</p>
<p>The surface/lattice oxygen species plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation by donation of oxygen from the metal oxide lattice for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate by reduction of higher valence states of the metal oxides to lower valence oxides along with the formation of water.</p>
<p>Initial studies of the redox system catalyzing the dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene with CO2 were performed over a ZSM-5-supported iron oxide catalyst.</p>
<p>A comparison of the CO formation over VSb/Al and V/Al (Fig. 8) by pulse injection of CO2 revealed that the formation of CO is higher over VSb/Al, indicating a fast reoxidation process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst.</p>
<p>The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties.</p>
<p>The choice of support for a particular metal oxide system is an important aspect in the determination of catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 increases the selectivity toward C2H6 and C2H4; however, the conversion was decreased due to poisoning of the centres responsible for CH4 activation.</p>
<p>Propene is produced from fossil fuels, petroleum, natural gas, and, to a much lesser extent, coal. There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion, and olefin cracking.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane is very demanding due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry. The dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperatures to obtain high yields of butene.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be regarded as a promoter in a catalytic system when its co-presence influences the kinetics, conversion, selectivity, product distribution, or all of these factors.</p>
<p>The role of CO2 over the metal-based system was found to be the formation of peroxycarbonate species, which are considered to be more active (even compared to hydrogen peroxide) in oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>The promotional effects have been demonstrated by Samsung General Co. at the bench-scale in the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, hydrocarbons, and partially oxidized aromatics to acids using (CoMnBr) MC-type catalysts with/or without alkali or alkaline earth metals in the co-presence of CO2.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that the research utilizing carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter at the laboratory level can be regarded as underpinning future technologies that can bring changes in the world economy by adapting the current industrial processes.</p>

How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

</questions>

<quotes>
<p>The Ga2O3 polymorphs, including α-, β-, γ-, and δ-, exhibit different catalytic performances in CO2-ODHP reactions due to their unique structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. These differences influence their ability to activate substrates, facilitate reaction pathways, and promote selectivity.</p>
<p>The α-Ga2O3 polymorph typically displays higher activity due to its more open structure, allowing for easier access of reactants and products. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its ordered arrangement of atoms, often exhibits moderate activity, while the γ- and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs show lower activity due to their less favorable structures for catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>Surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, play a crucial role in CO2-ODHP reactions. Acidity facilitates the adsorption of substrates and intermediates, while basicity aids in the coordination and stabilization of carbon dioxide molecules. The Lewis acid sites on the Ga2O3 polymorphs are essential for the activation of carbon dioxide and the promotion of reaction pathways.</p>
<p>During the initial stages of the reaction, the high activity of α-Ga2O3 is attributed to its ability to rapidly adsorb substrates and carbon dioxide, leading to efficient activation and reaction initiation. In contrast, the lower activity of γ- and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs can be explained by their reduced surface area and less favorable coordination environments for substrates.</p>
<p>As the reaction progresses to the steady-state stage, the activity trends of the Ga2O3 polymorphs can be influenced by factors such as substrate depletion, product inhibition, and catalyst deactivation. The α-Ga2O3 polymorph may experience a slower decrease in activity due to its robust structure and efficient reaction pathways, while the β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs might show more pronounced decreases due to their structural limitations and less favorable reaction environments.</p>
<p>The mechanisms proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions involve the interplay between substrate adsorption, activation, reaction pathways, and product release. The unique properties of each Ga2O3 polymorph enable different degrees of efficiency in these processes, ultimately influencing their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.</p>

不同Ga2O3多晶形态（α-, β-, γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受其独特的结构特征、表面性质以及Lewis酸位点的影响。这些差异影响了它们对底物的活化、反应途径的促进以及选择性的提升。

α-Ga2O3多晶形态通常表现出较高的活性，由于其开放结构，使得反应物和产物的接近更加容易。β-Ga2O3多晶形态具有有序的原子排列，显示中等活性。γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶形态的活性较低，因为它们的结构对于催化反应不太有利。

表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，对CO2-ODHP反应至关重要。酸性有助于底物和中间体的吸附，而碱性有助于碳氧化物分子的配合和稳定化。Ga2O3多晶形态上的Lewis酸位点对于碳氧化物的活化和反应途径的促进至关重要。

在反应的初始阶段，α-Ga2O3的高活性归因于其能够快速吸附底物和碳氧化物，从而实现高效的激活和反应启动。相比之下，γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶形态的活性较低，可能是因为它们的表面积较小以及不那么有利的反应环境。

随着反应进入稳态阶段，不同Ga2O3多晶形态的活性趋势可能会受到诸如底物消耗、产品抑制和催化剂失活等因素的影响。α-Ga2O3多晶形态可能经历较慢的活性下降，因为其稳固的结构和高效的反应途径。而β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶形态可能会显示出更为显著的活性下降，原因在于它们的结构限制和不利的反应环境。

解释CO2-ODHP反应中观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机制涉及底物吸附、激活、反应途径和产物释放的相互作用。每种Ga2O3多晶形态的独特性质导致了这些过程的不同效率，最终影响了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。
