<p>Carbon dioxide in its electronic ground state is a closed shell linear system with 1Sg + symmetry. The electronic structure of CO2 may be represented by a Walsh diagram (Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Based upon these observations, we may imagine that the acti- vation of CO2 on a surface may be by electron transfer from a surface to the CO2 molecule which, in turn, could lead to the occupation of this orbital via the formation of CO2 , which is a bent anion in its equilibrium geometry.</p>
