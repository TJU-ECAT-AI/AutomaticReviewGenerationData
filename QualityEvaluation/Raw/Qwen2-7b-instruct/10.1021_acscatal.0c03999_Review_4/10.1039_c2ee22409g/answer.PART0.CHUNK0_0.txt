<p>Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.</p>
<p>The effect of carbon dioxide in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene was studied by Park et al. over a zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst, which exhibited superior conversions compared with that of a simple dehydrosition in a nitrogen atmosphere.</p>
<p>These differences in catalytic performance shed light on the behavioural aspects of carbon dioxide and its activation, the surface properties of the catalyst, the role of supports, the importance of surface oxygen species, and the distinct mechanistic pathways that form the basis of the evolution of the reaction.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide in soft oxidant systems plays a prominent role in hydrogen abstraction from simple or functionalized hydrocarbons via the catalytic activation of carbon dioxide to form CO and oxygen species.</p>
<p>Studies by Ge et al. with density functional theory (DFT) slab calculations on (110) and (100) surfaces of g-Al2O3 demonstrated that the adsorption of CO2 occurs in a bidentate configuration across the OAl bridge sites, forming carbonate species.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide as an activator suggests that it plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, alkali or alkaline earth metals can act as promoters and enhance the catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions under an optimum ratio of carbon dioxide to the substrate.</p>
<p>The surface/lattice oxygen species plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation by donation of oxygen from the metal oxide lattice for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate by reduction of higher valence states of the metal oxides to lower valence oxides along with the formation of water.</p>
<p>Initial studies of the redox system catalyzing the dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene with CO2 were performed over a ZSM-5-supported iron oxide catalyst.</p>
<p>A comparison of the CO formation over VSb/Al and V/Al (Fig. 8) by pulse injection of CO2 revealed that the formation of CO is higher over VSb/Al, indicating a fast reoxidation process.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even in CO2 mediated oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the support can have a large influence on the performance of the catalyst.</p>
<p>The support brings modification of the properties of the dispersed active site by its acidic or basic properties.</p>
<p>The choice of support for a particular metal oxide system is an important aspect in the determination of catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The oxidative coupling of methane with CO2 increases the selectivity toward C2H6 and C2H4; however, the conversion was decreased due to poisoning of the centres responsible for CH4 activation.</p>
<p>Propene is produced from fossil fuels, petroleum, natural gas, and, to a much lesser extent, coal. There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion, and olefin cracking.</p>
<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane is very demanding due to the extensive utilization of butene or its products in the polymer industry. The dehydrogenation of n-butane is an equilibrium endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperatures to obtain high yields of butene.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide can be regarded as a promoter in a catalytic system when its co-presence influences the kinetics, conversion, selectivity, product distribution, or all of these factors.</p>
<p>The role of CO2 over the metal-based system was found to be the formation of peroxycarbonate species, which are considered to be more active (even compared to hydrogen peroxide) in oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>The promotional effects have been demonstrated by Samsung General Co. at the bench-scale in the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, hydrocarbons, and partially oxidized aromatics to acids using (CoMnBr) MC-type catalysts with/or without alkali or alkaline earth metals in the co-presence of CO2.</p>
<p>It is envisioned that the research utilizing carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter at the laboratory level can be regarded as underpinning future technologies that can bring changes in the world economy by adapting the current industrial processes.</p>
