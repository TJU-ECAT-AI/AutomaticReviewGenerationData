[5] "The co-presence of CO2 augmented the conversion of cyclic olefins and a significant difference was observed in the conversion and selectivity."
[6] "No significant change in the catalytic performance and DC% was observed after an increment of the gas ratio beyond 0.333, indicating saturation of activity."
[7] "The high selectivity of styrene in this selective dehydrogenation process suggests that a $2.7 million saving for 0.6 Mt of styrene monomer per year could be made."
[8] "The promotional effects have been demonstrated by Samsung General Co. at the bench-scale in the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, hydrocarbons and partially oxidized aromatics to acids using (CoMnBr) MC-type catalysts with/or without alkali or alkaline earth metals in the co-presence of CO2."
