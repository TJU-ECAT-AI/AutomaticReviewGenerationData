<p>Initial studies on the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide in catalytic transformations date back to the 1990s and form the basis of present day soft oxidant systems.</p>
<p>The present review paves the way for the development of alternative technologies utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter to produce chemicals.</p>
<p>Utilization of CO2 globally is envisaged by scientists as a necessity that could contribute not only to the mitigation of CO2 atmospheric levels, but also towards the economic, renewable and environmentally friendly synthesis of value added products.</p>
<p>One such technology, which is enjoying rapid growth, relates to the behavioral aspects of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic transformations.</p>
<p>At present, most ethyl benzene dehydrogenation plants are run by a simple dehydrogenation process using a superheated steam, which leads to the loss of a large amount of latent heat upon condensation at the gas-liquid separator. In addition, this reaction is thermodynamically limited as well as being energy consuming.</p>
<p>The promotional effects have been demonstrated by Samsung General Co. at the bench-scale in the oxidation of alkyl aromatics, hydrocarbons and partially oxidized aromatics to acids using (CoMnBr) MC-type catalysts with/or without alkali or alkaline earth metals in the co-presence of CO2.</p>
