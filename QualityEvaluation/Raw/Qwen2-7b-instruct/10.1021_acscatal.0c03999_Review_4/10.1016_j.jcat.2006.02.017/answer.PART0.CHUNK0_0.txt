[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[3] "Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed high activity due to the presence of abundant medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces. The Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts were less effective. Carbon dioxide positively influences the reaction over Ga2O3/TiO2 by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction. However, it negatively impacts Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 by displacing propane adsorbed on their basic sites. The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特性和表面性质影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高活性，因为它们表面上富含中强酸性位点。而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO催化剂则效果较差。二氧化碳在反应中对Ga2O3/TiO2具有积极影响，通过逆水煤气变换反应移除吸附在催化剂表面的H2。然而，它对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3有负面影响，通过取代它们的基本位点上的丙烷。脱氢反应可能通过异裂解途径进行，而不是还原氧化机制。
