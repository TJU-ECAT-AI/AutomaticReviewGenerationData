[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[3] "Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts showed high activity due to the presence of abundant medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces. The Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO catalysts were less effective. Carbon dioxide positively influences the reaction over Ga2O3/TiO2 by removing adsorbed H2 through the reverse watergas shift reaction. However, it negatively impacts Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 by displacing propane adsorbed on their basic sites. The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特性和表面性质影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高活性，因为它们表面上富含中强酸性位点。而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO催化剂则效果较差。二氧化碳在反应中对Ga2O3/TiO2具有积极影响，通过逆水煤气变换反应移除吸附在催化剂表面的H2。然而，它对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3有负面影响，通过取代它们的基本位点上的丙烷。脱氢反应可能通过异裂解途径进行，而不是还原氧化机制。

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The high activity of Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO is due to the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces. CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: positively by removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. XPS studies attribute the different behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts to the distinct interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation reaction is proposed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.

[9] "For Ga2O3/SiO2, because activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction is very low, it would be difficult for CO2 to react with the chemisorbed H2 over Ga2O3/SiO2, and thus a positive effect of CO2 would not be observed."

Distinct behaviors were observed when studying the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over five supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are superior catalysts compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, as they possess numerous medium to strong and strong acid sites on their surfaces. CO2 enhances dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but has a negative impact on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The differing support effects might stem from variations in the catalysts' hydrogen adsorption capabilities and acid-base properties, resulting from different interactions between gallium oxide and the support. XPS studies revealed a high density of reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, potentially explaining its unique catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction with CO2 present.

在研究五种支持的镓氧化物催化剂上无CO2或存在CO2下丙烷脱氢为丙烯的行为时，观察到了不同的行为。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2相比Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO更优，因为它们表面含有大量中到强和强酸中心。二氧化碳可以增强Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3有负面影响。这些不同的支持效果可能源自催化剂的氢吸附能力差异和酸碱性质差异，这可能是由于镓氧化物与支持之间的不同相互作用导致的。XPS研究表明，Ga2O3/TiO2表面有高密度的还原镓原子（45%），这可能解释了该催化剂在存在CO2下的独特催化行为。

1. The structural characteristics and surface properties, particularly the acidity and basicity, of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High activity is observed in catalysts with abundant medium-strong acid sites on the surface, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2, compared to ineffective catalysts like Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. 

2. The presence of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of Ga2O3 polymorphs enhances the dehydrogenation activity by facilitating the reactions that bypass the slow step, thus accelerating the total reaction rate.

3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) exhibits dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites.

4. The dehydrogenation reaction on supported gallium oxide catalysts likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway rather than a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.

2. Ga2O3晶相表面的中强酸性位点通过促进反应绕过缓慢步骤，从而加速总反应速率，提高了催化活性。

3. 碳二酸（CO2）在脱氢反应中表现出双重作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的H2的积极作用，以及通过置换催化剂基本位点上的丙烷的消极作用。

4. 支持型镓氧化物催化剂上的脱氢反应可能通过异裂分解反应途径而不是还原氧化机制进行，与纯镓氧化物类似。
