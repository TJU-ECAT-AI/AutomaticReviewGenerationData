[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The conversions of propane over Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts at 600 C reached 23, 33, and 39%, respectively."
[3] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[4] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[5] "Dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism."

1. The structural characteristics and surface properties, particularly the acidity and basicity, of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High activity is observed in catalysts with abundant medium-strong acid sites on the surface, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2, compared to ineffective catalysts like Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. 

2. The presence of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of Ga2O3 polymorphs enhances the dehydrogenation activity by facilitating the reactions that bypass the slow step, thus accelerating the total reaction rate.

3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) exhibits dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role in removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and a negative role in displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites.

4. The dehydrogenation reaction on supported gallium oxide catalysts likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway rather than a redox mechanism, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.

1. 不同Ga2O3晶相的结构特性和表面性质，尤其是酸性和碱性，显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。具有丰富中强酸性位点的催化剂，如Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2表现出高活性，相比之下，像Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO这样的催化剂则表现不佳。

2. Ga2O3晶相表面的中强酸性位点通过促进反应绕过缓慢步骤，从而加速总反应速率，提高了催化活性。

3. 碳二酸（CO2）在脱氢反应中表现出双重作用：通过逆水煤气变换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的H2的积极作用，以及通过置换催化剂基本位点上的丙烷的消极作用。

4. 支持型镓氧化物催化剂上的脱氢反应可能通过异裂分解反应途径而不是还原氧化机制进行，与纯镓氧化物类似。
