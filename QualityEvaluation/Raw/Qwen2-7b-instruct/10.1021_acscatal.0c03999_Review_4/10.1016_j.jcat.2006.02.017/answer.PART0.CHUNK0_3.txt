[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different gallium oxide polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts show high activity in dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective. CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: positively removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and negatively displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. The dehydrogenation process likely follows a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway.

不同镓氧化物晶相的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及路易斯酸中心影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出较高的脱氢活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。二氧化碳在反应中扮演双重角色：通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的离解氢，正面作用；以及置换催化剂基本位点上的丙烷，负面作用。脱氢过程可能遵循异裂解反应途径。

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated, and distinct behaviors were observed."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."
[3] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
[4] "These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."
[5] "XPS studies showed abundant reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, which may account for this catalyst’s unique catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2."

Distinct behaviors were observed when studying the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over five supported gallium oxide catalysts in the absence or presence of CO2. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are superior catalysts compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, as they possess numerous medium to strong and strong acid sites on their surfaces. CO2 enhances dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but has a negative impact on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The differing support effects might stem from variations in the catalysts' hydrogen adsorption capabilities and acid-base properties, resulting from different interactions between gallium oxide and the support. XPS studies revealed a high density of reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, potentially explaining its unique catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction with CO2 present.

在研究五种支持的镓氧化物催化剂上无CO2或存在CO2下丙烷脱氢为丙烯的行为时，观察到了不同的行为。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2相比Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO更优，因为它们表面含有大量中到强和强酸中心。二氧化碳可以增强Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3有负面影响。这些不同的支持效果可能源自催化剂的氢吸附能力差异和酸碱性质差异，这可能是由于镓氧化物与支持之间的不同相互作用导致的。XPS研究表明，Ga2O3/TiO2表面有高密度的还原镓原子（45%），这可能解释了该催化剂在存在CO2下的独特催化行为。
