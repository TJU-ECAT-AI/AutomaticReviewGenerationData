[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over different supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated."
[2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
[4] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[5] "XPS studies show that the different behavior of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts may be attributed to the different interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species."
[6] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The high activity of Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO is due to the abundance of medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces. CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: positively by removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalyst's basic sites. XPS studies attribute the different behaviors of the five supported Ga2O3 catalysts to the distinct interactions between the support and the Ga2O3 species. The dehydrogenation reaction is proposed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, similar to that on pure gallium oxide.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂的高活性与它们表面丰富的中强酸性位点有关，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO催化剂则无此特性。CO2在反应中扮演双重角色：正向通过逆水煤气变换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的H2，负向通过取代催化剂上的基本位点吸附的丙烷。XPS研究表明，五种支持的Ga2O3催化剂的不同行为归因于它们与Ga2O3物种之间的不同相互作用。推测脱氢反应通过异裂分解反应途径进行，类似于纯镓氧化物。
