[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
[3] "Dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600 C;the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3."
[4] "The conversion of CO2 in reactions (1) and (2) can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 before and after the reaction."
[5] "CO2 pulse reaction was also applied for further research."
[6] "The H2 and propane chemisorption capacity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured;the results are given in Tables 7 and 8."
[7] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton increases propane dehydrogenation activity by replacing the slow step (5) by the fast equilibria (7) and (8)."
[8] "When CO2 is introduced into the propane dehydrogenation reaction, chemisorbed H2 formed from steps (5) and (7) can also be removed via an alternative route (9) (i.e., the reverse water-gas shift reaction), besides step (6):"
[9] "For Ga2O3/SiO2, because activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction is very low, it would be difficult for CO2 to react with the chemisorbed H2 over Ga2O3/SiO2, and thus a positive effect of CO2 would not be observed."

1. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts were highly effective for propane dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective.
2. CO2 plays dual roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: positively removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst.
3. CO2 was included in the dehydrogenation reaction at 600°C over the supported gallium oxide catalysts, influencing their activity and selectivity.
4. The conversion of CO2 can be quantified by analyzing the changes in CO and CO2 amounts before and after the reaction.
5. Further research utilized CO2 pulse reactions for detailed investigation.
6. The adsorption capacities of H2 and propane were measured to understand their interactions with the catalysts.
7. The presence of gallium oxide and protons enhances dehydrogenation activity by accelerating key reaction steps.
8. When CO2 is added, chemisorbed H2 can be removed through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, altering the reaction dynamics.
9. CO2's impact on Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts is minimal due to its low activity in the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

1. Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出了高效性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。
2. 在脱氢反应中，二氧化碳扮演了双重角色：通过逆水煤气转换反应去除催化剂表面的离解吸附H2，同时通过基本位点排斥丙烷来产生负面影响。
3. 在600°C下，二氧化碳被加入到支持镓氧化物催化剂的脱氢反应中，影响了它们的活性和选择性。
4. 可以通过分析反应前后CO和CO2量的变化来量化CO2的转化率。
5. 进一步研究使用二氧化碳脉冲反应进行了详细调查。
6. 测定了H2和丙烷的吸附能力，以理解它们与催化剂的相互作用。
7. 镓氧化物的存在和质子增强了脱氢反应的活性，通过加速关键反应步骤。
8. 当添加二氧化碳时，可以通过逆水煤气转换反应去除化学吸附的H2，改变反应动力学。
9. 由于二氧化碳在逆水煤气转换反应中的低活性，对Ga2O3/SiO2催化剂的影响很小。
