[1] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[2] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. The equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen, with the twostep pathway being more favorable than the onestep pathway.

2. Experimental conversion levels for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 are significantly lower than theoretical equilibrium values, likely due to rapid catalyst deactivation.

3. Including side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to increased propane conversion and reduced propylene selectivity, as these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable.

4. Higher temperatures increase the selectivity of the product to CO and hydrogen, which is indicative of propane dry reforming.

5. Increasing temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce the tendency of coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that control unwanted side reactions kinetically.

1. 在二氧化碳的存在下，丙烷的平衡转化率高于惰性气体或氢气，两步途径比一步途径更占优势。

2. 报告的实验丙烷脱氢化转化率在二氧化碳中的水平远低于理论平衡值，这可能归因于催化剂的快速失活。

3. 包含副反应的热力学模拟导致丙烷转化率增加和丙烯选择性降低，因为这些副反应在热力学上更为有利。

4. 更高的温度提高了产物中CO和氢的选择性，这是丙烷干重整的标志。

5. 提高温度和CO2/C3H8比率降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产率，除了控制不希望的副反应动力学的催化剂外。
