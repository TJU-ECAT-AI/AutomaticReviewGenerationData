3.4. Applicability To Practical Systems
The results of the previous sections imply that equilibrium compositions obtained in the presence of propane reforming and coke forming side reactions are of little applicability to practical catalytic systems. Although these reactions are largely controlled by the catalyst formulation, their occurrence (especially coke formation), even to a small extent,can significantly affect the catalyst performance in CO2PDH by covering and modifying the active sites.

The applicability of equilibrium compositions obtained considering propane reforming and coke formation to practical catalytic systems is limited. These side reactions, though influenced by catalyst formulation, can substantially impact the performance of CO2PDH catalysts by altering active sites.
