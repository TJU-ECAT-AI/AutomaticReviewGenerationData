3.1. One And TwoStep CO2 Propane Dehydrogenation
"For onestep reaction system, the number of chemical species (assuming no hydrogen fed) in the gaseous phase is 5 with one equilibrium reaction (reaction 3). Therefore, the number of independent components is 4, and according to the phase rule, the degree of freedom is 4."
"Consequently, by specifying T and P, the molar fraction of only two compounds can vary independent of others, that is, the others may be calculated by the thermodynamic constants of the reactions for both systems."

"Figure 1 shows the effect of temperature on equilibrium propane conversion with different diluting agents. The conversions increase with temperature because of the endothermic nature of the overall reactions. The simple dehydrogenation (that is, without diluent) is also depicted as the reference. Addition of a diluent (both inert and/or reactive) increases the conversion through decreasing the partial pressure of the products, and also, in the case of carbon dioxide, consuming the produced hydrogen."

"In the case of hydrogen cofeed, however, the effect is more complex. Hydrogen addition tends to increase the conversion through decreasing partial pressure, as other diluents, and to decrease the equilibrium conversion by shifting reaction 1 to the left as H2 is a product. The net effect is a slight drop in conversion as illustrated in Fig. 1. The highest conversion is observed in the case of twostep CO2PDH."

"One might note that the combination of onestep and simple dehydrogenation gives exactly the same results as twostep CO2PDH since reactions 1 to 3 are not thermodynamically independent."

The structure and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) can significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The acidity and basicity of these polymorphs play crucial roles in determining their activity and selectivity. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of these materials can facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by coordinating with the reactants and directing the reaction pathways. The α-Ga2O3 polymorph is generally found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity due to its unique surface properties, which promote the desired reaction while inhibiting undesirable side reactions. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, despite having similar Lewis acid sites, may exhibit lower activity due to differences in the electronic structure or the arrangement of these sites on the surface. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs tend to have a higher basicity, which can lead to increased coke formation and reduced selectivity for propylene. The δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs, with their distinct crystal structure, may offer a balance between activity and selectivity, depending on the specific conditions of the reaction. The mechanisms proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction include the role of these polymorphs in stabilizing the transition states of the desired reaction pathways and minimizing the formation of intermediates that lead to coke formation.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质在CO2-ODHP反应中对催化性能有着显著影响。这些晶相的酸性和碱性对确定其活性和选择性至关重要。表面的Lewis酸位点能够促进丙烷的氧化脱氢，通过与反应物配位并引导反应途径来发挥作用。α-Ga2O3晶相通常表现出最高的催化活性，由于其独特的表面特性，能够促进所需的反应同时抑制副反应。尽管β-Ga2O3晶相具有相似的Lewis酸位点，但其活性可能较低，这可能是由于电子结构或表面位点排列的不同。γ-Ga2O3晶相倾向于具有更高的碱性，可能导致焦炭形成增加并降低丙烯选择性。δ-Ga2O3晶相可能在活性和选择性之间提供平衡，具体取决于反应条件。解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性阶段的机制包括这些晶相在稳定所需反应途径的过渡态以及减少导致焦炭形成的中间体方面的作用。
