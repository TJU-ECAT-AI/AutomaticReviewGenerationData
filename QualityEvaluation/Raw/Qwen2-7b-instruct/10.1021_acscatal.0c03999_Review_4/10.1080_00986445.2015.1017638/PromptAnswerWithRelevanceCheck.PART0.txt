3.4. Applicability To Practical Systems
The results of the previous sections imply that equilibrium compositions obtained in the presence of propane reforming and coke forming side reactions are of little applicability to practical catalytic systems. Although these reactions are largely controlled by the catalyst formulation, their occurrence (especially coke formation), even to a small extent,can significantly affect the catalyst performance in CO2PDH by covering and modifying the active sites.

[1] "The main carboncontaining product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. 9). This can be attributed to the fact that coke gasification reactions (the reverse of reactions 8 and 9) converting coke to CO are endothermic and are favored at higher temperatures."
[2] "The fact that PDH with H2 (which is a weaker coke removing diluent compared to CO2) has been commercialized illustrates that the current catalyst formulations cannot effectively control coke formation in CO2PDH."
[3] "Consequently, much is to be done to achieve active and coke resistant catalysts to make use of the advantages of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (including acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit varying catalytic activities due to differences in their surface properties. Specifically, the α-Ga2O3 polymorph shows superior catalytic activity compared to the other polymorphs, likely due to its unique surface structure and Lewis acid sites that facilitate the desired reactions more efficiently. The β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs have lower catalytic performance, which may be attributed to their distinct surface properties that hinder the reaction kinetics.

The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction can be explained by the interaction between the Ga2O3 polymorphs' surface properties and the reactants. The surface properties of the polymorphs determine the adsorption strength of reactants and intermediates, influencing the reaction rates and selectivities. Acidic sites on the polymorphs can promote specific reactions, whereas basic sites may inhibit unwanted side reactions, contributing to the observed activity trends.

At higher temperatures, the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen increases, which is attributed to the enhanced propane dry reforming. Higher temperatures and a higher CO2/C3H8 ratio reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically. The coke removing capability of the diluent plays a crucial role in catalyst stability. Carbon dioxide is a weaker coke removing agent compared to steam. The commercialization of PDH with H2 suggests that current catalyst formulations struggle to effectively control coke formation in CO2PDH. To harness the benefits of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes, further research and development are necessary to create more efficient catalysts that resist coke formation.

不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特性和表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位的影响。α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3晶相显示出不同的催化活性，这主要归因于它们独特的表面结构和Lewis酸位，这些位点更有效地促进了所需反应。β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3晶相的催化性能较低，可能是因为它们的表面性质阻碍了反应动力学。

反应初期和稳态阶段的活动趋势和选择性的变化可以由聚合物表面性质与反应物之间的相互作用来解释。聚合物表面性质决定了反应物和中间体的吸附强度，从而影响反应速率和选择性。聚合物上的酸性位点可以促进特定反应，而碱性位点可能会抑制不希望的副反应，从而导致观察到的活性趋势。

随着温度的升高，CO和氢气的选择性增加，这是由于丙烷干重整的增强。较高的温度和较高的CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除非催化剂通过动力学控制不希望的副反应。焦炭去除能力是催化剂稳定性的关键因素。二氧化碳是较弱的焦炭去除剂，与水蒸汽相比。H2参与商业丙烷脱氢化的原因表明，当前的催化剂配方难以有效控制CO2PDH中的焦炭形成。为了利用二氧化碳在轻烷烃商业脱氢化中的优势，需要进一步的研究和发展，以创建更高效的催化剂，这些催化剂能够抵抗焦炭形成。

[1] "Thermodynamic considerations showed that the equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep."
[2] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. The equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen, with the twostep pathway being more favorable than the onestep pathway.

2. Experimental conversion levels for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 are significantly lower than theoretical equilibrium values, likely due to rapid catalyst deactivation.

3. Including side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to increased propane conversion and reduced propylene selectivity, as these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable.

4. Higher temperatures increase the selectivity of the product to CO and hydrogen, which is indicative of propane dry reforming.

5. Increasing temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce the tendency of coke formation and propylene yield, except for catalysts that control unwanted side reactions kinetically.

3.1. One And TwoStep CO2 Propane Dehydrogenation
"For onestep reaction system, the number of chemical species (assuming no hydrogen fed) in the gaseous phase is 5 with one equilibrium reaction (reaction 3). Therefore, the number of independent components is 4, and according to the phase rule, the degree of freedom is 4."
"Consequently, by specifying T and P, the molar fraction of only two compounds can vary independent of others, that is, the others may be calculated by the thermodynamic constants of the reactions for both systems."

"Figure 1 shows the effect of temperature on equilibrium propane conversion with different diluting agents. The conversions increase with temperature because of the endothermic nature of the overall reactions. The simple dehydrogenation (that is, without diluent) is also depicted as the reference. Addition of a diluent (both inert and/or reactive) increases the conversion through decreasing the partial pressure of the products, and also, in the case of carbon dioxide, consuming the produced hydrogen."

"In the case of hydrogen cofeed, however, the effect is more complex. Hydrogen addition tends to increase the conversion through decreasing partial pressure, as other diluents, and to decrease the equilibrium conversion by shifting reaction 1 to the left as H2 is a product. The net effect is a slight drop in conversion as illustrated in Fig. 1. The highest conversion is observed in the case of twostep CO2PDH."

"One might note that the combination of onestep and simple dehydrogenation gives exactly the same results as twostep CO2PDH since reactions 1 to 3 are not thermodynamically independent."

The structure and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) can significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The acidity and basicity of these polymorphs play crucial roles in determining their activity and selectivity. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of these materials can facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by coordinating with the reactants and directing the reaction pathways. The α-Ga2O3 polymorph is generally found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity due to its unique surface properties, which promote the desired reaction while inhibiting undesirable side reactions. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, despite having similar Lewis acid sites, may exhibit lower activity due to differences in the electronic structure or the arrangement of these sites on the surface. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs tend to have a higher basicity, which can lead to increased coke formation and reduced selectivity for propylene. The δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs, with their distinct crystal structure, may offer a balance between activity and selectivity, depending on the specific conditions of the reaction. The mechanisms proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction include the role of these polymorphs in stabilizing the transition states of the desired reaction pathways and minimizing the formation of intermediates that lead to coke formation.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质在CO2-ODHP反应中对催化性能有着显著影响。这些晶相的酸性和碱性对确定其活性和选择性至关重要。表面的Lewis酸位点能够促进丙烷的氧化脱氢，通过与反应物配位并引导反应途径来发挥作用。α-Ga2O3晶相通常表现出最高的催化活性，由于其独特的表面特性，能够促进所需的反应同时抑制副反应。尽管β-Ga2O3晶相具有相似的Lewis酸位点，但其活性可能较低，这可能是由于电子结构或表面位点排列的不同。γ-Ga2O3晶相倾向于具有更高的碱性，可能导致焦炭形成增加并降低丙烯选择性。δ-Ga2O3晶相可能在活性和选择性之间提供平衡，具体取决于反应条件。解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性阶段的机制包括这些晶相在稳定所需反应途径的过渡态以及减少导致焦炭形成的中间体方面的作用。
