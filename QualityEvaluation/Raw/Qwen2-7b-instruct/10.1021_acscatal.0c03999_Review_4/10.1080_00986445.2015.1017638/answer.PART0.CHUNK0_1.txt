[1] "The main carboncontaining product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. 9). This can be attributed to the fact that coke gasification reactions (the reverse of reactions 8 and 9) converting coke to CO are endothermic and are favored at higher temperatures."
[2] "The fact that PDH with H2 (which is a weaker coke removing diluent compared to CO2) has been commercialized illustrates that the current catalyst formulations cannot effectively control coke formation in CO2PDH."
[3] "Consequently, much is to be done to achieve active and coke resistant catalysts to make use of the advantages of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (including acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit varying catalytic activities due to differences in their surface properties. Specifically, the α-Ga2O3 polymorph shows superior catalytic activity compared to the other polymorphs, likely due to its unique surface structure and Lewis acid sites that facilitate the desired reactions more efficiently. The β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs have lower catalytic performance, which may be attributed to their distinct surface properties that hinder the reaction kinetics.

The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction can be explained by the interaction between the Ga2O3 polymorphs' surface properties and the reactants. The surface properties of the polymorphs determine the adsorption strength of reactants and intermediates, influencing the reaction rates and selectivities. Acidic sites on the polymorphs can promote specific reactions, whereas basic sites may inhibit unwanted side reactions, contributing to the observed activity trends.

At higher temperatures, the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen increases, which is attributed to the enhanced propane dry reforming. Higher temperatures and a higher CO2/C3H8 ratio reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically. The coke removing capability of the diluent plays a crucial role in catalyst stability. Carbon dioxide is a weaker coke removing agent compared to steam. The commercialization of PDH with H2 suggests that current catalyst formulations struggle to effectively control coke formation in CO2PDH. To harness the benefits of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes, further research and development are necessary to create more efficient catalysts that resist coke formation.

不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特性和表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位的影响。α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3晶相显示出不同的催化活性，这主要归因于它们独特的表面结构和Lewis酸位，这些位点更有效地促进了所需反应。β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3晶相的催化性能较低，可能是因为它们的表面性质阻碍了反应动力学。

反应初期和稳态阶段的活动趋势和选择性的变化可以由聚合物表面性质与反应物之间的相互作用来解释。聚合物表面性质决定了反应物和中间体的吸附强度，从而影响反应速率和选择性。聚合物上的酸性位点可以促进特定反应，而碱性位点可能会抑制不希望的副反应，从而导致观察到的活性趋势。

随着温度的升高，CO和氢气的选择性增加，这是由于丙烷干重整的增强。较高的温度和较高的CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除非催化剂通过动力学控制不希望的副反应。焦炭去除能力是催化剂稳定性的关键因素。二氧化碳是较弱的焦炭去除剂，与水蒸汽相比。H2参与商业丙烷脱氢化的原因表明，当前的催化剂配方难以有效控制CO2PDH中的焦炭形成。为了利用二氧化碳在轻烷烃商业脱氢化中的优势，需要进一步的研究和发展，以创建更高效的催化剂，这些催化剂能够抵抗焦炭形成。
