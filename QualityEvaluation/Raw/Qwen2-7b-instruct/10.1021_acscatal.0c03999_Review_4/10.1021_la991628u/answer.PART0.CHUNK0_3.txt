<p>The mesostructured gallium yttrium mixed oxides were synthesized by the homogeneous precipitation method using urea in the presence of alkyl sulfate. Gallium chloride (GaCl3) was used as the gallium source, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) was used as the yttrium source, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (C12H25OSO3Na) was used as the templating agent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the x = 1.0 and 0.5 mesophases separated at 9 h of reaction were observed to have a hexagonal structure with their unit cell parameters increased to 4.7 and 4.4 nm, respectively, although the 110 and 200 reflection peaks for both solids were more broadened in comparison with those for the 3 h of reaction mesophases.</p>
<p>The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm for the acetate-treated form of the x = 0.5 product separated after an elapsed reaction time of 9 h is shown in Figure 3. The rapid adsorption in the range of P/P0 = 00.4 for the sample is due to the monolayer coverage of pores and particle surface and capillary condensation in pores.</p>
<p>When indium chloride, the same group IIIB metal as Al and Ga, was used in place of gallium chloride, layered mesophases and In(OH)3 occurred but no hexagonal mesophase was obtainable for any molar ratios of x.</p>
<p>A similar effect would be exerted in the presence of a mesostructured galliumyttrium mixed oxide system. It is thus concluded that yttrium species act as a polymerizing agent for inorganic framework to form mesoporous materials.</p>

The synthesis of mesoporous gallium oxide stabilized by yttrium oxide was achieved using the homogeneous precipitation method. Gallium chloride served as the gallium source, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate as the yttrium source, and sodium dodecyl sulfate as the templating agent. The pH of the reaction mixture increased from 2.6 to 7.1 over 9 hours, leading to precipitation. XRD patterns showed hexagonal structures for the gallium yttrium mixed oxides, with unit cell parameters increasing from 4.2 to 4.7 nm for x = 1.0 after 3 hours, and to 4.4 nm for x = 0.5 after 9 hours. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of the acetate-treated gallium oxide exhibited a rapid adsorption due to monolayer coverage of pores and capillary condensation. When indium chloride was used instead of gallium chloride, no hexagonal mesophase was formed. It was concluded that yttrium species act as a polymerizing agent for stabilizing the inorganic framework and forming mesoporous materials.

通过均相沉淀法合成了由Yttrium氧化物稳定化的微孔镓氧化物。GaCl3作为镓源，Y(NO3)3·6H2O作为钇源，十二烷基硫酸钠作为模板剂。反应混合物的pH值从2.6增加到7.1，持续9小时后发生沉淀。X射线衍射图谱显示了镓钇混氧化物的六方结构，单元参数从x = 1.0时的4.2nm增加到3小时后的4.7nm，x = 0.5时为9小时后的4.4nm。N2吸附-脱附等温线显示，乙酸盐处理的镓氧化物在样品范围内快速吸附，原因是孔隙和颗粒表面的单层覆盖以及孔隙中的毛细凝结。当使用InCl3代替GaCl3时，没有形成六方相。最终结论是，钇物种作为聚合剂稳定无机框架并形成微孔材料。
