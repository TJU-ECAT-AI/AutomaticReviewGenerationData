<p>The mesostructured gallium yttrium mixed oxides were synthesized by the homogeneous precipitation method using urea in the presence of alkyl sulfate.</p>
<p>As the pH of the reaction mixture increased from 2.65.1 at its initial level to 7.18.3 after 9 h of reaction time (Table 1), precipitation occurred and developed.</p>
<p>The resulting mixture was immediately cooled to room temperature to prevent further hydrolysis of urea.</p>
<p>After centrifugation, the resulting solid, white in color, was washed with water repeatedly and then dried at 60 C in air.</p>
<p>The removal of surfactant from the obtained mesophases was done by anion exchange with acetate anions;20-23 the mesophase sample (0.5 g) was mixed with 0.05 M ethanol solution of sodium acetate (40 mL), and then stirred at 40 C for 1 h, and resulting solids were washed with ethanol, repeatedly.</p>
<p>Table 1. Preparation Condition and Characterization of the As-Grown and Acetate-Treated Mesostructured Gallium Oxides Structurally Stabilized by Yttrium Oxide Templated by Dodecyl Sulfate Assemblies</p>
<p>Peak assignment: ·, GaO(OH).</p>
<p>Sulfur to metal (Ga + Y) molar ratio detected by XMA analysis dropped from 0.30 for the as-grown product to 0 for the acetate-treated one, indicating that the incorporated surfactants were completely removed with retention of the hexagonal structure.</p>
<p>The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm for the acetate-treated form of the x = 0.5 product separated after an elapsed reaction time of 9 h is shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Judging from the Ga0.57Y0.43O1.5 to SiO2 mass ratio of 102.0/60.1, the specific surface area of 714 m2 g-1 corresponds to a specific surface area of 1212 m2 g-1 for a mesoporous silica, nearly equal to 10001200 m2 g-1 for MCM-41 or FSM-16.</p>
<p>The effective pore size was determined to be 2.0 nm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the specific surface area of the x = 0.6251.0 products decreased with an increase of x, along with a decrease in crystallinity as shown from their XRD patterns.</p>
<p>We also tried to synthesize other yttrium oxide-supported hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides. When indium chloride, the same group IIIB metal as Al and Ga, was used in place of gallium chloride, layered mesophases and In(OH)3 occurred but no hexagonal mesophase was obtainable for any molar ratios of x.</p>
<p>A similar reaction using zirconium oxychloride or iron(III) chloride as a second metal component yielded only Y2(CO3)3·3H2O and amorphous zirconium and iron hydroxides.</p>
<p>We also could not synthesize even In-, Zr-, and Fe-based hexagonal mesostructured oxides in the homogeneous precipitation method.</p>
<p>In the mesostructured yttrium aluminum oxide system, the substitution of yttrium species into the aluminum oxide framework led to a change from the 4-coordinate Al-rich framework to the 6-coordinate Al-rich one to stabilize the hexagonal structure for the removal of surfactants, since the framework composed mainly of edge- and vertex-shared YO6 and AlO6 octahedra is much more stable than that composed of edge-shared AlO4 tetrahedra.</p>
<p>It is thus concluded that yttrium species act as a polymerizing agent for inorganic framework to form mesoporous materials.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have synthesized ordered hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxides structurally stabilized by yttrium oxide and demonstrated the capability to control the Ga to (Ga + Y) mole ratio in the resulting solids.</p>

This paper discusses the synthesis and characterization of ordered hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxides stabilized by yttrium oxide. The authors describe the homogeneous precipitation method using urea, alkyl sulfate, and gallium chloride as the gallium source, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate as the yttrium source, and sodium dodecyl sulfate as the templating agent. The process involves mixing these components at a specific molar ratio, stirring at 40°C for 1 hour, heating the mixture at 80°C for 3 or 9 hours, cooling it to room temperature to prevent urea hydrolysis, and then washing and drying the resulting solid. Anion exchange with acetate ions removes surfactants, leading to a collapse of the hexagonal structure. The paper reports the specific surface area and pore size of the synthesized gallium oxide, concluding that yttrium species act as a polymerizing agent for the inorganic framework to form mesoporous materials. The authors also demonstrate the ability to control the gallium-to-(gallium + yttrium) molar ratio in the resulting solids. The synthesized gallium oxide is expected to serve as a strong acid catalyst with size-selective properties.
