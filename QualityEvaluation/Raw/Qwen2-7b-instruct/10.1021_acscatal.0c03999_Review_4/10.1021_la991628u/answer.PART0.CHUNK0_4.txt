Since the synthesis of mesoporous silicas such as MCM-41 and FSM-16 with large internal surface areas and uniform pore sizes, the surfactant templating method has been used to synthesize mesoporous metal oxides, including titanium, aluminum, niobium, and tantalum oxides. The mesostructured metal oxides are taken to be useful not only as catalysts and separating or adsorbing agents but also as functional host materials with optically, electrically, or magnetically unique properties, owing to the shape-specific and/or quantum effects of their thin inorganic skeletons.

Though the synthesis of mesoporous alumina has been already demonstrated by several workers, mesoporous gallium oxide has not yet been reported. We have already reported the synthesis of layered and hexagonal mesostructured aluminum, gallium, and rare earth oxides templated by alkyl sulfate assemblies by the homogeneous precipitation method using urea. The anion-exchange method reported by Holland et al. was found to be applicable to the conversion of the hexagonal mesostructured rare earth oxides into mesoporous materials with specific surface areas of as large as 545 m2 g−1 for the Y system and about 300 m2 g−1 for the lanthanide (GdLu) system. Our recent study further demonstrated that the Al-based hexagonal mesophase can also be converted into an ordered porous material through the introduction of yttrium into the inorganic framework.

The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm for the acetate-treated form of the x = 0.5 product separated after an elapsed reaction time of 9 h is shown in Figure 3. The rapid adsorption in the range of P/P0 = 0–0.4 for the sample is due to the monolayer coverage of pores and particle surface and capillary condensation in pores. The desorption isotherm showed no hysteresis relative to the adsorption isotherm. A similar result was observed for MCM-41. The specific surface area was as large as 714 m2 g−1. Judging from the Ga0.57Y0.43O1.5 to SiO2 mass ratio of 102.0/60.1, the specific surface area of 714 m2 g−1 corresponds to a specific surface area of 1212 m2 g−1 for a mesoporous silica, nearly equal to 1000–1200 m2 g−1 for MCM-41 or FSM-16.

The effective pore size was determined to be 2.0 nm. Taking into consideration a unit cell parameter of 4.0 nm for the sample recovered after the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurement, the thickness of the inorganic wall and acetate layer is thus estimated to be 2.0 nm. The acetate-treated products also showed an increase of specific surface area from 447 m2 g−1 for x = 0 to 714 m2 g−1 for x = 0.5 with an increase of x (Table 1), in harmony with an increase in crystallinity. On the other hand, the specific surface area of the x = 0.625–1.0 products decreased with an increase of x, along with a decrease in crystallinity as shown from their XRD patterns.

We also tried to synthesize other yttrium oxide-supported hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides. When indium chloride, the same group IIIB metal as Al and Ga, was used in place of gallium chloride, layered mesophases and In(OH)3 occurred but no hexagonal mesophase was obtainable for any molar ratios of x. A similar reaction using zirconium oxychloride or iron(III) chloride as a second metal component yielded only Y2(CO3)3·3H2O and amorphous zirconium and iron hydroxides. We also could not synthesize even In-, Zr-, and Fe-based hexagonal mesostructured oxides in the homogeneous precipitation method. On the other hand, the use of tin(IV) chloride led to the formation of a mesostructured tin yttrium oxide, and it was converted into a mesoporous material by the acetate treatment, in contrast to the collapse of a mesostructured tin oxide by the same treatment.

In the mesostructured yttrium aluminum oxide system, the substitution of yttrium species into the aluminum oxide framework led to a change from the 4-coordinate Al-rich framework to the 6-coordinate Al-rich one to stabilize the hexagonal structure for the removal of surfactants, since the framework composed mainly of edge- and vertex-shared YO6 and AlO6 octahedra is much more stable than that composed of edge-shared AlO4 tetrahedra. A similar effect would be exerted in the presence of a mesostructured galliumyttrium mixed oxide system. It is thus concluded that yttrium species act as a polymerizing agent for inorganic framework to form mesoporous materials.

In conclusion, we have synthesized ordered hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxides structurally stabilized by yttrium oxide and demonstrated the capability to control the Ga to (Ga + Y) mole ratio in the resulting solids. The hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxide would be promising as a strong acid catalyst with size-selective property. This technique, the doping of polymerizing agent into inorganic framework, may be applicable to convert any other unstable hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides for removal of surfactants into stable mesoporous solids.

This document reports the successful synthesis of ordered hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxides stabilized by yttrium oxide. The researchers employed a homogeneous precipitation method using urea and alkyl sulfate as a surfactant to synthesize these materials. The introduction of yttrium into the gallium oxide framework stabilizes the hexagonal structure, enabling the synthesis of mesoporous gallium oxide. The synthesis process involves adjusting the molar ratio of gallium to the total metal (gallium plus yttrium) in the reaction mixture. By doing so, the researchers were able to control the Ga to (Ga + Y) mole ratio in the resulting solids, demonstrating the potential of these materials as strong acid catalysts with size-selective properties. The technique of doping a polymerizing agent into the inorganic framework is shown to be applicable for converting other unstable hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides into stable mesoporous solids.

The synthesis of mesoporous gallium oxide is considered interesting because it is expected to be a stronger solid acid than aluminum oxide. If successfully synthesized, this material would serve as a strong acid catalyst with molecular shape or size selectivities. The research highlights the importance of the yttrium species in stabilizing the hexagonal structure of the gallium oxide and acting as a polymerizing agent for the inorganic framework. The document also discusses the potential applicability of this technique to convert other unstable hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides into stable mesoporous solids, expanding the potential uses of these materials in various industries.

The specific surface area of the synthesized mesoporous gallium oxide reached up to 714 m^2/g, comparable to that of mesoporous silicas like MCM-41 or FSM-16. The pore size was determined to be 2.0 nm, and the thickness of the inorganic wall and acetate layer was estimated to be 2.0 nm. The surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different gallium oxide polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) play a crucial role in their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction can be attributed to the unique structural characteristics and chemical properties of these gallium oxide polymorphs.

In summary, the synthesis of ordered hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxides structurally stabilized by yttrium oxide opens up possibilities for their application as strong acid catalysts with size-selective properties. The technique of doping a polymerizing agent into the inorganic framework demonstrates the potential for converting other unstable hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides into stable mesoporous solids, which could lead to advancements in various catalytic processes and material applications.
