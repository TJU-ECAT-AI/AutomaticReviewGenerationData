Since the synthesis of mesoporous silicas such as MCM-41 1 and FSM-16 2 with large internal surface areas and uniform pore sizes, the surfactant templating method has been used to synthesize mesoporous metal oxides, including titanium, 3 aluminum, 4,5 niobium, 6 and tantalum 7 oxides. The mesostructured metal oxides are taken to be useful not only as catalysts and separating or adsorbing agents but also as functional host materials with optically, electrically, or magnetically unique properties, owing to the shape-specific and/or quantum effects of their thin inorganic skeletons.

Though the synthesis of mesoporous alumina has been already demonstrated by several workers,4,5 mesoporous gallium oxide has not yet been reported. We have already reported the synthesis of layered and hexagonal mesostructured aluminum, 15-18 gallium, 19 and rare earth 20,21 oxides templated by alkyl sulfate assemblies by the homogeneous precipitation method using urea.

The anion-exchange method reported by Holland et al. 22 was found to be applicable to the conversion of the hexagonal mesostructured rare earth oxides into mesoporous materials with specific surface areas of as large as 545 m2 g-1 for the Y system and about 300 m2 g-1 for the lanthanide (GdLu) system.20,21 The Al- and Ga-based hexagonal mesophases structurally collapsed by the same treatment.

Our recent study further demonstrated that the Al-based hexagonal mesophase can also be converted into an ordered porous material through the introduction of yttrium into the inorganic framework. 23 The synthesis of mesoporous gallium oxide would be interesting because it is expected to be a stronger solid acid than aluminum oxide. If mesoporous gallium oxide were obtainable, it would serve as a strong acid catalyst with molecular shape or size selectivities.

In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of mesoporous gallium oxide stabilized by yttrium oxide.

The mesostructured gallium yttrium mixed oxides were synthesized by the homogeneous precipitation method using urea in the presence of alkyl sulfate. Gallium chloride (GaCl3) was used as the gallium source, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O) was used as the yttrium source, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (C12H25OSO3Na) was used as the templating agent. GaCl3, Y(NO3)3, surfactant, urea, and water were mixed at a molar ratio of x:(1  x):2:30:60 (x = 01.0) and stirred at 40 C for 1 h.

The resulting mixture was immediately cooled to room temperature to prevent further hydrolysis of urea. After centrifugation, the resulting solid, white in color, was washed with water repeatedly and then dried at 60 C in air.

Prior to the N2 adsorption desorption measurement, samples were heated at 150 C for 1 h in a vacuum to remove adsorbed water. Specific surface area was calculated by the BET method, 24 and pore size distribution was determined by the ClanstonInkley method, 25 a modified procedure of the BJH method.

The XRD patterns of the as-grown mesostructured gallium oxide structurally stabilized by yttrium oxide showed a major peak located at 2θ = ca. 2.3 and two weak peaks at 2θ = 35, along with a halo band at 2θ = ca. 20.

The TEM images of the products indicated a highly ordered hexagonal structure. Anion-exchange treatment with acetate ions to remove incorporated surfactants from the products resulted in the collapse of their hexagonal structure.

The expansion of unit cell parameter and the decrease in crystallinity for the 9 h reaction product in comparison with the 3 h reaction product is most likely due to the more extensive polymerization of the GaYO framework.

The specific surface area of the x = 0.5 product separated at 9 h of reaction time was as large as 714 m2 g-1. Judging from the Ga0.57Y0.43O1.5 to SiO2 mass ratio of 102.0/60.1, the specific surface area of 714 m2 g-1 corresponds to a specific surface area of 1212 m2 g-1 for a mesoporous silica, nearly equal to 10001200 m2 g-1 for MCM-41 or FSM-16.

The effective pore size was determined to be 2.0 nm. Taking into consideration a unit cell parameter of 4.0 nm for the sample recovered after the N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm measurement, the thickness of the inorganic wall and acetate layer is thus estimated to be 2.0 nm.

The specific surface area of the x = 1.0 product showed a specific surface area of as low as 233 m2 g-1 and the disappearance of 100, 110, and 200 XRD peaks.

The authors also tried to synthesize other yttrium oxide-supported hexagonal mesostructured metal oxides. However, they could not synthesize In-, Zr-, and Fe-based hexagonal mesostructured oxides in the homogeneous precipitation method. On the other hand, the use of tin(IV) chloride led to the formation of a mesostructured tin yttrium oxide, and it was converted into a mesoporous material by the acetate treatment.

It is thus concluded that yttrium species act as a polymerizing agent for inorganic framework to form mesoporous materials.

In conclusion, we have synthesized ordered hexagonal mesoporous gallium oxides structurally stabilized by yttrium oxide and demonstrated the capability to control the Ga to (Ga + Y) mole ratio in the resulting solids.

The literature describes the synthesis and characterization of mesoporous gallium oxide stabilized by yttrium oxide. This material is expected to be a stronger solid acid than aluminum oxide, serving as a strong acid catalyst with molecular shape or size selectivities. The synthesis involves using urea in the presence of alkyl sulfate as a templating agent, gallium chloride as the gallium source, and yttrium nitrate hexahydrate as the yttrium source. The material is characterized by XRD patterns showing a major peak at 2θ = ca. 2.3 and two weak peaks at 2θ = 35, with a halo band at 2θ = ca. 20. The TEM images indicate a highly ordered hexagonal structure. Anion-exchange treatment with acetate ions collapses the hexagonal structure. The specific surface area reaches 714 m2/g after treatment, corresponding to approximately 1212 m2/g for a mesoporous silica. The effective pore size is determined to be 2.0 nm. The synthesis demonstrates the capability to control the Ga to (Ga + Y) mole ratio in the resulting solids.
