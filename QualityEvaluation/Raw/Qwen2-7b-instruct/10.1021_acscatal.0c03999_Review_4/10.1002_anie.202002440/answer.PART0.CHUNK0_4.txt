[1] "The results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[2] "Combined with the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."

The ODHP reaction catalyzed by both h-BN and supported boron oxide catalysts involves the gas-phase radical mechanisms and pathways, with unambiguously identified gas-phase methyl radicals being detected through the use of SVUV-PIMS. The detailed reaction pathways for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts are proposed by combining kinetic studies, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations. Propene is primarily formed through surface reactions involving the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. Both surface-mediated and gas-phase reaction pathways contribute to the formation of C1 and C2 products.
