How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "It is generally proposed that the formed oxidized B sites (for example, BO, BOH, and B(OH)xO3x) act as the active centers under ODHP reaction conditions."
[3] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction."
[4] "Wang etal.7 have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[5] "Furthermore, the complete reaction pathways and mechanisms of ODHP reaction over the h-BN catalysts are proposed with the aid of combined kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[6] "The main product, propene, is more likely formed on the catalyst surface, since no gas-phase propyl radicals were observed."
[7] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."
[8] "Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane."
[9] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."
[10] "We find the formation of such as ethylene and methyl radicals can occur competitively over either the surface or the gas-phase (Supporting Information, FiguresS30, S31) with similar barriers."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, the provided document does not specifically discuss the impact of Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. The document focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and its role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The proposed reaction mechanisms involve both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways, with propene being primarily formed from the surface reaction of propane. Gas-phase methyl radicals are detected, and DFT calculations support the proposed reaction pathways and mechanisms for various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts.

The radical chemistry of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts has been elucidated through the use of online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). The experimental findings, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealed that propene is predominantly formed through surface reactions involving the activation of propane's CH bonds. Additionally, both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways contribute to the production of C1 and C2 products. Notably, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts was obtained, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways over h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts.

This study provides the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts. The researchers used synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) to detect the presence of methyl radicals (CH3.) in the reaction mixture. This finding supports the hypothesis that methyl radicals play a role in the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, as proposed by Wang et al.7 The detection of these radicals offers new insights into the reaction pathways and mechanisms involved in the ODHP process, which could be crucial for the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

The main products in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts are propene, which is primarily formed through a surface reaction involving the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. C1 and C2 products can be generated via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The use of synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) allowed for the first-time identification of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways specific to these catalysts. This finding represents a significant advancement in understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts.
