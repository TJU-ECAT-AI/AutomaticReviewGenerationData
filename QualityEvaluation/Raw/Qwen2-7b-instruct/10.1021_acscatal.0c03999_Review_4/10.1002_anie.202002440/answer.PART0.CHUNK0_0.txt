[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "It is generally proposed that the formed oxidized B sites (for example, BO, BOH, and B(OH)xO3x) act as the active centers under ODHP reaction conditions."
[3] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction."
[4] "Wang etal.7 have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[5] "Furthermore, the complete reaction pathways and mechanisms of ODHP reaction over the h-BN catalysts are proposed with the aid of combined kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[6] "The main product, propene, is more likely formed on the catalyst surface, since no gas-phase propyl radicals were observed."
[7] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."
[8] "Propene is mainly formed from surface reaction via the cleavage of CH bonds of propane."
[9] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."
[10] "We find the formation of such as ethylene and methyl radicals can occur competitively over either the surface or the gas-phase (Supporting Information, FiguresS30, S31) with similar barriers."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, the provided document does not specifically discuss the impact of Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. The document focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and its role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The proposed reaction mechanisms involve both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways, with propene being primarily formed from the surface reaction of propane. Gas-phase methyl radicals are detected, and DFT calculations support the proposed reaction pathways and mechanisms for various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。然而，提供的文献并未具体讨论Ga2O3晶型对CO2-ODHP反应的影响。文献主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）及其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的作用。提出的反应机制涉及表面介导和气体相自由基途径，丙烯主要通过丙烷表面反应形成。检测到气体相甲基自由基，并且DFT计算支持在硼基催化剂上从各种产品进行ODHP反应的提议反应途径和机制。
