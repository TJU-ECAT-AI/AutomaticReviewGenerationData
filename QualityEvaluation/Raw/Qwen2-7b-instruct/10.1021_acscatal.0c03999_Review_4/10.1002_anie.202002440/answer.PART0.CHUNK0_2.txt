[1] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[2] "Interestingly, a recent work implied a possible influence of gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalyst in ODHP reaction,6 in which no expected relationship was found between the catalytic activity and contact time."
[3] "Wang etal.7 have proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the CC bond cleavage, leading to various secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP."
[4] "To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts."
[5] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."

This study provides the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and supported boron oxide catalysts. The researchers used synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) to detect the presence of methyl radicals (CH3.) in the reaction mixture. This finding supports the hypothesis that methyl radicals play a role in the ODHP reaction mechanism over boron-based catalysts, as proposed by Wang et al.7 The detection of these radicals offers new insights into the reaction pathways and mechanisms involved in the ODHP process, which could be crucial for the development of highly selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

本研究提供了在六方氮化硼（h-BN）和硼氧化物支持催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中首次直接实验证据的气相甲基自由基。研究人员使用同步辐射真空紫外光离子质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）检测了反应混合物中的甲基自由基（CH3.）。这一发现支持了Wang等人的假设，即甲基自由基在硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制中起作用，正如他们所提出的那样。这些自由基的检测为理解ODHP过程中的反应途径和机制提供了新见解，对于开发高度选择性的烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂至关重要。
