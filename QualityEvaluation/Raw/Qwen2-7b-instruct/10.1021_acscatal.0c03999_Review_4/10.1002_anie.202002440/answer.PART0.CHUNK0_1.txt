[1] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts."

The radical chemistry of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts has been elucidated through the use of online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). The experimental findings, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealed that propene is predominantly formed through surface reactions involving the activation of propane's CH bonds. Additionally, both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways contribute to the production of C1 and C2 products. Notably, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts was obtained, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways over h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts.

对六方硼氮（h-BN）催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢反应的自由基化学进行了阐明，使用了在线同步辐射真空紫外光离子质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）。实验结果结合密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，丙烯主要通过表面反应从丙烷的CH键激活产生。此外，表面介导和气相途径都为C1和C2产品的形成做出了贡献。值得注意的是，首次直接证实了h-BN和BOx/SiO2催化剂上ODHP反应中的气相甲基自由基（CH3.）的存在，提供了关于该反应机制和路径的新见解。
