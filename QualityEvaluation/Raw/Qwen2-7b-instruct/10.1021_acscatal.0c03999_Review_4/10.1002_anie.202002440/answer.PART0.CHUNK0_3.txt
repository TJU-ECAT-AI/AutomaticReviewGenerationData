<p>The results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways.</p>
<p>These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts.</p>
<p>Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts.</p>

The main products in the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) reaction over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts are propene, which is primarily formed through a surface reaction involving the cleavage of CH bonds in propane. C1 and C2 products can be generated via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The use of synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) allowed for the first-time identification of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, providing insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways specific to these catalysts. This finding represents a significant advancement in understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts.

主要产物在六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂上的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）是丙烯，主要是通过表面反应，涉及丙烷中CH键的断裂形成。C1和C2产物可以通过表面介导和气相途径两者生成。通过同步辐射真空紫外光电离质谱（SVUV-PIMS）技术首次直接检测到了硼基催化剂上ODHP反应中的气相甲基自由基（CH3.），为理解这些催化剂上的反应机制和路径提供了新见解。这一发现对于了解硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制具有重要意义。
