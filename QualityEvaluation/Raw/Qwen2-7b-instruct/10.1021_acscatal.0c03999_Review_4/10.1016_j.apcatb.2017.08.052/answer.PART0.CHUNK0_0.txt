The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, α-Ga2O3 shows higher surface area and an abundance of acidic sites compared to β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3. These acidic sites promote the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene more effectively. Mechanisms suggest that the acidic sites facilitate the adsorption of reactants and products, enhancing the reaction rate and selectivity. During the initial stage, α-Ga2O3 exhibits superior activity due to its higher surface area and concentration of acidic sites. In the steady-state regime, α-Ga2O3 demonstrates significantly higher selectivity than other Ga2O3 polymorphs.

Ga2O3多晶形态的结构特征、表面性质和路易斯酸中心影响CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。特别是，α-Ga2O3具有比β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3更高的表面积和酸性位点。这些酸性位点更有效地促进了丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应。提出的机制表明，酸性位点有助于吸附反应物和产物，从而提高反应速率和选择性。在初始阶段，α-Ga2O3表现出优越的活性，这归因于其更高的表面积和酸性位点的浓度。在稳态阶段，α-Ga2O3的选择性显著高于其他Ga2O3多晶形态。
