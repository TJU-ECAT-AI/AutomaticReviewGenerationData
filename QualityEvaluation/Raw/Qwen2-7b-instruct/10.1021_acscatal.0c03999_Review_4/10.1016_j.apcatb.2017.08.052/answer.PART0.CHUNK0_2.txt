<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-Ga2O3 catalyst showed the highest activity and selectivity towards propylene compared to other polymorphs. This can be attributed to the specific structure and surface properties of the α-Ga2O3 catalyst.

不同Ga2O3晶相的结构特性和表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α-Ga2O3催化剂表现出最高的活性和向丙烯的选择性，与其它晶相相比。这可以归因于α-Ga2O3催化剂的特定结构和表面性质。
