The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of various Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The acidity and basicity of these surfaces affect the catalytic activity, while Lewis acid sites are essential in the reaction mechanism. Different Ga2O3 polymorphs demonstrate varying catalytic performances, with the observed activity trends and selectivity explained by specific interactions between the catalyst and reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

各种Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及路易斯酸中心对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能有显著影响。这些表面的酸性和碱性影响催化活性，而路易斯酸中心是反应机制的关键。不同Ga2O3晶相表现出不同的催化性能，观察到的活性趋势和选择性可以通过催化剂与反应物之间的特定相互作用在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段解释。
