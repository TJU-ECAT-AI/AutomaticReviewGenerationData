[1] "The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)."
[2] "The results showed that the structure, surface properties (acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influenced their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions."
[3] "The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction were attributed to these structural and chemical characteristics."

The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by these structural and chemical characteristics.
