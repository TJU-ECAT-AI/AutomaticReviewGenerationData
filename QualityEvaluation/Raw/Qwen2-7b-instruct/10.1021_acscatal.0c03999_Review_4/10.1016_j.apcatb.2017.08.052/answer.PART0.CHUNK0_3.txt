The structural characteristics, surface properties (including acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites on the surface of these polymorphs affect their catalytic activity and selectivity. Mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction have been suggested.
