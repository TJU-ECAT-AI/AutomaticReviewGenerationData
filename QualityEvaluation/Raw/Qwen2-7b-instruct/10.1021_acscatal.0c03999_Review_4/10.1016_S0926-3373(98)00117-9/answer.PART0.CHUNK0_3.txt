[1] "As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction, irrespective preparation method."
[2] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process. On the other hand, the activity of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 prepared by co-impregnation or coprecipitation methods as well as that of Ga2O3 Al2O3 was depressed by the presence of H2O."
[3] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[4] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[5] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[6] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

1. SnO2 doping decreases the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction regardless of the preparation method in the absence of H2O.
2. The presence of H2O significantly enhances the activity of two types of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts, specifically those prepared by solgel method and by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process. However, catalysts prepared by co-impregnation or coprecipitation methods and Ga2O3Al2O3 itself exhibit reduced activity in the presence of H2O.
3. The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species with intimate GaOAl bonding is crucial for the promotional effect of H2O.
4. The optimal SnO2 loading for achieving high NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O is 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 prepared by solgel method.
5. The promotional effect of H2O is partly due to the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O.
6. Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is its selective inhibition of certain reaction steps, specifically inhibiting the reaction of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on the SnO2 site, thus preventing propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO.

1.SnO2掺杂无论合成方法如何，都会降低Ga2O3Al2O3在无H2O条件下的NO还原活性。
2.H2O的存在显著提高了两种SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂的活性，具体为通过溶胶法合成的催化剂和通过溶胶法将SnO2浸渍到Ga2O3Al2O3上的催化剂。然而，通过共浸渍或沉淀法制备的催化剂和Ga2O3Al2O3自身在H2O存在下活性降低。
3.SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3中具有紧密的GaOAl键合的物种对于H2O的促进效应至关重要。
4.对于通过溶胶法制备的SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂，在H2O存在的最佳SnO2负载量为5 wt%。
5.H2O的促进作用部分归因于其去除催化剂表面沉积的碳质材料的能力。
6.H2O对某些反应步骤的选择性抑制是另一个促进效果的原因，特别是抑制NO2与丙烯反应形成NO和COx的过程，从而防止丙烯氧化为COx而不减少NO。
