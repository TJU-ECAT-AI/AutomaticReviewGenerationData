[1] "As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction, irrespective preparation method."
[2] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[3] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[4] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[5] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[6] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

1. SnO2 doping reduces the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction regardless of the preparation method in the absence of H2O.
2. The presence of H2O significantly increases the activity of two types of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts, one prepared by solgel method and the other by impregnation method.
3. The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species with intimate GaOAl bonding is crucial for the promotional effect of H2O.
4. The optimal SnO2 loading for NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O is 5 wt% for the solgel-prepared SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalyst.
5. Transient response experiments suggest that one reason for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O.
6. Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is the selective inhibition of specific reaction steps by H2O. It is proposed that H2O inhibits the NO2-propene reaction forming NO and COx on the SnO2 site, leading to propene oxidation without NO reduction.

1.SnO2掺杂在无H2O的情况下降低了Ga2O3Al2O3的NO还原活性，无论制备方法如何。
2.在H2O存在的条件下，两种SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂（一种通过溶胶法制备，另一种通过浸渍法制备）的活性显著提高。
3.SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3中具有紧密的GaOAl键合的物种对于H2O的促进效果是必不可少的。
4.在H2O存在下，对SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3溶胶法制备催化剂而言，最佳的SnO2负载为5 wt%以实现NO还原活性。
5.瞬态响应实验表明，促进H2O效果的一个原因是H2O通过去除催化剂表面沉积的碳质材料而起作用。
6.另一个促进H2O效果的原因是H2O选择性抑制某些反应步骤。提出H2O抑制NO2与丙烯反应形成NO和COx在SnO2位点上，导致丙烯氧化而不进行NO还原。
