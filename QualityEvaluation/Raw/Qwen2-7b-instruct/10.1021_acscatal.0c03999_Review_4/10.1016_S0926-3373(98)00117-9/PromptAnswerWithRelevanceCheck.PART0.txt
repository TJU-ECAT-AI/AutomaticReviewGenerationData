[1] "As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction, irrespective preparation method."
[2] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[3] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[4] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[5] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[6] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

<p>Although SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 gave lower NO conversion than Ga2O3Al2O3 in the absence of H2O, the activity was enhanced considerably by the presence of H2O and much higher than that of Ga2O3Al2O3.</p>
<p>The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O.</p>
<p>The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The first one is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O. The other is the selective inhibition by H2O of the reaction steps resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The promotional effect of H2O on the activity of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts for the selective reduction of NO with propene involves two mechanisms. Firstly, H2O helps in the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Secondly, H2O selectively inhibits certain reaction steps that lead to propene oxidation without reducing NO, promoting the reduction of NO.
