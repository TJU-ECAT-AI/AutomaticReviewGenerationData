[1] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[2] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[3] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[4] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[5] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

1. The presence of H2O significantly enhanced the activity of two types of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts, one prepared by solgel method and the other by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process.
2. The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species with GaOAl bonds is crucial for the promotional effect of H2O.
3. The best SnO2 loading for achieving optimal NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 prepared by solgel method.
4. The removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O is considered one reason for the promotional effect of H2O.
5. Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O involves selective inhibition of certain reaction steps. H2O is said to inhibit the reaction step of NO2 with propene leading to NO formation and COx production, thereby avoiding propene oxidation without reducing NO.

1. 在水的存在下，两种SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂的活性显著提高，一种通过溶胶法制备，另一种是通过将SnO2浸渍在由溶胶法制备的Ga2O3Al2O3上制备的。
2. SnO2和具有GaOAl键的Ga2O3Al2O3物种的存在对于水的促进效果至关重要。
3. 对于通过溶胶法制备的SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3，最佳的SnO2负载量以实现最优的NO还原活性为5 wt%。
4. 水去除催化剂表面沉积的碳质材料被认为是促进效果的一个原因。
5. 另一个促进效果的原因与某些反应步骤的选择性抑制有关。据说水抑制了NO2与丙烯的反应，导致NO形成和COx产生，从而避免了丙烯氧化而不减少NO。
