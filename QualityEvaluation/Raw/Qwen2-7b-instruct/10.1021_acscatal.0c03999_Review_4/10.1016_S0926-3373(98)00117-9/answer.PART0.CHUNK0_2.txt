<p>Although SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 gave lower NO conversion than Ga2O3Al2O3 in the absence of H2O, the activity was enhanced considerably by the presence of H2O and much higher than that of Ga2O3Al2O3.</p>
<p>The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O.</p>
<p>The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The first one is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O. The other is the selective inhibition by H2O of the reaction steps resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The promotional effect of H2O on the activity of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts for the selective reduction of NO with propene involves two mechanisms. Firstly, H2O helps in the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Secondly, H2O selectively inhibits certain reaction steps that lead to propene oxidation without reducing NO, promoting the reduction of NO.

H2O对SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂在丙烯选择性还原NO的活性增强涉及两种机制。首先，H2O有助于去除沉积在催化剂表面的碳质材料，从而提高催化活性。其次，H2O选择性抑制导致丙烯氧化而不减少NO的某些反应步骤，促进NO的还原。
