[1] "As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction, irrespective preparation method."
[2] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[3] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[4] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[5] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[6] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

3. The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species with intimate GaOAl bonding is essential for the promotional effect of H2O.
4. The optimal SnO2 loading for NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O is 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 prepared by solgel method.

1.SnO2掺杂降低了在无H2O的情况下Ga2O3Al2O3对NO的还原活性，无论制备方法如何。
2.H2O的存在显著提高了两种SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂的活性：一种是通过溶胶法制备的，另一种是在通过溶胶法制备的Ga2O3Al2O3上浸渍SnO2。
3.SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3具有密切结合的GaOAl键的存在对于H2O的促进效果至关重要。
4.在溶胶法制备的SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3中，NO还原活性的最佳SnO2负载为5 wt%。
5.瞬态响应实验表明，H2O促进效果的一个原因是H2O去除催化剂表面沉积的碳质材料。
6.另一个H2O促进效果的原因是选择性抑制某些反应步骤。H2O抑制了NO2与丙烯反应形成NO和COx的步骤在SnO2位点，导致丙烯氧化到COx而不减少NO。
