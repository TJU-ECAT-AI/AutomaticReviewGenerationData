[1] "In this paper (part I) we report a detailed study on the reaction kinetics of propane and propene oxidation in the presence of oxygen over Li/Dy/MgO catalysts and the re- action mechanism of propene oxidative conversion will be proposed based mainly on the kinetic measurements."
[2] "Alkane activation via a CH bond splitting is the rate- determining step for all reaction products. For propane, rates are first order up to 0.3 bar propane. At high propane partial pressures (> 0.3 bar) the reaction order increases for all hy- drocarbon products."
[3] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reac- tion rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals."
[4] "Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the cat- alyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site."
[5] "Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst. The rate of conversion is low compared to the rate of conversion of propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction condi- tions."
[6] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate- determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry determines largely the selectivity pattern."

1. The detailed study focuses on the reaction kinetics of propane and propene oxidation in the presence of oxygen over Li/Dy/MgO catalysts, and proposes the reaction mechanism of propene oxidative conversion based on kinetic measurements.

2. Activation of alkane through CH bond splitting serves as the rate-determining step for all products. For propane, the reaction rate is first order until the partial pressure reaches 0.3 bar. At higher pressures, the reaction order increases for all hydrocarbon products.

3. The presence of gas-phase oxygen is critical for propane conversion. The significant increase in reaction rates upon increasing oxygen concentration is attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain-carrier radicals, facilitating a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals.

4. Carbon dioxide strongly inhibits catalyst activity for all products. The order of 1 is attributed to blocking of active sites by the formation of Li+CO3 on the active site.

5. Consecutive reactions of propene predominantly yield carbon oxides, occurring mainly on the catalyst. The conversion rate of propene is lower compared to propane due to the relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical under reaction conditions.

6. The conversion patterns of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. Gas-phase radical chemistry largely dictates the selectivity pattern.

1. 研究详细报道了在氧气存在下Li/Dy/MgO催化剂上丙烷和丙烯氧化反应的动力学，并基于动力学测量提出丙烯氧化转换的反应机制。

2. 通过CH键断裂激活烷烃是所有产物的决定性步骤。对于丙烷，当部分压力达到0.3巴时，反应速率呈一级反应。在更高压力下，所有烃产品的反应级数增加。

3. 气相氧的存在对丙烷转化至关重要。氧浓度增加导致反应速率显著提高的原因在于氧分子与链载体自由基的相互作用，通过OH自由基打开快速反应途径。

4. 二氧化碳强烈抑制催化剂活性。一级的表观顺序归因于在活性位点形成Li+CO3导致的活性位点阻塞。

5. 丙烯连续反应主要产生碳氧化物，主要发生在催化剂上。与丙烷相比，丙烯的转化率较低，原因是在反应条件下中间亚甲基自由基相对稳定。

6. 乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化模式证实了从烷烃的氢解离是决定性步骤。气相自由基化学在很大程度上决定了选择性模式。
