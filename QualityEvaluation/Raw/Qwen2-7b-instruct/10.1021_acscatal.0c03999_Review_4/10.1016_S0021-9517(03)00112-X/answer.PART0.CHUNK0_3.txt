The study focuses on the oxidative conversion of propane over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts, presenting a detailed analysis of reaction kinetics and proposing a mechanism that includes activation of propane on the catalyst leading to the formation of propyl radicals undergoing a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase. The key points are:

1. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).

2. The reaction kinetics were studied by varying the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture.

3. The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase.

4. Alkane activation is rate determining.

5. Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism: influencing the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly by increasing the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals, and facilitating the removal of hydrogen from the surface OH species formed during the activation of propane on the catalyst.

6. Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to its strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.

研究重点是轻烷烃在锂促进镁催化剂上的氧化转换，详细分析了反应动力学，并提出了一个机制，该机制包括在催化剂上激活丙烷生成丙基自由基，在气体相中进行自由基链机制。关键点如下：

1. 丙烷氧化脱氢化和裂解的催化性能可达到丙烯和乙烯产量高达50%。

2. 通过改变反应物分压以及向反应混合物中添加产物物种来研究反应动力学。

3. 可以用一个机制来质性解释，该机制包括在催化剂上激活丙烷生成丙基自由基，在气体相中进行自由基链机制。

4. 烷烃活化是所有产物的速率决定步骤。

5. 氧气在机制中有两个功能：显著影响气体相化学，增加链传递自由基的类型和浓度；并促进从表面OH物种去除氢原子，这些物种是在催化剂上激活丙烷时形成的。

6. 二氧化碳对反应有强烈的抑制作用，但不改变产物分布，原因是它在激活丙烷的位点上强烈吸附。
