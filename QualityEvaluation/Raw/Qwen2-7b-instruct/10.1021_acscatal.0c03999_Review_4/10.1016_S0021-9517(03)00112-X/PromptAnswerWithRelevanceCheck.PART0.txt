The presence of oxygen is crucial for propane conversion, as it opens a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals. The role of oxygen is complex, influencing both the homogeneous and heterogeneous chemistry. The mechanism includes heterogeneous initiation on the catalyst and homogeneous radical chain propagation reactions. The initiation takes place mainly on the catalyst at low propane partial pressures. When propane is activated, a propyl radical is formed by hydrogen abstraction. Depending on the type of hydrogen abstracted, two different propyl radicals can be formed. These radicals have different decomposition routes, with the methyl radical forming methane and regenerating the propyl radical. The rates of production of i-propyl and n-propyl radicals in the propagation steps are comparable. Oxygen affects both the homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and the proposed reaction mechanism is represented in Figure 15.

氧气对于丙烷转化至关重要，因为它通过OH自由基打开了快速反应途径。氧气的作用复杂，影响着均相和异相化学反应。机制包括在催化剂上的异相起始以及自由基链传递反应。起始主要发生在催化剂上，且在低丙烷分压下进行。当丙烷被激活时，会产生一个丙基自由基，通过氢原子抽取。根据抽取的氢原子类型的不同，可以形成两种不同的丙基自由基。这些自由基有不同的分解路径，甲基自由基会形成甲烷并再生丙基自由基。在传播步骤中，i-丙基和n-丙基自由基的生产率相当。氧气影响着均相和异相反应，提出的反应机制在图15中表示。

The study focuses on the oxidative conversion of propane over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts, presenting a detailed analysis of reaction kinetics and proposing a mechanism that includes activation of propane on the catalyst leading to the formation of propyl radicals undergoing a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase. The key points are:

1. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).

2. The reaction kinetics were studied by varying the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture.

3. The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase.

4. Alkane activation is rate determining.

5. Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism: influencing the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly by increasing the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals, and facilitating the removal of hydrogen from the surface OH species formed during the activation of propane on the catalyst.

6. Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to its strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.
