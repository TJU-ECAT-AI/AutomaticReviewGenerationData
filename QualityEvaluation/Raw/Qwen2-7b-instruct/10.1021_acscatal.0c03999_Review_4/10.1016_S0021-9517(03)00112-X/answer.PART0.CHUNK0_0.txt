1. A detailed study on the reaction kinetics of propane and propene oxidation in the presence of oxygen over Li/Dy/MgO catalysts is reported in this paper. The reaction mechanism of propene oxidative conversion is proposed based on kinetic measurements.

2. Activation of alkanes via a CH bond splitting is the rate-determining step for all reaction products.

3. The presence of gas-phase oxygen is crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of reaction rates by increasing oxygen concentration is attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals.

4. Oxygen has a second function of regenerating the catalyst by removing hydrogen from the catalyst, restoring its activity for generation of radicals.

5. Carbon dioxide strongly suppresses the activity of the catalyst for all products. This is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site.

6. Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceed mainly on the catalyst.

7. The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step.

8. Gas-phase radical chemistry largely determines the selectivity pattern.

1. 在这篇论文中，报告了对丙烷和丙烯在Li/Dy/MgO催化剂存在下氧化反应动力学的详细研究，并基于动力学测量提出了丙烯氧化转换的反应机制。

2. 通过CH键断裂进行的烷烃激活是所有反应产物的决定性步骤。

3. 气相氧的存在对于丙烷转化至关重要。通过增加氧浓度导致的反应速率显著增加，归因于氧分子与链传递体自由基的相互作用，从而打开快速反应途径，通过OH自由基。

4. 氧气的第二个功能是通过从催化剂中去除氢原子来再生催化剂，恢复其生成自由基的能力。

5. 二氧化碳强烈抑制催化剂的所有产品活性。这归因于在活性位点形成Li+CO3导致的活性位点阻塞。

6. 丙烯的连续反应几乎仅产生碳氧化物，并主要在催化剂上进行。

7. 乙烯、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势证实了烷烃中的氢原子抽取是决定性步骤。

8. 气相自由基化学在很大程度上决定了选择性模式。
