[1] "The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species to the reaction mixture."
[2] "The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase."
[3] "Alkane activation is rate determining."
[4] "Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased."
[5] "The second function of oxygen is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen from the surface OHspecies that are formed during the activation of propane on the catalyst."
[6] "Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane."

1. The reaction kinetics were explored by altering the partial pressures of reactants and adding product species to the reaction mixture.
2. The findings can be explained by a mechanism involving propane activation on the catalyst leading to the creation of propyl radicals undergoing a radical-chain process in the gas phase.
3. Activation of alkanes is the rate-determining step.
4. Oxygen's role includes significantly impacting radical gas-phase chemistry with increased types and concentrations of chain propagator radicals at low oxygen levels.
5. Oxygen also aids in removing hydrogen from surface OH species formed during propane activation.
6. Carbon dioxide strongly hinders the reaction without altering the product distribution, due to its strong adsorption on the propane-activating site.

1. 反应动力学通过改变反应物的分压以及向反应混合物中添加产物物种进行了研究。
2. 观察结果可以用一种机制来解释，该机制包括在催化剂上激活丙烷生成丙基自由基，在气相中经历自由基链机制。
3. 烷烃活化是决定性的步骤。
4. 氧的作用包括显著影响自由基气相化学，低氧水平时增加了链传递自由基的类型和浓度。
5. 氧还帮助从表面OH物种去除氢，这些物种是在催化剂上丙烷激活期间形成的。
6. 二氧化碳强烈抑制反应而不改变产物分布，这是由于其对激活丙烷的位点的强烈吸附所致。
