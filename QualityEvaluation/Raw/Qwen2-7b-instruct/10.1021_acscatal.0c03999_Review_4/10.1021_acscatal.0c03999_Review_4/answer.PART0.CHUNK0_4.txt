3.2.1. Identification of Active Ga2O3 Polymorphs
"To establish the correlation between activity and Ga2O3 polymorphs, Zheng et al. have evaluated the activity performance of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP."
"β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
"Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
"The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
"Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
"α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity;"
"Reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
"On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
"Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."

The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit superior activity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, affecting their activity. The presence of tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 creates coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites that promote dehydrogenation reactions. In contrast, α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ sites with weaker acidity, which are less effective in forming Lewis acid sites. The initial activity is highest on β-Ga2O3, while γ-Ga2O3 shows comparable activity. The surface basicity is too low in β- and γ-Ga2O3, leading to less CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. However, the surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its positive impact in the early stages of the reaction.

不同Ga2O3晶相在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受其结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸中心的影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶相的活性优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸性密度按顺序递减为β > γ > δ > α，影响其活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3中四面体Ga原子的存在创造了配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，作为Lewis酸位点促进脱氢反应。相反，α-和δ-Ga2O3具有弱酸性的八面体Ga3+位点，形成Lewis酸位点的能力较弱。初始活性在β-Ga2O3中最高，而γ-Ga2O3表现出相近的活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3的表面碱性过低，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。然而，表面碱性位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应早期阶段的正向作用。
