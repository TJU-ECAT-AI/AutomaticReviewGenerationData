[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
[2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
[3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
[4] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
[5] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
[6] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."
[7] "Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. This difference is explained by the surface acidity and basicity of the polymorphs. β-Ga2O3 has the highest surface acidity density, which correlates with its initial activity and is conducive to the dehydrogenation reaction. γ-Ga2O3, while having lower acidity density compared to β-Ga2O3, still shows superior catalytic performance due to its structure that allows the formation of surface Lewis acid sites. These sites are responsible for the dehydrogenation process. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide, without involving a redox cycle. The activity trend is explained by the differences in Lewis acidity, where the acidic sites facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, while the basic sites hinder CO2 adsorption and activation.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸中心对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能产生显著影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出色，优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。这种差异可以通过晶相的表面酸性和碱性来解释。β-Ga2O3具有最高的表面酸性密度，这与它的初始活性相关，并有利于脱氢反应。γ-Ga2O3虽然与β-Ga2O3相比酸性密度较低，但仍能表现出优越的催化性能，这是由于其结构允许形成表面Lewis酸中心。这些中心负责脱氢过程。在稳定状态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而无需涉及还原周期。活性趋势通过酸性位点促进脱氢反应，而碱性位点阻碍CO2吸附和活化来解释。
