[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
[2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
[3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
[4] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
[5] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
[6] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
[7] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."
[8] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
[9] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle."
[10] "For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. This is due to several factors:

1. **Acidity and Basicity**: β-Ga2O3 has a higher surface acidity density compared to γ-Ga2O3, γ-Ga2O3 compared to δ-Ga2O3, and δ-Ga2O3 compared to α-Ga2O3. This difference in acidity affects the reaction rates.

2. **Lewis Acid Sites**: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which generate coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites that act as Lewis acid sites. These sites are responsible for the dehydrogenation reactions. In contrast, α- and δ-Ga2O3 contain octahedral Ga3+ ions, which are less acidic and can undergo reconstruction to create surface Lewis acid sites.

3. **Initial Activity**: The initial activity of the catalyst depends on the surface acid density. β-Ga2O3 maximizes this activity due to its high surface acidity. Surface basic sites are present but insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8.

4. **Reduction Mechanism**: At the initial stage of the reaction, the reduction of Ga cations occurs, which benefits the dehydrogenation process (DHP). However, at the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

5. **Textural Properties**: Various methods have been developed to enhance the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as using nanocasting techniques or hydrothermal methods. These methods can improve surface area, porosity, and the distribution of Lewis acid sites, which further boosts catalytic performance.

不同Ga2O3多晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及路易斯酸位点影响其催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出色，这与以下因素有关：

1. 酸性和碱性：β-Ga2O3的表面酸密度高于γ-Ga2O3，γ-Ga2O3高于δ-Ga2O3，δ-Ga2O3高于α-Ga2O3。这种酸度差异影响了反应速率。

2. 路易斯酸位点：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga离子，产生配位不饱和Ga3+位点作为路易斯酸位点。这些位点负责脱氢反应。相比之下，α-和δ-Ga2O3含有八面体Ga3+离子，酸性较弱，并且可以通过重构形成表面路易斯酸位点。

3. 初始活性：催化剂的初始活性取决于表面酸密度。β-Ga2O3由于其高表面酸度而达到最大值。表面碱性位点存在但不足以吸附和激活CO2，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。

4. 还原机制：反应初期，Ga离子发生还原，这对脱氢过程有益。然而，在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而无需氧化还原循环。

5. 纹理特性：已开发出多种方法来增强Ga2O3的纹理特性，如使用纳米铸造技术或尿素基水热方法。这些方法可以提高表面积、孔隙率和路易斯酸位点的分布，进一步提升了催化性能。
