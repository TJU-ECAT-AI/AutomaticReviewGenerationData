The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. This is attributed to their higher surface acidity and surface basicity, where β-Ga2O3 has the highest surface acidity. The initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs depends on their surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 showing the maximum activity. The differences in Lewis acidity between the polymorphs explain the observed activity trend. The surface base site density correlates with the initial activity, indicating its promotional effect. The reduction of Ga cations at the initial stage of the reaction benefits the DHP process. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle. Various methods, including nanocasting techniques and urea-based hydrothermal methods, have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, aiming to enhance its surface area and catalytic performance.

The nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template allows for a significant increase in surface area up to 307 m2 g1, while the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent results in a surface area of 29 m2 g1. Wu et al.'s method synthesizes mesoporous Ga2O3 with high surface area using a water-soluble, eco-friendly sucrose as a nonsurfactant template. By increasing the sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio, the surface area of β-Ga2O3 can be varied in the range of 6598 m2 g1. Among the catalysts, β-Ga2O3S4 (sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio = 4) exhibits the highest catalytic performance, surpassing the thermal decomposition-prepared β-Ga2O3. The HS-prepared Ga2O3Al2O3 (GA) catalysts feature large pore sizes and more tetrahedral Ga ions as Lewis acid sites, contributing to their improved catalytic performance.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性以及Lewis酸中心，对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶相在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出色。这归因于它们较高的表面酸性和表面碱性，其中β-Ga2O3具有最高的表面酸性。Ga2O3晶相的初始活性取决于其表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3展现出最大的活性。不同晶相间的Lewis酸性差异解释了观察到的活性趋势。表面碱基位点密度与初始活性有关，表明它在反应初期的促进作用。反应初期，Ga离子的还原过程对DHP过程有益。在稳态阶段，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而无需红氧化循环。为调节Ga2O3的纹理特性，已开发出多种方法，包括使用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米铸造技术以及使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的尿素基水热方法，旨在提高其表面积和催化性能。

使用水溶性、环保的蔗糖作为非表面活性剂模板的纳米铸造技术允许将表面面积增加至高达307 m2 g1。尿素基水热方法使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的结果是表面面积为29 m2 g1。吴等人提出了一种合成具有高表面积的多孔Ga2O3的方法，使用可溶性、环保的蔗糖作为非表面活性剂模板。通过增加蔗糖/Ga2O3摩尔比，β-Ga2O3的表面面积可以变化在6598 m2 g1范围内。在催化剂中，β-Ga2O3S4（蔗糖/Ga2O3摩尔比= 4）展现出最高的催化性能，超过热分解制备的β-Ga2O3。水热法制备的Ga2O3Al2O3（GA）催化剂具有较大的孔径和更多的四面体Ga离子作为Lewis酸中心，从而提高了其催化性能。
