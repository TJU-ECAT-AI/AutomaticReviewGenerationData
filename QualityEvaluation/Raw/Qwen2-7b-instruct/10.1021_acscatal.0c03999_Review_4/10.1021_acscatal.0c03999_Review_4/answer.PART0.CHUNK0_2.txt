[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
[2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
[3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
[4] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
[5] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."
[6] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
[7] "Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend."
[8] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. This is attributed to their higher surface acidity density and surface basicity, with β-Ga2O3 having the highest surface acidity density. The initial activity of these catalysts is highly dependent on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 showing the maximum activity. The difference in Lewis acidity explains the activity trend. Moreover, the surface basicity of Ga2O3 affects its CO2 conversion efficiency, being lower than C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with the initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the early stages of the reaction. At the steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α、β、γ和δ）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出色。这归因于它们更高的表面酸密度和表面碱性，其中β-Ga2O3具有最高的表面酸密度。这些催化剂的初始活性高度依赖于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3的活性最高。不同Lewis酸性的差异解释了活性趋势。此外，Ga2O3的表面碱性影响其CO2转化效率，低于C3H8。表面碱基位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应早期的促进作用。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而不涉及还原周期，这是在第3.2.3节中讨论的内容。
