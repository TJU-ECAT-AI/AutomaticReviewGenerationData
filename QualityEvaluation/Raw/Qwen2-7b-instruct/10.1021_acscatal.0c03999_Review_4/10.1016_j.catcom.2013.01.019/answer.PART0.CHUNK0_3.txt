[1] "In the presence of CO2, over the most active materials, during 4 h on stream at 823 K, propene was produced with the yield of 1018% and high selectivity of 9195%."
[2] "Moreover, pure mesoporous gallium oxide exerted a higher resistance on deactivation during the DHP-CO2 process in comparison with gallium oxide prepared without a hard template."
[3] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support."
[4] "Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
[5] "Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied temperatures. In addition, light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) as well as small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are produced."
[6] "The selectivity to the side products rises with temperature indicating that hydrocracking, cracking and dehydrocyclization reactions are more privileged at high temperatures."
[7] "In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."

1. The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained through these factors. 

2. Pure mesoporous Ga2O3m and mixed GaAlO(Al/Ga=1:4) show promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. Their resistance to deactivation is higher compared to the Ga2O3-t material prepared without a hard template.

3. The catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 processes over Ga-containing materials is affected by two factors: the acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or support properties, and pore geometry, especially in highly porous Ga-containing materials.

4. The higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution, facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied temperatures. Light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethene) and small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are also produced.

6. The selectivity to side products increases with temperature, indicating that hydrocracking, cracking, and dehydrocyclization reactions become more favorable at higher temperatures.

7. The stability of Ga2O3m is investigated, showing that the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking over multiple dehydrogenation cycles. However, after short regeneration with air, the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance.

1. 不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸中心的影响。在初始阶段和稳态阶段反应过程中，活性趋势和选择性的解释涉及这些因素。

2. 纯的微孔镓氧化物和混合镓铝氧（Al/Ga=1:4）在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的过程中显示出有前景的催化性能，在存在二氧化碳的情况下。它们在DHP-CO2过程中对失活的抵抗力比没有硬模板制备的镓氧化物更高。

3. 在DHP-CO2过程中，Ga含材料的催化性能受两个因素影响：酸度，由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑特性决定，以及孔隙几何形状，特别是在高度多孔的Ga含材料中。

4. 高选择性到丙烯可能是由于Ga2O3m均匀的微孔结构及其较高的孔径分布顺序所引起的，这促进了脱氢反应。

5. 在所有研究的温度下，丙烯是主要的产品。此外，还产生了轻烃（甲烷、乙烷和乙烯）以及少量芳香烃（苯和甲苯）。

6. 温度升高时，侧产品的选择性增加，表明在较高温度下，裂解、裂化和脱氢环化反应更占优势。

7. 对Ga2O3m的稳定性进行了研究，显示丙烯的产率逐渐降低，这是由于结焦导致的。然而，在空气短时间再生后，微孔Ga2O3m几乎完全恢复了其催化性能。
