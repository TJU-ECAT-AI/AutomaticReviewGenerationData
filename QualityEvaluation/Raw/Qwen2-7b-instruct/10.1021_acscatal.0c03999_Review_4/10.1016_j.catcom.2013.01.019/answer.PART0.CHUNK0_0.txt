[1] "Over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conversion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated more slowly than Ga2O3-t."
[2] "For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3."
[3] "We suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
[4] "The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support."
[5] "In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."
[6] "In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition."

1. The initial conversion of propane over Ga2O3Al2O3 materials was lower than Ga2O3-t, but they deactivated more slowly during the DHP-CO2 process.
2. Higher selectivity to propene was obtained over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3 in the DHP-CO2 process.
3. The higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m might be attributed to its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution.
4. Acidity in the Ga2O3 polymorphs and support properties determine the selectivity in DHP-CO2.
5. Mesoporous Ga2O3m retained its catalytic performance even after multiple dehydrogenation cycles, recovering almost completely after regeneration.
6. The Boudouard reaction (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) did not suppress coke deposition during the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

1. Ga2O3Al2O3材料的初始丙烷转化率低于Ga2O3-t，但在DHP-CO2过程中，多孔材料的失活速度较慢。
2. 在DHP-CO2过程中，α-和β-Ga2O3晶相的丙烯选择性高于δ-和γ-Ga2O3。
3. Ga2O3m的高丙烯选择性可能归因于其均匀的多孔结构和更高的孔径分布顺序。
4. Ga2O3晶相组成和支持性质的酸度决定了DHP-CO2过程中的选择性。
5. 多孔Ga2O3m即使在多次脱氢化循环后仍能保持其催化性能，并且在空气再生后几乎完全恢复性能。
6. Boudouard反应（Ccoke+CO2=2CO）没有抑制CO2存在下丙烷脱氢化过程中的结焦沉积。
