[1] "Over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conversion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated more slowly than Ga2O3-t."
[2] "For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3."
[3] "We suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
[4] "The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support."
[5] "In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."
[6] "In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition."

[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."
[2] "For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."
[3] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."
[4] "Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
[5] "It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which could decrease the selectivity to propene."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions through two main factors. The first factor is acidity, which is determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support. For instance, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit higher selectivity in the DHP-CO2 process compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The second factor involves pore geometry, particularly in highly porous Ga-containing materials, affecting the selectivity of propene formation. In the case of mesoporous Ga2O3 materials, such as Ga2O3m, the uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene. This is because the mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction by allowing rapid diffusion of products in the largest pores, thus preventing side reactions that could decrease the selectivity to propene.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能主要受到两个因素的影响。第一个因素是酸性，这由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑物的性质决定。例如，α-和β-Ga2O3晶型在DHP-CO2过程中比δ-和γ-Ga2O3表现出更高的选择性。第二个因素涉及孔隙几何形状，尤其是在高孔隙率的Ga基材料中，影响丙烯生成的选择性。对于介孔Ga2O3材料，如Ga2O3m，其均匀的介孔结构以及孔径分布的更高顺序有助于提高丙烯生成的选择性。这是因为介孔性促进了产品的快速扩散，允许在最大孔隙中进行反应，从而防止降低丙烯生成的选择性。

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The acidity, which can be determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a crucial role in the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. An increase in the density of acid sites and the initial yield of propene leads to an increase in the amount of coke deposited during the DHP-CO2 process. Higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m may be attributed to its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution. At all studied temperatures, propene is the primary product formed along with light hydrocarbons and small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons.

结构特征、表面性质和路易斯酸中心的不同Ga2O3晶相在CO2-ODHP反应中对其催化性能有显著影响。酸性，可以通过Ga2O3的相组成或支持物的性质来确定，在反应的初始和稳态阶段起着关键作用。酸中心密度和初始丙烯产率的增加导致DHP-CO2过程中焦炭沉积量的增加。Ga2O3m的高选择性可能归因于其均匀的微孔结构及其孔径分布的更高秩序。在所有研究的温度下，丙烯是主要产物，同时还会产生轻烃和少量芳香烃。

1. The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions is influenced by their structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained through these factors. 

2. Pure mesoporous Ga2O3m and mixed GaAlO(Al/Ga=1:4) show promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2. Their resistance to deactivation is higher compared to the Ga2O3-t material prepared without a hard template.

3. The catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 processes over Ga-containing materials is affected by two factors: the acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or support properties, and pore geometry, especially in highly porous Ga-containing materials.

4. The higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution, facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied temperatures. Light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethene) and small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are also produced.

6. The selectivity to side products increases with temperature, indicating that hydrocracking, cracking, and dehydrocyclization reactions become more favorable at higher temperatures.

7. The stability of Ga2O3m is investigated, showing that the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking over multiple dehydrogenation cycles. However, after short regeneration with air, the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance.

1. 不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能受到其结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸中心的影响。在初始阶段和稳态阶段反应过程中，活性趋势和选择性的解释涉及这些因素。

2. 纯的微孔镓氧化物和混合镓铝氧（Al/Ga=1:4）在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的过程中显示出有前景的催化性能，在存在二氧化碳的情况下。它们在DHP-CO2过程中对失活的抵抗力比没有硬模板制备的镓氧化物更高。

3. 在DHP-CO2过程中，Ga含材料的催化性能受两个因素影响：酸度，由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑特性决定，以及孔隙几何形状，特别是在高度多孔的Ga含材料中。

4. 高选择性到丙烯可能是由于Ga2O3m均匀的微孔结构及其较高的孔径分布顺序所引起的，这促进了脱氢反应。

5. 在所有研究的温度下，丙烯是主要的产品。此外，还产生了轻烃（甲烷、乙烷和乙烯）以及少量芳香烃（苯和甲苯）。

6. 温度升高时，侧产品的选择性增加，表明在较高温度下，裂解、裂化和脱氢环化反应更占优势。

7. 对Ga2O3m的稳定性进行了研究，显示丙烯的产率逐渐降低，这是由于结焦导致的。然而，在空气短时间再生后，微孔Ga2O3m几乎完全恢复了其催化性能。

1. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display varying degrees of activity in CO2-ODHP reactions, with β-Ga2O3 showing higher catalytic performance compared to α-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs. The activity trend can be explained by the unique Lewis acid sites present on the surfaces of these polymorphs, which facilitate the reverse water-gas shift and Boudouard reactions, enhancing olefin yield and suppressing coke deposition.

2. The presence of hard template during the synthesis of Ga2O3 suppresses the collapse of mesopore structure that typically occurs during the recrystallization of gallium oxide. This results in a stable mesoporous structure, which enhances the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. During the steady-state stage of CO2-ODHP reactions, the selectivity to propene over Ga2O3 materials depends on two factors: acidity and pore geometry. The acidity is determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, influencing the selectivity to propene. Additionally, pore geometry plays a crucial role, especially in highly porous Ga-containing materials, as it facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction by enabling rapid diffusion of products through the available space of the largest pores, thus preventing side reactions and maintaining high selectivity to propene.

4. After the initial reaction period, the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 materials, particularly Ga2O3-t, diminishes rapidly. However, upon short regeneration with air, these materials regain their catalytic performance, demonstrating high stability under operation conditions.

1. 不同Ga2O3相态（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-Ga2O3相态显示了与α-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3相比更高的催化性能，活动趋势可以由这些相态表面独特的Lewis酸位点解释，这些位点促进反向水煤气变换和布杜瓦德反应，增强烯烃产率并抑制结焦沉积。

2. 在Ga2O3合成过程中使用硬模板可以抑制在镓氧化物再结晶期间发生的多孔结构塌陷。这导致稳定多孔结构的形成，从而增强Ga2O3在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。

3. 在CO2-ODHP反应的稳态阶段，Ga2O3材料的丙烯选择性取决于两个因素：酸性和孔几何形状。酸性由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑材料的性质决定，影响丙烯的选择性。此外，孔几何形状起着关键作用，尤其是在高孔隙度Ga基材料中，它通过允许产品快速通过最大孔隙空间的可用空间进行扩散，从而防止副反应并保持高丙烯选择性。

4. 在初始反应阶段之后，Ga2O3材料，特别是Ga2O3-t，其催化性能迅速降低。然而，在空气短时间再生之后，这些材料能够完全恢复其催化性能，显示出在操作条件下高稳定性。
