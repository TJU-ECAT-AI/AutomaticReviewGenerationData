[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."
[2] "For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."
[3] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."
[4] "Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
[5] "It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which could decrease the selectivity to propene."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions through two main factors. The first factor is acidity, which is determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support. For instance, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit higher selectivity in the DHP-CO2 process compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The second factor involves pore geometry, particularly in highly porous Ga-containing materials, affecting the selectivity of propene formation. In the case of mesoporous Ga2O3 materials, such as Ga2O3m, the uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene. This is because the mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction by allowing rapid diffusion of products in the largest pores, thus preventing side reactions that could decrease the selectivity to propene.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能主要受到两个因素的影响。第一个因素是酸性，这由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑物的性质决定。例如，α-和β-Ga2O3晶型在DHP-CO2过程中比δ-和γ-Ga2O3表现出更高的选择性。第二个因素涉及孔隙几何形状，尤其是在高孔隙率的Ga基材料中，影响丙烯生成的选择性。对于介孔Ga2O3材料，如Ga2O3m，其均匀的介孔结构以及孔径分布的更高顺序有助于提高丙烯生成的选择性。这是因为介孔性促进了产品的快速扩散，允许在最大孔隙中进行反应，从而防止降低丙烯生成的选择性。
