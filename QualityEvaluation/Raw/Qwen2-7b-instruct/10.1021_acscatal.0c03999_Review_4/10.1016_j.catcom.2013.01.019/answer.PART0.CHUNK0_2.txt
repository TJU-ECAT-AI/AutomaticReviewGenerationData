[1] "In DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."
[2] "Moreover,with raising the density of acid sites and initial yield of propene the amount of coke deposited during DHP-CO2 process increases."
[3] "We suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
[4] "Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied temperatures. In addition, light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) as well as small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are produced."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The acidity, which can be determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a crucial role in the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. An increase in the density of acid sites and the initial yield of propene leads to an increase in the amount of coke deposited during the DHP-CO2 process. Higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m may be attributed to its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution. At all studied temperatures, propene is the primary product formed along with light hydrocarbons and small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons.

结构特征、表面性质和路易斯酸中心的不同Ga2O3晶相在CO2-ODHP反应中对其催化性能有显著影响。酸性，可以通过Ga2O3的相组成或支持物的性质来确定，在反应的初始和稳态阶段起着关键作用。酸中心密度和初始丙烯产率的增加导致DHP-CO2过程中焦炭沉积量的增加。Ga2O3m的高选择性可能归因于其均匀的微孔结构及其孔径分布的更高秩序。在所有研究的温度下，丙烯是主要产物，同时还会产生轻烃和少量芳香烃。
