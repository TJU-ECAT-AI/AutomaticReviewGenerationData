          "[1] Over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conversion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated more slowly than Ga2O3-t."
          "[2] For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3."
          "[3] We suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
          "[4] The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support."
          "[5] In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."
          "[6] In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained through these factors. For instance, higher selectivity to propene is observed over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The initial conversion of propane over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is slightly lower than Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process, mesoporous materials deactivate more slowly than Ga2O3-t. The acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Additionally, the uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution in Ga2O3m contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene. The dehydrogenation reaction of propane in the presence of CO2 does not suppress coke deposition.

          不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸位点影响其催化性能。在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段，活性趋势和选择性的解释涉及这些因素。例如，与δ-和γ-Ga2O3相比，在α-和β-Ga2O3晶相中观察到更高的丙烯选择性。Ga2O3m和Ga2O3Al2O3材料的丙烷初始转化率略低于Ga2O3-t，但在DHP-CO2过程中，多孔材料的失活速度比Ga2O3-t慢。酸性，由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑材料的性质决定，对催化性能起着关键作用。此外，Ga2O3m均匀的多孔结构及其孔径分布的更高顺序有助于提高丙烯选择性。在存在CO2的丙烷脱氢化反应中，不会抑制结焦沉积。

          "[1] In DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support."
          "[2] Moreover,with raising the density of acid sites and initial yield of propene the amount of coke deposited during DHP-CO2 process increases."
          "[3] We suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
          "[4] Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied temperatures. In addition, light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) as well as small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are produced."

          In the DHP-CO2 process over Ga-containing materials, the selectivity to propene depends on two factors: the acidity, which can be determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, and the density of acid sites and the initial yield of propene. An increase in the amount of coke deposited during the DHP-CO2 process is observed when the density of acid sites and initial yield of propene are raised. Higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m may be attributed to its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution. Propene is the primary product formed at all studied temperatures, accompanied by the production of light hydrocarbons and small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons.

          在包含镓的材料中进行DHP-CO2过程时，丙烯的选择性取决于两个因素：酸性，这可以由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑材料的性质决定，以及酸中心的密度和初始丙烯产率。在DHP-CO2过程中，随着酸中心密度和初始丙烯产率的增加，沉积的焦炭量增加。Ga2O3m的高选择性可能归因于其均匀的多孔结构及其孔径分布的更高顺序。所有研究的温度下，丙烯是主要的产品，同时还生产轻烃和少量芳香烃。
