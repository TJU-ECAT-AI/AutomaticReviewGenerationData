[1] "In the de- hydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2)."
[2] "CO2 enhances the olefin yield and sup- presses coke deposition by participation in the reverse water-gas shift (2) and Boudouard (3) reactions, respectively."
[3] "Taking into account the advantages of the nanocasting route and the promising catalytic performance of Ga-containing materials, we decided to prepare thermally stable ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials using CMK-3 as a hard template."
[4] "In the case of Ga2O3, the presence of hard template suppresses collapse of mesopore structure that typically occurs during gallium oxide recrystallization."
[5] "CO2 enhances the olefin yield and sup- presses coke deposition by participation in the reverse water-gas shift (2) and Boudouard (3) reactions, respectively."
[6] "The highest initial conversion of propane was achieved for the Ga2O3-t sample. However, this material rapidly lost its activity and after 250 min on stream it was almost inactive."
[7] "Over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conver- sion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated more slowly than Ga2O3-t."
[8] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is as- sociated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase com- position of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."
[9] "Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied tempera- tures. In addition, light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) as well as small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene) are produced."
[10] "However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."

1. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display varying degrees of activity in CO2-ODHP reactions, with β-Ga2O3 showing higher catalytic performance compared to α-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs. The activity trend can be explained by the unique Lewis acid sites present on the surfaces of these polymorphs, which facilitate the reverse water-gas shift and Boudouard reactions, enhancing olefin yield and suppressing coke deposition.

2. The presence of hard template during the synthesis of Ga2O3 suppresses the collapse of mesopore structure that typically occurs during the recrystallization of gallium oxide. This results in a stable mesoporous structure, which enhances the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. During the steady-state stage of CO2-ODHP reactions, the selectivity to propene over Ga2O3 materials depends on two factors: acidity and pore geometry. The acidity is determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, influencing the selectivity to propene. Additionally, pore geometry plays a crucial role, especially in highly porous Ga-containing materials, as it facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction by enabling rapid diffusion of products through the available space of the largest pores, thus preventing side reactions and maintaining high selectivity to propene.

4. After the initial reaction period, the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 materials, particularly Ga2O3-t, diminishes rapidly. However, upon short regeneration with air, these materials regain their catalytic performance, demonstrating high stability under operation conditions.

1. 不同Ga2O3相态（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-Ga2O3相态显示了与α-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3相比更高的催化性能，活动趋势可以由这些相态表面独特的Lewis酸位点解释，这些位点促进反向水煤气变换和布杜瓦德反应，增强烯烃产率并抑制结焦沉积。

2. 在Ga2O3合成过程中使用硬模板可以抑制在镓氧化物再结晶期间发生的多孔结构塌陷。这导致稳定多孔结构的形成，从而增强Ga2O3在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。

3. 在CO2-ODHP反应的稳态阶段，Ga2O3材料的丙烯选择性取决于两个因素：酸性和孔几何形状。酸性由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑材料的性质决定，影响丙烯的选择性。此外，孔几何形状起着关键作用，尤其是在高孔隙度Ga基材料中，它通过允许产品快速通过最大孔隙空间的可用空间进行扩散，从而防止副反应并保持高丙烯选择性。

4. 在初始反应阶段之后，Ga2O3材料，特别是Ga2O3-t，其催化性能迅速降低。然而，在空气短时间再生之后，这些材料能够完全恢复其催化性能，显示出在操作条件下高稳定性。
