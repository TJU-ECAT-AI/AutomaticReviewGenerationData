[1] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."
[2] "Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[3] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."
[4] "In the presence of Sn, this energy barrier is increased, as is shown in Figure 28, therefore decreasing the activity of the catalyst."
[5] "Indeed, metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, albeit they deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations."
[6] "Nevertheless, metal oxide-based catalysts can operate at relatively low, intermediate, and high space velocities, respectively."
[7] "Indeed, for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt-based catalysts, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively."

[2] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[3] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[4] "To date, five main industrial processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been patented, two of which are currently being used to produce light olefins."
[5] "The reaction is run at temperatures of approximately 575 C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar."
[6] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[7] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
[8] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[9] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[10] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[11] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[12] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."

[1] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[2] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[3] "An active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants."

The surface area plays a crucial role in stabilizing Cr6+ sites when using silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Conversely, titania is not a suitable support for CrOx due to its weak interaction with the oxide, which leads to easy sintering. However, by doping titania with Cr, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst can be created.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. 

α-Ga2O3 is the least active polymorph, β-Ga2O3 is the most active, while γ- and δ-Ga2O3 show intermediate activity. The activity trends are explained by the presence of weak Lewis acid sites on the β-Ga2O3 surface, which are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. The concentration of these sites correlates with propane conversion. 

During the initial stages of the reaction, the Lewis acid sites are involved in the adsorption and dehydrogenation of propane. In the steady-state, the surface chemistry of Ga2O3 evolves, and the formation of Brønsted acid sites competes with the Lewis acid sites. This leads to a decrease in dehydrogenation activity. The balance between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites determines the overall activity of the catalyst.

The presence of carbon species on the catalyst surface, as reported by McGregor et al., suggests that these species might be catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction. Elevated temperatures enhance cracking, which becomes the dominant reaction, reducing selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

The oxygen-containing groups (CO) formed during the pretreatment with nitric acid are proposed to be the active sites in carbon-based catalysts. These groups are involved in the dehydrogenation of propane.

Catalysts tend to deactivate faster at higher space velocities, which is linked to the increased rate of coke formation. Changes in reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, thereby improving catalyst stability.

Only catalysts whose space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined were included in the comparison. This ensures a fair assessment of the catalytic performance across different catalyst types.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
不同Ga2O3晶系的结构特性和表面性质影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α-Ga2O3是活性最低的晶系，β-Ga2O3是活性最高的，而γ-和δ-Ga2O3的活性介于两者之间。活性趋势由β-Ga2O3表面的弱Lewis酸位点决定，这些位点对于脱氢作用至关重要。这些位点的浓度与丙烷转化率相关。

反应初期，Lewis酸位点参与丙烷的吸附和脱氢化。稳态阶段，Ga2O3表面化学特性发生变化，Brønsted酸位点与Lewis酸位点的竞争导致脱氢化活性下降。Lewis酸位点和Brønsted酸位点之间的平衡决定了催化剂的整体活性。

McGregor等人的报道显示，催化剂表面的碳物种实际上可能正在催化反应。提高温度会增强裂解，这成为主导反应，降低了目标烯烃产物的选择性。

氧含基团（CO）在硝酸预处理过程中形成，被认为是碳基催化剂的活性位点。这些基团参与丙烷的脱氢化。

高空间速度下催化剂容易失活，这是由于焦炭形成速率增加。改变反应条件，如共注入蒸汽、氢气或CO2，可以减少焦炭形成，从而改善催化剂稳定性。

只有能够确定空间速度、失活率和初始产率的催化剂被纳入比较，以确保对不同催化剂类型进行公平评估。

[1] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In fact, it is thought that the comparable ionic sizes and charges of Al3+ and Cr3+ aid in the spreading and later integration of Cr3+ into the octahedral positions of alumina, leading to the formation of a chromia-alumina spinel that is ineffective for dehydrogenation reactions.
