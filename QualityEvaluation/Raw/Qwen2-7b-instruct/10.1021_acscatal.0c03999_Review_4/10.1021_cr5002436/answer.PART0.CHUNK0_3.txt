The majority of new propane dehydrogenation facilities will be established in China or the United States, utilizing either the Catofin or Oleflex technologies. A Catofin installation typically features 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors packed with a chromiaalumina catalyst. A simplified diagram illustrates the gas separation unit separating paraffins, cracking products, and hydrogen from olefins. Steam is added to the feed to decrease paraffin partial pressure and prevent coke formation. Step sites are more reactive for propane dehydrogenation, with the energy barrier for propylene formation being significantly lower on step sites (2434 kJ/mol) compared to the flat surface (6372 kJ/mol). Adding CO2 as a mild oxidant enhances the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by reversing the water gas shift reaction, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation. Achieving high activity and selectivity in chromium-based hydrogenation catalysts requires modifying catalyst composition and operating conditions. The addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant improves catalyst activity by facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction, which shifts the equilibrium towards product formation.

大多数新的丙烷脱氢装置将在中国或美国建立，使用的是Catofin或Oleflex技术。Catofin安装通常包括58个并行的绝热固定床反应器，填充有氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂。分离单元的简化图展示了从烷烃、裂解产物和氢气中分离出烯烃的过程。向原料中添加蒸汽以降低烷烃分压并防止结焦。步面位点对于丙烷脱氢更为活跃，形成丙烯的能量壁垒在步面位点（2434 kJ/mol）远低于平面上（6372 kJ/mol）。将二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂添加可以提高铬基脱氢催化剂的活性，通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除生成的氢气，从而有效推动产物形成。实现高活性和选择性铬基氢化催化剂需要调整催化剂组成和操作条件。通过添加二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂，可以促进逆向水煤气变换反应，从而推动平衡向产物形成方向移动，从而提高催化剂活性。
