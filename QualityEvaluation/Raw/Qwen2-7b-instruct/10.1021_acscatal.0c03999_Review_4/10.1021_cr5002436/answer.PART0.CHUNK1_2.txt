The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. 

α-Ga2O3 is the least active polymorph, β-Ga2O3 is the most active, while γ- and δ-Ga2O3 show intermediate activity. The activity trends are explained by the presence of weak Lewis acid sites on the β-Ga2O3 surface, which are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. The concentration of these sites correlates with propane conversion. 

During the initial stages of the reaction, the Lewis acid sites are involved in the adsorption and dehydrogenation of propane. In the steady-state, the surface chemistry of Ga2O3 evolves, and the formation of Brønsted acid sites competes with the Lewis acid sites. This leads to a decrease in dehydrogenation activity. The balance between Lewis and Brønsted acid sites determines the overall activity of the catalyst.

The presence of carbon species on the catalyst surface, as reported by McGregor et al., suggests that these species might be catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction. Elevated temperatures enhance cracking, which becomes the dominant reaction, reducing selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

The oxygen-containing groups (CO) formed during the pretreatment with nitric acid are proposed to be the active sites in carbon-based catalysts. These groups are involved in the dehydrogenation of propane.

Catalysts tend to deactivate faster at higher space velocities, which is linked to the increased rate of coke formation. Changes in reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, thereby improving catalyst stability.

Only catalysts whose space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined were included in the comparison. This ensures a fair assessment of the catalytic performance across different catalyst types.

不同Ga2O3晶系的结构特性和表面性质影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α-Ga2O3是活性最低的晶系，β-Ga2O3是活性最高的，而γ-和δ-Ga2O3的活性介于两者之间。活性趋势由β-Ga2O3表面的弱Lewis酸位点决定，这些位点对于脱氢作用至关重要。这些位点的浓度与丙烷转化率相关。

反应初期，Lewis酸位点参与丙烷的吸附和脱氢化。稳态阶段，Ga2O3表面化学特性发生变化，Brønsted酸位点与Lewis酸位点的竞争导致脱氢化活性下降。Lewis酸位点和Brønsted酸位点之间的平衡决定了催化剂的整体活性。

McGregor等人的报道显示，催化剂表面的碳物种实际上可能正在催化反应。提高温度会增强裂解，这成为主导反应，降低了目标烯烃产物的选择性。

氧含基团（CO）在硝酸预处理过程中形成，被认为是碳基催化剂的活性位点。这些基团参与丙烷的脱氢化。

高空间速度下催化剂容易失活，这是由于焦炭形成速率增加。改变反应条件，如共注入蒸汽、氢气或CO2，可以减少焦炭形成，从而改善催化剂稳定性。

只有能够确定空间速度、失活率和初始产率的催化剂被纳入比较，以确保对不同催化剂类型进行公平评估。
