[1] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."
[2] "Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[3] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."
[4] "In the presence of Sn, this energy barrier is increased, as is shown in Figure 28, therefore decreasing the activity of the catalyst."
[5] "Indeed, metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, albeit they deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations."
[6] "Nevertheless, metal oxide-based catalysts can operate at relatively low, intermediate, and high space velocities, respectively."
[7] "Indeed, for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt-based catalysts, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively."

1. β-Ga2O3 is the most stable and active Ga species in PDH according to some authors. Heterolytic dissociation is a proposed reaction mechanism involving H adsorption on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen.

2. Lewis acid sites, particularly coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, are necessary for dehydrogenation activity on Ga-based catalysts. This was substantiated by Chen et al. through NH3-TPD measurements.

3. The addition of Sn to the catalyst increases the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation reaction, thereby reducing the catalyst's activity.

4. Metal oxide-based catalysts can provide yields similar to Pt-based catalysts but often deactivate faster.

5. Metal oxide-based catalysts can operate at low, intermediate, or high space velocities, unlike Pt-based catalysts which typically operate at high space velocities.

6. The average specific activity of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is significantly higher than that of CrOx and GaOx catalysts.

1. β-Ga2O3是PDH中Ga物种中最稳定且活性最高的。提出了H异裂解反应机制，其中H吸附在Ga+Lewis酸位点上，而C3H7+吸附在相邻的氧原子上。

2. 杨等通过NH3-TPD测量与不同GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的活性数据的相关性，证明了高浓度的Lewis酸组分，以四面体配位的Ga3+离子的形式，是脱氢化活性的先决条件。

3. 添加Sn到催化剂中会增加脱氢化反应的能量壁垒，从而降低催化剂的活性。

4. 金属氧化物基催化剂可以提供与铂基催化剂相似的产率，但往往比铂基催化剂更快地失效。

5. 金属氧化物基催化剂可以在低、中或高空速下运行，而铂基催化剂通常在高空速下运行。

6. 铂基催化剂对丙烷脱氢的平均特定活动明显高于铬氧化物和镓氧化物催化剂。
