[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "However, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[3] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."

1. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the formation of vanadium species. Monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species dominate between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species are prevalent at higher loadings.
2. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are crucial for catalyst dispersion, acting as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors.
3. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are important for achieving a well-dispersed catalyst, serving as attachment points for vanadium precursor molecules.
4. Wu et al.'s findings indicate that monomeric species are the majority below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species are the most common between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species are dominant at higher loadings.
5. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is vital for catalyst dispersion, providing sites for vanadium precursor attachment.

1. 表面积与金属负载比决定了钒物种的形成。在低于1.2 V/nm2的负载下，单体物种占主导地位；在1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间，聚合态钒物种占优势；而高于此范围时，V2O5晶体物种更为常见。
2. 支撑表面的羟基团对于催化剂的分散至关重要，作为用于制备这些催化剂的钒前体的锚定位点。
3. 支撑表面的羟基团对于实现催化剂的良好分散非常重要，充当了前体分子的附着点。
4. 武等人发现，在低于1.2 V/nm2的负载下，单体物种占主导；在1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间，聚合态物种占优势；而负载较高时，V2O5晶体物种更为普遍。
5. 支撑表面上的羟基团对于催化剂的分散至关重要，为钒前体提供附着点。
