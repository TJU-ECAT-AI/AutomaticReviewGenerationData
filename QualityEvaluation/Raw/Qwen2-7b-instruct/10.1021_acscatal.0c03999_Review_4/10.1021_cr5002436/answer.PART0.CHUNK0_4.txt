[1] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The support's characteristics are crucial not just for determining the catalyst's physical properties, but also for influencing its catalytic activity and selectivity due to its interaction with the active component.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
支持的性质不仅决定了催化剂的机械性能，而且由于它与活性组分的相互作用，对催化剂的活性和选择性有着深远的影响。

<quotes>
[1] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In fact, it is thought that the comparable ionic sizes and charges of Al3+ and Cr3+ aid in the spreading and later integration of Cr3+ into the octahedral positions of alumina, leading to the formation of a chromia-alumina spinel that is ineffective for dehydrogenation reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
实际上，认为Al3+和Cr3+的相似电荷和离子大小促进了Cr3+在氧化铝八面体位置的扩散和随后的整合，这导致形成了一种对脱氢反应无效的铬氧-氧化铝尖晶石。

[1] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The abundance of inexpensive natural gas liquids, especially ethane, has led to a transition in the United States from naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane-based steam cracking, with ethane crackers being built while naphtha crackers are either being decommissioned or transformed.
