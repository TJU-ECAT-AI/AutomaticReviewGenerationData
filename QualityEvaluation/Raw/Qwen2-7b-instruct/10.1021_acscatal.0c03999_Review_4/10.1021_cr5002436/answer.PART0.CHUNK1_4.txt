[1] "Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH."
[2] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[3] "Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation."
[4] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."

1. Two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species, bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support, are the most active sites for dehydrogenation. 
2. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the type of vanadium species that form. Monomeric species are predominant at low loadings, while polymeric species dominate at higher loadings.
3. Isolated vanadium species are active but prone to deactivation from coke formation.
4. Treating V2O5 crystallites under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C can restore their activity as polymeric vanadium species.

1. 在γ/θ-氧化铝支撑上直接键合的二维聚态V3+或V4+物种是脱氢化最活跃的位点。
2. 表面积与金属负载比决定了形成的不同类型的钒物种。在低负载下，单体物种占主导地位，而在高负载下，聚合物物种占优势。
3. 孤立的钒物种活性但易因焦炭形成而失活。
4. 在600°C的氧气气氛下处理V2O5晶体可以恢复其作为聚合态钒物种的活性。
