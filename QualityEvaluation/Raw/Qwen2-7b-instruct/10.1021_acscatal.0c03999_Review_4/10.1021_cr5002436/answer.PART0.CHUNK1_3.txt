[1] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[2] "A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."
[3] "Indeed, it has been reported that the reduction of Ga2O3 can be promoted by the proximity of other, more easily reduced metals, such as Pt and Pd."
[4] "Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

1. The exact nature of the active sites in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still debated among researchers. 
2. Adding CO2 to the reactant feed has been shown to increase the yield of olefins in dehydrogenation reactions.  
3. The reduction of gallium oxide can be facilitated by the presence of nearby metals that are easier to reduce, such as platinum and palladium. 
4. The structure of the support material plays a crucial role in the performance of gallium oxide-based catalysts. Mesoporous gallium aluminum mixed oxides show enhanced resistance to catalyst coking.
