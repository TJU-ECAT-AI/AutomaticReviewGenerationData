[1] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[2] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[3] "An active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants."

The surface area plays a crucial role in stabilizing Cr6+ sites when using silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Conversely, titania is not a suitable support for CrOx due to its weak interaction with the oxide, which leads to easy sintering. However, by doping titania with Cr, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst can be created.

表面面积在用硅酸盐作为铬氧化物基脱氢催化剂的支撑时，对于稳定Cr6+位点至关重要。相反，由于TiO2与氧化物之间弱相互作用，TiO2不是CrOx的良好支持，这会导致容易聚集。然而，通过向TiO2掺杂Cr，可以制备出一种活性且稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
