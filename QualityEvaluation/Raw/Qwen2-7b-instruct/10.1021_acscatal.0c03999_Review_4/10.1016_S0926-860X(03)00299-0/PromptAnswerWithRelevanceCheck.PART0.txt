<p>The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques.

<p>Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species.</p>
<p>The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.</p>

The state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts influence their catalytic performance in the propane aromatisation process. Gallium is incorporated through methods like ionic exchange, impregnation, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution. Upon calcination, Ga2O3 particles form at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reducing-oxidising cycles facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, enhancing its bifunctional catalytic properties. Maintaining gallium in the reduced GaI state improves aromatic yield. Highly dispersed cationic Ga species, acting in synergy with zeolite acidic sites, are crucial for high performance. This reduces the acidity and enhances dehydrogenation efficiency, leading to improved selectivity towards aromatic compounds.

在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，镓的状态和分散性影响其丙烷芳构化过程中的催化性能。镓通过离子交换、浸渍、机械混合和直接等同取代等方法进行整合。在煅烧后，在沸石晶体表面形成Ga2O3颗粒。还原氧化周期使镓物种迁移到沸石通道中，增强其双功能（脱氢和酸性）催化性质。保持镓在还原的GaI状态可以提高芳烃产率。高度分散的阳离子镓物种与沸石酸性位点协同作用，对于实现高性能至关重要。这降低了酸度并提高了脱氢效率，从而提高了向芳烃的选择性。

The document describes the incorporation of gallium into zeolites through various methods, including ionic exchange, impregnation, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution. The most common technique involves impregnation from aqueous solutions followed by calcination and activation treatments. After synthesis, gallium species exist as small GaO(OH) particles on the outer surface of zeolite crystals, along with isolated Ga2O3 needles. Upon calcination, these particles transform into smaller Ga2O3 particles at the zeolite's surface. Reducing-oxidizing cycles facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, likely as ion-exchanged Ga species, enhancing the catalyst's bifunctional properties for propane aromatization. Maintaining gallium in the GaI oxidation state is suggested to improve aromatic yield.

文档描述了将镓引入沸石通过多种方法，包括离子交换、浸渍、机械混合和直接同晶取代。最常见的技术是从水溶液中浸渍后进行煅烧和活化处理。在合成后，镓物种存在于沸石晶体表面的小GaO(OH)颗粒上，以及孤立的Ga2O3针状物。在煅烧后，这些颗粒转化为表面的小Ga2O3颗粒。减少氧化循环可以促进镓物种进入沸石通道，可能以离子交换的镓物种形式，增强催化剂的双功能性质用于丙烷芳构化。建议保持镓在GaI氧化态可以提高芳香产量。

1. The gallium species initially present as small GaO(OH) particles and needles transform into small Ga2O3 particles upon calcination at 823 K. These Ga2O3 particles remain at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reduction-oxidising cycles facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, possibly as ion-exchanged Ga species. Maintaining gallium in the GaI oxidation state enhances the aromatic yield in the propane aromatisation process.

2. After treatment by hydrogen, the catalysts exhibit higher activity and selectivity towards aromatic compounds, alongside a higher selectivity for methane, ethylene, and C5+ compounds. The selectivity for ethane and C4 alkanes decreases.

1. 在823 K的煅烧后，原来的镓物种从小的GaO(OH)颗粒和针状体转化为直径为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，这些Ga2O3颗粒仍然位于沸石晶体的外表面。在还原氧化周期的作用下，这些镓物种迁移到了沸石内部，可能以离子交换的镓物种形式。保持镓在GaI氧化态可以增强芳香产物的产率。

2. 经过氢处理后，催化剂对芳烃化合物的活性和选择性更高，同时对甲烷、乙烯和C5+化合物的选择性也更高。对于乙烷和C4烷烃的选择性则降低。
