[1] "Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely."
[2] "Reductionoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species."
[3] "The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield."
[4] "It was concluded that the main contribution of Ga to the performance of a Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalyst used for propane aromatisation was to this initial step."
[5] "In all cases, the catalysts show a higher activity and selectivity to aromatic compounds after treat- ment by hydrogen, together with a higher selectiv- ity to methane, ethylene, and C5+ compounds and a lower selectivity to ethane and C4 alkanes."

1. The gallium species initially present as small GaO(OH) particles and needles transform into small Ga2O3 particles upon calcination at 823 K. These Ga2O3 particles remain at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reduction-oxidising cycles facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, possibly as ion-exchanged Ga species. Maintaining gallium in the GaI oxidation state enhances the aromatic yield in the propane aromatisation process.

2. After treatment by hydrogen, the catalysts exhibit higher activity and selectivity towards aromatic compounds, alongside a higher selectivity for methane, ethylene, and C5+ compounds. The selectivity for ethane and C4 alkanes decreases.

1. 在823 K的煅烧后，原来的镓物种从小的GaO(OH)颗粒和针状体转化为直径为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，这些Ga2O3颗粒仍然位于沸石晶体的外表面。在还原氧化周期的作用下，这些镓物种迁移到了沸石内部，可能以离子交换的镓物种形式。保持镓在GaI氧化态可以增强芳香产物的产率。

2. 经过氢处理后，催化剂对芳烃化合物的活性和选择性更高，同时对甲烷、乙烯和C5+化合物的选择性也更高。对于乙烷和C4烷烃的选择性则降低。
