<p>The present contribution aims at providing additional information on the effect of such treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance for the aromatisation of propane.</p>
<p>Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites [7] by different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation using gallium salts in aqueous or organic media [5,8], mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment [6], and by direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis [9,10].</p>
<p>The method that is most applied is impregnation from aqueous solutions followed by calcination and activation treatments.</p>
<p>Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species.</p>
<p>The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.</p>
<p>Reductionoxidation cycles at 823 K promote the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species.</p>
<p>From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.</p>

The state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts influence their catalytic performance in the propane aromatisation process. Gallium is incorporated through methods like ionic exchange, impregnation, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution. Upon calcination, Ga2O3 particles form at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reducing-oxidising cycles facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, enhancing its bifunctional catalytic properties. Maintaining gallium in the reduced GaI state improves aromatic yield. Highly dispersed cationic Ga species, acting in synergy with zeolite acidic sites, are crucial for high performance. This reduces the acidity and enhances dehydrogenation efficiency, leading to improved selectivity towards aromatic compounds.

在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，镓的状态和分散性影响其丙烷芳构化过程中的催化性能。镓通过离子交换、浸渍、机械混合和直接等同取代等方法进行整合。在煅烧后，在沸石晶体表面形成Ga2O3颗粒。还原氧化周期使镓物种迁移到沸石通道中，增强其双功能（脱氢和酸性）催化性质。保持镓在还原的GaI状态可以提高芳烃产率。高度分散的阳离子镓物种与沸石酸性位点协同作用，对于实现高性能至关重要。这降低了酸度并提高了脱氢效率，从而提高了向芳烃的选择性。
