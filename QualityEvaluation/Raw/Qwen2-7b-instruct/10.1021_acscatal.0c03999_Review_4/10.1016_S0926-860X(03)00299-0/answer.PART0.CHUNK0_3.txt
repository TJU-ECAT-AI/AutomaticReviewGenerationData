1. "Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites [7] by different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation using gallium salts in aqueous or organic media [5,8], mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment [6], and by direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis [9,10]."
   
2. "The method that is most applied is impregnation from aqueous solutions followed by calcination and activation treatments."
   
3. "The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques."
   
4. "Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3."
   
5. "Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely."
   
6. "Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species."
   
7. "The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield."

The document describes the incorporation of gallium into zeolites through various methods, including ionic exchange, impregnation, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution. The most common technique involves impregnation from aqueous solutions followed by calcination and activation treatments. After synthesis, gallium species exist as small GaO(OH) particles on the outer surface of zeolite crystals, along with isolated Ga2O3 needles. Upon calcination, these particles transform into smaller Ga2O3 particles at the zeolite's surface. Reducing-oxidizing cycles facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels, likely as ion-exchanged Ga species, enhancing the catalyst's bifunctional properties for propane aromatization. Maintaining gallium in the GaI oxidation state is suggested to improve aromatic yield.

文档描述了将镓引入沸石通过多种方法，包括离子交换、浸渍、机械混合和直接同晶取代。最常见的技术是从水溶液中浸渍后进行煅烧和活化处理。在合成后，镓物种存在于沸石晶体表面的小GaO(OH)颗粒上，以及孤立的Ga2O3针状物。在煅烧后，这些颗粒转化为表面的小Ga2O3颗粒。减少氧化循环可以促进镓物种进入沸石通道，可能以离子交换的镓物种形式，增强催化剂的双功能性质用于丙烷芳构化。建议保持镓在GaI氧化态可以提高芳香产量。
