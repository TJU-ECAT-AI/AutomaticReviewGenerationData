<p>The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3.</p>
<p>Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species.</p>
<p>The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.</p>

在通过离子交换制备的Ga/H-ZSM-5沸石中，镓物种的状态包括小的GaO(OH)颗粒和大的Ga2O3针状物。在823 K的煅烧后，GaO(OH)颗粒转变为表面的小Ga2O3颗粒，而针状物几乎完全消失。在823 K的还原-氧化周期下，镓物种可以迁移到沸石内部，增强其丙烷芳构化过程中的双功能催化性能。维持镓在GaI氧化态可能可以提高芳烃产率。
