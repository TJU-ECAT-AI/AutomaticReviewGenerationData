3.1. Nature of oxygen species formed upon adsorption of O2 or N2O on reduced VOx/MCM-41
The EPR spectrum of as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 is characterized by a hyperfine structure (hfs) signal, which is typical for axially distorted isolated V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal coordination (spectrum 1 in Fig. 1B). However, a broad underlying singlet is also seen in this spectrum. This signal arises from magnetically interacting V4+ sites, suggesting that these species are connected with each other via an oxygen bridge, i.e. the VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst does not possess exclusively isolated vanadium sites.

3.2. Reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species against propane, propene, and carbon monoxide
When C3H8 was used as reactant, the Vn+  O shfs signal is already gone at 293 K, leaving behind only the hyperfine structure (hfs) signal arising from the coupling of the unpaired electron at the V4+ with the nuclear spin of 51V (black line in Fig. 6).

4. Discussion
For precise assignment of the shfs signal after oxygen adsorption in Fig. 1, the X-band spectrum has been reproduced by calculation using Eq. (1) (Table 1, Fig. 2). Excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated sum spectrum could be obtained by superimposing two axial subsignals (Fig. 2) with the spin Hamiltonian parameters listed in Table 1.

1. The nature of oxygen species formed upon adsorption of O2 or N2O on reduced VOx/MCM-41 includes an axially distorted isolated V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal coordination, along with magnetically interacting V4+ sites connected via an oxygen bridge.
2. Adsorbed oxygen species react with propane, propene, and carbon monoxide. Specifically, propane consumption leads to disappearance of the Vn+ O shfs signal, leaving behind only the hfs signal from the V4+ site.

1. 减少的VOx/MCM-41催化剂上吸附的氧物种包括轴向失配的孤立的V4+物种，在八面体或四面体协调中，以及磁性相互作用的V4+物种通过氧桥连接。
2. 吸附的氧物种与丙烷、丙烯和一氧化碳反应。具体而言，丙烷消耗导致Vn+ O shfs信号消失，仅留下V4+位点的hfs信号。
