[1] "An electrophilic Vn+ O (n = 4, 5) radical anion intermediate is formed from O2 probably via dissociation of a bi-atomic adsorbed oxygen species."
[2] "This radical is remarkably stable in inert atmosphere up to elevated temperatures but reacts partly with C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO already at room temperature."
[3] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."
[4] "This might be due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active."
[5] "The different electronic nature of these oxygen intermediates is discussed as a reason for the higher propene selectivity obtained in propane oxidative dehydrogenation over VOx/MCM-41 with N2O."

Answer: The nature of the oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx/MCM-41 catalyst by gas-phase O2 and N2O is different. Upon reoxidation with O2, a Vn+ O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species is detected, which is remarkably stable in inert atmosphere but reacts with propane, propene, and CO at room temperature. In contrast, no such species is observed upon reoxidation with N2O. This difference in nature might be attributed to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active in the case of N2O. The higher propene selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation over VOx/MCM-41 with N2O is explained by the different electronic nature of these oxygen intermediates.

氧物种的性质在氧化还原过程中不同。使用氧气进行氧化还原时，检测到一种Vn+ O（n = 4, 5）的自由基离子中间体，这种物种在惰性气氛中非常稳定，但在室温下会与丙烷、丙烯和CO反应。相比之下，在使用N2O进行氧化还原时，没有观察到这样的物种。这种差异的性质可能归因于快速形成的核质子性的O2氧化离子，这些离子在N2O的情况下不具有EPR活性。在N2O下进行丙烷氧化脱氢化时更高的丙烯选择性，可以解释为这些氧气中间体的电子性质不同。
