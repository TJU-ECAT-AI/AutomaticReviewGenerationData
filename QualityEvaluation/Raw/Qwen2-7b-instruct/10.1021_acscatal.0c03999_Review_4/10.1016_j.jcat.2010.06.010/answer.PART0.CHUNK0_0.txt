[1] "In order to prove if reduced VOx species on MCM-41 can be oxidized, gas-phase O2 (5 mbar) has been added to the reduced catalyst at 77 K. A multiline spectrum occurred in the middle field range (spectrum 3 in Fig. 1)."
[2] "The oxygen radical does not decay after 1 h storage in O2 at 293 K (spectrum 5 in Fig. 1A)."
[3] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."
[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[5] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."

1. Upon adding gas-phase O2 (5 mbar) to the reduced catalyst at 77 K, a multiline spectrum occurred in the middle field range, indicating the formation of an oxygen radical.
2. The oxygen radical remained stable after 1 hour of storage at 293 K in O2.
3. No such oxygen radical species could be observed when reduced VOx species were reoxidized with N2O.
4. The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be attributed to the formation of specific oxygen species, including OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O.
5. It is probable that N2O deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced VOx/MCM by releasing N2.

1. 在向77 K下的还原催化剂添加气体态O2（5 mbar）后，中间磁场范围内出现了多线光谱，表明形成了氧自由基。
2. 在293 K的O2中存储1小时后，氧自由基保持稳定。
3. 当使用N2O重新氧化还原的VOx物种时，没有观察到这样的氧自由基物种。
4. O2中的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可能归因于形成特定的氧物种，包括OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O2 2 和Vn+  O。
5. 可能是N2O通过释放N2在其表面部分还原的VOx/MCM上沉积其氧。
