[1] "In order to prove if reduced VOx species on MCM-41 can be oxidized, gas-phase O2 (5 mbar) has been added to the reduced catalyst at 77 K. A multiline spectrum occurred in the middle field range (spectrum 3 in Fig. 1)."
[2] "The oxygen radical does not decay after 1 h storage in O2 at 293 K (spectrum 5 in Fig. 1A)."
[3] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."
[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[5] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."

3.1. Nature of oxygen species formed upon adsorption of O2 or N2O on reduced VOx/MCM-41
The EPR spectrum of as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 is characterized by a hyperfine structure (hfs) signal, which is typical for axially distorted isolated V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal coordination (spectrum 1 in Fig. 1B). However, a broad underlying singlet is also seen in this spectrum. This signal arises from magnetically interacting V4+ sites, suggesting that these species are connected with each other via an oxygen bridge, i.e. the VOx/ MCM-41 catalyst does not possess exclusively isolated vanadium sites.

3.2. Reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species against propane, propene, and carbon monoxide
When C3H8 was used as reactant, the Vn+  O shfs signal is already gone at 293 K, leaving behind only the hyperfine structure (hfs) signal arising from the coupling of the unpaired electron at the V4+ with the nuclear spin of 51V (black line in Fig. 6).

4. Discussion
For precise assignment of the shfs signal after oxygen adsorption in Fig. 1, the X-band spectrum has been reproduced by calculation using Eq. (1) (Table 1, Fig. 2). Excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated sum spectrum could be obtained by superimposing two axial subsignals (Fig. 2) with the spin Hamiltonian parameters listed in Table 1.

1. The nature of oxygen species formed upon adsorption of O2 or N2O on reduced VOx/MCM-41 includes an axially distorted isolated V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal coordination, along with magnetically interacting V4+ sites connected via an oxygen bridge.
2. Adsorbed oxygen species react with propane, propene, and carbon monoxide. Specifically, propane consumption leads to disappearance of the Vn+ O shfs signal, leaving behind only the hfs signal from the V4+ site.

[1] "An electrophilic Vn+ O (n = 4, 5) radical anion intermediate is formed from O2 probably via dissociation of a bi-atomic adsorbed oxygen species."
[2] "This radical is remarkably stable in inert atmosphere up to elevated temperatures but reacts partly with C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO already at room temperature."
[3] "In contrast, no such species could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O."
[4] "This might be due to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active."
[5] "The different electronic nature of these oxygen intermediates is discussed as a reason for the higher propene selectivity obtained in propane oxidative dehydrogenation over VOx/MCM-41 with N2O."
</quotes>

Answer: The nature of the oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx/MCM-41 catalyst by gas-phase O2 and N2O is different. Upon reoxidation with O2, a Vn+ O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species is detected, which is remarkably stable in inert atmosphere but reacts with propane, propene, and CO at room temperature. In contrast, no such species is observed upon reoxidation with N2O. This difference in nature might be attributed to the rapid formation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active in the case of N2O. The higher propene selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation over VOx/MCM-41 with N2O is explained by the different electronic nature of these oxygen intermediates.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氧物种的性质在氧化还原过程中不同。使用氧气进行氧化还原时，检测到一种Vn+ O（n = 4, 5）的自由基离子中间体，这种物种在惰性气氛中非常稳定，但在室温下会与丙烷、丙烯和CO反应。相比之下，在使用N2O进行氧化还原时，没有观察到这样的物种。这种差异的性质可能归因于快速形成的核质子性的O2氧化离子，这些离子在N2O的情况下不具有EPR活性。在N2O下进行丙烷氧化脱氢化时更高的丙烯选择性，可以解释为这些氧气中间体的电子性质不同。

[1] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[2] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."
[3] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The formation of OxV5+ O2, OxV5 O2 2, and Vn+ O might contribute to the higher activity but lower propene selectivity observed when propane is subjected to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant. 

2. It is plausible that when nitrogen dioxide (N2O) reacts with the reduced vanadium oxide species, it readily deposits oxygen on the surface by releasing nitrogen gas, which may happen similarly on reduced VOx/MCM catalysts.

3. The enhanced activity and reduced selectivity in propane ODH with O2, compared to N2O, can be attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species. These species preferentially burn propene, whereas the nucleophilic, less reactive but more selective oxygen species from N2O participate in the ODH process.

1. 形成OxV5+ O2、OxV5 O2 2 和 Vn+ O 可能会是导致使用分子氧（O2）作为氧化剂时，丙烷氧化脱氢反应中活性较高但丙烯选择性较低的原因。

2. 可以推测，当氮氧化物（N2O）与还原的钒氧化物物种反应时，它通过释放氮气迅速在表面沉积氧，这种情况也可能发生在还原VOx/MCM催化剂上。

3. 在使用O2进行丙烷氧化脱氢过程中观察到的增强活性和降低选择性，以及与使用N2O相比，可以归因于高度反应性的电磷基氧物种的存在。这些物种倾向于优先燃烧丙烯，而从N2O参与氧化脱氢过程的核基、较不反应但选择性更高的氧物种则具有较低的选择性。

1. The formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O might contribute to higher activity but lower propene selectivity when using O2 in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. Upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O, no EPR-active oxygen radical species are detected, suggesting that a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed instead.
3. The absence of detectable oxygen by EPR indicates a rapid electron transfer leading to the formation of a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion in the catalyst structure.
