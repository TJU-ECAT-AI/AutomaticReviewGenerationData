[1] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[2] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."
[3] "From the fact that no O is evidenced by EPR, we conclude that transfer of a second electron might be very fast and a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed and incorporated in the catalyst structure."

1. The formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O might contribute to higher activity but lower propene selectivity when using O2 in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. Upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O, no EPR-active oxygen radical species are detected, suggesting that a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion is formed instead.
3. The absence of detectable oxygen by EPR indicates a rapid electron transfer leading to the formation of a diamagnetic O2 oxide ion in the catalyst structure.

1. 氧化五价钒与氧形成的复合物（OxV5+  O2 和OxV5    O2 2）以及n价钒与氧形成的复合物可能是导致使用氧气时丙烷氧化脱氢反应具有较高活性但丙烯选择性较低的原因。
2. 当使用N2O重新氧化还原的VOx物种时，未检测到可由EPR检测到的氧活性自由基物种，这表明可能形成了一个顺磁性氧2氧化物离子。
3. EPR无法检测到氧的存在表明发生了快速的电子转移，导致在催化剂结构中形成了一个顺磁性氧2氧化物离子。
