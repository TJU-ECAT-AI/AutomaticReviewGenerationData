[1] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[2] "Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxygen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well."
[3] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

1. The formation of OxV5+ O2, OxV5 O2 2, and Vn+ O might contribute to the higher activity but lower propene selectivity observed when propane is subjected to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant. 

2. It is plausible that when nitrogen dioxide (N2O) reacts with the reduced vanadium oxide species, it readily deposits oxygen on the surface by releasing nitrogen gas, which may happen similarly on reduced VOx/MCM catalysts.

3. The enhanced activity and reduced selectivity in propane ODH with O2, compared to N2O, can be attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species. These species preferentially burn propene, whereas the nucleophilic, less reactive but more selective oxygen species from N2O participate in the ODH process.

1. 形成OxV5+ O2、OxV5 O2 2 和 Vn+ O 可能会是导致使用分子氧（O2）作为氧化剂时，丙烷氧化脱氢反应中活性较高但丙烯选择性较低的原因。

2. 可以推测，当氮氧化物（N2O）与还原的钒氧化物物种反应时，它通过释放氮气迅速在表面沉积氧，这种情况也可能发生在还原VOx/MCM催化剂上。

3. 在使用O2进行丙烷氧化脱氢过程中观察到的增强活性和降低选择性，以及与使用N2O相比，可以归因于高度反应性的电磷基氧物种的存在。这些物种倾向于优先燃烧丙烯，而从N2O参与氧化脱氢过程的核基、较不反应但选择性更高的氧物种则具有较低的选择性。
