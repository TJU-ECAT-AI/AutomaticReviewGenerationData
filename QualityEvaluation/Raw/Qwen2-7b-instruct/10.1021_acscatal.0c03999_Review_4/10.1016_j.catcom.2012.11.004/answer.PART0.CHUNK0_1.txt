The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of surface area, crystallinity, and Lewis acid sites. Higher surface area, decreased crystallinity, and an increased density of surface defects tend to correlate with higher catalytic activity. Specifically, β-Ga2O3 polymorphs with higher surface areas and decreased crystallinity show enhanced catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of Ga2O3 polymorphs play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, as they facilitate the activation of hydrocarbons in a CO2 atmosphere. The textural properties of β-Ga2O3 materials contribute significantly to the catalytic performance, enabling a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. The surface acidity of the catalysts, which is closely related to the Lewis acid sites, correlates well with the catalytic performance, indicating that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity.

In terms of stability, conventional β-Ga2O3 catalysts lose a substantial portion of their initial activity after prolonged use. In contrast, sucrose-templated β-Ga2O3 samples exhibit lower conversion loss, albeit with severe deactivation. The deactivation can be largely attributed to the blocking of active Lewis acid sites by carbon deposition, rather than significant degradation of the textural or structural properties of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4 material. The regeneration process, involving interruption under an N2 stream followed by air introduction at a higher temperature to burn off carbon species, leads to a slight decrease in initial activity after the first regeneration, but marginal variations are observed after subsequent regenerations.

不同Ga2O3多晶形态（α、β、γ和δ）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸碱性）和Lewis酸位点显著影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α、β、γ和δ-Ga2O3多晶形态表现出不同的表面积、结晶性和Lewis酸位点。较高的表面积、较低的结晶性和表面缺陷密度与更高的催化活性相关。具体而言，具有更高表面积和较低结晶性的β-Ga2O3多晶形态在CO2存在下对丙烷脱氢反应显示出增强的催化性能。β-Ga2O3多晶形态的表面酸性与催化性能之间有很好的相关性，这表明表面Lewis酸Ga位点的丰富是实现高催化活性的关键因素。

关于稳定性，传统β-Ga2O3催化剂在长时间使用后会损失大量初始活性。相比之下，以蔗糖为模板制备的β-Ga2O3样品的转化损失相对较小，但仍然存在严重的失活现象。失活主要归因于活性Lewis酸位点被碳沉积阻塞，而不是材料的纹理或结构性质的显著退化。再生过程涉及在N2流中中断反应，然后在较高温度下引入空气以烧掉催化剂上的碳物种，导致第一次再生后的初始活性略有下降，但在随后的再生后观察到微小的变化。
