[1] "A series of mesoporous β-Ga2O3 with high surface area have been prepared using eco-friendly sucrose as a non-surfactant template and studied in relation to their performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2."
[2] "Among the four sucrose-derived samples tested, the material prepared from a sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio of 4 achieved the highest propane conversion, which was approximately the double efficiency of the conventional β-Ga2O3."
[3] "The enhanced activity of the sucrose-derived materials is attributed to a high abundance of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites as a consequence of their favorable textural properties and enhanced surface areas."
[4] "The fact that the resultant materials are pure white in color suggests a complete template removal during the calcination step, as confirmed from the thermogravimetry analysis."
[5] "Note that the sample prepared with higher sucrose/Ga2O3 ratio possesses higher porosity."
[6] "It is observed that conventional β-Ga2O3 presents a solid bulk structure, while the sucrose-templated samples display distinct sponge-like morphology, a feature probably as a result of the carbon template removal during combustion processing."
[7] "There is a significant difference in the total amounts of the surface acidity between the two types of β-Ga2O3 samples."
[8] "In line with the broad literature documenting the PDH reaction over Ga-based materials, it appears that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts."
[9] "However, deactivation is still severe for the sucrose-templated samples, and regeneration therefore seems indispensable from the perspective of application."
[10] "After the first regeneration, the initial propane conversion for β-Ga2O3-S4 amounted to 39% at 773 K, which is slightly lower than that for the fresh sample (43.7%)."

1. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the presence of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites, which are a consequence of favorable textural properties and enhanced surface areas, leads to enhanced activity. The sucrose-derived samples showed higher propane conversion rates due to their increased surface Lewis acid sites, contributing to the catalytic efficiency.

2. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of the β-Ga2O3 catalysts play a crucial role in achieving high catalytic activity. These sites facilitate the activation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired products. The sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 catalysts demonstrated higher activity because of the increased abundance of these Lewis acid sites on their surfaces.

3. The deactivation of the sucrose-templated samples occurred due to carbon deposition blocking the active Lewis acid sites, rather than significant degradation of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4 material's textural or structural properties. Regeneration was necessary to restore the initial activity, although the efficiency declined slightly after the first regeneration and remained stable thereafter.

1. 不同Ga2O3多晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。具体而言，表面配位不饱和Ga位点的存在，这是由于有利的结构特性和增强的表面积的结果，导致了增强的活性。通过增加表面Lewis酸位点的数量，证明了使用蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3催化剂具有更高的丙烷转化率。

2. β-Ga2O3催化剂表面的Lewis酸位点在实现高催化活性中起着关键作用。这些位点有助于在CO2存在下激活烃类，将平衡移向所需产物。通过增加表面Lewis酸位点的数量，蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3催化剂显示出更高的活性。

3. 该研究发现，蔗糖模板样品的失活是由于碳沉积阻塞了活性Lewis酸位点，而不是mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4材料的纹理或结构特性的显著降解。需要再生来恢复初始活性，尽管在第一次再生后效率略有下降，但在接下来的再生中保持稳定。
