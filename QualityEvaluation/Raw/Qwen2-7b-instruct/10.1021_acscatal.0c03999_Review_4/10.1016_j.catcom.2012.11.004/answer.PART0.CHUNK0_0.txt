[5] "Among the four sucrose-derived samples tested, the material prepared from a sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio of 4 achieved the highest propane conversion, which was approximately the double efficiency of the conventional β-Ga2O3."
[6] "The enhanced activity of the sucrose-derived materials is attributed to a high abundance of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites as a consequence of their favorable textural properties and enhanced surface areas."
[7] "There is a significant difference in the total amounts of the surface acidity between the two types of β-Ga2O3 samples."

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions through several mechanisms. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 exhibit varying degrees of catalytic efficiency due to differences in their structural characteristics. The presence of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites, which are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere, is more abundant in the sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 materials. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The surface acidity of the β-Ga2O3 samples is significantly influenced by the presence of these Lewis acid sites. The sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 materials show higher surface acidity, which correlates with their enhanced catalytic activity. This is evidenced by their ability to achieve higher propane conversion rates, particularly when compared to conventional β-Ga2O3. The textural properties of the sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 materials also contribute to their improved catalytic performance, as they provide a larger surface area for the activation of reactants. The stability of the catalytic system is maintained through the regeneration process, where carbon deposition on the catalyst is burned off under air conditions, preserving the catalytic activity of the β-Ga2O3 materials for multiple cycles.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α、β、γ、δ）的结构特性、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点，通过几种机制影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α、β、γ、δ-Ga2O3由于其结构特性的差异，表现出不同的催化效率。在蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3材料中，存在更多的可配位未饱和表面Ga位点，这些位点对于CO2气氛下的烃类活化至关重要。这些位点促进了丙烷向丙烯的脱氢反应。β-Ga2O3样品的表面酸性受到这些Lewis酸位点的存在影响。蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3材料显示出更高的表面酸性，这与它们增强的催化活性相关。这体现在它们能够实现更高的丙烷转化率，特别是在与常规β-Ga2O3相比时。β-Ga2O3材料的纹理性质也对其改进的催化性能做出了贡献，因为它们提供了更大的表面积，用于激活反应物。通过再生过程保持催化剂系统的稳定性，其中在空气条件下燃烧掉催化剂上的碳沉积，从而保存了β-Ga2O3材料的催化活性，以实现多个周期。
