The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions in several ways. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit different catalytic activities due to variations in their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph is particularly noted for its excellent catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. However, challenges persist in developing improved catalytic systems that exhibit desirable stability and activity.

The use of sucrose as a non-surfactant template allows for the preparation of mesoporous β-Ga2O3 materials with favorable textural and structural properties. These materials show improved performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The enhanced activity of the sucrose-derived materials is attributed to a high abundance of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites, which are a result of their favorable textural properties and enhanced surface areas. The sucrose-derived materials are also noted for their ability to completely remove the template during the calcination step, as confirmed through thermogravimetry analysis. 

The catalytic performance shows an excellent correlation with the surface acidity data. The selectivities of propylene remain above 86% for the five catalysts, with slightly higher values achieved over the templated samples. The sucrose-derived samples exhibit higher propane conversion rates compared to conventional β-Ga2O3, with the highest specific surface area sample achieving a conversion rate approximately twice that of conventional β-Ga2O3. The results compare favorably with the exceptionally high activity obtained with Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions. The stability of the sucrose-templated samples is also noted, with conversion loss corresponding to 43-56% of their initial values after 8 hours of reaction. Deactivation is attributed to the blocking of active Lewis acid sites by carbon deposition, rather than significant degradation of the textural or structural properties of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4 material. Regeneration of β-Ga2O3-S4 after 8 hours of reaction is possible through interruption under an N2 stream followed by air introduction at 923 K to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. After the first regeneration, the initial propane conversion for β-Ga2O3-S4 amounts to 39%, which is slightly lower than that for the fresh sample (43.7%). However, after the second and third regenerations, only marginal variations in initial activity are observed.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α、β、γ和δ）的结构特性、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸位点对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生影响。这些晶型表现出不同的催化效率，这主要取决于它们的结构特性、表面性质和Lewis酸位点的不同。β-Ga2O3晶型因其与传统Cr或V基系统相比具有出色催化效率而特别受到认可。然而，继续开发具有理想稳定性和活性的新型催化系统仍然是一个重大挑战。

使用蔗糖作为非表面活性剂模板，可以制备具有优良纹理和结构特性的介孔β-Ga2O3材料。这些材料在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程中表现出改善的性能。蔗糖衍生材料的增强活性归因于高浓度的配位不饱和表面Ga位点的存在，这是由于其有利的纹理特性和增强的表面积造成的。这些蔗糖衍生材料还被注意到，在煅烧过程中完全去除模板，这一点通过热重分析得到证实。

催化性能与表面酸度数据之间存在良好相关性。丙烯的选择性保持在86%以上，五个催化剂中稍高的值是在模板样品上获得的。与传统β-Ga2O3相比，蔗糖衍生材料显示出更高的丙烷转化率，最高特定表面积样品的转化率约为传统β-Ga2O3的两倍。与基于Ga2O3-Al2O3的固体解决方案相比，这些结果具有可比性。蔗糖模板化样品的稳定性也得到了注意，反应8小时后的转化损失对应于初始值的43%-56%。失活归因于活性Lewis酸位点由碳沉积阻塞，而不是mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4材料的纹理或结构性质的显著降解。β-Ga2O3-S4反应8小时后通过中断在N2流下进行再生，并在923 K时引入空气以燃烧催化剂上的碳物种来再生。第一次再生后，β-Ga2O3-S4的初始丙烷转化率为39%，略低于新鲜样本（43.7%）。然而，在第二次和第三次再生后，初始活性仅观察到微小变化。
