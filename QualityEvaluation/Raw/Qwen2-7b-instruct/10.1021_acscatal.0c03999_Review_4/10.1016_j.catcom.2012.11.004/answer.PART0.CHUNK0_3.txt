[1] "In this valuable transformation, cheap and abundant CO2 serves two distinct functions: as a mild oxidant to shift the equilibrium towards the products and the suppression of coke deposition."
[2] "There were how- ever, only very few studies on the synthesis of Ga2O3 with enhanced sur- face area."
[3] "The fact that the resultant materials are pure white in color suggests a complete tem- plate removal during the calcination step, as confirmed from the thermogravimetry analysis (Fig S3)."
[4] "The major product formed in the reaction is propylene, with the minor products being eth- ane, ethylene and methane."
[5] "It is in- teresting to note that the sucrose-derived samples gave consistently higher propane conversion during the reaction, showing that the textur- al properties of the β-Ga2O3 materials play a significant role in the titled reaction."
[6] "It is also found that the catalytic performance show an excellent correlation with the surface acidity data (Fig. S2)."
[7] "However, deactivation is still severe for the sucrose-templated samples, and regeneration therefore seems indispensable from the perspective of application."
[8] "The present work demonstrates the high potential of using environ- mentally friendly sucrose as a non-surfactant template to prepare mesoporous β-Ga2O3 materials with favorable textural and structural properties for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

1. CO2 serves dual purposes in the CO2-ODHP reaction: acting as a mild oxidant to shift the equilibrium towards the desired products and preventing coke deposition.
2. Only a few studies have focused on synthesizing Ga2O3 with increased surface area.
3. The white color of the final materials indicates complete removal of the template during calcination, as confirmed by thermogravimetry analysis.
4. The main product generated in the reaction is propylene, with minor products including ethane, ethylene, and methane.
5. The sucrose-derived samples consistently showed higher propane conversion during the reaction, highlighting the importance of the textural properties of the β-Ga2O3 materials in the process.
6. The catalytic performance correlates well with surface acidity data.
7. Although deactivation is severe for the sucrose-templated samples, regeneration appears necessary for practical applications.
8. The study showcases the potential of using environmentally friendly sucrose as a non-surfactant template for preparing mesoporous β-Ga2O3 materials with advantageous textural and structural properties for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
