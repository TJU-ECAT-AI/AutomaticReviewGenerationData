The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions through several mechanisms. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 exhibit varying degrees of catalytic efficiency due to differences in their structural characteristics. The presence of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites, which are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere, is more abundant in the sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 materials. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The surface acidity of the β-Ga2O3 samples is significantly influenced by the presence of these Lewis acid sites. The sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 materials show higher surface acidity, which correlates with their enhanced catalytic activity. This is evidenced by their ability to achieve higher propane conversion rates, particularly when compared to conventional β-Ga2O3. The textural properties of the sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 materials also contribute to their improved catalytic performance, as they provide a larger surface area for the activation of reactants. The stability of the catalytic system is maintained through the regeneration process, where carbon deposition on the catalyst is burned off under air conditions, preserving the catalytic activity of the β-Ga2O3 materials for multiple cycles.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α、β、γ、δ）的结构特性、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点，通过几种机制影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α、β、γ、δ-Ga2O3由于其结构特性的差异，表现出不同的催化效率。在蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3材料中，存在更多的可配位未饱和表面Ga位点，这些位点对于CO2气氛下的烃类活化至关重要。这些位点促进了丙烷向丙烯的脱氢反应。β-Ga2O3样品的表面酸性受到这些Lewis酸位点的存在影响。蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3材料显示出更高的表面酸性，这与它们增强的催化活性相关。这体现在它们能够实现更高的丙烷转化率，特别是在与常规β-Ga2O3相比时。β-Ga2O3材料的纹理性质也对其改进的催化性能做出了贡献，因为它们提供了更大的表面积，用于激活反应物。通过再生过程保持催化剂系统的稳定性，其中在空气条件下燃烧掉催化剂上的碳沉积，从而保存了β-Ga2O3材料的催化活性，以实现多个周期。

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of surface area, crystallinity, and Lewis acid sites. Higher surface area, decreased crystallinity, and an increased density of surface defects tend to correlate with higher catalytic activity. Specifically, β-Ga2O3 polymorphs with higher surface areas and decreased crystallinity show enhanced catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of Ga2O3 polymorphs play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, as they facilitate the activation of hydrocarbons in a CO2 atmosphere. The textural properties of β-Ga2O3 materials contribute significantly to the catalytic performance, enabling a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. The surface acidity of the catalysts, which is closely related to the Lewis acid sites, correlates well with the catalytic performance, indicating that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity.

In terms of stability, conventional β-Ga2O3 catalysts lose a substantial portion of their initial activity after prolonged use. In contrast, sucrose-templated β-Ga2O3 samples exhibit lower conversion loss, albeit with severe deactivation. The deactivation can be largely attributed to the blocking of active Lewis acid sites by carbon deposition, rather than significant degradation of the textural or structural properties of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4 material. The regeneration process, involving interruption under an N2 stream followed by air introduction at a higher temperature to burn off carbon species, leads to a slight decrease in initial activity after the first regeneration, but marginal variations are observed after subsequent regenerations.

不同Ga2O3多晶形态（α、β、γ和δ）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸碱性）和Lewis酸位点显著影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α、β、γ和δ-Ga2O3多晶形态表现出不同的表面积、结晶性和Lewis酸位点。较高的表面积、较低的结晶性和表面缺陷密度与更高的催化活性相关。具体而言，具有更高表面积和较低结晶性的β-Ga2O3多晶形态在CO2存在下对丙烷脱氢反应显示出增强的催化性能。β-Ga2O3多晶形态的表面酸性与催化性能之间有很好的相关性，这表明表面Lewis酸Ga位点的丰富是实现高催化活性的关键因素。

关于稳定性，传统β-Ga2O3催化剂在长时间使用后会损失大量初始活性。相比之下，以蔗糖为模板制备的β-Ga2O3样品的转化损失相对较小，但仍然存在严重的失活现象。失活主要归因于活性Lewis酸位点被碳沉积阻塞，而不是材料的纹理或结构性质的显著退化。再生过程涉及在N2流中中断反应，然后在较高温度下引入空气以烧掉催化剂上的碳物种，导致第一次再生后的初始活性略有下降，但在随后的再生后观察到微小的变化。

1. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, the presence of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites, which are a consequence of favorable textural properties and enhanced surface areas, leads to enhanced activity. The sucrose-derived samples showed higher propane conversion rates due to their increased surface Lewis acid sites, contributing to the catalytic efficiency.

2. The Lewis acid sites on the surface of the β-Ga2O3 catalysts play a crucial role in achieving high catalytic activity. These sites facilitate the activation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired products. The sucrose-derived β-Ga2O3 catalysts demonstrated higher activity because of the increased abundance of these Lewis acid sites on their surfaces.

3. The deactivation of the sucrose-templated samples occurred due to carbon deposition blocking the active Lewis acid sites, rather than significant degradation of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4 material's textural or structural properties. Regeneration was necessary to restore the initial activity, although the efficiency declined slightly after the first regeneration and remained stable thereafter.

2. β-Ga2O3催化剂表面的Lewis酸位点在实现高催化活性中起着关键作用。这些位点有助于在CO2存在下激活烃类，将平衡移向所需产物。通过增加表面Lewis酸位点的数量，蔗糖衍生的β-Ga2O3催化剂显示出更高的活性。

3. 该研究发现，蔗糖模板样品的失活是由于碳沉积阻塞了活性Lewis酸位点，而不是mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4材料的纹理或结构特性的显著降解。需要再生来恢复初始活性，尽管在第一次再生后效率略有下降，但在接下来的再生中保持稳定。

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions in several ways. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit different catalytic activities due to variations in their structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph is particularly noted for its excellent catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr- or V-based systems. However, challenges persist in developing improved catalytic systems that exhibit desirable stability and activity.

The use of sucrose as a non-surfactant template allows for the preparation of mesoporous β-Ga2O3 materials with favorable textural and structural properties. These materials show improved performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2. The enhanced activity of the sucrose-derived materials is attributed to a high abundance of coordinative unsaturated surface Ga sites, which are a result of their favorable textural properties and enhanced surface areas. The sucrose-derived materials are also noted for their ability to completely remove the template during the calcination step, as confirmed through thermogravimetry analysis. 

The catalytic performance shows an excellent correlation with the surface acidity data. The selectivities of propylene remain above 86% for the five catalysts, with slightly higher values achieved over the templated samples. The sucrose-derived samples exhibit higher propane conversion rates compared to conventional β-Ga2O3, with the highest specific surface area sample achieving a conversion rate approximately twice that of conventional β-Ga2O3. The results compare favorably with the exceptionally high activity obtained with Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions. The stability of the sucrose-templated samples is also noted, with conversion loss corresponding to 43-56% of their initial values after 8 hours of reaction. Deactivation is attributed to the blocking of active Lewis acid sites by carbon deposition, rather than significant degradation of the textural or structural properties of the mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4 material. Regeneration of β-Ga2O3-S4 after 8 hours of reaction is possible through interruption under an N2 stream followed by air introduction at 923 K to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. After the first regeneration, the initial propane conversion for β-Ga2O3-S4 amounts to 39%, which is slightly lower than that for the fresh sample (43.7%). However, after the second and third regenerations, only marginal variations in initial activity are observed.

不同Ga2O3晶型（α、β、γ和δ）的结构特性、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸位点对其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生影响。这些晶型表现出不同的催化效率，这主要取决于它们的结构特性、表面性质和Lewis酸位点的不同。β-Ga2O3晶型因其与传统Cr或V基系统相比具有出色催化效率而特别受到认可。然而，继续开发具有理想稳定性和活性的新型催化系统仍然是一个重大挑战。

使用蔗糖作为非表面活性剂模板，可以制备具有优良纹理和结构特性的介孔β-Ga2O3材料。这些材料在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程中表现出改善的性能。蔗糖衍生材料的增强活性归因于高浓度的配位不饱和表面Ga位点的存在，这是由于其有利的纹理特性和增强的表面积造成的。这些蔗糖衍生材料还被注意到，在煅烧过程中完全去除模板，这一点通过热重分析得到证实。

催化性能与表面酸度数据之间存在良好相关性。丙烯的选择性保持在86%以上，五个催化剂中稍高的值是在模板样品上获得的。与传统β-Ga2O3相比，蔗糖衍生材料显示出更高的丙烷转化率，最高特定表面积样品的转化率约为传统β-Ga2O3的两倍。与基于Ga2O3-Al2O3的固体解决方案相比，这些结果具有可比性。蔗糖模板化样品的稳定性也得到了注意，反应8小时后的转化损失对应于初始值的43%-56%。失活归因于活性Lewis酸位点由碳沉积阻塞，而不是mesoporous β-Ga2O3-S4材料的纹理或结构性质的显著降解。β-Ga2O3-S4反应8小时后通过中断在N2流下进行再生，并在923 K时引入空气以燃烧催化剂上的碳物种来再生。第一次再生后，β-Ga2O3-S4的初始丙烷转化率为39%，略低于新鲜样本（43.7%）。然而，在第二次和第三次再生后，初始活性仅观察到微小变化。
