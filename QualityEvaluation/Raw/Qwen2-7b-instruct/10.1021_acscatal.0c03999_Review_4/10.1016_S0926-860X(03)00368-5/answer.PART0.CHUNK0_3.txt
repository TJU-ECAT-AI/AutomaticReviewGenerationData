1. Carbon dioxide plays a role in improving the dehydrogenation of propane to propene by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift. It consumes hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation process, shifting the equilibrium towards products. However, it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. 

2. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst, explaining why potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

3. XRD analyses of the catalysts show no significant changes in the diffraction patterns before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under carbon dioxide flow. The fresh Ga2O3 catalyst is more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

1. 二氧化碳通过促进水煤气变换反应，可以改善丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程。它消耗脱氢过程中产生的氢气，使平衡向产物方向移动。然而，在反应过程中，它并不能抑制催化剂的快速失活。

2. 向镓氧化物中引入钾会导致催化活性的丧失。反应似乎在催化剂上的酸性位点进行，解释了钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂活性不高的原因。

3. X射线衍射分析显示，在二氧化碳流下进行丙烷脱氢前后，催化剂的衍射图谱没有显著变化。新鲜的镓氧化物催化剂在873 K下反应后比未反应前更加非晶质。
