1. Oxygen concentration has a minor impact on propane conversion and propene yield during the initial stages of the reaction, with the highest selectivity observed in the absence of oxygen. Increasing oxygen concentration up to 9.1% leads to a slight decrease in propane conversion and propene yield.

2. The addition of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts results in a significant loss of catalytic activity. The propane conversion and propene selectivity decrease notably with an increase in the K/Ga atomic ratio.

3. The catalytic activity of potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts is lower compared to unpromoted catalysts. This decrease is partly associated with a reduction in the specific surface area of the catalyst.

4. The specific surface area of the gallium oxide catalysts changes during the dehydrogenation process, with the fresh catalyst being more amorphous than after the reaction at 873 K.

5. Treating the Ga2O3 catalyst with hydrogen causes a slight decrease in the amount of CO, suggesting that carbon dioxide can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface.

6. The amount of CO gradually decreases with increasing pulse numbers, indicating that carbon dioxide can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction.

1. 氧气浓度在反应初期对丙烷转化率和丙烯产率的影响较小，没有氧气时选择性最高。增加氧气浓度至9.1%，导致丙烷转化率和丙烯产率略有下降。

2. 向镓氧化物中添加钾会导致催化剂活性显著降低。随着K/Ga原子比的增加，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著下降。

3. 钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性低于未促进的催化剂。这种下降部分与催化剂特定表面积的减少有关。

4. 镓氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的特定表面积发生变化，新鲜催化剂在873 K反应后更为非晶质。

5. 将镓2O3催化剂用氢处理会导致CO量轻微下降，表明二氧化碳可能与吸附在镓2O3表面的氢反应。

6. 随着脉冲次数的增加，CO量逐渐减少，这表明二氧化碳可以通过布杜瓦尔反应去除碳沉积。
