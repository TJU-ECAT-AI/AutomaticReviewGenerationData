[1] "Bulk Ga2O3 prepared by thermal decomposition of gallium nitrate is an effective catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[2] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction."
[3] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[4] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."
[5] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

1. The structure and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, acidity and basicity, as well as Lewis acid sites, play crucial roles. The observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are attributed to these factors.
2. The promoting role of carbon dioxide was evident only during the initial stages of the reaction. After that, it did not prevent the rapid deactivation of the catalyst.
3. Adding potassium to gallium oxide catalysts results in a loss of catalytic activity.
4. The dehydrogenation process likely occurs on the acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium-promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not show high activity.
5. For all Ga2O3 samples, the primary phase identified through XRD analysis was -Ga2O3, which is the sole stable form of Ga2O3 known.

1. Ga2O3多晶形态的结构和表面性质影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸中心，在初始阶段和稳定状态阶段的反应中起着关键作用。根据这些因素解释了观察到的活性趋势和选择性。
2. 在反应的初期，二氧化碳的促进作用仅被观察到。之后，它未能阻止催化剂的快速失活。
3. 向镓氧化物催化剂中添加钾会导致催化剂活性的丧失。
4. 反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，因为钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂并未表现出高活性。
5. 对所有Ga2O3样品的XRD分析表明，主要相位是- Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的Ga2O3形式。
