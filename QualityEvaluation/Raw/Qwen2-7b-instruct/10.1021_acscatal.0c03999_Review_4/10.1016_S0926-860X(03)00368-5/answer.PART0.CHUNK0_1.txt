<p>Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide has been carried out over unpromoted and potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>It was found that carbon dioxide enhance the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>After 0.2 h of reaction periodic propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33 and 93%, respectively, while in the presence of argon only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity are achieved under the same condition.</p>
<p>The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>
<p>No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow.</p>
<p>For all of the Ga2O3 samples, the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For Ga2O3-K2 catalyst additionally K2CO3 was detected.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structure and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, acidic sites on the catalyst surface facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Potassium promotion leads to a loss of catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites by excess potassium. The introduction of potassium modifies the acidity/basicity properties of Ga2O3, affecting the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. However, carbon dioxide primarily enhances the initial activity of the catalyst and does not significantly alter the diffraction patterns or the stability of the Ga2O3 polymorphs during the reaction. The presence of potassium does not significantly affect the crystalline structure of Ga2O3 but reduces its catalytic efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

在CO2-ODHP反应中，Ga2O3多晶形态的结构和表面性质显著影响其催化性能。特别是，催化剂表面的酸性位点促进了脱氢过程。钾促进导致催化活性的损失，因为过剩的钾阻塞了活性位点。钾的引入改变了Ga2O3的酸碱性性质，影响了产物的选择性和活性。然而，二氧化碳主要在反应初期增强催化剂的活性，并不会显著改变衍射图案或Ga2O3多晶体的稳定性。钾的存在对Ga2O3的晶体结构影响不大，但降低了其在丙烷脱氢中的催化效率。
