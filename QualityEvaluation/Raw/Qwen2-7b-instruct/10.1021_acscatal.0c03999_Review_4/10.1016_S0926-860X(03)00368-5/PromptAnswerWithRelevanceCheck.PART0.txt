[3] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[4] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

1. The structure and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, acidity and basicity, as well as Lewis acid sites, play crucial roles. The observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are attributed to these factors.
2. The promoting role of carbon dioxide was evident only during the initial stages of the reaction. After that, it did not prevent the rapid deactivation of the catalyst.
3. Adding potassium to gallium oxide catalysts results in a loss of catalytic activity.
4. The dehydrogenation process likely occurs on the acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium-promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not show high activity.
5. For all Ga2O3 samples, the primary phase identified through XRD analysis was -Ga2O3, which is the sole stable form of Ga2O3 known.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structure and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, acidic sites on the catalyst surface facilitate the dehydrogenation process. Potassium promotion leads to a loss of catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites by excess potassium. The introduction of potassium modifies the acidity/basicity properties of Ga2O3, affecting the selectivity and activity of the catalyst. However, carbon dioxide primarily enhances the initial activity of the catalyst and does not significantly alter the diffraction patterns or the stability of the Ga2O3 polymorphs during the reaction. The presence of potassium does not significantly affect the crystalline structure of Ga2O3 but reduces its catalytic efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

在CO2-ODHP反应中，Ga2O3多晶形态的结构和表面性质显著影响其催化性能。特别是，催化剂表面的酸性位点促进了脱氢过程。钾促进导致催化活性的损失，因为过剩的钾阻塞了活性位点。钾的引入改变了Ga2O3的酸碱性性质，影响了产物的选择性和活性。然而，二氧化碳主要在反应初期增强催化剂的活性，并不会显著改变衍射图案或Ga2O3多晶体的稳定性。钾的存在对Ga2O3的晶体结构影响不大，但降低了其在丙烷脱氢中的催化效率。

The structure and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly their acidity and basicity, significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by the nature of these sites. The acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst determine the location and reactivity of the active sites involved in the dehydrogenation process. The potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts show a loss of catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites by excess potassium, suggesting that the acidic sites play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reaction.

Ga2O3多晶系的结构和表面特性，特别是其酸性和碱性，显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。推测Lewis酸中心在乙烷脱氢作用中是活性位点。在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段，活动趋势和选择性的解释与这些位点的性质有关。催化剂的酸碱性属性决定了参与脱氢过程的活性位点的位置和反应性。钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂由于过量钾导致活性下降，表明酸性位点在脱氢反应中起着关键作用。

<p>The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be considered as follows:</p>
<p>CH3CH2CH3 = CH2=CHCH3 + H2</p>
<p>H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13], propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. However, CO2 does not improve the catalyst's performance after the initial stage of the reaction.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>
<p>No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow.</p>

1. Carbon dioxide plays a role in improving the dehydrogenation of propane to propene by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift. It consumes hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation process, shifting the equilibrium towards products. However, it does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. 

2. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst, explaining why potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

3. XRD analyses of the catalysts show no significant changes in the diffraction patterns before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under carbon dioxide flow. The fresh Ga2O3 catalyst is more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

1. 二氧化碳通过促进水煤气变换反应，可以改善丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程。它消耗脱氢过程中产生的氢气，使平衡向产物方向移动。然而，在反应过程中，它并不能抑制催化剂的快速失活。

2. 向镓氧化物中引入钾会导致催化活性的丧失。反应似乎在催化剂上的酸性位点进行，解释了钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂活性不高的原因。

3. X射线衍射分析显示，在二氧化碳流下进行丙烷脱氢前后，催化剂的衍射图谱没有显著变化。新鲜的镓氧化物催化剂在873 K下反应后比未反应前更加非晶质。

[1] "In the absence of O2, the selectivity is the highest."
[2] "Increase of O2 concentration up to 9.1% weakly decrease propane conversion and propene yield."
[3] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[4] "The decrease in the catalytic activity is partly correlated with the decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst."
[5] "The amount of CO slightly decreased from 5.4 × 104 to 1.6×104 mmol after treatment of the Ga2O3 catalyst with hydrogen."
[6] "However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number."

1. Oxygen concentration has a minor impact on propane conversion and propene yield during the initial stages of the reaction, with the highest selectivity observed in the absence of oxygen. Increasing oxygen concentration up to 9.1% leads to a slight decrease in propane conversion and propene yield.

2. The addition of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts results in a significant loss of catalytic activity. The propane conversion and propene selectivity decrease notably with an increase in the K/Ga atomic ratio.

3. The catalytic activity of potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts is lower compared to unpromoted catalysts. This decrease is partly associated with a reduction in the specific surface area of the catalyst.

4. The specific surface area of the gallium oxide catalysts changes during the dehydrogenation process, with the fresh catalyst being more amorphous than after the reaction at 873 K.

5. Treating the Ga2O3 catalyst with hydrogen causes a slight decrease in the amount of CO, suggesting that carbon dioxide can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface.

6. The amount of CO gradually decreases with increasing pulse numbers, indicating that carbon dioxide can remove carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction.

1. 氧气浓度在反应初期对丙烷转化率和丙烯产率的影响较小，没有氧气时选择性最高。增加氧气浓度至9.1%，导致丙烷转化率和丙烯产率略有下降。

2. 向镓氧化物中添加钾会导致催化剂活性显著降低。随着K/Ga原子比的增加，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著下降。

3. 钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性低于未促进的催化剂。这种下降部分与催化剂特定表面积的减少有关。

4. 镓氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的特定表面积发生变化，新鲜催化剂在873 K反应后更为非晶质。

5. 将镓2O3催化剂用氢处理会导致CO量轻微下降，表明二氧化碳可能与吸附在镓2O3表面的氢反应。

6. 随着脉冲次数的增加，CO量逐渐减少，这表明二氧化碳可以通过布杜瓦尔反应去除碳沉积。
