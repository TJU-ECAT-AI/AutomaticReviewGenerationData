<p>It was found that carbon dioxide enhance the initial activity of the Ga2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>After 0.2 h of reaction periodic propane conversion and propene selectivity reach 33 and 93%, respectively, while in the presence of argon only 25% conversion and 90% selectivity are achieved under the same condition.</p>
<p>The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

The structure and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs, particularly their acidity and basicity, significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by the nature of these sites. The acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst determine the location and reactivity of the active sites involved in the dehydrogenation process. The potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts show a loss of catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites by excess potassium, suggesting that the acidic sites play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation reaction.

Ga2O3多晶系的结构和表面特性，特别是其酸性和碱性，显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。推测Lewis酸中心在乙烷脱氢作用中是活性位点。在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段，活动趋势和选择性的解释与这些位点的性质有关。催化剂的酸碱性属性决定了参与脱氢过程的活性位点的位置和反应性。钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂由于过量钾导致活性下降，表明酸性位点在脱氢反应中起着关键作用。
