[1] "Propane conversion increased dramatically with increasing vanadium content, for example, 18% for O2 and 9.2% for CO2 ODH at 1.9 V/nm2 for the S1 catalyst, while it increased to greater than 25% at higher VOx loadings for both O2 and CO2 ODH."
[2] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."
[3] "The occurrence of homogeneous reactions was investigated first by passing the above-mentioned propane/O2 and propane/CO2 mixtures through an empty reactor and over the original silica support at 550750 C."
[4] "The maximum yield of propylene of about 11 mol-% was observed over S2 catalyst (3.1 V/nm2)."

In the study, it was found that the conversion of propane increased significantly with the increase in vanadium content. For instance, at 1.9 V/nm2 for the S1 catalyst, the conversion was 18% for O2 and 9.2% for CO2 ODH. However, when the vanadium loading was increased, the propane conversion exceeded 25% for both O2 and CO2 ODH. Additionally, the promotion of the catalyst with sodium ions led to the formation of surface Na metavanadate or a reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which did not exhibit catalytic activity in the presence of CO2. The homogeneous reactions were first examined by passing propane/O2 and propane/CO2 mixtures through an empty reactor and over the original silica support at temperatures ranging from 550 to 750 degrees Celsius. The highest yield of propylene, approximately 11 mol-%, was achieved over the S2 catalyst, which had 3.1 V/nm2 of vanadium loading.

在研究中，发现随着钒含量的增加，丙烷转化率显著提高。例如，在S1催化剂上，对于氧气，当为1.9 V/nm2时，转化率为18%，而对于二氧化碳ODH，则为9.2%。然而，当增加钒负载时，丙烷转化率超过了25%，适用于氧气和二氧化碳ODH。此外，通过钠离子促进催化剂会导致表面Na五氧化二钒或还原V3+/V4+相的形成，这在二氧化碳存在下没有催化活性。首先通过将丙烷/O2和丙烷/CO2混合物通过空反应器和原始硅酸盐支持物进行热处理（温度范围从550到750摄氏度），来检查同质反应的发生情况。最高丙烯产率约为11 mol-%，在具有3.1 V/nm2钒负载的S2催化剂上获得。
