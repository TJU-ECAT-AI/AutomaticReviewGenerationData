[1] "Propane conversion increased dramatically with increasing vanadium content, for example, 18% for O2 and 9.2% for CO2 ODH at 1.9 V/nm2 for the S1 catalyst, while it increased to greater than 25% at higher VOx loadings for both O2 and CO2 ODH."
[2] "We observed a trend through Raman spectroscopic studies that with increasing vanadium content on silica, 2D vanadia structures are formed at first, and then formation of 3D vanadia crystalline structure is favorable."
[3] "Considerable carbon deposition was observed in used catalysts after propane ODH by CO2, the extent of which correlated with their catalytic activity."
[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

This study investigates the selective oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant, aiming to produce olefins as valuable chemical intermediates. The research employs silica-supported vanadia catalysts, where the surface coverage of VOx species varies based on the incorporation of Na+ cations. The introduction highlights the environmental implications of carbon dioxide emissions and the potential of utilizing these gases in industrial chemical synthesis, specifically focusing on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The catalysts' activity in ODH reactions with carbon dioxide is compared to that with molecular oxygen, demonstrating that carbon dioxide exhibits lower catalytic efficiency, leading to the formation of more reactive olefin products. The study also explores the impact of sodium promotion on the dispersion of VOx species and the subsequent catalytic activity in propane ODH reactions with carbon dioxide. The authors report that while sodium promotion enhances dispersion, it also results in the formation of inactive Na metavanadate species on the catalyst surface. The results suggest that the optimized surface coverage of VOx species on the silica support is crucial for achieving high activity in carbon dioxide-based propane ODH reactions. The research contributes to the development of sustainable processes for the conversion of greenhouse gases into valuable chemical products.

本文研究了丙烷在二氧化碳作为氧化剂下的选择性氧化，旨在生产作为有价值的化学中间体的烯烃。研究采用了二氧化硅支持的钨酸催化剂，其中VOx物种表面覆盖度根据钠+离子的掺杂而变化。引言强调了二氧化碳排放对环境的影响以及利用这些气体进行工业化学合成的潜力，特别关注了丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。在使用二氧化碳的ODH反应中，与氧气相比，二氧化碳的催化效率较低，导致形成更活泼的烯烃产品。研究还探讨了钠促进对VOx物种分散度的影响及其在二氧化碳存在下丙烷ODH反应的催化活性。作者报告称，尽管钠促进可以增强分散度，但也会导致在催化剂表面上形成无活性的钠钨酸盐物种。结果表明，二氧化硅支持上VOx物种的优化表面覆盖度对于实现二氧化碳基丙烷ODH反应的高活性至关重要。这项研究为将温室气体转化为有价值化学品的过程的发展做出了贡献。
