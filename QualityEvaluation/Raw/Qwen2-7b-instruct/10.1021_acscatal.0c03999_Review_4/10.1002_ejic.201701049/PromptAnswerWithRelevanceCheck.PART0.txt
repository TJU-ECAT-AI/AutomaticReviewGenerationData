<p>Supported vanadia catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of silica supports, and by varying the surface coverage of VOx species by means of sodium on the silica surface, the nature of the catalyst was investigated.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the composition of model supported vanadia catalysts synthesized in this study. A series of VOx/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized at different vanadia loadings to study the effect of vanadia surface coverage on conversion and selectivity in propane ODH.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the initial propane conversion and product selectivity of propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 550 C.

<p>Table 3 shows the initial propane conversions and product selectivities for propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 600 C. The propane conversion and formation of C1C3 cracking products increased dramatically at 600 C, while the propylene yield was not significantly affected.</p>

The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of supported vanadia catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using both molecular oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as oxidants. The surface coverage of vanadia (VOx) species, promoted by sodium (Na+) ions, affects the catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and product selectivity. The catalysts were studied at different temperatures (550°C and 600°C) and space velocities (GHSV). The literature reports the initial propane conversion and product yields for both O2 and CO2 ODH reactions, highlighting the impact of vanadia surface coverage on the reactivity. The presence of sodium promotes the dispersion of vanadia species, but it also results in the formation of Na metavanadate, which lacks catalytic activity in CO2 ODH. The redox behavior of surface vanadia species is negatively influenced by sodium, preventing the regeneration of the V5+ state crucial for propane activation.

文献讨论了使用分子氧(O2)和二氧化碳(CO2)作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中支持型钒酸盐催化剂的合成与表征。通过钠（Na+）离子的促进，表面钒酸盐（VOx）物种的覆盖率影响催化性能，包括丙烷转化率和产物选择性。在不同温度（550°C和600°C）和空速（GHSV）下研究了这些催化剂。文献报告了两种O2和CO2 ODH反应的初始丙烷转化率和产物产率，并强调了钒酸盐表面覆盖率对活性的影响。钠的加入促进了钒酸盐物种的分散，但也导致了钠钒酸盐的形成，这在CO2 ODH过程中缺乏催化活性。钠的存在对表面钒酸盐物种的还原行为产生负面影响，阻止了丙烷激活所需的钒酸盐V5+状态的再生。

[1] "Promotion with Na+ significantly improved the dispersion of VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacked catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[2] "The lower catalytic activity of CO2 compared to oxygen, which is typically used in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), also means that more reactive olefins are less likely to undergo undesirable combustion in the presence of CO2."
[3] "Supported vanadia catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of silica supports, and by varying the surface coverage of VOx species by means of sodium on the silica surface, the nature of the catalyst was investigated."
[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which lacked catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

Answer: How does the promotion of vanadia catalysts with sodium affect their dispersion and catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2?

The promotion of vanadia catalysts with sodium significantly improves the dispersion of vanadium oxide (VOx) species on the silica support. This enhancement allows for better utilization of the catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. However, the formation of surface sodium metavanadate or a reduced V3+/V4+ phase occurs simultaneously, which lacks catalytic activity in this specific reaction. The improvement in dispersion is confirmed through EDS elemental mapping, demonstrating that sodium promotes the distribution of VOx species more evenly across the catalyst surface.

Answer: Na+ promotion enhances vanadium dispersion on silica, boosting catalyst activity in CO2-ODHP. Yet, it forms inactive Na metavanadate, hindering overall catalytic performance.

如何通过钠对范德华催化剂的影响，改变它们在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的分散性和催化活性？

钠促进显著提高了二氧化硅支持剂上的钒氧化物（VOx）物种的分散性。这种增强使得催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中得到了更有效的利用。然而，同时形成了表面钠钒酸盐或还原的V3+/V4+相，这在特定反应中缺乏催化活性。通过能量分散X射线光谱（EDS）元素映射进一步证实了钠促进了VOx物种在整个催化剂表面的均匀分布。
  
钠促进增强了催化剂的活性，但同时形成的非活性Na钒酸盐阻碍了整体催化性能。

[1] "Propane conversion increased dramatically with increasing vanadium content, for example, 18% for O2 and 9.2% for CO2 ODH at 1.9 V/nm2 for the S1 catalyst, while it increased to greater than 25% at higher VOx loadings for both O2 and CO2 ODH."
[2] "We observed a trend through Raman spectroscopic studies that with increasing vanadium content on silica, 2D vanadia structures are formed at first, and then formation of 3D vanadia crystalline structure is favorable."
[3] "Considerable carbon deposition was observed in used catalysts after propane ODH by CO2, the extent of which correlated with their catalytic activity."
[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

This study investigates the selective oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant, aiming to produce olefins as valuable chemical intermediates. The research employs silica-supported vanadia catalysts, where the surface coverage of VOx species varies based on the incorporation of Na+ cations. The introduction highlights the environmental implications of carbon dioxide emissions and the potential of utilizing these gases in industrial chemical synthesis, specifically focusing on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The catalysts' activity in ODH reactions with carbon dioxide is compared to that with molecular oxygen, demonstrating that carbon dioxide exhibits lower catalytic efficiency, leading to the formation of more reactive olefin products. The study also explores the impact of sodium promotion on the dispersion of VOx species and the subsequent catalytic activity in propane ODH reactions with carbon dioxide. The authors report that while sodium promotion enhances dispersion, it also results in the formation of inactive Na metavanadate species on the catalyst surface. The results suggest that the optimized surface coverage of VOx species on the silica support is crucial for achieving high activity in carbon dioxide-based propane ODH reactions. The research contributes to the development of sustainable processes for the conversion of greenhouse gases into valuable chemical products.

本文研究了丙烷在二氧化碳作为氧化剂下的选择性氧化，旨在生产作为有价值的化学中间体的烯烃。研究采用了二氧化硅支持的钨酸催化剂，其中VOx物种表面覆盖度根据钠+离子的掺杂而变化。引言强调了二氧化碳排放对环境的影响以及利用这些气体进行工业化学合成的潜力，特别关注了丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。在使用二氧化碳的ODH反应中，与氧气相比，二氧化碳的催化效率较低，导致形成更活泼的烯烃产品。研究还探讨了钠促进对VOx物种分散度的影响及其在二氧化碳存在下丙烷ODH反应的催化活性。作者报告称，尽管钠促进可以增强分散度，但也会导致在催化剂表面上形成无活性的钠钨酸盐物种。结果表明，二氧化硅支持上VOx物种的优化表面覆盖度对于实现二氧化碳基丙烷ODH反应的高活性至关重要。这项研究为将温室气体转化为有价值化学品的过程的发展做出了贡献。

In the study, it was found that the conversion of propane increased significantly with the increase in vanadium content. For instance, at 1.9 V/nm2 for the S1 catalyst, the conversion was 18% for O2 and 9.2% for CO2 ODH. However, when the vanadium loading was increased, the propane conversion exceeded 25% for both O2 and CO2 ODH. Additionally, the promotion of the catalyst with sodium ions led to the formation of surface Na metavanadate or a reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which did not exhibit catalytic activity in the presence of CO2. The homogeneous reactions were first examined by passing propane/O2 and propane/CO2 mixtures through an empty reactor and over the original silica support at temperatures ranging from 550 to 750 degrees Celsius. The highest yield of propylene, approximately 11 mol-%, was achieved over the S2 catalyst, which had 3.1 V/nm2 of vanadium loading.

在研究中，发现随着钒含量的增加，丙烷转化率显著提高。例如，在S1催化剂上，对于氧气，当为1.9 V/nm2时，转化率为18%，而对于二氧化碳ODH，则为9.2%。然而，当增加钒负载时，丙烷转化率超过了25%，适用于氧气和二氧化碳ODH。此外，通过钠离子促进催化剂会导致表面Na五氧化二钒或还原V3+/V4+相的形成，这在二氧化碳存在下没有催化活性。首先通过将丙烷/O2和丙烷/CO2混合物通过空反应器和原始硅酸盐支持物进行热处理（温度范围从550到750摄氏度），来检查同质反应的发生情况。最高丙烯产率约为11 mol-%，在具有3.1 V/nm2钒负载的S2催化剂上获得。
