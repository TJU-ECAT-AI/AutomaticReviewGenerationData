Answer: How does the promotion of vanadia catalysts with sodium affect their dispersion and catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2?

The promotion of vanadia catalysts with sodium significantly improves the dispersion of vanadium oxide (VOx) species on the silica support. This enhancement allows for better utilization of the catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. However, the formation of surface sodium metavanadate or a reduced V3+/V4+ phase occurs simultaneously, which lacks catalytic activity in this specific reaction. The improvement in dispersion is confirmed through EDS elemental mapping, demonstrating that sodium promotes the distribution of VOx species more evenly across the catalyst surface.

Answer: Na+ promotion enhances vanadium dispersion on silica, boosting catalyst activity in CO2-ODHP. Yet, it forms inactive Na metavanadate, hindering overall catalytic performance.

如何通过钠对范德华催化剂的影响，改变它们在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的分散性和催化活性？

钠促进显著提高了二氧化硅支持剂上的钒氧化物（VOx）物种的分散性。这种增强使得催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中得到了更有效的利用。然而，同时形成了表面钠钒酸盐或还原的V3+/V4+相，这在特定反应中缺乏催化活性。通过能量分散X射线光谱（EDS）元素映射进一步证实了钠促进了VOx物种在整个催化剂表面的均匀分布。
  
钠促进增强了催化剂的活性，但同时形成的非活性Na钒酸盐阻碍了整体催化性能。
