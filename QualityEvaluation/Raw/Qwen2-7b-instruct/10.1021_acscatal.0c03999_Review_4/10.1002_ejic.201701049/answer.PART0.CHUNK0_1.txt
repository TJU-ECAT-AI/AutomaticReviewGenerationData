<p>Supported vanadia catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of silica supports, and by varying the surface coverage of VOx species by means of sodium on the silica surface, the nature of the catalyst was investigated.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the composition of model supported vanadia catalysts synthesized in this study. A series of VOx/SiO2 catalysts were synthesized at different vanadia loadings to study the effect of vanadia surface coverage on conversion and selectivity in propane ODH.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the initial propane conversion and product selectivity of propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 550 C. In the case of O2, the formation of C1 and C2 products increased with increasing vanadia content in these catalysts. Also, as expected, the conversion of propane was considerably higher during O2 ODH compared to CO2 ODH.</p>
<p>Table 3 shows the initial propane conversions and product selectivities for propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 600 C. The propane conversion and formation of C1C3 cracking products increased dramatically at 600 C, while the propylene yield was not significantly affected.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the TOFs for propane consumption as a function of surface VOx coverage at 500 C at different space velocities to maintain low propane conversion (<15%).</p>
<p>Table 4 shows the results of CO2 ODH of propane over Na-promoted silica catalysts prepared at the same VOx surface coverage as the Na-free supported VOx catalysts (Table 1).</p>
<p>The Raman spectra of the Na-free and Na-promoted silica support and VOx/SiO2 catalysts were recorded to establish the nature of the surface species in these two series of supported vanadia catalysts.</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows the Raman spectra of the Na-free and Na-promoted S4 catalysts containing the highest VOx loading (6.6 V/nm2).</p>
<p>Conclusions Propane ODH by O2 and CO2 was performed over Na-free and Na-promoted supported VOx/SiO2 catalysts. The propylene yield was very similar in both CO2 and O2 ODH reactions with a maximum value of about 11 mol-% observed for the S2 catalyst.</p>
<p>The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation.</p>

The literature discusses the synthesis and characterization of supported vanadia catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using both molecular oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as oxidants. The surface coverage of vanadia (VOx) species, promoted by sodium (Na+) ions, affects the catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and product selectivity. The catalysts were studied at different temperatures (550°C and 600°C) and space velocities (GHSV). The literature reports the initial propane conversion and product yields for both O2 and CO2 ODH reactions, highlighting the impact of vanadia surface coverage on the reactivity. The presence of sodium promotes the dispersion of vanadia species, but it also results in the formation of Na metavanadate, which lacks catalytic activity in CO2 ODH. The redox behavior of surface vanadia species is negatively influenced by sodium, preventing the regeneration of the V5+ state crucial for propane activation.

文献讨论了使用分子氧(O2)和二氧化碳(CO2)作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中支持型钒酸盐催化剂的合成与表征。通过钠（Na+）离子的促进，表面钒酸盐（VOx）物种的覆盖率影响催化性能，包括丙烷转化率和产物选择性。在不同温度（550°C和600°C）和空速（GHSV）下研究了这些催化剂。文献报告了两种O2和CO2 ODH反应的初始丙烷转化率和产物产率，并强调了钒酸盐表面覆盖率对活性的影响。钠的加入促进了钒酸盐物种的分散，但也导致了钠钒酸盐的形成，这在CO2 ODH过程中缺乏催化活性。钠的存在对表面钒酸盐物种的还原行为产生负面影响，阻止了丙烷激活所需的钒酸盐V5+状态的再生。
