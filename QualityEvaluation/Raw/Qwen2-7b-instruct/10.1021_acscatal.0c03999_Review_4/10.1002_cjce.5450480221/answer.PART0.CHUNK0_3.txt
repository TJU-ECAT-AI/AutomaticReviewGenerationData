[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[6] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the prcscnce of different catalysts, low product yiclds are ohrained due to the occrrence of uncontrolled corn- bustion rcactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[7] "A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydrogenation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene."
[8] "Moreover it was noted by Petro-Tcx that of thc thrcc halogcn pronioters used. iodine was thc most effective producing highest once-through yields ( - 807,) when present in smallest molar ratios, i.e. 0.001-0.002 tnole I2 p x  mole hydrocarbon feed."

[14] "However, when the above materials are suitably impregnated with transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides, good catalysts are achieved ( 4 * 6 ) , As indicated earlier even thouah iodine is the best promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, its high cost (approx. $l.OO/lb) and the difficulty in recovering it completely for recycle makes its use in a commercial process risky from an economic point of view."

[17] "It is apparent that the equilibrium constants for the HPS and HI regeneration reactions are similar for all the temperatures shown thus indicating the possibility of replacing the HI in an HC. and/or HBr/HI promoter mixture with HPS while still allowing high product yields to be achieved."

There is theoretical evidence suggesting that sulfur or sulfur combined with chlorine and/or bromine can be used as a promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, potentially replacing iodine or iodine-based mixtures. Suitable catalysts should enable high product yields. Oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has received considerable attention, particularly for the selective dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers. Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are not equilibrium-limited as they produce water alongside olefinic products. Using oxygen alone for hydrogen abstraction in the presence of catalysts often leads to low product yields due to uncontrollable combustion reactions. Iodine has proven to be the most effective promoter among the halogens used in oxidative dehydrogenation, especially when present in very small molar ratios. The dehydrogenation reaction mechanism involves halogen atoms abstracting hydrogen from hydrocarbons to form hydrogen halides, which are then oxidized to elemental halogen and water. Iodine is found to be the most efficient promoter due to its ease of oxidation back to its active form. Mixed halogen systems, particularly those containing chlorine and iodine, can synergistically enhance product yields through additional reactions. The use of sulfur as a promoter in place of halogens is suggested, as it is cheaper and potentially easier to recover, offering a cost-effective alternative in commercial processes. The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide can supply reactive sulfur species to replace halogens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, maintaining high product yields.

理论研究表明，硫或硫与氯和/或溴结合可以作为氧化脱氢反应中烃类的促进剂，可能替代碘或碘基混合物。合适的催化剂应能实现高产品产率。烃类的氧化处理已受到广泛关注，特别是对于烷烃和烯烃的选择性脱氢以生成烯烃和二烯烃单体。氧化脱氢反应不是平衡限制的，因为它们产生水与烯烃产物一起。在催化剂的存在下仅使用氧气进行氢抽象通常导致低产品产率，由于失控的燃烧反应形成一氧化碳和二氧化碳。碘已被证明是在氧化脱氢化中最具效的促进剂，特别是在极小摩尔比下存在时。发现碘是卤素中效率最高的促进剂，因为它很容易被氧化回其活性形式。包含氯和碘的混合卤素系统可以通过额外的反应协同增强产品产率。建议使用硫作为促进剂替代卤素，因为它更便宜且可能更容易回收，提供商业过程中的成本效益选择。氢硫酸的氧化可以提供取代卤素的活性硫物种，在氧化脱氢反应中维持高产品产率。
