Since bromine and chlorine are less expensive than iodine and can be used to wholly or partially replace the latter, the basis for an economically attractive,mixed halogen promoted, dehydrogenation process t)cconics apparent. An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens,particularly bromine and chlorine. This could allow the replace- nient of much o f the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulphur.
