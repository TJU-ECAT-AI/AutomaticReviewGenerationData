[1] "Since bromine and chlorine are less expensive than iodine and can be used to wholly or partially replace the latter, the basis for an economically attractive,mixed halogen promoted, dehydrogenation process t)cconics apparent."
[2] "Under these conditions iodine proves to be the best promoter of all the halogens."
[3] "When all three halogens (Cl2, Br2, and I2) are used in admixture,similar reaction sequences can be written taking into account the various hydrogen abstraction and hydrogen halide oxidation reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Bromine and chlorine are less costly alternatives to iodine that can be used to replace or partially replace it in a mixed halogen-promoted dehydrogenation process, making such a process economically viable.
2. Among the halogens, iodine demonstrates superior promotional efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Using a mixture of all three halogens (chlorine, bromine, and iodine) in the oxidative dehydrogenation process allows for similar reaction sequences involving hydrogen abstraction and hydrogen halide oxidation reactions to occur.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 溴和氯这两种卤素在成本上低于碘，可以完全或部分替代碘，在混合卤素促进的脱氢过程中，这种过程具有经济吸引力。
2. 在所有卤素中，碘显示出在氧化脱氢反应中最佳的促动效率。
3. 使用氯、溴和碘这三种卤素的混合物在氧化脱氢过程中，允许类似的涉及氢抽象和氢卤化物氧化反应序列发生。
