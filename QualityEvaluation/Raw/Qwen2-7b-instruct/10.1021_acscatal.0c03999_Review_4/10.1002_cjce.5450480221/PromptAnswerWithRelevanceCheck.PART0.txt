The economic attractiveness of using mixed halogen promoters in dehydrogenation processes is based on the fact that bromine and chlorine are less expensive alternatives to iodine. Incorporating sulfur alongside these halogens could further reduce costs by replacing a significant portion of the expensive halogens with the much cheaper sulfur.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There is theoretical evidence suggesting that sulfur or sulfur combined with chlorine and/or bromine can be used as a promoter for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, potentially replacing iodine or iodine-based mixtures. Suitable catalysts should enable high product yields. Oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has received considerable attention, particularly for the selective dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers. Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are not equilibrium-limited as they produce water alongside olefinic products. Using oxygen alone for hydrogen abstraction in the presence of catalysts often leads to low product yields due to uncontrollable combustion reactions. Iodine has proven to be the most effective promoter among the halogens used in oxidative dehydrogenation, especially when present in very small molar ratios. The dehydrogenation reaction mechanism involves halogen atoms abstracting hydrogen from hydrocarbons to form hydrogen halides, which are then oxidized to elemental halogen and water. Iodine is found to be the most efficient promoter due to its ease of oxidation back to its active form. Mixed halogen systems, particularly those containing chlorine and iodine, can synergistically enhance product yields through additional reactions. The use of sulfur as a promoter in place of halogens is suggested, as it is cheaper and potentially easier to recover, offering a cost-effective alternative in commercial processes. The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide can supply reactive sulfur species to replace halogens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, maintaining high product yields.

理论研究表明，硫或硫与氯和/或溴结合可以作为氧化脱氢反应中烃类的促进剂，可能替代碘或碘基混合物。合适的催化剂应能实现高产品产率。烃类的氧化处理已受到广泛关注，特别是对于烷烃和烯烃的选择性脱氢以生成烯烃和二烯烃单体。氧化脱氢反应不是平衡限制的，因为它们产生水与烯烃产物一起。在催化剂的存在下仅使用氧气进行氢抽象通常导致低产品产率，由于失控的燃烧反应形成一氧化碳和二氧化碳。碘已被证明是在氧化脱氢化中最具效的促进剂，特别是在极小摩尔比下存在时。发现碘是卤素中效率最高的促进剂，因为它很容易被氧化回其活性形式。包含氯和碘的混合卤素系统可以通过额外的反应协同增强产品产率。建议使用硫作为促进剂替代卤素，因为它更便宜且可能更容易回收，提供商业过程中的成本效益选择。氢硫酸的氧化可以提供取代卤素的活性硫物种，在氧化脱氢反应中维持高产品产率。

Sulphur/ Halogen Promoted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Hydrocarbons

Research Department, Imperial Oil Enterprises Ltd., Sarnia, Ontario lodine is known to be an efficient promoter for the oxidative dehydrogenation of a wide variety of hydro- carbons. However, because of its high cost attempts have been made to reduce or eliminate it from the reaction system while still achieving high product yields.
These considerations indieate that high product yields should also be possible with the new system if suitable ratalysts are used. 
In reccnt years oxidative processing of hydrocarbons has
I
assoincd great importancc in the pctrochcmical industry. A brief survey of literature indicates that oxidative processes such as: (a) ainnioxidation of propylcnc to acrylonitrile, (b) oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and C c ) ethylene oxidation (via the Wacker process) to acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate have been dewloped into major commercial processes (1).
Much attention has also hcen given to the selective, oxidative de- hydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers.Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. I n  the thcrmal dehydrogenation of butane, for example, using a chromia-on- alumina catalyst, butadiene yields of approximately 20% are obtaincd (*). Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product. However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the prcscnce of different catalysts, low product yiclds are ohrained due to the occrrence of uncontrolled corn- bustion rcactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydro- genation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene ( 3 - 4 ) .  Shortly thereafter, Petro-Tex Chemical Corp. ( 5 ) obtained patents on an oxydehydrogenation process using iodine as well as bromine and chlorine as thc promoters. Both the Shell and Pctro-Tex proccsscs allowed up to 709;) butadiene yields from butane and higher than 8 0 y o once-through butadiene yields from tnitenc. Moreover it was noted by Petro-Tcx that of thc thrcc halogcn pronioters used. iodine was thc most effective producing highest once-through yields ( - 807,) when present in smallest molar ratios, i.e. 0.001-0.002 tnole I2 p x  mole hydrocarbon feed.

The literature does not provide specific information about how the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The focus of the document is on the use of sulfur and halogens in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly in comparison to iodine and its role as a promoter in butene-to-butadiene reactions. It does not discuss Ga2O3 polymorphs or their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.
