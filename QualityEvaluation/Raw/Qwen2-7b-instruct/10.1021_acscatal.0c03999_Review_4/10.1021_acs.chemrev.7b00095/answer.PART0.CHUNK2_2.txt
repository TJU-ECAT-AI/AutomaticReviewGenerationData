[1] "Polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration."
[2] "The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv."
[3] "Unlike TEA, PEI-modified supports show higher affinity for H2S, probably due to higher basicity of PEI, but possibly due to higher swelling of PEI compared to TEA."

[8] "These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C."

Answer: 
The study discusses the exploration of physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 for low-temperature H2S adsorption. These sorbents exhibit a high outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv, showcasing higher affinity for H2S compared to triethanolamine (TEA), likely due to increased basicity or swelling of PEI. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity by requiring fewer amine groups per H2S molecule. The structure of mesoporous molecular sieves impacts the kinetic capacity of PEI sorbents, with larger pore size and three-dimensional channel structure promoting higher breakthrough capacity. Lowering temperature benefits both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while decreasing gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) enhances breakthrough capacity. Developed sorbents display a breakthrough capacity of up to 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22°C using 4000 ppm H2S and 20% H2 in bulk N2. PEI/SBA-15 sorbents demonstrate exceptional CO2 loading at 75°C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), with higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature due to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in H2S. Hierarchical porous silica supports for PEI form monoliths suitable for direct use in fixed beds without shaping. These supports exhibit a significantly higher breakthrough capacity (1.27 mmol/g) compared to PEI/SBA-15 (0.79 mmol/g) or MCM-41 (0.81 mmol/g), though the test for the former was conducted at a lower inlet H2S concentration and higher GHSV.

研究探讨了在90°C和10ppmv入口浓度下，物理负载聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）颗粒在微孔分子筛MCM-41上的低温H2S吸附。这些吸附剂能够维持出口浓度为0.04ppmv，显示出与三乙醇胺（TEA）相比更高的H2S亲和力，可能由于PEI的更高基本性或膨胀性。水分增强吸附能力，因为在存在水分的情况下，每个H2S分子仅需要一个胺基团，而无水分时则需要两个。微孔分子筛的结构影响PEI吸附剂的动力学容量，较大的孔径和三维通道结构有利于更高的穿透能力。降低温度对穿透能力和饱和容量都有好处，而降低气体小时空间速度（GHSV）可以增强穿透能力。开发的吸附剂在22°C下使用4000ppm H2S和20%H2在纯N2中表现出高达0.79mmol/g的穿透容量和高达3.02mmol/g的饱和容量。PEI/SBA-15吸附剂在75°C时具有出色的CO2装载能力（0.15大气压下的3.2mmol/g），由于H2S的更快质子转移反应机制，导致在较低温度下具有更高的H2S穿透能力。层次结构多孔硅支持材料形成的多孔体可以直接用于固定床使用，无需成型。这些支持材料的穿透容量显著高于PEI/SBA-15（0.79mmol/g）或MCM-41（0.81mmol/g），尽管对前者进行测试时的入口H2S浓度较低且GHSV较高。
