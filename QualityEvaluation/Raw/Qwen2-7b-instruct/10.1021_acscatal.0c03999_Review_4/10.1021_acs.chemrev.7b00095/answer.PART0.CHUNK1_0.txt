1. Zeolites are characterized by their microporous nature, with the maximum diameter of a sphere that can diffuse through the zeolite structure varying from 1 to 8 Å based on the framework structure.

2. Humidity and temperature negatively impacted H2S removal, whereas oxygen had a favorable effect on the process.

3. High temperatures pose concerns for MOFs with ultra-high adsorption capacity due to potential bed instability without proper heat transfer.

4. Some hydroxyls were found to be available for interaction, as indicated by the computed isotherm, which matched the experimental data when triangular channels were blocked.

5. The most effective zeolites will come from the pool of structures identified for high selectivity towards methane, but the ideal adsorbent will depend on the specific feed conditions (humidity, hydrocarbon richness, CO2/H2S ratios).

1. 硅铝沸石具有微孔结构，其直径范围从1至8 Å，具体取决于框架结构。

2. 湿度和温度对硫化氢去除产生负面影响，而氧气对其有益。

3. 对于具有极高吸附能力的MOFs，在缺乏适当热传递的情况下，高温会引发床层稳定性问题。

4. 一些羟基被发现可用作交互作用，这通过阻塞三角通道并匹配实验数据的计算等温线得以证实。

5. 最有效的硅铝沸石将来自具有高甲烷选择性的结构池，但理想的吸附剂将取决于特定的进料条件（湿度、轻烃丰富性、CO2/H2S比率）。
