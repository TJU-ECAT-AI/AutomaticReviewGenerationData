[1] "Metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization have been investigated extensively; (109, 110) this large body of literature is beyond the scope of this Review, and we focus here mostly on low to moderate temperatures (2530300 C) that are of relevance to natural gas sweetening, including the Claus tail gas."

The literature discusses metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization, but this topic is outside the scope of the current review, focusing instead on lower to moderate temperatures (2530300 C) pertinent to natural gas sweetening processes.

文献中讨论了用于热气体脱硫的金属氧化物，但这个话题超出了当前综述的范围，主要关注的是与天然气净化相关的较低到中等温度（2530300 C）。

[1] "Adsorption of H2S by ZnO is stoichiometric at 350 C but falls off rapidly as the temperature is reduced. (131) Since this is an exothermic reaction, this decline in conversion is due to slower reaction kinetics."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
At 350 C, the adsorption of H2S by ZnO follows a stoichiometric process, but the efficiency drops off quickly as the temperature decreases. This decrease in conversion is caused by a slower reaction rate due to the exothermic nature of the reaction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在350 C时，ZnO对H2S的吸附遵循质量守恒的过程，但随着温度的降低，转化率迅速下降。这种转化率的下降是由于反应速率较慢，这是由于反应为放热性质所导致的。

[1] "It was also found that conventional regeneration at 300 C using 5% O2 in N2 resulted in a drastic loss of capacity for the regenerated material. As an alternative regeneration technique, the authors proposed an in situ regeneration process by adding 5% O2 to the feed stream (desulfurization and regeneration occur at the same time); this resulted in breakthrough capacities twice those observed when O2 was absent from the inlet gas."

It was discovered that conventional regeneration at 300 C with 5% O2 in N2 led to a significant loss of regeneration capacity. An alternative in situ regeneration method, which involved adding 5% O2 to the feed stream (where desulfurization and regeneration occurred simultaneously), doubled the breakthrough capacities observed when O2 was not present in the inlet gas.

发现常规在300 C下使用5% O2在N2中的再生会导致再生能力的大幅损失。一种替代的就地再生方法，即向进料流中添加5% O2（同时进行脱硫和再生），使突破容量达到了没有O2进入气体时观察到的两倍。
