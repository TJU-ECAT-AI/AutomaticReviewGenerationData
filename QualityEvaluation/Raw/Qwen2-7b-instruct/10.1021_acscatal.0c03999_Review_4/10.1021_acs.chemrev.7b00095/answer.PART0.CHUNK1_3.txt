1. The adsorption process was conducted at 300°C using a coal syngas composition with specific gas fractions. The adsorbent was regenerated at 550°C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between.
2. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of sulfur per gram of adsorbent was achieved across five adsorption-regeneration cycles for 16.6 wt% nickel loaded on SBA-16.
3. It is uncertain whether H2S adsorption occurred on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form, which would result in a metal oxide.
4. High temperatures in MOFs with ultra-high capacity pose concerns regarding bed stability without adequate heat transfer.
5. The importance of MOF framework topology, along with the choice of metallic cluster and organic ligands, is emphasized. Powerful screening of adsorbents using computational techniques is crucial to capture subtle differences.
6. Upon activation at 150°C under vacuum, water molecules were removed from the metal, leaving it in a square pyramidal geometry with an open metal site, resulting in SBET values of 1193 and 379 m²/g for two samples.
7. The breakthrough capacity dropped to 19% when the adsorption temperature was increased from 30 to 60°C.
8. The physisorption regime might start without reaching a loading of 1 H2S molecule per Ni atom, suggesting incomplete activation of the MOF (70% activated).
9. The saturation loadings for CH4, CO2, H2S, and COS were found to be 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively, based on the adsorption isotherm fits for these compounds.

1. 在300°C下，使用特定气体组成的煤合成气进行了吸附。吸附剂在550°C下通过纯氢和10%空气在Ar中的交替氧化还原处理以及短时间的Ar吹扫进行了再生。
2. 对于16.6 wt%镍负载在SBA-16上的吸附剂，在五个吸附-再生周期中实现了可完全再生的7毫克/克硫的容量。
3. 不清楚H2S吸附是在氢再生形式的吸附剂上还是在产生氧化物的空气再生形式上进行的。
4. 具有超高水平容量的MOF在缺乏适当热传递的情况下存在高温上升的问题，这会引发床层稳定性问题。
5. 强调了MOF框架拓扑结构的重要性，除了金属簇和有机配体的选择。使用现有和新的计算技术对吸附剂进行强大的筛选对于捕获细微差异至关重要。
6. 在150°C下在真空条件下激活后，水分子从金属中被去除，使其形成一个开放的金属位点并处于四面体几何形状，两个样品的SBET值分别为1193和379 m²/g。
7. 当吸附温度从30°C增加到60°C时，突破容量降低至19%。
8. 可能没有达到每镍原子1个H2S分子的负载量，就开始了物理吸附阶段，这可能表明MOF（70%激活）的不完全激活。
9. 根据这些化合物的吸附等温线拟合，CH4、CO2、H2S和COS的饱和负载分别为9.16、7.25、5.87和3.11 mmol/g。
