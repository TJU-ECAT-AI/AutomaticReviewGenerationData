Usually, when metals are employed for H2S removal, they are used as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites.
By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering.
Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between.
A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorption-regeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07.
It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide.

Metal sorbents, particularly those with small particle sizes and high surface area, can be effective in removing H2S from gas streams. The use of metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, such as SBA-16, allows for stabilization and regeneration of the adsorbent with minimal loss of surface area and active sites. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16 after five adsorption-regeneration cycles. The chemisorbed H2S to Ni ratio was 0.07. However, it is unclear whether H2S adsorption takes place on the hydrogen-regenerated form or on the air-regenerated form of the adsorbent, which could result in a metal oxide.

金属吸附剂，特别是那些具有小颗粒和高比表面积的吸附剂，在去除H2S方面非常有效。在立方结构的介孔硅酸盐中使用金属颗粒（如SBA-16），可以实现吸附剂的稳定性和再生，同时最小化表面面积和活性位点的损失。实现了16.6 wt% Ni负载在SBA-16上后的完全可再生容量为每克吸附剂7毫克S，经过五次吸附-再生周期。Ni与H2S的化学吸附比为0.07。然而，不清楚H2S吸附是否发生在氢再生形式或空气再生形式的吸附剂上，这可能导致金属氧化物的形成。

MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs) are porous structures resulting from coordination of metal ions or clusters to organic ligands.
Bare metals exist at most as nanoparticles formed out of clusters of several thousands of atoms and suffer from activity loss by way of sintering during high-temperature regeneration.
MOFs provide a scheme for isolating the metal atoms or the metal oxide clusters by being chemically coordinated within a porous framework.
This allows design of adsorbents where not only each metal atom exclusively interacts with a single adsorbate molecule but also each of these interaction sites may be regenerated without significant loss of activity.
Additionally, appropriately functionalized organic ligands can also contribute in promoting the selectivity toward the desired gas molecule.
MOFs offer a large parameter space to rationally design the size, shape, and functionality of pores with high adsorption and/or diffusion selectivity toward the molecule of interest.
Typical pore diameters in MOFs are in the microporous regime ranging from 3 to 20 Å.
Due to the highly porous nature of most MOFs, their lower conductivity (0.3 W/m·K for MOF-5 at 300 K) compared to that of crystalline materials in general can be a potential concern for strong host-guest interactions.

金属有机框架（MOFs）是由金属离子或簇与有机配体的协同作用形成的多孔结构。裸露的金属通常以由数千个原子组成的纳米粒子存在，并且在高温再生过程中经历活性损失。MOFs提供了一种隔离金属原子或金属氧化物簇的方法，通过在多孔框架内进行化学配合。这使得设计吸附剂成为可能，其中每个金属原子仅与单个吸附分子相互作用。这些相互作用位点可以再生，而活性损失很小。功能化的有机配体也有助于提高对所需气体分子的选择性。MOFs提供了大量设计空间来创建具有高吸附和/或扩散选择性的孔，针对目标分子。MOFs的典型孔径范围在3到20 Å之间。大多数MOFs的低导电性（300 K时MOF-5的0.3 W/m·K）与一般晶体材料相比，可能对强主客体相互作用构成挑战。
