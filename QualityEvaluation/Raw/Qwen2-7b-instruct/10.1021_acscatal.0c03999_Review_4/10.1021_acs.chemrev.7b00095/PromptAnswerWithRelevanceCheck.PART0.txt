2.2 Methanol
The Rectisol process, developed independently by Linde and Lurgi in the late 1950s, involves physical absorption using methanol at temperatures between 40 and 60 C. Since methanol has a low viscosity, it can be used for very low-temperature absorption processes, in particular for feeds with low partial pressures of acid gases. 

2.3 N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone
Like the Rectisol process, the Purisol process is also a physical absorption process based on N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). However, due to its much lower vapor pressure, it can be operated at relatively higher temperatures without excessive solvent loss. 

2.4 Poly(ethylene glycol) Dimethyl Ether
Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) is a mixture of CH3O(CH2CH2O)nCH3 oligomers with n = 29. Compared to the other solvents, PEGDME has a higher viscosity, which reduces mass-transfer rates and tray efficiencies and increases packing or tray requirements, especially at reduced temperatures. 

2.6 Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts having moderately low melting points (<100 C), with their ionic character imparting them a large cohesive energy in the liquid phase, which in turn results in extremely low vapor pressures over a wide temperature range. 

3.1 Metal Oxides
Since the 1960s, metal oxides have been used for desulfurization of coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas. Metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization have been investigated extensively. 

3.2 Metals
Early literature focused on H2S poisoning of metal catalysts and the threshold concentration below which H2S will not unduly poison a given metal catalyst.

1. 在40至60°C的温度范围内，Rectisol过程利用甲醇进行吸收，适用于低温度吸收过程和低酸性气体分压。

2. Purisol过程依赖于N-甲基-2-吡咯烷酮（NMP）进行物理吸收，在较高温度下运行，而不会产生过多的溶剂损失，因为其蒸气压力较低。

3. 对比其他溶剂，聚乙二醇二甲醚（PEGDME）具有较高的粘度，影响质量传输速率和塔板效率，特别是在较低温度下。

4. 由于其离子特性带来的较大液相结合能，使得离子液体在较宽温度范围内具有极低的蒸气压力。

5. 自20世纪60年代以来，金属氧化物已被用于煤炭气体、合成气体、氢燃料电池气体和克劳斯尾气的脱硫化。

6. 早期研究关注的是H2S不造成催化剂过度毒化的阈值浓度，专注于H2S对金属催化剂的影响。

[8] "These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C."
[9] "The authors proposed a two-stage process, with the first column being operated at 75 C for CO2 removal and the second column at 22 C for H2S removal (see Figure 13)."
</quotes>

Answer: The study discusses the use of PEI-modified sorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) adsorption. The sorbents show higher affinity for H2S compared to triethanolamine (TEA), possibly due to higher basicity and swelling of PEI. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity as it allows for the interaction of only one amine group per H2S molecule. Temperature, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), and amount of PEI loading affect the breakthrough and saturation capacities. The sorbents achieve a breakthrough capacity of up to 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22°C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2. The process includes a two-stage system, with the first column operating at 75°C for CO2 removal and the second at 22°C for H2S removal.

研究讨论了聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）改性吸附剂在低温下对硫化氢（H2S）吸附的应用。与三乙醇胺（TEA）相比，PEI改性吸附剂对H2S具有更高的亲和力，可能是因为PEI更高的碱性和膨胀性。水分能增强吸附能力，因为它允许每个水分子只需要一个胺基团与H2S分子结合。温度、气体小时空间速度（GHSV）和PEI负载量影响穿透和饱和容量。在22°C时，使用4000 ppm H2S和20%H2的氮气中，吸附剂达到0.79 mmol/g的穿透容量和3.02 mmol/g的饱和容量。该过程包括两个阶段系统，第一列在75°C下运行以去除二氧化碳，第二列在22°C下运行以去除硫化氢。

Usually, when metals are employed for H2S removal, they are used as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites.
By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering.
Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between.
A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorption-regeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07.
It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide.

MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs) are porous structures resulting from coordination of metal ions or clusters to organic ligands.
Bare metals exist at most as nanoparticles formed out of clusters of several thousands of atoms and suffer from activity loss by way of sintering during high-temperature regeneration.
MOFs provide a scheme for isolating the metal atoms or the metal oxide clusters by being chemically coordinated within a porous framework.
This allows design of adsorbents where not only each metal atom exclusively interacts with a single adsorbate molecule but also each of these interaction sites may be regenerated without significant loss of activity.
Additionally, appropriately functionalized organic ligands can also contribute in promoting the selectivity toward the desired gas molecule.
MOFs offer a large parameter space to rationally design the size, shape, and functionality of pores with high adsorption and/or diffusion selectivity toward the molecule of interest.
Typical pore diameters in MOFs are in the microporous regime ranging from 3 to 20 Å.
Due to the highly porous nature of most MOFs, their lower conductivity (0.3 W/m·K for MOF-5 at 300 K) compared to that of crystalline materials in general can be a potential concern for strong host-guest interactions.

金属有机框架（MOFs）是由金属离子或簇与有机配体的协同作用形成的多孔结构。裸露的金属通常以由数千个原子组成的纳米粒子存在，并且在高温再生过程中经历活性损失。MOFs提供了一种隔离金属原子或金属氧化物簇的方法，通过在多孔框架内进行化学配合。这使得设计吸附剂成为可能，其中每个金属原子仅与单个吸附分子相互作用。这些相互作用位点可以再生，而活性损失很小。功能化的有机配体也有助于提高对所需气体分子的选择性。MOFs提供了大量设计空间来创建具有高吸附和/或扩散选择性的孔，针对目标分子。MOFs的典型孔径范围在3到20 Å之间。大多数MOFs的低导电性（300 K时MOF-5的0.3 W/m·K）与一般晶体材料相比，可能对强主客体相互作用构成挑战。

Answer: 
The study discusses the exploration of physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 for low-temperature H2S adsorption. These sorbents exhibit a high outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv, showcasing higher affinity for H2S compared to triethanolamine (TEA), likely due to increased basicity or swelling of PEI. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity by requiring fewer amine groups per H2S molecule. The structure of mesoporous molecular sieves impacts the kinetic capacity of PEI sorbents, with larger pore size and three-dimensional channel structure promoting higher breakthrough capacity. Lowering temperature benefits both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while decreasing gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) enhances breakthrough capacity. Developed sorbents display a breakthrough capacity of up to 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22°C using 4000 ppm H2S and 20% H2 in bulk N2. PEI/SBA-15 sorbents demonstrate exceptional CO2 loading at 75°C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), with higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature due to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in H2S. Hierarchical porous silica supports for PEI form monoliths suitable for direct use in fixed beds without shaping. These supports exhibit a significantly higher breakthrough capacity (1.27 mmol/g) compared to PEI/SBA-15 (0.79 mmol/g) or MCM-41 (0.81 mmol/g), though the test for the former was conducted at a lower inlet H2S concentration and higher GHSV.

研究探讨了在90°C和10ppmv入口浓度下，物理负载聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）颗粒在微孔分子筛MCM-41上的低温H2S吸附。这些吸附剂能够维持出口浓度为0.04ppmv，显示出与三乙醇胺（TEA）相比更高的H2S亲和力，可能由于PEI的更高基本性或膨胀性。水分增强吸附能力，因为在存在水分的情况下，每个H2S分子仅需要一个胺基团，而无水分时则需要两个。微孔分子筛的结构影响PEI吸附剂的动力学容量，较大的孔径和三维通道结构有利于更高的穿透能力。降低温度对穿透能力和饱和容量都有好处，而降低气体小时空间速度（GHSV）可以增强穿透能力。开发的吸附剂在22°C下使用4000ppm H2S和20%H2在纯N2中表现出高达0.79mmol/g的穿透容量和高达3.02mmol/g的饱和容量。PEI/SBA-15吸附剂在75°C时具有出色的CO2装载能力（0.15大气压下的3.2mmol/g），由于H2S的更快质子转移反应机制，导致在较低温度下具有更高的H2S穿透能力。层次结构多孔硅支持材料形成的多孔体可以直接用于固定床使用，无需成型。这些支持材料的穿透容量显著高于PEI/SBA-15（0.79mmol/g）或MCM-41（0.81mmol/g），尽管对前者进行测试时的入口H2S浓度较低且GHSV较高。
