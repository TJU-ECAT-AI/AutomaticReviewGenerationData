[1] "In the field of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal, physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration."
[2] "The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv."
[3] "Unlike TEA, PEI-modified supports show higher affinity for H2S, probably due to higher basicity of PEI, but possibly due to higher swelling of PEI compared to TEA."
[4] "Moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence."
[5] "A decrease in temperature favors both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in GHSV enhances the breakthrough capacity."
[6] "The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2."
[7] "The same authors also studied the effects of the operating temperature (2275 C), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV; 3371011 h1), amount of PEI loading, and different molecular sieve supports (MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15)."
[8] "These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C."
[9] "The authors proposed a two-stage process, with the first column being operated at 75 C for CO2 removal and the second column at 22 C for H2S removal (see Figure 13)."

Answer: The study discusses the use of PEI-modified sorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) adsorption. The sorbents show higher affinity for H2S compared to triethanolamine (TEA), possibly due to higher basicity and swelling of PEI. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity as it allows for the interaction of only one amine group per H2S molecule. Temperature, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), and amount of PEI loading affect the breakthrough and saturation capacities. The sorbents achieve a breakthrough capacity of up to 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22°C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2. The process includes a two-stage system, with the first column operating at 75°C for CO2 removal and the second at 22°C for H2S removal.

研究讨论了聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）改性吸附剂在低温下对硫化氢（H2S）吸附的应用。与三乙醇胺（TEA）相比，PEI改性吸附剂对H2S具有更高的亲和力，可能是因为PEI更高的碱性和膨胀性。水分能增强吸附能力，因为它允许每个水分子只需要一个胺基团与H2S分子结合。温度、气体小时空间速度（GHSV）和PEI负载量影响穿透和饱和容量。在22°C时，使用4000 ppm H2S和20%H2的氮气中，吸附剂达到0.79 mmol/g的穿透容量和3.02 mmol/g的饱和容量。该过程包括两个阶段系统，第一列在75°C下运行以去除二氧化碳，第二列在22°C下运行以去除硫化氢。
