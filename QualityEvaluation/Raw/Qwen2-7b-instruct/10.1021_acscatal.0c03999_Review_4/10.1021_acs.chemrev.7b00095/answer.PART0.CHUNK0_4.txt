[1] "In 1976, Westmoreland and Harrison screened for the high-temperature (4001200 C) desulfurization potential of oxides of 28 elements with computational free energy minimizations of a C-H-N-O-S elemental system in the presence of the metal oxide using temperature-dependent free energies from the literature."
[2] "Rodriguez et al. studied adsorption of H2S on a series of metal oxide surfaces using synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission."
