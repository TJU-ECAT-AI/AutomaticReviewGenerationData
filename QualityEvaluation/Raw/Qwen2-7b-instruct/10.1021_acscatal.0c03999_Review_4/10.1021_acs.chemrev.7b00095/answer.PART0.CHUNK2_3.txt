[1] "The studies discussed so far did not involve H2S adsorption in the presence of CO2, which is known to be much more acidic compared to H2S. Ma et al. have made significant progress by finding an exceptional dependence of these sorbents on temperature for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption and developing an innovative sorption process."
[2] "These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C."
[3] "Efforts toward reducing the regeneration time will increase the productivity of these sorbents."
[4] "Polymer chains are trapped in a frozen state at T < Tg, but T > Tg allows for significant motion of the chains. Glassy polymers offer size-selective separation by virtue of differential diffusivity; in contrast, rubbery polymers suffer reduced size selectivity from increased elasticity of the polymer chains."
[5] "Unlike conventional microporous materials such as zeolites and activated carbon, polymeric materials possess advantageous properties, such as solution-processability and precise control over chemical functionality."

1.Ma等人在二氧化碳和硫化氢竞争吸附的温度依赖性方面取得了显著进展，并开发了一种创新的吸附过程。
2. PEI/SBA-15吸附剂在75°C下具有高二氧化碳负载能力，并且在较低温度下对硫化氢的吸收能力较高，这可能归因于硫化氢更快的质子传递反应机制。
3. 减少再生时间可以提高吸附剂的生产力。
4. 玻璃态聚合物通过差异扩散提供尺寸选择性分离，而橡胶态聚合物由于聚合链的弹性而具有较低的尺寸选择性。
5. 高分子材料具有溶液可加工性和精确控制化学功能等优势特性，与沸石和活性炭不同。
