[1] "Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between."
[2] "Fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorption-regeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07."
[3] "It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide."

The adsorption process was conducted at 300 C with a coal syngas mixture consisting of 23% hydrogen, 29% carbon monoxide, 8% carbon dioxide, 30% water vapor, 10% helium, and 10 ppm hydrogen sulfide. Regeneration took place at 550 C using a cycle of alternating oxidation and reduction with pure hydrogen and 10% air in argon, with a short argon purge in between. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 milligrams of sulfur per gram of adsorbent was achieved over five cycles of adsorption and regeneration for 16.6 weight percent nickel loaded on SBA-16. The ratio of chemisorbed hydrogen sulfide to nickel was 0.07. However, it is uncertain whether hydrogen sulfide adsorption occurred on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the metal oxide formed after air regeneration.

吸附过程在300摄氏度下进行，煤合成气混合物由23％氢、29％一氧化碳、8％二氧化碳、30％水蒸气、10％氦和10 ppm硫化氢组成。再生在550摄氏度下进行，使用纯氢和10％空气在氩气中的交替氧化还原循环，中间有短暂的氩气冲洗。对于16.6重量百分比镍负载在SBA-16上，实现了7毫克/克吸附剂的完全可再生容量，经过五次吸附和再生周期。化学吸附的硫化氢与镍的比例为0.07。然而，不清楚硫化氢吸附是在氢再生形式的吸附剂上发生还是在空气再生后形成的金属氧化物上发生。

[1] "The breakthrough capacity increased by 38% on activation at 180 C compared to the unactivated sample and decreased by 10% if the sample was activated further at 200 C."
[2] "Contrary to this inference, Peterson et al. observed no change in H2S adsorption capacity under dry (0% relative humidity) and wet (80% relative humidity) conditions."

Activation at 180 C increased the breakthrough capacity by 38% compared to the unactivated sample, while further activation at 200 C decreased it by 10%. Contrary to this assumption, Peterson et al. did not observe any change in hydrogen sulfide adsorption capacity under both dry (0% relative humidity) and wet (80% relative humidity) conditions.

180摄氏度激活提高了未激活样品突破容量的38%，而进一步在200摄氏度激活则降低了10%。与此相反的是，Peterson等观察到，在相对湿度为0%（干燥）和80%（潮湿）的条件下，氢硫化物吸附能力没有变化。
