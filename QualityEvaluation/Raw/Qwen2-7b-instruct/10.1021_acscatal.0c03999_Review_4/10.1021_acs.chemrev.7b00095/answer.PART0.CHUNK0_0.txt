2.2 Methanol
The Rectisol process, developed independently by Linde and Lurgi in the late 1950s, involves physical absorption using methanol at temperatures between 40 and 60 C. Since methanol has a low viscosity, it can be used for very low-temperature absorption processes, in particular for feeds with low partial pressures of acid gases. 

2.3 N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone
Like the Rectisol process, the Purisol process is also a physical absorption process based on N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). However, due to its much lower vapor pressure, it can be operated at relatively higher temperatures without excessive solvent loss. 

2.4 Poly(ethylene glycol) Dimethyl Ether
Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) is a mixture of CH3O(CH2CH2O)nCH3 oligomers with n = 29. Compared to the other solvents, PEGDME has a higher viscosity, which reduces mass-transfer rates and tray efficiencies and increases packing or tray requirements, especially at reduced temperatures. 

2.6 Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts having moderately low melting points (<100 C), with their ionic character imparting them a large cohesive energy in the liquid phase, which in turn results in extremely low vapor pressures over a wide temperature range. 

3.1 Metal Oxides
Since the 1960s, metal oxides have been used for desulfurization of coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas. Metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization have been investigated extensively. 

3.2 Metals
Early literature focused on H2S poisoning of metal catalysts and the threshold concentration below which H2S will not unduly poison a given metal catalyst.

2. The Purisol process relies on N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for physical absorption, capable of operating at higher temperatures without significant solvent loss due to its lower vapor pressure.

3. Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) has a higher viscosity compared to other solvents, affecting mass-transfer rates and tray efficiencies, particularly at lower temperatures.

4. Ionic liquids possess extremely low vapor pressures over a wide temperature range due to their ionic character, which results from their moderately low melting points.

5. Metal oxides have been applied for desulfurization in coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas processes since the 1960s.

6. Early studies addressed the threshold concentration of H2S that does not excessively poison metal catalysts, focusing on H2S poisoning of metal catalysts.

1. 在40至60°C的温度范围内，Rectisol过程利用甲醇进行吸收，适用于低温度吸收过程和低酸性气体分压。

2. Purisol过程依赖于N-甲基-2-吡咯烷酮（NMP）进行物理吸收，在较高温度下运行，而不会产生过多的溶剂损失，因为其蒸气压力较低。

3. 对比其他溶剂，聚乙二醇二甲醚（PEGDME）具有较高的粘度，影响质量传输速率和塔板效率，特别是在较低温度下。

4. 由于其离子特性带来的较大液相结合能，使得离子液体在较宽温度范围内具有极低的蒸气压力。

5. 自20世纪60年代以来，金属氧化物已被用于煤炭气体、合成气体、氢燃料电池气体和克劳斯尾气的脱硫化。

6. 早期研究关注的是H2S不造成催化剂过度毒化的阈值浓度，专注于H2S对金属催化剂的影响。
