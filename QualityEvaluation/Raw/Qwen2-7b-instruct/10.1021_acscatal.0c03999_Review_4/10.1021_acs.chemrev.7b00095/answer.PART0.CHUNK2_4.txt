[1] "The studies discussed so far did not involve H2S adsorption in the presence of CO2, which is known to be much more acidic compared to H2S. Ma et al. have made significant progress by finding an exceptional dependence of these sorbents on temperature for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption and developing an innovative sorption process."
[2] "The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence."
[3] "The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2."
[4] "These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C."
[5] "In another study, physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration."
[6] "Polymer chains are trapped in a frozen state at T < Tg, but T > Tg allows for significant motion of the chains. Glassy polymers offer size-selective separation by virtue of differential diffusivity; in contrast, rubbery polymers suffer reduced size selectivity from increased elasticity of the polymer chains."

1. Ma et al. have made progress by finding an exceptional temperature dependence for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption, developing an innovative sorption process.
2. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity by requiring only one amine group per H2S molecule, compared to two in the absence of moisture.
3. Developed sorbents show a high breakthrough capacity of 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C for 4000 ppm H2S and 20% H2 in bulk N2.
4. PEI/SBA-15 sorbents have high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but H2S has a lower kinetic barrier due to faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism, resulting in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at 22 C.
5. Physically loaded PEI particles on MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration.
6. Glassy polymers offer size-selective separation through differential diffusivity, while rubbery polymers have reduced size selectivity due to increased polymer chain elasticity.

1. 马等人通过发现二氧化碳和硫化氢竞争吸附的温度依赖性，开发了一个创新的吸附过程，取得了显著进展。
2. 水分增强了吸附能力，因为仅需一个胺基团即可吸附一个硫化氢分子，在有水分的情况下，与无水分时需要两个相比。
3. 研发的吸附剂在22°C下对4000 ppm硫化氢和20%氢气在纯氮气中的饱和容量为3.02毫摩尔/克，突破容量为0.79毫摩尔/克。
4. PEI/SBA-15吸附剂在75°C时具有高二氧化碳负载（0.15大气压下为3.2毫摩尔/克），但硫化氢的动能壁垒较低，由于更快的质子转移反应机制，导致在22°C时较高的硫化氢突破容量。
5. 在90°C和10 ppmv进气浓度下，通过物理加载聚乙烯亚胺（PEI）颗粒在MCM-41上50%质量负载进行了低温硫化氢吸附研究。
6. 玻璃态聚合物通过差异扩散提供尺寸选择性分离，而橡胶态聚合物因聚合链弹性增加而具有较小的尺寸选择性。
