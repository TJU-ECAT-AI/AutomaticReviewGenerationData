[1] "Metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization have been investigated extensively; (109, 110) this large body of literature is beyond the scope of this Review, and we focus here mostly on low to moderate temperatures (2530300 C) that are of relevance to natural gas sweetening, including the Claus tail gas."
[2] "Similar structural arguments were invoked for ZnCo oxides (discussed below) by Baird et al. (132)"
[3] "Regeneration in 20% O2 in He at 500 C for 4 h resulted in over 80% of capacity recovered for the Fe-containing solids, while regeneration at 750 C halved the H2S capacity."
[4] "Since the 1960s, metal oxides have been used for desulfurization of coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas. (107, 108)"

1. The focus of this review is on low to moderate temperatures (2530300 C) relevant to natural gas sweetening, particularly the Claus tail gas, rather than the extensive literature on hot-gas desulfurization.
2. Structural arguments proposed by Baird et al. (132) were similarly applied to ZnCo oxides.
3. Regeneration at 500 C for 4 hours using 20% O2 in He resulted in over 80% capacity recovery for Fe-containing solids, whereas regeneration at 750 C led to halving of the H2S capacity.
4. Metal oxides have been utilized for desulfurization of coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas since the 1960s.

1. 本综述关注的是适用于天然气净化（特别是克劳斯尾气）的较低至中等温度（2530300℃），而不是广泛涉及的高温脱硫文献。
2. Baird等人（132）提出的结构论点也被应用于ZnCo氧化物。
3. 在He中用20% O2加热至500℃进行4小时再生，Fe基材料的再生能力恢复超过80%，而加热至750℃则导致H2S容量减半。
4. 自20世纪60年代以来，金属氧化物已被用于煤炭气体、合成气体、燃料电池氢气和克劳斯尾气的脱硫。
