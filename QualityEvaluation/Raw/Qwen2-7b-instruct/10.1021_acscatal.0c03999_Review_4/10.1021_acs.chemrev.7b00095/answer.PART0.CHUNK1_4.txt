1. Adsorption tests were conducted at 300 C with a coal syngas composition that included 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S. Regeneration was performed at 550 C through a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction process with pure H2 and 10% air in Ar, followed by a short Ar purge.

2. A regenerable capacity of 7 mg of sulfur per gram of adsorbent was achieved across five adsorption-regeneration cycles for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the chemisorbed H2S to Ni ratio being 0.07.

3. Hamon et al. conducted the pioneering experimental study on H2S adsorption in MOFs, including small-pore MIL-53 and MIL-47, and large-pore MIL-100 and MIL-101.

4. GCMC simulations were executed using force fields that demonstrated a reasonable alignment with the single-component experimental adsorption isotherms and enthalpies.

5. Only some hydroxyls were available for interaction, as confirmed by the computed isotherm that matched the experimental isotherm when triangular channels were blocked.

6. The adsorption isotherms for CH4, CO2, H2S, and COS were notably distinct, with saturated loadings estimated at 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively.

1. 在300°C下，进行了煤合成气组成包含23%H2、29%CO、8%CO2、30%H2O、10%He和10ppmH2S的吸附测试。在Ar中使用纯H2和10%空气进行五周期交替氧化还原处理，并在中间进行短暂的Ar排出后进行再生。

2. 在五次吸附-再生循环中，实现了每克吸附剂7毫克的硫再生容量，用于16.6 wt% Ni负载的SBA-16，化学吸附的H2S与Ni的比例为0.07。

3. Hamon等人进行了MOFs中H2S吸附的开创性实验研究，包括小孔MIL-53和MIL-47以及大孔MIL-100和MIL-101。

4. 使用显示了单组分实验吸附等温线和焓的良好一致性的力场执行了GCMC模拟。

5. 当三角形通道被阻断时，仅部分羟基可用作交互作用，通过计算的等温线与实验等温线匹配来证实这一点。

6. CH4、CO2、H2S和COS的吸附等温线存在明显差异，饱和负载分别为9.16、7.25、5.87和3.11mmol/g。
