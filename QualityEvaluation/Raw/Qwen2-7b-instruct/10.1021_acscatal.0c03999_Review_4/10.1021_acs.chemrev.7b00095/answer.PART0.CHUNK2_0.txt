[1] "The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv."
[2] "The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence."
[3] "A decrease in temperature favors both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in GHSV enhances the breakthrough capacity."
[4] "The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves influences the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents; large pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favor higher breakthrough capacity."
[5] "The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2."
[6] "These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C."
[7] "The authors propose that PEI with higher polymerization degree should have very large steric hindrance and low fluidity, restraining the internal diffusion of H2S and lowering the amine utilization, while PEI (423), a mixture of linear monomers and branch polymers, may be partially consumed or volatilized during the impregnation and drying, resulting in the decrease of efficient amine groups."

1. The adsorbent could keep the outlet concentration at 0.04 ppmv.

2. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity, requiring only one amine group per H2S molecule, compared to two in the absence of moisture.

3. Lower temperature benefits both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in gas hourly space velocity improves the breakthrough capacity.

4. The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves impacts the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents, with larger pores and a three-dimensional channel structure favoring higher breakthrough capacity.

5. The developed sorbents have a breakthrough capacity of 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C, using 4000 ppm H2S and 20% H2 in bulk N2.

6. The PEI/SBA-15 sorbents exhibit a high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), with the lower kinetic barrier for H2S than CO2, attributed to faster proton-transfer reaction in H2S, leading to higher H2S breakthrough capacities at 22 C.

7. PEI with higher polymerization degree has significant steric hindrance and low fluidity, restricting internal H2S diffusion and reducing amine utilization. PEI (423), a blend of linear monomers and branched polymers, may be partially consumed or volatilized during impregnation and drying, decreasing the effective amine groups.

1. 吸附剂能够保持出口浓度为0.04 ppmv。

2. 水分提高了吸附能力，只需要一个胺基团用于每个H2S分子，而在没有水分的情况下需要两个。

3. 温度降低有利于突破和饱和容量，而气流小时空间速度的减少增加了突破容量。

4. 多孔分子筛的结构影响支持的PEI吸附剂的动能容量，较大的孔径和三维通道结构有利于更高的突破容量。

5. 在22°C下使用4000 ppm H2S和20% H2在批量N2中，开发的吸附剂具有0.79 mmol/g的突破容量和3.02 mmol/g的饱和容量。

6. PEI/SBA-15吸附剂在75°C时具有高CO2负载（3.2 mmol/g在0.15 atm），由于H2S与CO2相比较低的活化能壁垒，归因于H2S中更快的质子转移反应机制，导致在22°C时较高的H2S突破容量。

7. 高聚合度的PEI具有显著的空间阻碍和低流动性，限制了内部H2S扩散并降低了胺的利用。PEI（423），由线性单体和支链聚合物的混合物组成，在浸渍和干燥过程中可能部分消耗或挥发，减少了有效的胺基组。
