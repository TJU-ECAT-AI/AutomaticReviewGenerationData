[1] "The study aimed to investigate the effect of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additive on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over alumina supported vanadia catalyst."
[2] "The catalyst samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia."
[3] "The results showed that the presence of CO2 and metal oxide additives significantly influenced the catalyst's structure and surface properties."
[4] "The CO2 and metal oxide additives altered the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, affecting the Lewis acid sites."
[5] "These changes led to an improvement in the catalyst's activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction."
[6] "The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction were explained by the modified structure and surface properties of the catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structural characteristics, surface properties (including acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) were found to influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 and metal oxide additives was shown to significantly affect the catalyst's structure and surface properties, altering its acidity and basicity. This modification led to improved activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction, with the observed trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages being explained by the modified structure and surface properties of the catalyst.

不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，被发现影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。CO2和金属氧化物添加剂的存在被证明显著影响催化剂的结构和表面性质，改变其酸性和碱性。这种修改导致了CO2-ODHP反应中催化剂活动性和选择性的改善，解释了初始阶段和稳态阶段观察到的趋势和选择性变化的是催化剂结构和表面性质的修改。
