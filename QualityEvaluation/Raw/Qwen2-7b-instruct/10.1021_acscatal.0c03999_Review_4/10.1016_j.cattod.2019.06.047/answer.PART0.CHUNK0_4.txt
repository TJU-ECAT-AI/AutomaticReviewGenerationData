The structural characteristics, surface properties (acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by modulating the activation of propane molecules and the formation of intermediate species. Carbon dioxide enhances the catalytic activity of the vanadia catalyst, while secondary surface metal oxide additives, particularly γ-Ga2O3, further improve the catalytic performance. The acidic and basic properties of the Ga2O3 polymorphs contribute to the activation process, and Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to produce ethylene. These factors lead to the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction through their synergistic effects on the catalyst structure and surface properties.

不同的Ga2O3多晶形态（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质（酸性、碱性和Lewis酸中心），以及Lewis酸中心，通过调节丙烷分子的活化和中间物种的形成，影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂性能。二氧化碳增强了范德催化剂的催化活性，而次级表面金属氧化物添加剂，特别是γ-Ga2O3，进一步提高了催化性能。Ga2O3多晶形态的酸性和碱性特性有助于激活过程，而催化剂表面的Lewis酸中心促进了丙烷的脱氢生成乙烯。这些因素通过协同作用于催化剂结构和表面性质，导致了反应初期和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性。
