The structural characteristics, surface properties (including acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) were found to influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The presence of CO2 and metal oxide additives was shown to significantly affect the catalyst's structure and surface properties, altering its acidity and basicity. This modification led to improved activity and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction, with the observed trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages being explained by the modified structure and surface properties of the catalyst.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions by modulating the activation of propane molecules and the formation of intermediate species. Carbon dioxide enhances the catalytic activity of the vanadia catalyst, while secondary surface metal oxide additives, particularly γ-Ga2O3, further improve the catalytic performance. The acidic and basic properties of the Ga2O3 polymorphs contribute to the activation process, and Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to produce ethylene. These factors lead to the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction through their synergistic effects on the catalyst structure and surface properties.
