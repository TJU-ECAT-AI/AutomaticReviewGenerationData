[1] "The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions."
[2] "Proposed mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction."

The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Proposed mechanisms elucidate the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
