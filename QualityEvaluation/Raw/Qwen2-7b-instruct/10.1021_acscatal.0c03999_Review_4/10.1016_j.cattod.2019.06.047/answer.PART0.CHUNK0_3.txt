The study found that the addition of carbon dioxide significantly increased the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene production in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over an alumina-supported vanadia catalyst. Secondary surface metal oxide additives were also effective in improving catalyst performance by adjusting surface properties. A mechanism was proposed to explain the observed trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, involving the role of Lewis acid sites in promoting the process and the impact of surface properties on reaction kinetics.
