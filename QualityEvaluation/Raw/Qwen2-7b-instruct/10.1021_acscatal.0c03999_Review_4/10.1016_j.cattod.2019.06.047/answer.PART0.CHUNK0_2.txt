[1] "The study aimed to investigate the effect of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additive on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over alumina supported vanadia catalyst."
[2] "The catalyst samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[3] "The results showed that the addition of metal oxide additives could significantly affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards the target products."
[4] "The mechanism proposed for the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction involved the interaction between the metal oxide additives and the catalyst surface."

The research investigates how the structure, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of various Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) impact their performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. It also proposes mechanisms to explain the observed activity patterns and selectivity throughout the initial and steady-state reaction phases.
