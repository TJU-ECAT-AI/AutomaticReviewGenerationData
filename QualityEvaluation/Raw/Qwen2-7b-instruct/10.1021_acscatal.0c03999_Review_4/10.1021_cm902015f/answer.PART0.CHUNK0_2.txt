Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Nor does it propose mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
