[1] "The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) play crucial roles in their catalytic performance."
[2] "In the context of CO2-ODHP reactions, these factors influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity."
[3] "The mechanisms proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants."

The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors affect reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
