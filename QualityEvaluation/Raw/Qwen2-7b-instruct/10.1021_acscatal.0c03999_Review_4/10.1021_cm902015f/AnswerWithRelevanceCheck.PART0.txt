          The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors affect reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

          不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性以及Lewis酸中心，在CO2-ODHP反应中对其催化性能有显著影响。这些因素影响反应动力学和产物选择性。解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机制涉及催化剂表面与反应物之间的特定相互作用，在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段都是如此。

          The literature does not provide specific information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Nor does it propose mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
