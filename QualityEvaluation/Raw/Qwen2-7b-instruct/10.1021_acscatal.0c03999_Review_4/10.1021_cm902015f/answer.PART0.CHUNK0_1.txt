<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structural characteristics, surface properties such as acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors determine the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, resulting in observed activity trends and selectivity.
