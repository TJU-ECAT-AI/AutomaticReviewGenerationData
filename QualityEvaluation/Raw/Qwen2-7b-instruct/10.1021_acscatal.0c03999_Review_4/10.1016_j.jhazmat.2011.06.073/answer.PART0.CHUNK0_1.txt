[1] "Mesoporous wide bandgap semiconductors offer high photocatalytic oxidation and mineralization activities."
[2] "Because of their uniquely larger specific surface area,continuous pore channels,and multiple scattering structures,mesoporous materials have been widely used as photocatalysts of high light harvesting and fast mass transfer rate."
[3] "As a result,these photocatalysts show exceptional performance in photocatalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into harmless compounds such as carbon dioxide and water."
[4] "Recently,1-dimensional -Ga2O3 such as nanowires and nanorods has attracted increasing attention for its unique nanostructure and photocatalytic properties."
[5] "High surface area mesoporous nano- or micro-structures are believed to offer much improved photocatalytic activity than conventional low-surface area counterparts,especially in multi-phase photocatalytic systems."
[6] "In such systems,the reaction rate of gassolid heterogeneous photocatalysis is often limited by mass-transfer processes on the catalyst surface."
[7] "Therefore,developing porous -Ga2O3 with a larger surface area is of great scientific and practical significance."
[8] "The overall goal of this study was to prepare and characterize a class of PEG-modified -Ga2O3 mesoporous nanorods by a modified hydrothermal method toward the photocatalytic oxidation of VOCs."
[9] "The specific objectives were to:(1) determine the effects of molecular weight and the content of PEG on the BET area and photoluminescence toward better understanding of the crystalline growth process;(2) assess the environmental friendliness of the -Ga2O3 facilitated photocatalytic oxidation process based on recommended exposure limit (REL) and the health risk influence index () via evaluating the photocatalytic degradation of toluene (a prototype VOC) and identifying the photocatalytic oxidation intermediates using a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS)."

The study aimed to synthesize mesoporous -Ga2O3 nanorods using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a template, focusing on their photocatalytic oxidation properties towards volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The objectives included determining the effects of PEG's molecular weight and content on the material's surface area and photoluminescence to understand the crystalline growth process. Additionally, the environmental impact of the -Ga2O3 catalyst was assessed through the evaluation of the health risk influence index based on the recommended exposure limit (REL) and the identification of intermediate products during the photocatalytic degradation of toluene. The synthesized -Ga2O3 nanorods exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity and produced fewer toxic intermediates compared to conventional catalysts like TiO2.
