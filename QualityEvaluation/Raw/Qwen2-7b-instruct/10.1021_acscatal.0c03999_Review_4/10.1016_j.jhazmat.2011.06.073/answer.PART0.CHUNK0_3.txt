1. A typical synthesis process involved dissolving 1.6 g of Ga(NO3)3·9H2O, 2.64 g of urea, and 20 mL of PEG into 70 mL of deionized water, followed by vigorous stirring for 2 hours at 25 °C. The material was then calcined at 800 °C for 2 hours in a muffle furnace to obtain the desired nanostructured -Ga2O3 nanorods.

2. The XRD patterns' diffraction peaks could be indexed to the precursor GaOOH and monoclinic -Ga2O3, according to JCPDS standards.

3. The SEM image depicted a diamond-shaped cross-section of the -Ga2O3 nanorods with two 60° and two 120° angles. The TEM images illustrated nanorods measuring approximately 200-300 nm in each dimension and 1.0-1.2 μm in length, featuring dense nanoholes with an average diameter of about 20 nm.

4. The PL spectra were measured at 25 °C using a fluorospectrophotometer with a Xe lamp as the excitation source.

5. During the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene, -Ga2O3 produced a higher percentage of benign intermediates, such as methanol, 1,3-butadiene, and acetic acid, compared to TiO2.

6. The PL intensity increased with the addition of PEG content, reaching its peak at a dosage of 20 mL.

7. The formation mechanism of mesoporous -Ga2O3 nanorods comprised the production of GaOOH nanoparticles, adsorption of hydrophilic PEG groups on the GaOOH surface to prevent particle aggregation, and subsequent growth into diamond nanorods through Ostwald ripening.

1. 在一个典型的合成过程中，将1.6克Ga(NO3)3·9H2O、2.64克尿素和20毫升PEG溶解于70毫升去离子水中，并在25°C下剧烈搅拌2小时。然后，在800°C下使用马弗炉煅烧2小时以获得所需的-Ga2O3纳米棒结构。

2. X射线衍射图谱中的衍射峰可以被归因于前体GaOOH和单斜晶系-Ga2O3，根据JCPDS标准。

3. SEM图像显示了-Ga2O3纳米棒的钻石形横截面，带有两个60°和两个120°角度。TEM图像表明长度约为1.0-1.2微米，直径为约200-300纳米，具有密集的纳米孔，平均直径约为20纳米。

4. 在测量到25°C时，使用氟光度计和Xe灯作为激发源进行PL谱的测量。

5. 在光催化氧化苯的进程中，与TiO2相比，-Ga2O3生成更多百分比的无害中间体，如甲醇、1,3-丁二烯和乙酸。

6. 随着PEG含量的增加，PL强度增加，达到20毫升的最高程度。

7. mesoporous -Ga2O3纳米棒的形成机制包括生产GaOOH纳米颗粒，PEG链上亲水性基团吸附在GaOOH表面以减少其表面能，防止颗粒快速聚集，并进一步通过奥斯瓦尔德熟化生长成钻石纳米棒。
