In the study, mesoporous -Ga2O3 diamond nanorods were synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a template through a hydrothermal method. These nanorods were found to have UV photocatalytic oxidation activity for gaseous toluene. The photoluminescence spectra indicated that the dosage and molecular weight of PEG play a significant role in the formation of vacancies and the photocatalytic oxidation activities. The health risk influence index of the intermediates revealed that the -Ga2O3 nanorods have a lower calculated health risk of 9.6, making them safer than titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a health risk index of 17.6. Surfactant templating, including the use of PEG, is a breakthrough methodology for synthesizing mesoporous materials with tunable properties.

在研究中，通过使用聚乙二醇（PEG）作为模板的水热方法合成了介孔-Ga2O3钻石纳米棒。这些纳米棒被发现具有紫外线光催化氧化活性对气体甲苯。光致发光光谱表明，PEG的剂量和分子量对于形成空位和光催化氧化活性至关重要。健康风险影响指数显示，这些-Ga2O3纳米棒的计算健康风险为9.6，比二氧化钛（TiO2）低得多，后者具有17.6的健康风险指数。表面活性剂模板化，包括使用PEG，是合成具有可调性质的介孔材料的突破性技术。
