In the study, mesoporous -Ga2O3 diamond nanorods were synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a template through a hydrothermal method. These nanorods were found to have UV photocatalytic oxidation activity for gaseous toluene. The photoluminescence spectra indicated that the dosage and molecular weight of PEG play a significant role in the formation of vacancies and the photocatalytic oxidation activities. The health risk influence index of the intermediates revealed that the -Ga2O3 nanorods have a lower calculated health risk of 9.6, making them safer than titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a health risk index of 17.6. Surfactant templating, including the use of PEG, is a breakthrough methodology for synthesizing mesoporous materials with tunable properties.

The synthesis of mesoporous -Ga2O3 diamond nanorods was achieved through a hydrothermal method utilizing PEG as a template. These nanorods demonstrated UV photocatalytic oxidation activity for gaseous toluene. The formation of vacancies and photocatalytic oxidation activities were influenced by the dosage and molecular weight of PEG. The calculated health risks indicated that the -Ga2O3 nanorods had a significantly lower risk than TiO2. The crystallite size decreased while the surface area increased to an optimal level of 29.0 m2/g with a PEG dosage of 20 mL. High surface area mesoporous nano- or micro-structures were found to enhance photocatalytic activity compared to conventional counterparts. For the sample without PEG, gallium-oxygen vacancy pairs (VO, VGa) were responsible for the weak peak at 490 nm. As the PEG dosage surpassed 60 mL, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity sharply declined, aligning with the XRD findings. The crystallites transformed into diamond nanorods via Ostwald ripening. At high temperatures, the activation of atoms in -Ga2O3, along with remaining PEG and urea molecules, enabled nitrogen and carbon impurities to enter the -Ga2O3 structure and replace oxygen atoms.

通过水热方法并利用聚乙二醇（PEG）作为模板，合成了介孔-Ga2O3金刚石纳米棒。这些纳米棒对气态甲苯表现出紫外线光催化氧化活性。形成空位和光催化活性受到PEG的剂量和分子量的影响。计算得出的风险表明，Ga2O3纳米棒的风险远低于TiO2。晶体粒度减小而表面积增加至最大值29.0 m2/g，当PEG剂量达到20 mL时。高表面积的微孔纳米或微结构比低表面积的常规结构提供了显著增强的光催化活性。对于没有PEG的样品，490 nm处的弱峰归因于镓氧空位对（VO, VGa），因为该样品中氧空位浓度较低。当PEG剂量超过60 mL时，光致发光（PL）强度急剧下降，这与XRD结果一致。晶粒进一步转化为钻石纳米棒，通过奥斯瓦尔德熟化。在高温下，Ga2O3中的原子激活，以及剩余的PEG和尿素分子，使得氮和碳杂质以足够的能量进入Ga2O3结构并取代氧原子。
