The mesoporous -Ga2O3 diamond nanorods were successfully synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a template through a hydrothermal method. The photocatalytic oxidation of toluene was assessed under UV conditions, and seven types of intermediates were identified through online monitoring with proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry. The photoluminescence spectra indicated that both the dosage and molecular weight of PEG play significant roles in the creation of vacancies and influencing the photocatalytic oxidation activities. Furthermore, the -Ga2O3 nanorods demonstrated a notably safer health risk profile, with a calculated health risk index of 9.6, compared to titanium dioxide (TiO2) with an index of 17.6.

通过聚乙二醇（PEG）作为模板的水热方法，成功合成了介孔-Ga2O3钻石纳米棒。在紫外条件下对甲苯的光催化氧化进行了评估，并通过质子转移反应质谱法在线监测了七种中间体。光致发光光谱显示，PEG的剂量和分子量对于形成空位和影响光催化氧化活性至关重要。此外，与二氧化钛（TiO2）相比，-Ga2O3纳米棒在健康风险方面表现出显著的安全性，其计算的健康风险指数为9.6，而TiO2的指数为17.6。
