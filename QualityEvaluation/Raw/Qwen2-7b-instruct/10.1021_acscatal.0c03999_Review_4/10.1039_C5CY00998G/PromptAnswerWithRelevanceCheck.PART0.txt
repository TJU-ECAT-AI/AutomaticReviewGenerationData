<p>The DHS method can be successfully employed to obtain Cr/SiO2 catalysts with high specific surface area and a texture characterized by the co-presence of ordered mesoporous, disordered mesoporous and non-porous particles, their relative amount depending on the Cr content.</p>
<p>All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behavior as Lewis acid centers towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading.</p>
<p>The formation of surface chromate species was accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.</p>
<p>All the investigated catalysts appeared stable towards possible irreversible deactivation in the ODH of propane, in reaction conditions as close as possible to industrial applications, and allowed the attainment of yields in propene (and total olefins) among the highest reported in the literature, in particular by using CO2 alone as oxidant, where YC3H6 still remained as high as 40% after 1000 min of reaction at very low space velocity, in order to attain conversion of industrial interest.</p>
<p>Finally, XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that this possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent.</p>

The document discusses the use of direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHS) to prepare chromium/silica (Cr/SiO2) catalysts with high specific surface area and a texture featuring ordered mesoporous, disordered mesoporous, and non-porous particles. Chromium is primarily present as dispersed chromate species on the surface of the catalyst, and the number of active sites (measured as Lewis acid centers) is directly proportional to the chromium loading. The presence of surface chromate species leads to the formation of Brnsted acid sites, which are more prevalent in catalysts with higher chromium content. The catalysts demonstrate remarkable stability against irreversible deactivation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) under conditions resembling industrial applications. High yields of propene (and total olefins) are achieved, particularly when carbon dioxide (CO2) is used as the oxidant, with the yield of propene remaining at 40% after 1000 minutes of reaction at low space velocity, indicative of industrial relevance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveals that the average oxidation state of chromium sites varies between +2 and +3 depending on whether CO2 or a mixture of CO2 and oxygen (O2) is used as the oxidant. This difference in oxidation state is suggested to influence the selectivity and yield of propene and ethene (C2H4) during ODH, depending on the oxidant used.

文档讨论了直接水热合成（DHS）用于制备具有高比表面面积和由有序介孔、无序介孔和非孔颗粒共存的纹理的铬/二氧化硅（Cr/SiO2）催化剂的应用。铬主要以表面铬酸盐物种的形式分散在催化剂上，活性位点（作为NH3的Lewis酸中心行为测量）与铬负载成正比。表面铬酸盐物种的存在导致表面Brnsted酸位点的形成，这些位点在高铬含量的催化剂中更为丰富。催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）条件下表现出对不可逆失活的出色稳定性，条件接近工业应用。在高空间速度下，使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂时实现了高丙烯（和总烯烃）产率，特别是当仅使用CO2作为氧化剂时，丙烯的产率仍保持在40%，反应时间长达1000分钟，这表明工业相关性。X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）光谱显示，根据是否使用CO2或CO2和氧气（O2）的混合物作为氧化剂，铬物种的平均氧化态在+2和+3之间变化。推测这种氧化态的差异会影响丙烯和乙炔（C2H4）在ODH中的选择性和产率，取决于所使用的氧化剂。

<p>The results obtained in propane ODH using O2 or O2+CO2 suggest that it could be worthwhile to investigate the possibility to tune the O2/CO2 ratio in order to obtain a desired composition of the olefin mixture to obtain tailored feeds for C2H4/C3H6 copolymerization.</p>
<p>The higher production of C2H4 might be the results of the enhanced cracking of propane in the presence of O2,52 also responsible for the production of larger excess of CH4 (reported in Fig.S8 in the ESI).</p>

The structural characteristics and surface properties of the Ga2O3 polymorphs α-, β-, γ-, and δ- play a crucial role in their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-Ga2O3 polymorph is noted for its high activity and selectivity in the oxidation of CO2 to CO. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph is less active but shows better stability under reaction conditions. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorph has moderate activity and selectivity, while the δ-Ga2O3 polymorph demonstrates the lowest activity but high selectivity for the formation of CO. These performance differences are attributed to the distinct electronic structures and surface properties of each polymorph, affecting the adsorption and activation of reactants and products. The presence of Lewis acidic sites on the surface of Ga2O3 polymorphs facilitates the activation of CO2, leading to the formation of CO through the CO2-ODHP reaction. The stability and selectivity trends during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by the unique surface chemistry and structure of each polymorph, which influences the reaction pathways and product distribution.

Ga2O3四种晶型α-、β-、γ-和δ-的结构特性和表面性质在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能中起着关键作用。α-Ga2O3晶型表现出高活性和选择性，用于氧化CO2生成CO。β-Ga2O3晶型的活性较低，但具有更好的稳定性。γ-Ga2O3晶型的活性和选择性适中，而δ-Ga2O3晶型显示出最低的活性但对CO的形成有很高的选择性。这些性能差异归因于每种晶型独特的电子结构和表面性质，影响反应物和产物的吸附与活化过程。Ga2O3晶型表面上存在的Lewis酸性位点有助于激活CO2，导致通过CO2-ODHP反应形成CO。在初始和稳态反应阶段的稳定性和选择性趋势由每种晶型的独特表面化学和结构所解释，这影响了反应途径和产物分布。

<p>Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity.</p>

Answer: The catalytic dehydrogenation of propene (C3H6) is currently performed industrially using catalysts like Cr2O3/Al2O3 (Catofin press) or Pt (<1 wt%), Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process). However, there is growing interest in developing cheaper and more sustainable alternatives. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has emerged as a particularly promising process due to its higher energy efficiency and simpler process compared to traditional dehydrogenation and cracking.

Answer: As the chromium content increases, the regularity and extent of mesopores significantly decrease (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy). However, this does not hinder the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher chromium loadings.

The structural characteristics of the catalysts, including the decrease in the extent and regularity of mesopores with increased chromium content, did not limit the catalytic performance. The spectroscopic and catalytic results helped explain the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and suggested a tentative correlation between the oxidation state of chromium species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) and the selectivity in propene production. There was no irreversible deactivation observed regardless of the dehydrogenation conditions. The highest initial yield in propene was approximately 47% when using CO2 as the oxidant, and this yield remained at approximately 40% even after 1000 minutes of reaction.
