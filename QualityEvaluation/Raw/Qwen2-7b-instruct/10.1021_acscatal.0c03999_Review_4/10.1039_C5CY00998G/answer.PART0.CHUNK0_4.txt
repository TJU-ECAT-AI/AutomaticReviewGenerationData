[1] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[2] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[3] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."
[4] "The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

The structural characteristics of the catalysts, including the decrease in the extent and regularity of mesopores with increased chromium content, did not limit the catalytic performance. The spectroscopic and catalytic results helped explain the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and suggested a tentative correlation between the oxidation state of chromium species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) and the selectivity in propene production. There was no irreversible deactivation observed regardless of the dehydrogenation conditions. The highest initial yield in propene was approximately 47% when using CO2 as the oxidant, and this yield remained at approximately 40% even after 1000 minutes of reaction.

催化剂的结构特性，包括随着铬含量增加，介孔的量度和规律性显著下降，并未限制催化性能。光谱学和催化结果帮助解释了不同氧化剂在定义铬氧化态中的作用，并提出了反应中铬物种（Cr2+/Cr3+）氧化态与丙烯选择性的暂定相关性。无论脱氢条件如何，均未观察到不可逆失活现象。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，最高初始丙烯产率约为47%，即使在反应1000分钟后，该产率仍保持在约40%。
