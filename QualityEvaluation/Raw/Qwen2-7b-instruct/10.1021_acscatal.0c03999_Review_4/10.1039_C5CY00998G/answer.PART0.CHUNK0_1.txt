<p>Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.</p>
<p>Achieving high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins.</p>
<p>The addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected.</p>
<p>The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings.</p>
<p>Theoretical surface dispersion of Cr ions increase of more than 10 times passing from 0.03 (for 0.25-Cr/DHS) to 0.35 at/nm2 (2.0-Cr/DHS).</p>
<p>Theoretical surface dispersion of Cr ions increase of more than 10 times passing from 0.03 (for 0.25-Cr/DHS) to 0.35 at/nm2 (2.0-Cr/DHS).</p>
<p>Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred, independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs.</p>
<p>Thermodynamic calculations indicated that the equilibrium conversion of propane in the reaction 38 + 2 = 36 +  + 2 carried out at 873 K is ca. 67%.</p>
<p>The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased).</p>
<p>The results obtained in propane ODH using O2 or O2+CO2 suggest that it could be worthwhile to investigate the possibility to tune the O2/CO2 ratio in order to obtain a desired composition of the olefin mixture to obtain tailored feeds for C2H4/C3H6 copolymerization.</p>
<p>The higher production of C2H4 might be the results of the enhanced cracking of propane in the presence of O2,52 also responsible for the production of larger excess of CH4 (reported in Fig.S8 in the ESI).</p>

The structural characteristics and surface properties of the Ga2O3 polymorphs α-, β-, γ-, and δ- play a crucial role in their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-Ga2O3 polymorph is noted for its high activity and selectivity in the oxidation of CO2 to CO. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph is less active but shows better stability under reaction conditions. The γ-Ga2O3 polymorph has moderate activity and selectivity, while the δ-Ga2O3 polymorph demonstrates the lowest activity but high selectivity for the formation of CO. These performance differences are attributed to the distinct electronic structures and surface properties of each polymorph, affecting the adsorption and activation of reactants and products. The presence of Lewis acidic sites on the surface of Ga2O3 polymorphs facilitates the activation of CO2, leading to the formation of CO through the CO2-ODHP reaction. The stability and selectivity trends during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained by the unique surface chemistry and structure of each polymorph, which influences the reaction pathways and product distribution.

Ga2O3四种晶型α-、β-、γ-和δ-的结构特性和表面性质在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能中起着关键作用。α-Ga2O3晶型表现出高活性和选择性，用于氧化CO2生成CO。β-Ga2O3晶型的活性较低，但具有更好的稳定性。γ-Ga2O3晶型的活性和选择性适中，而δ-Ga2O3晶型显示出最低的活性但对CO的形成有很高的选择性。这些性能差异归因于每种晶型独特的电子结构和表面性质，影响反应物和产物的吸附与活化过程。Ga2O3晶型表面上存在的Lewis酸性位点有助于激活CO2，导致通过CO2-ODHP反应形成CO。在初始和稳态反应阶段的稳定性和选择性趋势由每种晶型的独特表面化学和结构所解释，这影响了反应途径和产物分布。
