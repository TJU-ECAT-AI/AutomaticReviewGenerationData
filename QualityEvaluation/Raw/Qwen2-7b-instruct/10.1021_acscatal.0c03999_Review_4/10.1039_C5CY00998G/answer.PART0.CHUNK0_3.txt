<p>Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3 Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity.</p>

Answer: The catalytic dehydrogenation of propene (C3H6) is currently performed industrially using catalysts like Cr2O3/Al2O3 (Catofin press) or Pt (<1 wt%), Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process). However, there is growing interest in developing cheaper and more sustainable alternatives. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has emerged as a particularly promising process due to its higher energy efficiency and simpler process compared to traditional dehydrogenation and cracking.

当前，丙烯（C3H6）的催化脱氢主要使用Cr2O3/Al2O3（Catofin压片）或Pt（<1 wt%），Sn（1-2 wt%）/Al2O3（Oleflex工艺）等催化剂。然而，由于其更高的能源效率和更简单的流程，人们对于开发成本更低、更可持续的替代品的兴趣日益增长。丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程因其与传统脱氢和裂解相比更高的能效以及更简单的工艺而被认为极具潜力。

<p>The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings.</p>
</quotes>

Answer: As the chromium content increases, the regularity and extent of mesopores significantly decrease (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy). However, this does not hinder the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher chromium loadings.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
随着铬含量的增加，介孔的规则性和数量显著减少（X射线衍射、氮气吸附、透射电子显微镜）。然而，这并没有阻碍高铬负载催化剂的催化性能。
