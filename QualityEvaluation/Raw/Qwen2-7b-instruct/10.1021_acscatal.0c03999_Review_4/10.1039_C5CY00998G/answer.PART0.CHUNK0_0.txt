<p>The DHS method can be successfully employed to obtain Cr/SiO2 catalysts with high specific surface area and a texture characterized by the co-presence of ordered mesoporous, disordered mesoporous and non-porous particles, their relative amount depending on the Cr content.</p>
<p>All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behavior as Lewis acid centers towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading.</p>
<p>The formation of surface chromate species was accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents.</p>
<p>All the investigated catalysts appeared stable towards possible irreversible deactivation in the ODH of propane, in reaction conditions as close as possible to industrial applications, and allowed the attainment of yields in propene (and total olefins) among the highest reported in the literature, in particular by using CO2 alone as oxidant, where YC3H6 still remained as high as 40% after 1000 min of reaction at very low space velocity, in order to attain conversion of industrial interest.</p>
<p>Finally, XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant. It seems reasonable to propose that this possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent.</p>

The document discusses the use of direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHS) to prepare chromium/silica (Cr/SiO2) catalysts with high specific surface area and a texture featuring ordered mesoporous, disordered mesoporous, and non-porous particles. Chromium is primarily present as dispersed chromate species on the surface of the catalyst, and the number of active sites (measured as Lewis acid centers) is directly proportional to the chromium loading. The presence of surface chromate species leads to the formation of Brnsted acid sites, which are more prevalent in catalysts with higher chromium content. The catalysts demonstrate remarkable stability against irreversible deactivation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) under conditions resembling industrial applications. High yields of propene (and total olefins) are achieved, particularly when carbon dioxide (CO2) is used as the oxidant, with the yield of propene remaining at 40% after 1000 minutes of reaction at low space velocity, indicative of industrial relevance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveals that the average oxidation state of chromium sites varies between +2 and +3 depending on whether CO2 or a mixture of CO2 and oxygen (O2) is used as the oxidant. This difference in oxidation state is suggested to influence the selectivity and yield of propene and ethene (C2H4) during ODH, depending on the oxidant used.

文档讨论了直接水热合成（DHS）用于制备具有高比表面面积和由有序介孔、无序介孔和非孔颗粒共存的纹理的铬/二氧化硅（Cr/SiO2）催化剂的应用。铬主要以表面铬酸盐物种的形式分散在催化剂上，活性位点（作为NH3的Lewis酸中心行为测量）与铬负载成正比。表面铬酸盐物种的存在导致表面Brnsted酸位点的形成，这些位点在高铬含量的催化剂中更为丰富。催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）条件下表现出对不可逆失活的出色稳定性，条件接近工业应用。在高空间速度下，使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂时实现了高丙烯（和总烯烃）产率，特别是当仅使用CO2作为氧化剂时，丙烯的产率仍保持在40%，反应时间长达1000分钟，这表明工业相关性。X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）光谱显示，根据是否使用CO2或CO2和氧气（O2）的混合物作为氧化剂，铬物种的平均氧化态在+2和+3之间变化。推测这种氧化态的差异会影响丙烯和乙炔（C2H4）在ODH中的选择性和产率，取决于所使用的氧化剂。
