        The in-depth analysis presented here highlights the pivotal role of structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in influencing their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Specifically, β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs demonstrate superior performance in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity, surpassing α- and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs. Surface acidity density, which decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, along with surface basicity, correlates with the catalytic activity and selectivity observed across these polymorphs.

        The initial activity of these catalysts is notably influenced by the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibiting the highest activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. In contrast, octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity, allow for the potential reconstruction to tetrahedral Ga cations, generating additional surface Lewis acid sites.

        The surface basic sites, however, are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to propane. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, suggesting its promotional effect in the early stages of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ indicate that the reduction of Ga cations occurs initially, benefiting dehydrogenation but only during the initial phase of the reaction. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

        The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, reducing the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

        Various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent, aiming to enhance its catalytic performance further.

        Looking ahead, the integrative understanding and prospective outlook section suggests several promising avenues for future research. These include exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies that could leverage the insights gained from the current study. Potential future directions might focus on:
        
        - Developing new catalyst designs that optimize the balance between acidity and basicity to enhance both activity and selectivity.
        - Enhancing the stability of Ga2O3 catalysts by modifying their structure or composition to reduce coke formation and improve longevity.
        - Investigating the synergistic effects of combining Ga2O3 with other catalysts or supports to achieve higher efficiency and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.
        - Utilizing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
        - Optimizing the reaction conditions and operating parameters to maximize the performance of Ga2O3 catalysts in practical applications.
        - Expanding the scope of the study to include a broader range of feedstocks and reaction conditions to broaden the applicability of Ga2O3 catalysts in industry.

        The insights provided herein offer a solid foundation for advancing the field of CO2-ODHP catalysis, particularly with respect to Ga2O3 polymorphs, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient chemical processes.

        在此深入分析中，不同镓（III）氧化物（Ga2O3）晶相（α-、β-、γ-、δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及路易斯酸中心在控制CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能方面扮演着至关重要的角色。具体而言，β- 和γ-Ga2O3 晶相在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性上表现出卓越性能，超越了α- 和δ-Ga2O3晶相。

        这些催化剂的初始活性受到表面酸密度的影响，β-Ga2O3晶相显示出最高活性。β- 和γ-Ga2O3晶相中的四面体Ga离子形成了可协调的Ga3+位点作为脱氢反应中的路易斯酸中心。相比之下，α- 和δ-Ga2O3晶相中的八面体Ga3+由于更强的配位和较弱的酸性，允许潜在地重建为四面体Ga离子，从而生成额外的表面路易斯酸位点。

        表面碱性位点不足以促进CO2吸附和活化，导致CO2转化率低于丙烷。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性呈正相关，表明其在反应早期阶段的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱还原性以及存在的Ga+和Ga3+表明，在反应初期Ga离子的还原发生，对脱氢有益但仅限于反应的初始阶段。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂进行，而没有红ox循环。

        丙烯的选择性受酸性和碱性的平衡影响，更强的酸性支持有利于丙烯生产，但会导致由于焦炭形成而缩短催化剂寿命。HZSM-48支持的Ga2O3催化剂相对于HZSM-5支持的催化剂，由于其较弱的酸性强度，降低了发生不希望的副反应如芳构化的风险，从而提高了丙烯选择性而不牺牲初始活性。这些催化剂的稳定性也受到孔结构的影响；具有单向孔结构的催化剂由于更易于接触的表面而具有较低的稳定性，导致焦炭沉积。

        已经开发了多种技术来调整Ga2O3的纹理特性，例如使用介孔碳作为硬模板的纳米铸造技术（131）和基于尿素的水热法使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的方法，以进一步提高其催化性能。

        展望未来，整合理解和前景展望部分提出了一些有前景的研究方向，旨在利用当前研究的见解推动该领域的进步。这些方向可能包括：
        
        - 设计新的催化剂设计，优化酸性和碱性的平衡，以增强活性和选择性。
        - 通过修改结构或组成来增强Ga2O3催化剂的稳定性，减少焦炭形成并延长使用寿命。
        - 探索结合Ga2O3与其他催化剂或支撑物的新组合，以实现更高的效率和选择性在CO2-ODHP反应中。
        - 利用先进的表征技术来深入了解反应机制和催化剂行为，尤其是在反应的初始和稳态阶段。
        - 优化反应条件和操作参数，以最大限度地提高Ga2O3催化剂在工业应用中的性能。
        - 扩大研究范围，包括更广泛的原料和反应条件，以扩大Ga2O3催化剂的应用范围。

        本研究提供的洞察为推进CO2-ODHP催化领域的研究提供了坚实的基础，特别是在涉及Ga2O3晶相方面，为更可持续和高效的化学过程开辟了道路。
