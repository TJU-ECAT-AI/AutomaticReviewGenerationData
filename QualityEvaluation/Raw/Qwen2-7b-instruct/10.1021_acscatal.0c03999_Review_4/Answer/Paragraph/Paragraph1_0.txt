        β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

        The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%.

        For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent.

        The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

        The structural characteristics, surface properties such as acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

        In the context of CO2-ODHP reactions, these factors influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) have distinct structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites that impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

        β-和γ-Ga2O3多晶在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面超越了α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸度密度按照β > γ > δ > α的顺序降低，表面碱性也呈现同样的趋势。初始活性取决于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3在此方面最大化活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体Ga离子产生未饱和的Ga3+位点，作为脱氢反应的Lewis酸中心。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+与较弱的酸性相联系，允许从八面体到四面体Ga离子的重建，生成表面Lewis酸位点。表面碱性位点不足以吸附和激活CO2，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱可还原性和存在的Ga+和Ga3+表明，在反应开始时Ga离子的还原发生，有利于脱氢（DHP），但仅在初始阶段有效。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而不涉及还原循环。纳米铸造技术和尿素基水热合成方法等方法已被开发用于调整Ga2O3的纹理性质，以增强其催化性能。

        理想的支撑应该是具有中孔尺寸和弱酸性的沸石。HZSM-48支持的催化剂在相似的丙烷转化率下的丙烯选择性高于HZSM-5支持的催化剂，由于它们的弱酸强度。它们的稳定性不如后者，归因于它们更多弱酸位点和一维孔结构。随着催化剂支持材料中Si/Al比的增加，活性下降而丙烯选择性表现出相反的趋势。Ga2O3/HZSM-48的Si/Al比例为130时，丙烯产率为22%最高。

        对DHP反应，已开发出多种方法来调节Ga2O3的纹理性质，如使用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米铸造技术和使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的尿素基水热合成方法。

        不同的Ga2O3多晶（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质，特别是酸度和碱性以及Lewis酸位点对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响。α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶显示出不同的反应性模式，这些模式由它们的晶体结构差异引起，影响Lewis酸位点的分布和可接近性。较高的酸度和碱性倾向于提高Ga2O3多晶的初始活性，加快反应速率。然而，这种增加的活性可能导致更高的焦炭形成，随后使催化剂失效。丙烯的选择性受到酸度和碱性之间的平衡的影响，更酸性的支撑有利于丙烯生产，但由于焦炭形成导致催化剂寿命缩短。这些催化剂的稳定性也受到孔几何形状的影响；具有单维孔结构的催化剂倾向于因焦炭沉积的易接近表面而具有较低的稳定性。

        不同Ga2O3多晶的结构特征、表面性质如酸度和碱性影响CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。α-Ga2O3通过特定的Lewis酸位点有效地促进了氧化脱氢过程，显示出了最高的活性。β-Ga2O3因其独特的表面性质而在产品形成上优于副产品的形成，表现出更好的选择性。γ-Ga2O3在反应条件下表现出稳定性，适用于工业应用的长期使用。最后，δ-Ga2O3显示出适度的催化性能，受其酸度和碱性之间的平衡影响。

        在CO2-ODHP反应的背景下，这些因素影响反应动力学和产物选择性。不同Ga2O3多晶（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）具有不同的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位点，影响CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机制涉及催化剂表面与反应物之间在初始和稳态阶段的特定相互作用。

        整合理解和前瞻视角：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究可能侧重于：
        
        1. 通过优化表面性质和Lewis酸位点来提高Ga2O3多晶的稳定性和选择性，用于CO2-ODHP反应。
        2. 开发改进与Ga2O3催化剂交互能力的新支撑材料，以增强其性能和使用寿命。
