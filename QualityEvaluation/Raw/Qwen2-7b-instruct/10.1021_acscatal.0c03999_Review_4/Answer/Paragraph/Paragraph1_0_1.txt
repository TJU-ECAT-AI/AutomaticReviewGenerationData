        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019], [10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134], and [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017]. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in carbon dioxide (CO2)-olefinic double bond hydrogenation peroxide (ODHP) reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity, respectively. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, paralleling the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral gallium (Ga) cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to propane. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

        The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. Zeolite-supported catalysts, specifically HZSM-48, exhibit higher selectivities to propene than their HZSM-5 counterparts at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. However, HZSM-48-supported catalysts have poorer stability compared to HZSM-5-supported ones, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of the catalyst support, while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with a Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%, highlighting the effectiveness of HZSM-48 in promoting propene selectivity without compromising initial activity.

        Different Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The dehydrogenation reaction of propane in the presence of CO2 does not suppress coke deposition.

        The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs play a crucial role in their catalytic performance. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.
