        The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

        不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-, β-, γ-, 和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂性能产生了显著影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶相在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸密度按照β > γ > δ > α的顺序减少，表面碱性也呈现相似趋势。初始活性取决于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3达到最大活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体Ga离子产生未饱和Ga3+位点作为脱氢反应的Lewis酸中心。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+由于较弱的酸性而与较少的配位结合，允许从八面体到四面体Ga离子的潜在重建，从而在表面上生成Lewis酸位点。表面碱性位点不足以吸附和激活CO2，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性呈正相关，表明其在反应初期的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱还原性及存在Ga+和Ga3+表明Ga离子的还原发生在反应开始阶段，有利于脱氢(DHP)，但仅在初始阶段有效。在稳定态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂进行，而无需循环氧化还原过程。通过纳米铸造和尿素基水热法等技术调整Ga2O3的纹理性质，可以增强其催化性能。
