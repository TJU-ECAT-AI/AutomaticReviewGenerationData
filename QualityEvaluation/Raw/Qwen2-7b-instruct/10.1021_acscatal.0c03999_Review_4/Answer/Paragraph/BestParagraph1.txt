        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019\], \[10.1021/cm902015f\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017\]. 

        β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

        The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%.

        Various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent.

        At steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.

        For the DHP reaction, the structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.
        
        The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction.
        
        In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air, mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance. In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition.
