        The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different gallium(III) oxide (Ga2O3) polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) play a pivotal role in their catalytic performance for carbon dioxide (CO2)-mediated olefinic double bond hydrogenation (ODHP) reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs demonstrate superior performance in terms of propane conversion (C3H8) and cyclohexene selectivity (C3H6) compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, paralleling the surface basicity pattern. The initial catalytic activity is closely tied to the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 achieving the highest activity. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedrally coordinated gallium (Ga) cations, providing sites for Lewis acid interactions that facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Octahedrally coordinated Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3, which are less acidic, allow for the potential reconstruction to tetrahedral Ga cations, introducing additional surface Lewis acid sites. The scarcity of surface basic sites limits CO2 adsorption and activation, resulting in lower CO2 conversion relative to C3H8. The density of surface basic sites correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect during the onset of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the coexistence of Ga+ and Ga3+ ions in the catalysts suggest that Ga cation reduction occurs primarily at the beginning of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via a heterolytic dissociation mechanism on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

        Various methods have been developed to fine-tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as nanocasting with mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method utilizing polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent, to enhance its catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are influenced by these factors. For instance, higher selectivity to propene is observed over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The initial conversion of propane over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is slightly lower than Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process, mesoporous materials deactivate more slowly than Ga2O3-t. The acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a critical role in the catalytic performance. The uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution in Ga2O3m contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene. The dehydrogenation reaction of propane in the presence of CO2 does not suppress coke deposition.

        Looking ahead, the investigation of emerging fields and innovative methodologies offers promising avenues for future research. Potential directions include exploring the synergistic effects of combining Ga2O3 with other catalysts or supports, developing new synthesis routes to tailor the surface properties, and investigating the influence of operational parameters such as temperature and pressure on catalytic performance. The integration of machine learning and advanced characterization techniques could also provide deeper insights into the structure-property-performance relationships, guiding the rational design of next-generation catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

        在碳二氧（CO2）介导的烯键双键氢化（ODHP）反应中，不同镓（III）氧化物（Ga2O3）晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心对催化性能的影响至关重要。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶型在丙烷转化（C3H8）和环己烯选择性（C3H6）方面表现出优于α-和δ-Ga2O3的性能。表面酸密度按照β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，表面碱性也呈现相似趋势。初始催化活性与表面酸密度紧密相关，β-Ga2O3实现最高活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3均含有四面体配合的镓（Ga）离子，提供Lewis酸位点，促进氧化脱氢过程。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体配合Ga3+，酸性较弱，允许潜在的向四面体Ga原子重建，引入额外的表面Lewis酸位点。表面碱性位点的稀缺限制了CO2吸附和活化，导致CO2转化效率低于C3H8。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性呈正相关，表明其在反应初期具有促进作用。Ga2O3的弱可还原性和共存的Ga+和Ga3+离子表明，Ga原子的还原主要发生在反应初期，有利于脱氢，但仅在初始阶段有效。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂机制进行，不涉及氧化还原循环。

        已开发了多种方法来调整Ga2O3的结构特性，如利用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米成型技术（131）和基于尿素的水热法使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂，以增强其CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。

        不同Ga2O3晶型的结构特性、表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位点显著影响其CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机制涉及催化剂表面与反应物之间的特定相互作用，在反应的初始和稳态阶段都起作用。例如，α-和β-Ga2O3相比δ-和γ-Ga2O3，表现出更高的丙烯选择性。丙烷在Ga2O3m和Ga2O3Al2O3材料上的初始转化率略低，但在DHP-CO2过程中，多孔材料的失活速度比Ga2O3-t慢。由Ga2O3的相组成或支撑材料的性质决定的酸性，在催化性能中起着关键作用。Ga2O3m的均匀多孔结构与孔径分布的高阶顺序相结合，提高了丙烯的选择性。在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应并未抑制焦炭沉积。

        展望未来，探索新兴领域和创新方法提供了极具潜力的研究方向。可能的方向包括研究Ga2O3与其他催化剂或支持物的协同效应、开发新的合成路线以定制表面性质，并调查操作参数如温度和压力对催化性能的影响。机器学习和高级表征技术的集成也可以提供更深入的见解，指导下一代催化剂的设计，用于CO2-ODHP反应。
