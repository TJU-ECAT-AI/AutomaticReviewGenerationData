        The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.
        
        The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. Their stability is not as good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with a Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%.
        
        Different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) have distinct structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites that impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.
        
        The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism. Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites. For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent.
        
        In summary, the structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors affect reaction kinetics and product selectivity, explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity through specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are complex, involving the unique Lewis acid sites of Ga2O3 polymorphs, the role of acidity and basicity in promoting or inhibiting catalytic activity, and the impact of surface properties on product selectivity. Understanding and optimizing these interactions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective Ga2O3-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.
        
        Looking ahead, there is potential for further exploration in this field. Future research might focus on refining the synthesis methods to tailor the surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs for improved catalytic performance. It could also investigate the integration of Ga2O3 catalysts with other materials to create hybrid systems that combine the strengths of multiple components. Additionally, the study of the dynamic behavior of Ga2O3 catalysts under real-world operating conditions could provide insights into their durability and stability. The development of advanced modeling tools to predict the catalytic performance based on the structural and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs would also be valuable for guiding the design of new catalysts.

        不同的Ga2O3晶系（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能受到其结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位的影响。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶系在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面表现出色。表面酸密度按照β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，表面碱性也呈现同样的趋势。初始活性取决于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3在此方面达到最大值。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体镓离子创造了不饱和的Ga3+位点，作为脱氢反应的Lewis酸位。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+由于较弱的酸性而与更多的酸性更强的位点结合，允许从八面体到四面体的Ga离子重建，从而在表面上生成Lewis酸位。表面碱性位点不足以吸附和活化二氧化碳，导致二氧化碳的转化率低于丙烷。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性呈正相关，表明其在反应初期对催化性能具有促进作用。Ga2O3的弱还原性以及存在Ga+和Ga3+（XPS）表明，Ga离子的还原仅发生在反应开始阶段，有利于脱氢（DHP），但仅在反应的初期有效。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解途径进行，而不涉及氧化还原循环。已开发了多种方法来调整Ga2O3的微观结构特性，如使用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米铸造技术以及使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的尿素基水热法。

        最理想的支撑材料应是具有中等孔径和弱酸性的沸石。HZSM-48支持的催化剂在相似的丙烷转化率下展现出对丙烯更高的选择性，这是由于它们较弱的酸强度。这些催化剂的稳定性不如后者，因为它们的酸位点更多且为单向孔结构。随着催化剂支持体Si/Al比的增加，活性降低，而丙烯选择性则出现相反的趋势。Ga2O3/HZSM-48的Si/Al比为130时，丙烯产率为22%。

        α-Ga2O3、β-Ga2O3、γ-Ga2O3和δ-Ga2O3具有不同的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位，影响它们在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。α-Ga2O3表现出最高活性，因为它通过特定的Lewis酸位高效促进了氧化脱氢过程。β-Ga2O3在形成所需产品而非副产品的选择性上表现更好，这得益于其独特的表面性质。γ-Ga2O3在反应条件下表现出稳定性，适合工业应用的长期使用。最后，δ-Ga2O3的催化性能适中，受酸性和碱性的平衡影响。

        碳酸盐与丙烷在存在下的脱氢反应可能通过异裂解途径而不是氧化还原机制进行。对于脱氢反应，不同压力下脉冲反应和脱氢反应的结果表明，二氧化碳在催化剂表面通过逆水煤气变换反应移除吸附的H2发挥着两方面的作用：一方面，它通过逆水煤气变换反应移除了吸附的H2；另一方面，它通过置换在催化剂碱性位点上吸附的丙烷，对催化性能产生负面影响。对于DHP反应，已开发了多种方法来调整Ga2O3的微观结构特性，如使用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米铸造技术和使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的尿素基水热法。

        总之，不同Ga2O3晶系的结构特征、表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位显著影响其二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应的催化性能。这些因素影响反应动力学和产物选择性，解释了观察到的活性趋势和选择性，通过催化剂表面与反应物之间的特定相互作用。这些相互作用的机制复杂，涉及Ga2O3晶系的独特Lewis酸位、酸性和碱性对催化活性的促进或抑制作用，以及表面性质对产物选择性的影响。深入了解并优化这些相互作用可以推动二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中更高效和选择性Ga2O3基催化剂的发展。

        展望未来，该领域还有进一步探索的潜力。未来的研究可能专注于改进合成方法以定制Ga2O3晶系的表面性质，以提高催化性能。也可以研究将Ga2O3催化剂与其他材料集成，形成结合多种组件优势的复合系统。此外，研究Ga2O3催化剂在实际运行条件下的动态行为可以提供关于其耐用性和稳定性的见解。开发先进的建模工具来预测基于Ga2O3晶系的结构和表面性质的催化性能，将有助于指导新催化剂的设计。
