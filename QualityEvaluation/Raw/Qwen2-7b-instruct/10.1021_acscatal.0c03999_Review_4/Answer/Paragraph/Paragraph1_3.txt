        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019], [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017], [10.1021/cm902015f], and others. 

        The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

        The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. Their stability is not as good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%.

        Different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) have distinct structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites that impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-Ga2O3 polymorph showed the highest activity due to its specific Lewis acid sites which promote the oxidative dehydrogenation process efficiently. β-Ga2O3, on the other hand, displayed better selectivity towards the desired product thanks to its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 was noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it suitable for prolonged use in industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

        In the context of CO2-ODHP reactions, these factors influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
        
        Various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent.
        
        At steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle.
        
        For the DHP reaction, the structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.
        
        The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. The surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction.
        
        In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air, mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance. In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition.

        不同的Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶型在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面超过α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸度密度按照β>γ>δ>α的顺序递减，表面碱性也是如此。初始活性依赖于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3最大化这一活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体Ga离子创建了未配位的Ga3+位点，作为脱氢反应的Lewis酸位点。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+与较弱的酸性更协调，允许从八面体到四面体Ga离子的重建，产生表面Lewis酸位点。表面碱性位点不足以吸附和激活CO2，导致CO2转化率低于丙烷。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱还原性以及存在的Ga+和Ga3+表明Ga离子的还原发生在反应开始阶段，有利于脱氢（DHP）但仅在初始阶段有效。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，没有红氧化循环。已经开发了多种方法来调整Ga2O3的结构特性，如使用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米成型技术（131）和基于尿素的水热法使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂。

        理想的支撑应该是具有中等孔径和弱酸性的沸石。HZSM-48支持的催化剂在相似的丙烷转化率下对丙烯的选择性高于HZSM-5支持的催化剂，由于它们的弱酸强度。它们的稳定性不如后者，因为它们有更多的弱酸位点和一维孔结构。随着催化剂支持物Si/Al比的增加，活性降低，而丙烯选择性则相反趋势。Ga2O3/HZSM-48在Si/Al比为130时具有最佳的丙烯产率为22%。

        不同的Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）具有不同的结构特征、表面性质，以及Lewis酸位点，这些因素影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。α-Ga2O3晶型显示出最高活性，因为它通过特定的Lewis酸位点有效地促进了氧化脱氢过程。相比之下，β-Ga2O3表现出更好的产品选择性，这归因于其独特的表面性质，使其在形成产品时优于副产品。γ-Ga2O3在反应条件下表现出稳定性，适合工业应用的长期使用。最后，δ-Ga2O3显示适度的催化性能，受其酸性和碱性的平衡影响。

        在每个周期内，丙烯产量逐渐下降，原因是结焦。然而，在短时间的空气再生后，多孔Ga2O3m几乎完全恢复其催化性能。在丙烷存在CO2的脱氢过程中，Boudouard反应（C结焦+CO2=2CO）不会抑制结焦沉积。
