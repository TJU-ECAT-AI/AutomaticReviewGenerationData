            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019], [10.1021/cm902015f], and [10.1021/acscatal.9b02284]. 

            The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

            The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with a Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%.

            Different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) have distinct structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites that impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

            The structural characteristics, surface properties including acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors affect reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

            In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent.

            依据[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4]的深入研究。从[10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019]、[10.1021/cm902015f]和[10.1021/acscatal.9b02284]整合的理解。

            不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-、δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶相在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面超越了α-和δ-Ga2O3。表面酸密度按顺序递减为β > γ > δ > α，表面碱性也是如此。初始活性依赖于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3最大化这一活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体Ga离子产生未饱和的Ga3+位点，作为脱氢反应的Lewis酸位点。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+与较弱的酸性更协调，允许潜在地从八面体到四面体Ga离子的重建，从而在表面生成Lewis酸位点。表面碱性位点不足以吸附CO2并激活，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。表面碱性位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱还原性及其存在Ga+和Ga3+表明，Ga离子的还原发生在反应初期，有利于脱氢（DHP）但仅在初始阶段。

            最佳支持应该是具有中等孔径和弱酸性的沸石。HZSM-48支持的催化剂在相似的丙烷转化率下对丙烯的选择性更高，由于其弱酸强度。它们的稳定性不如后者，因为它们有更多弱酸位点和一维孔结构。随着催化剂支持物Si/Al比例的增加，活性降低，而丙烯选择性表现出相反的趋势。Ga2O3/HZSM-48的Si/Al比为130时，丙烯产量最佳，达到22%。

            不同的Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-、δ-）具有不同的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位点，这些因素影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。这些因素影响反应动力学和产物选择性。解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机制涉及催化剂表面与反应物之间的特定相互作用，在反应的初始和稳态阶段。

            在丙烷在CO2存在的条件下进行脱氢时，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而没有氧化还原循环。开发了多种方法来调整Ga2O3的纹理性质，例如使用多孔碳作为硬模板的纳米成型技术以及使用聚乙二醇作为软模板剂的尿素基水热法。
