        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019], [10.1021/acscatal.9b02284], [10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134], [10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017], [10.1021/cm902015f], and others. The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance. The structural characteristics, surface properties, particularly acidity and basicity, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. These factors affect reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend. Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%. In the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, the reaction of Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition.

        根据参考文献[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_4]的深入分析，综合了来自文献[10.1016/j.catcom.2013.01.019]、[10.1021/acscatal.9b02284]、[10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134]、[10.1016/j.jcat.2006.02.017]、[10.1021/cm902015f]等的信息。不同Ga2O3晶系（α-、β-、γ-、δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（尤其是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸位点显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现出优势。表面酸度密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序降低，表面碱性也是如此。初始活性取决于表面酸度密度，β-Ga2O3最大化这一活性。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体Ga离子形成不饱和Ga3+位点作为脱氢反应的Lewis酸位。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+与较弱的酸性连接，允许从八面体到四面体的Ga离子重建，产生表面Lewis酸位。表面碱性位点不足以吸附和激活CO2，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。表面碱基位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应初期的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱可还原性和存在Ga+和Ga3+表明，Ga离子的还原发生在反应开始阶段，有利于脱氢（DHP），但仅在反应初期有效。稳定状态时，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂进行，而没有发生循环还原。纳米成型和基于尿素的水热法等技术被用于调整Ga2O3的纹理性质，以增强其催化性能。
