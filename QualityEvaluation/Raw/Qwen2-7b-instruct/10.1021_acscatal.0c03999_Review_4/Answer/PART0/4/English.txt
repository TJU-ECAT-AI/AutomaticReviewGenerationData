The acidity and surface properties of the catalysts play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the dehydrogenation of propane. As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-48 support increases, the acidity of the catalyst decreases, leading to a reduction in activity. However, the selectivity towards propene increases at lower propane conversions. This is attributed to the suppression of side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization due to the weaker acidity of the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts. During the reaction, the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts exhibit lower stability compared to Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts, which can be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The addition of CO2 to the reaction improves the stability of the catalysts by eliminating coke through the Boudouard reaction and promoting the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface.
