[1] "The catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation over HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was investigated, and compared with that of HZSM-5 supported ones."
          [2] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
          [3] "However, the selectivity to propene is not high enough because of the aromatization of propene during the dehydrogenation."
          [4] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
          [5] "The initial activity of supported catalysts decreases with increasing the Si/Al ratio of ZSM-48, while the propene selectivity shows an opposite tendency."
          [6] "Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 shows the best propene yield of 22.2%."
          [7] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5, especially at low propane conversion, due to its weaker acidity."
          [8] "However, the stability on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with Ga2O3/ HZSM-5, which may be caused by its abundant weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structure."

[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [2] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
          [3] "Dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600 C;the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3."
          [4] "The conversion of CO2 in reactions (1) and (2) can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 before and after the reaction."
          [5] "CO2 pulse reaction was also applied for further research."
          [6] "The H2 and propane chemisorption capacity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured;the results are given in Tables 7 and 8."
          [7] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton increases propane dehydrogenation activity by replacing the slow step (5) by the fast equilibria (7) and (8)."
          [8] "When CO2 is introduced into the propane dehydrogenation reaction, chemisorbed H2 formed from steps (5) and (7) can also be removed via an alternative route (9) (i.e., the reverse water-gas shift reaction), besides step (6):"
          [9] "For Ga2O3/SiO2, because activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction is very low, it would be difficult for CO2 to react with the chemisorbed H2 over Ga2O3/SiO2, and thus a positive effect of CO2 would not be observed."
