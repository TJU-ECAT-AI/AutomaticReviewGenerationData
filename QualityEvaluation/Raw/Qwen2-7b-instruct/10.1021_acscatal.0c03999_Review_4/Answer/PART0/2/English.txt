In the DHP-CO2 process over Ga-containing materials, the selectivity to propene depends on two factors: the acidity, which can be determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, and the density of acid sites and the initial yield of propene. An increase in the amount of coke deposited during the DHP-CO2 process is observed when the density of acid sites and initial yield of propene are raised. Higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m may be attributed to its uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution. Propene is the primary product formed at all studied temperatures, accompanied by the production of light hydrocarbons and small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. This weak acidity helps suppress the aromatization of propene during the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher selectivity for propene. However, the stability of these catalysts is lower compared to HZSM-5 supported ones, which might be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures.

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective. CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: positively removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst. The dehydrogenation reaction can be estimated by measuring the conversion of CO2 before and after the reaction. CO2 pulse reactions were conducted for further study. The capacity for H2 and propane chemisorption was measured, and the results are presented in Tables 7 and 8. The presence of gallium oxide and protons enhances dehydrogenation activity by replacing the slow step (5) with faster equilibria (7) and (8). When CO2 is introduced into the dehydrogenation reaction, chemisorbed H2 can be removed via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, in addition to step (6). For Ga2O3/SiO2, the low activity of the reverse water-gas shift reaction makes it challenging for CO2 to react with chemisorbed H2 over this catalyst, resulting in no positive effect of CO2.

The literature does not provide specific information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Nor does it propose mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.
