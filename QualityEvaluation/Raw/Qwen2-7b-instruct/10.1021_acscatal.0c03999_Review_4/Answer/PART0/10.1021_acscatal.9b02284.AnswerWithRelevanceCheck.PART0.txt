          [1] "The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) have significant influences on their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions."
          [2] "The α-Ga2O3 polymorph showed the highest activity due to its specific Lewis acid sites which promote the oxidative dehydrogenation process efficiently."
          [3] "β-Ga2O3, on the other hand, displayed better selectivity towards the desired product thanks to its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts."
          [4] "γ-Ga2O3 was noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it suitable for prolonged use in industrial applications."
          [5] "δ-Ga2O3 was found to have a moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

          不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性），以及Lewis酸中心，对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能有显著影响。α-Ga2O3显示出最高活性，因为其通过特定的Lewis酸中心有效促进了氧化脱氢过程。另一方面，β-Ga2O3因其独特的表面性质而显示出对目标产物更好的选择性，这些性质有利于形成产物而非副产品。γ-Ga2O3以其在反应条件下的稳定性而被注意到，使其适合工业应用中的长期使用。最后，δ-Ga2O2的催化性能适中，受到其酸性和碱性之间平衡的影响。
