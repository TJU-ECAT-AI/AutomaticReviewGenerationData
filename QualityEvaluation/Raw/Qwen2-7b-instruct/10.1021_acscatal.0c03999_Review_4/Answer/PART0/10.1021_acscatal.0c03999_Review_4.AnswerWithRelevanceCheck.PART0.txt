          [1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
          [2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
          [3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
          [4] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
          [5] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
          [6] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
          [7] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."
          [8] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
          [9] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle."
          [10] "For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

          不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）以及Lewis酸中心影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3晶相在C3H8转化率和C3H6选择性方面表现更优。表面酸性密度按照顺序递减为β > γ > δ > α，表面碱性亦然。初始活性依赖于表面酸性密度，β-Ga2O3在此时达到最大值。β-和γ-Ga2O3结构中的四面体Ga原子创造了配位不饱和的Ga3+位点，作为Lewis酸中心促进脱氢反应。α-和δ-Ga2O3中的八面体Ga3+位点与较弱的酸性更协调，允许从八面体到四面体Ga原子的重构，产生表面Lewis酸位点。表面碱性位点不足于吸附和激活CO2，导致CO2转化率低于C3H8。表面碱基位点密度与初始活性相关，表明其在反应早期的促进作用。Ga2O3的弱可还原性和催化剂中存在的Ga+和Ga3+表明，Ga原子的还原仅发生在反应的初始阶段，对脱氢（DHP）有利，但仅限于初始阶段。在稳态下，反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解进行，而不涉及红氧化循环。纳米铸造技术和基于尿素的水热方法等方法已被用于调整Ga2O3的纹理特性，以提高其催化性能。
