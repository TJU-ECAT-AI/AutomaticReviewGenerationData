          [1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [2] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
          [3] "Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
          [4] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High activity is observed in catalysts with abundant medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2, compared to ineffective catalysts like Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but diminish those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

          不同Ga2O3晶相（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸性和碱性）及其路易斯酸中心影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。表面富含中强酸性位点的催化剂，如Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2表现出高活性，相比之下，像Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO这样的催化剂则效果较差。二氧化碳（CO2）可以增强Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但减弱Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3的活性。脱氢反应可能通过异裂解途径进行，而不是还原氧化机制。

          [2] "Results of pulse reaction and the H2 and propane chemisorptions indicate that two contrary roles of CO2 exist in the reaction: the positive role of removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the negative role of displacing the propane adsorbed on basic sites of catalyst."
          [3] "Dehydrogenation of propane was also run over the supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2 at 600 C;the reaction data are summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 3."
          [4] "The conversion of CO2 in reactions (1) and (2) can be estimated from the amount of CO and CO2 before and after the reaction."
          [5] "CO2 pulse reaction was also applied for further research."
          [6] "The H2 and propane chemisorption capacity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured;the results are given in Tables 7 and 8."
          [7] "The conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton increases propane dehydrogenation activity by replacing the slow step (5) by the fast equilibria (7) and (8)."
          [8] "When CO2 is introduced into the propane dehydrogenation reaction, chemisorbed H2 formed from steps (5) and (7) can also be removed via an alternative route (9) (i.e., the reverse water-gas shift reaction), besides step (6):"
          [9] "For Ga2O3/SiO2, because activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction is very low, it would be difficult for CO2 to react with the chemisorbed H2 over Ga2O3/SiO2, and thus a positive effect of CO2 would not be observed."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit high activity, while Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO are ineffective. CO2 plays dual roles in the reaction: positively removing dissociatively adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and negatively displacing propane adsorbed on basic sites of the catalyst. The dehydrogenation reaction can be estimated by measuring the conversion of CO2 before and after the reaction. CO2 pulse reactions were conducted for further study. The capacity for H2 and propane chemisorption was measured, and the results are presented in Tables 7 and 8. The presence of gallium oxide and protons enhances dehydrogenation activity by replacing the slow step (5) with faster equilibria (7) and (8). When CO2 is introduced into the dehydrogenation reaction, chemisorbed H2 can be removed via the reverse water-gas shift reaction, in addition to step (6). For Ga2O3/SiO2, the low activity of the reverse water-gas shift reaction makes it challenging for CO2 to react with chemisorbed H2 over this catalyst, resulting in no positive effect of CO2.

          不同Ga2O3晶相的结构特征、表面性质及路易斯酸中心影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂表现出高活性，而Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO则无效。二氧化碳在反应中扮演双重角色：通过逆水煤气转换反应移除催化剂表面吸附的离解氢，正面作用；以及通过基本位点置换丙烷，负面作用。可以通过测量反应前后CO2的转化率来估算脱氢反应。进行了二氧化碳脉冲反应以进一步研究。测量了H2和丙烷的化学吸附能力，并将结果给出在表7和表8中。镓氧化物和质子的存在通过将慢步骤（5）替换为更快的平衡（7）和（8）来增强脱氢活性。当二氧化碳被引入脱氢反应时，可以通过逆水煤气转换反应去除化学吸附的H2，除了步骤（6）。对于Ga2O3/SiO2，逆水煤气转换反应的低活性使得二氧化碳难以与该催化剂上的化学吸附的H2反应，因此观察不到二氧化碳的正面影响。

          [1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence or presence of CO2 over five supported gallium oxide catalysts was investigated, and distinct behaviors were observed."
          [2] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 are better catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, because they contain many more acid sites of medium to strong and strong strength on the surface."
          [3] "CO2 has a promoting effect on dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but a negative effect over Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
          [4] "These different support effects may derive from the catalysts differing H2 adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, probably caused by the differing interactions between the gallium oxide and the support."
          [5] "XPS studies showed abundant reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, which may account for this catalyst’s unique catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2."

          The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over five supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2, revealing distinct behaviors. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are superior to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, as they have a higher density of medium to strong acid sites on their surfaces. CO2 enhances dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but has a negative impact on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These differing effects might be attributed to differences in the catalysts' hydrogen adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, possibly resulting from the varied interactions between gallium oxide and the support material. XPS analysis indicated a high concentration of reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, which could explain its unique catalytic behavior in dehydrogenation reactions with CO2 present.

          在存在或不存在二氧化碳的情况下，对五种支持的镓氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢为丙烯进行了研究，观察到了不同的行为。Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂优于Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO，因为它们表面具有更高密度的中到强酸中心。二氧化碳可以增强Ga2O3/TiO2的脱氢活性，但对Ga2O3/ZrO2和Ga2O3/Al2O3有负面影响。这些不同的影响可能源自催化剂的氢吸附能力差异和酸碱性质差异，这可能是由于镓氧化物与支持材料之间不同相互作用的结果。XPS分析表明，Ga2O3/TiO2表面有高浓度的还原镓原子（45%），这可以解释该催化剂在存在二氧化碳下的独特催化行为。
