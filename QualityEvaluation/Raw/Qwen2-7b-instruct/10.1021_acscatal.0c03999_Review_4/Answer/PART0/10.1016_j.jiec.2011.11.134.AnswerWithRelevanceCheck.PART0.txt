          [1] "The ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."
          [2] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."
          [3] "Their stability is not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures."
          [4] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."
          [5] "Ga2O3/HZSM-48 with Si/Al ratio of 130 has the best propene yield of 22%. HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, which reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising too much on initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

          不同Ga2O3晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特性和表面性质，特别是酸性和碱性，以及Lewis酸位点，对CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能产生显著影响。α-, β-, γ-, δ-Ga2O3晶型由于其晶体结构的不同，导致Lewis酸位点分布和可接近性的差异，从而影响反应活性。更高的酸性和碱性倾向于增强Ga2O3晶型的初始活性，加快反应速率。然而，这种增加的活性可能导致更多的焦炭形成，进而使催化剂失活。丙烯选择性受到酸性和碱性平衡的影响，更酸性的支持物有利于丙烯生成，但可能因焦炭形成而缩短催化剂寿命。HZSM-48支持的Ga2O3催化剂相对于HZSM-5支持的催化剂具有较高的丙烯选择性，这是由于前者较弱的酸强度，减少了不希望的副反应如芳构化，从而提高了丙烯选择性而不牺牲太多的初始活性。这些催化剂的稳定性也受到孔结构的影响；具有单向孔结构的催化剂的稳定性较低，因为更容易出现焦炭沉积于表面。

          The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. This weak acidity helps suppress the aromatization of propene during the dehydrogenation process, leading to a higher selectivity for propene. However, the stability of these catalysts is lower compared to HZSM-5 supported ones, which might be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures.

          [1] "Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 based catalysts are found to be more efficient than others in this reaction [39]."
          [2] "HZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19],is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."
          [3] "The activity of the HZSM-48 supported Ga2O3 catalysts decreased sharply with the increase of Si/Al ratio of the support, which is in agreement with NH3-TPD results."
          [4] "As a consequence, the initial propylene yield has the sequence of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) > Ga2O3/HZSM-48(160) > Ga2O3/HZSM-48(220)."
          [5] "However, the selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."
          [6] "The lower stability of Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) may also be caused by its uninterpenetrating linear channels, which is easier to be blocked by the coke deposition during the reactions."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit distinct reactivity and selectivity profiles, primarily influenced by their acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites. For instance, the acidic nature of Ga2O3 facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the basic sites can promote unwanted side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its unique Lewis acid sites, demonstrates enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, leading to improved propene yields and selectivity compared to other polymorphs. However, its stability is compromised due to its unidimensional pore structure, which facilitates coke deposition, hindering long-term catalytic performance.

          The acidity and surface properties of the catalysts play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of the dehydrogenation of propane. As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-48 support increases, the acidity of the catalyst decreases, leading to a reduction in activity. However, the selectivity towards propene increases at lower propane conversions. This is attributed to the suppression of side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization due to the weaker acidity of the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts. During the reaction, the Ga2O3/HZSM-48 catalysts exhibit lower stability compared to Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts, which can be attributed to their abundance of weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures. The addition of CO2 to the reaction improves the stability of the catalysts by eliminating coke through the Boudouard reaction and promoting the desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface.

          酸性和表面性质对丙烷脱氢反应催化剂的性能至关重要。随着HZSM-48支持物中Si/Al比的增加，催化剂的酸性降低，导致活性下降。然而，在较低的丙烷转化率下，丙烯的选择性增加。这归因于由于Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的弱酸性抑制了副反应，如聚合、环化和芳构化。在反应过程中，Ga2O3/HZSM-48催化剂的稳定性低于Ga2O3/HZSM-5催化剂，这可能归因于它们丰富的弱酸位点和一维孔结构。向反应中添加CO2可以改善催化剂的稳定性，通过Boudouard反应消除焦炭，并促进丙烯从催化剂表面的脱附。
