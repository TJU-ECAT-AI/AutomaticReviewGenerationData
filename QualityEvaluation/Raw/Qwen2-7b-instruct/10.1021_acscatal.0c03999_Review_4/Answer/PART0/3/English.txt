The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit distinct reactivity and selectivity profiles, primarily influenced by their acidity, basicity, and Lewis acid sites. For instance, the acidic nature of Ga2O3 facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the basic sites can promote unwanted side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization. The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, with its unique Lewis acid sites, demonstrates enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, leading to improved propene yields and selectivity compared to other polymorphs. However, its stability is compromised due to its unidimensional pore structure, which facilitates coke deposition, hindering long-term catalytic performance.

The dehydrogenation of propane to propene was studied over five supported gallium oxide catalysts in the presence or absence of CO2, revealing distinct behaviors. Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts are superior to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, as they have a higher density of medium to strong acid sites on their surfaces. CO2 enhances dehydrogenation activity over Ga2O3/TiO2 but has a negative impact on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. These differing effects might be attributed to differences in the catalysts' hydrogen adsorption capacities and acid-base properties, possibly resulting from the varied interactions between gallium oxide and the support material. XPS analysis indicated a high concentration of reduced gallium atoms (45%) on the surface of Ga2O3/TiO2, which could explain its unique catalytic behavior in dehydrogenation reactions with CO2 present.
