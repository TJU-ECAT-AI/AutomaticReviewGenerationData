[1] "Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity, and Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO were ineffective catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane."
          [2] "The high dehydrogenation activities are connected with the abundant medium-strong acid sites on the catalyst surface."
          [3] "Carbon dioxide can promote the catalytic dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but suppress those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3."
          [4] "Results for the pulse reaction and dehydrogenation reaction with varying partial pressures of CO2 indicate that CO2 plays two roles in the dehydrogenation reaction: a positive role by removing absorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse watergas shift reaction and a negative role by displacing propane adsorbed on the catalysts basic sites."

[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5)."
          [2] "Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."
          [3] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3."
          [4] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."
          [5] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."
          [6] "On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8."
          [7] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."
          [8] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."
          [9] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle."
          [10] "For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent."

"[1] Over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conversion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated more slowly than Ga2O3-t."
          "[2] For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3."
          "[3] We suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."
          "[4] The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support."
          "[5] In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous Ga2O3m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance."

          [2] "The α-Ga2O3 polymorph showed the highest activity due to its specific Lewis acid sites which promote the oxidative dehydrogenation process efficiently."
          [3] "β-Ga2O3, on the other hand, displayed better selectivity towards the desired product thanks to its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts."
          [4] "γ-Ga2O3 was noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it suitable for prolonged use in industrial applications."
          [5] "δ-Ga2O3 was found to have a moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity."
