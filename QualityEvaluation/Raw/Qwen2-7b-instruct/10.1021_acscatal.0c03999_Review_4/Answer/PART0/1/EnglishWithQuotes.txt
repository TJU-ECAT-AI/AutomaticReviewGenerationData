The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained through these factors. For instance, higher selectivity to propene is observed over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The initial conversion of propane over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is slightly lower than Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process, mesoporous materials deactivate more slowly than Ga2O3-t. The acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Additionally, the uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution in Ga2O3m contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene.

Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, which reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising too much on initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134"},
