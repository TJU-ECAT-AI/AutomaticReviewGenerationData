The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites. Surface basic sites are insufficient for CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to lower CO2 conversion compared to C3H8. The surface base site density correlates with initial activity, indicating its promotional effect in the beginning of the reaction. The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained through these factors. For instance, higher selectivity to propene is observed over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The initial conversion of propane over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is slightly lower than Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process, mesoporous materials deactivate more slowly than Ga2O3-t. The acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Additionally, the uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution in Ga2O3m contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene. The dehydrogenation reaction of propane in the presence of CO2 does not suppress coke deposition.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, which reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising too much on initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but diminish those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

The weak reducibility of Ga2O3 and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ suggest that the reduction of Ga cations happens at the start of the reaction, benefiting dehydrogenation (DHP) but only during the initial phase. At steady state, the reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle. Methods like nanocasting and urea-based hydrothermal processes have been used to adjust the textural properties of Ga2O3, enhancing its catalytic performance.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction are explained through these factors. For instance, higher selectivity to propene is observed over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The initial conversion of propane over Ga2O3m and Ga2O3Al2O3 materials is slightly lower than Ga2O3-t, but during the DHP-CO2 process, mesoporous materials deactivate more slowly than Ga2O3-t. The acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or the properties of the support, plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. Additionally, the uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution in Ga2O3m contributes to enhanced selectivity to propene. The dehydrogenation reaction of propane in the presence of CO2 does not suppress coke deposition.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest activity due to its efficient promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation process through specific Lewis acid sites. β-Ga2O3 exhibits better selectivity for the desired product because of its unique surface properties that favor the formation of the product over byproducts. γ-Ga2O3 is noted for its stability under reaction conditions, making it ideal for long-term industrial applications. Lastly, δ-Ga2O3 shows moderate catalytic performance, influenced by its balance between acidity and basicity.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly impact their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs display distinct reactivity patterns due to variations in their crystal structures, which influence the distribution and accessibility of Lewis acid sites. Higher acidity and basicity tend to enhance the initial activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs, facilitating faster reaction rates. However, this increased activity can lead to higher coke formation, which subsequently deactivates the catalysts. The selectivity towards propene is influenced by the balance between acidity and basicity, with more acidic supports favoring propene production but leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes due to coke formation. The selectivity of HZSM-48-supported Ga2O3 catalysts over HZSM-5-supported catalysts is attributed to the former's weaker acid strength, which reduces the risk of unwanted side reactions such as aromatization, thus enhancing propene selectivity without compromising too much on initial activity. The stability of these catalysts is also affected by their pore geometries; catalysts with unidimensional pore structures tend to have lower stability due to more accessible surfaces for coke deposition.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. High activity is observed in catalysts with abundant medium-strong acid sites on their surfaces, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2, compared to ineffective catalysts like Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 but diminish those of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

These factors affect reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The mechanisms explaining the observed activity trends and selectivity involve specific interactions between the catalyst surface and the reactants during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

The structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity. Surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity depends on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 maximizing this activity. Tetrahedral Ga cations in β- and γ-Ga2O3 structures create coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, acting as Lewis acid sites for dehydrogenation reactions. Octahedral Ga3+ in α- and δ-Ga2O3 are less coordinated with weaker acidity, allowing for the potential reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations, which generates surface Lewis acid sites.
