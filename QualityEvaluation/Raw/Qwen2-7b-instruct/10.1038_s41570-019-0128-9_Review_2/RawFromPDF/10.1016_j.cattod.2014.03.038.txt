The  catalytic
 performance
 of a  zeolite
 is largely
 determined
 by  its  framework

 particle

 and  acidity.  A
 hierarchical
 SAPO-34/18
 zeolite
 with
 a low  Si/Al
 ratio  of 0.11–0.12  and  well-ordered

 was  synthesized
 with  the  conventional

 method
 by  just
 decreasing
 the Si  con-
tent
 in the  gel  mixture,
 that  is, the  development
 of
 its  hierarchical
 structure
 did
 not  need
 the use  of  an
extra
 template
 or  post-processing
 demetallation.
 The  hierarchical
 structure
 reduced  the  diffusion  dis-
tance
 inside
 the zeolitic  phase
 because
 the  void  space  made  it  equivalent
 to  being
 comprised
 of  small
zeolitic
 crystallites,
 which
 gave  a  catalytic
 performance
 akin  to  that  of
 nanosized
 zeolite  particles.

 process
 showed
 that
the
 hierarchical
 structure
 and low  acid  site  density
 resulted  in  a
 longer  lifetime,
 lower
 selectivities
to
 coke  and  propane
 and  higher  selectivities
 to propene
 and  butene,
 that is,  a
 better  catalyst
 for

 Introduction
SAPO-34
 zeolite
 is
 of
 interest
 for
 the
 methanol-to-oleﬁns
 (MTO)
process
 because
 its
 large
 cages,
 small
 windows
 and
 milder
 acid-
ity
 compared
 to
 ZSM-5
 give
 it
 higher
 selectivities
 to
 alkenes
 [1].
However,
 while
 its
 small
 window
 size
 gives
 it
 shape
 selectivity
to
 light
 alkenes,
 it
 also
 leads
 to
 diffusion
 limitation
 of
 the
 reac-
tion
 because
 this
 causes
 large
 hydrocarbon
 molecules
 and
 coke
 to
remain
 in
 the
 cages
 [2–4].
 Thus,
 catalyst
 development
 of
 the
 SAPO-
34
 catalyst
 have
 focused
 on
 getting
 better
 stability
 and
 meeting
the
 industrial
 needs
 for
 a
 higher
 selectivity
 to
 oleﬁns,
 especially
propene.
 There
 have
 been
 two
 main
 strategies
 for
 these:
 (1)
 use
SAPO-34
 that
 has
 only
 mild
 acidity
 [5,6],
 and
 (2)
 use
 tiny
 zeolite
crystallites,
 either
 as
 nanosized
 particles
 or
 as
 large
 particles
 with
a
 hierarchical
 structure
 [7–12].
 Concerning
 the
 acidity,
 Mees
 et
 al.
[5]
 reported
 that
 the
 coking
 of
 a
 SAPO-34
 catalyst
 decreased
 linearly
with
 acidity,
 and
 that
 with
 the
 decreased
 coking,
 the
 ethene/ethane
and
 propene/propane
 ratios
 increased.
 A
 SAPO-34
 catalyst
 with
very
 low
 density
 acid
 sites,
 described
 as
 an
 AlPO-34
 zeolite
 by
 the
authors
 [13],
 was
 reported
 to
 give
 a
 high
 selectivity
 to
 alkenes

the
 MTO
 reaction.
 Concerning
 the
 second
 strategy,
 very
 ﬁne
 zeo-
lite
 crystals
 are
 difﬁcult
 to
 use
 and
 would
 give
 high
 operational
costs,
 and
 so
 hierarchically
 structured
 crystals
 are
 considered
 more
practical
 [14].
Although
 there
 are
 many
 methods
 to
 prepare
 hierarchical
zeolites,
 including
 the
 use
 of
 special
 template
 [11,15,16]
 and
demetallation
 procedures
 [17–19],
 these
 suffered
 from
 one
 or
 more
of
 the
 following
 problems:
 complicated
 synthesis
 procedure,
 high
cost
 of
 template,
 difﬁcult
 to
 scale
 up
 or
 the
 possibility
 of
 contam-
ination
 because
 more
 templates
 or
 more
 procedures
 are
 involved.
Here,
 we
 reported
 a
 simple
 method
 to
 prepare
 a
 hierarchical
 SAPO-
34/18
 zeolite
 with
 well-ordered
 macropores
 and
 low
 acidity
 which
was
 obtained
 by
 simply
 changing
 the
 ratio
 of
 silica
 sol
 to
 pseu-
doboehmite,
 orthophosphoric
 acid
 and
 triethylamine
 (TEA)
 used
in
 the
 starting
 gel.
 The
 method
 did
 not
 need
 to
 use
 extra
 template
or
 demetallation
 procedures
 to
 produce
 the
 hierarchical
 structure.
The
 advantage
 of
 having
 macropores
 in
 the
 particle
 is
 that
 they
separate
 the
 solid
 zeolitic
 phase
 into
 patches
 so
 that
 the
 particle
is
 virtually
 comprised
 of
 many
 much
 smaller
 crystallites,
 which
results
 in
 much
 short
 diffusion
 distances
 inside
 these
 small
 inter-
nal
 zeolitic
 crystallites
 as
 compared
 to
 the
 diffusion
 distance
 in
 a
solid
 particle
 of
 the
 same
 size
 without
 macropores.
 Fortuitously,
 the
composition
 of
 the
 raw
 materials
 used
 for
 the
 zeolite
 synthesis
 also
gave
 the
 zeolite
 a
 lower
 acidity,
 which
 was
 further
 advantageous

 Experimental
2.1.
 Preparation
 of
 hierarchical
 SAPO-34/18
 zeolite
The
 catalysts
 were
 synthesized
 by
 the
 hydrothermal
 method.
The
 reagents
 used
 were
 silica
 sol
 (40
 wt%
 SiO2),
 pseudoboehmite
(73
 wt%
 Al2O3),
 orthophosphoric
 acid
 (85
 wt%
 H3PO4)
 and
 triethyl-
amine
 (TEA).
 Samples
 with
 two
 different
 morphological
 structures
were
 synthesized
 hydrothermally
 by
 changing
 the
 gel
 composi-
tion
 of
 Al2O3:xSiO2:1.15P2O5:2.7TEA:114H2O
 (x
 =
 0.05–0.5).
 Just
 by
changing
 the
 value
 of
 x,
 two
 kinds
 of
 SAPO-34/18
 particles
 were
obtained:
 particles
 with
 a
 conventional
 solid
 structure
 with
 a
 high
framework
 Si/Al
 ratio
 (named
 TS-C,
 x
 =
 0.5)
 and
 particles
 with
 a
hierarchical
 structure
 with
 a
 low
 framework
 Si/Al
 ratio
 (named
TS-H,
 x
 =
 0.05).
In
 the
 synthesis,
 the
 gel
 mixture
 was
 put
 into
 a
 stainless
 steel
autoclave
 lined
 with
 Teﬂon
 where
 it
 was
 ﬁrst
 aged
 for
 24
 h
 and
then
 heated
 at
 200 ◦C
 for
 20
 h.
 After
 cooling
 the
 product
 to
 room
temperature,
 the
 zeolite
 was
 recovered
 by
 centrifuging
 and
 washed
thoroughly
 with
 deionized
 water.
 Then
 the
 sample
 was
 dried
 at
110 ◦C
 for
 8
 h
 and
 calcined
 in
 air
 at
 600 ◦C
 for
 4
 h
 to
 remove
 the
 TEA
template.
2.2.
 Characterization
Scanning
 electron
 microscope
 (SEM)
 images
 were
 obtained
 with
a
 high
 resolution
 scanning
 electron
 microscope
 (JEOL,
 JSM-7401)
operated
 at
 2–3
 kV.
 Elemental
 analysis
 was
 performed
 by
 energy
dispersive
 spectroscopy
 (EDS;
 JSM
 7401F)
 and
 by
 inductively
 cou-
pled
 plasma-mass
 spectrometry
 (ICP-MAS).
 X-ray
 diffraction
 (XRD)
spectra
 were
 recorded
 on
 a
 Rigaku
 D/Max-RB
 diffractometer
 using
Cu
 K
 radiation
 at
 40
 kV
 and
 20
 mA.
 NH3-TPD
 analysis
 was
 car-
ried
 out
 on
 an
 automated
 chemisorption
 analyzer
 (Quantachrome
ChemBETPlusar)
 from
 100
 to
 600 ◦C
 with
 a
 temperature
 increase
of
 10 ◦C/min.
 Ar
 adsorption
 isotherms
 at
 87
 K
 were
 obtained
 with
an
 automated
 physisorption
 analyzer
 (Quantachrome
 Autosorb
iQ2).
 Mercury
 penetration
 measurements
 were
 conducted
 on
 a
Micromeritics
 AutoPore
 IV
 9500.
 Laser
 particle
 size
 analysis
 was
used
 to
 get
 the
 sample
 size
 using
 a
 Master
 Sizer
 3000,
 for
 which
the
 sample
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 wet
 dispersion.
2.3.
 Diffusion
 rate
 measurements
Diffusion
 coefﬁcient
 measurements
 were
 made
 with
 the
 sam-
ple
 placed
 as
 a
 ﬁxed
 bed
 in
 an
 apparatus
 designed
 to
 perform
 the
chromatographic
 method
 [20].
 Before
 the
 measurement,
 the
 sam-
ple
 was
 dehydrated
 at
 500 ◦C
 for
 2
 h
 in
 argon
 ﬂow.
 After
 the
 catalyst
had
 cooled
 to
 the
 measurement
 temperature
 (40 ◦C
 for
 propene
 and
100 ◦C
 for
 propane),
 which
 was
 chosen
 using
 preliminary
 experi-
ments
 to
 determine
 the
 conditions
 where
 the
 adsorbates
 did
 not
react,
 a
 carrier
 gas
 containing
 10
 mol%
 propene
 (or
 propane)
 was
passed
 through
 the
 zeolite
 bed
 for
 1
 h
 to
 saturate
 the
 sample.
 A
step
 change
 in
 the
 adsorbate
 concentration
 was
 then
 introduced
by
 fast
 response
 mass
 ﬂow
 controllers
 that
 were
 used
 to
 stop
 the
adsorbate
 ﬂow
 and
 increase
 the
 carrier
 gas
 ﬂow
 rate
 to
 keep
 the
total
 ﬂow
 rate
 constant.
 The
 adsorbate
 concentration
 at
 the
 exit
 of
the
 zeolite
 bed
 versus
 time
 (response
 curve)
 was
 recorded
 with
 a
mass
 spectrometer
 (MS,
 Stanford
 Research
 Systems
 RGA-200).
 The
diffusion
 coefﬁcients
 were
 obtained
 by
 curve
 ﬁtting
 the
 response
curves
 to
 the
 parameters
 in
 an
 axial
 dispersion
 chromatographic
model
 that
 included
 internal
 diffusion
 in
 the
 zeolite.
2.4.
 TG–GC
 catalyst
 activity
 testing
The
 coke
 accumulated
 in
 the
 catalysts
 were
 analyzed
 using
 a
thermogravimetry
 (TG)
 and
 gas
 chromatography
 (GC)
 combina-
tion
 equipment.
 TG
 and
 GC
 were
 used,
 respectively,
 to
 detect
 the
solid
 and
 gas
 phase
 products.
 The
 TG
 apparatus
 (Mettler
 Toledo,
TGA/DSC-1/1500)
 functioned
 as
 a
 reactor
 that
 was
 used
 to
 measure
the
 sample
 weight
 online,
 which
 gave
 the
 accumulated
 coke
 mass
in
 the
 sample
 as
 a
 function
 of
 reaction
 time.
 The
 MTO
 reaction
 in
 the
TG–GC
 equipment
 was
 carried
 out
 at
 400 ◦C
 and
 atmospheric
 pres-
sure
 with
 a
 feed
 concentration
 of
 10.0
 mol%
 methanol
 and
 3.7
 mg
catalyst.
 The
 feed
 was
 Ar
 as
 a
 carrier
 gas
 at
 a
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 40
 cm3/min
(STP)
 which
 was
 saturated
 with
 methanol
 by
 ﬂowing
 it
 through
a
 bottle
 containing
 methanol
 placed
 in
 a
 thermostatic
 bath.
 The
composition
 of
 the
 gaseous
 product
 at
 the
 outlet
 of
 the
 TG–GC
equipment
 was
 determined
 as
 a
 function
 of
 reaction
 time
 by
 col-
lecting
 gas
 samples
 at
 speciﬁed
 times
 in
 an
 automated
 GC
 sampling
valve
 with
 10
 sample
 loops,
 which
 collected
 gaseous
 product
 data
from
 the
 same
 experiment
 that
 was
 used
 to
 get
 the
 coking
 rate
 data.
The
 gas
 samples
 were
 analyzed
 ofﬂine
 by
 a
 GC
 (Agilent
 7890A)
 with
a
 capillary
 PLOT
 Q
 column
 (60
 m,
 0.53
 mm
 i.d.,
 70 ◦C
 to
 220 ◦C
 at
4 ◦C/min
 and
 kept
 for
 20
 min)
 and
 a
 FID
 detector.

 Results
3.1.
 Catalyst
 characterization
The
 SEM
 images
 in
 Fig.
 1
 showed
 that
 there
 were
 large
 morpho-
logical
 differences
 between
 TS-C
 and
 TS-H.
 TS-C
 comprised
 solid
cubic
 particles
 with
 smooth
 surfaces
 (Fig.
 1a),
 which
 is
 a
 morphol-
ogy
 that
 is
 commonly
 reported
 for
 particles
 of
 SAPO-34.
 In
 contrast,
the
 surfaces
 of
 TS-H
 (Fig.
 1b
 and
 c)
 had
 plentiful
 50
 to
 500
 nm
macropore
 openings.
 From
 a
 large
 number
 of
 observations
 using
SEM,
 it
 was
 observed
 that
 the
 pore
 distribution
 on
 the
 TS-H
 sur-
face
 had
 regularity,
 that
 is,
 they
 were
 observed
 to
 be
 well-ordered
macropores
 with
 a
 unique
 structure
 which
 differed
 from
 those
 pre-
viously
 reported
 for
 mesoporous
 [21]
 and
 layered
 [8]
 SAPO-34.
 The
3D
 MAX
 software
 was
 used
 with
 the
 images
 of
 the
 cross-section
(e.g.,
 Fig.
 1c)
 to
 deduce
 the
 morphological
 structure
 of
 the
 obviously
hierarchical
 nature
 of
 TS-H
 (Fig.
 1d).
 The
 result
 indicated
 that
 the
hierarchical
 cubic
 catalyst
 particle
 was
 composed
 of
 four
 pyra-
mids
 and
 two
 frustums,
 which
 were,
 respectively,
 about
 2
 m
 high
and
 400
 nm
 thick.
 The
 macropores
 at
 the
 crisscross
 intersection
 of
the
 four
 pyramids
 were
 directed
 straight
 inwards
 to
 form
 a
 three
dimensional
 well-ordered
 channel
 network,
 which
 was
 seen
 clearly
in
 the
 cutaway
 view
 of
 the
 TS-H
 zeolites.
 The
 macropore
 channels
also
 passed
 through
 the
 two
 opposing
 frustums.
The
 EDS
 analysis
 of
 the
 elemental
 compositions
 of
 the
 molec-
ular
 sieves
 gave
 the
 framework
 Si/Al
 atomic
 ratio
 of
 TS-H
 as
 0.11
and
 that
 of
 TS-C
 as
 0.21.
 The
 Si/Al
 ratios
 of
 TS-H
 and
 TS-C
 measured
by
 ICP-MS
 were
 0.12
 and
 0.23,
 in
 agreement
 with
 the
 measure-
ment
 by
 EDS.
 The
 peaks
 in
 the
 XRD
 patterns
 of
 the
 samples
 were
assigned
 by
 comparing
 them
 with
 those
 of
 standard
 CHA
 and
 AEI
structures.
 In
 the
 XRD
 pattern
 of
 TS-H
 (Fig.
 2),
 the
 peaks
 at
 16.9,
 19.6,
21.3,
 24.1
 and
 26.3◦indicated
 the
 existence
 of
 the
 AEI
 structure,
in
 addition
 to
 the
 standard
 CHA
 structure
 of
 SAPO-34.
 In
 addi-
tion,
 the
 absence
 of
 a
 peak
 at
 10.6◦indicated
 that
 the
 CHA
 and
AEI
 structures
 were
 not
 just
 physically
 mixed
 particles.
 The
 XRD
pattern
 of
 the
 catalyst
 was
 simulated
 using
 DIFFaX
 [10],
 a
 special-
ized
 computer
 program
 for
 studying
 crystals
 with
 stacking
 faults,
which
 indicated
 the
 sample
 was
 an
 intergrowth
 structure
 with
 the
CHA/AEI
 structures,
 namely,
 a
 SAPO-34
 and
 SAPO-18
 intergrowth
crystal
 with
 a

 and

 ratio
 of
 8:2.
 The

 pattern
of
 TS-C
 was
 almost
 the
 same
 as
 that
 of
 TS-H.

 In

 in

 the

 at

was
 due
 to

 and
 these

 showed
 that

 and

 were
 the

 for

 However,
in
 the
 region
 near
 P/P0 =
 1,
 there
 was
 Ar
 adsorption
 on
 TS-H
 but
not
 on
 TS-C,
 which
 indicated
 that
 TS-H
 also
 has
 large
 pores
 but
TS-C
 does
 not.
 Mercury
 penetration
 was
 also
 used
 to
 characterize
these
 macropores,
 and
 the
 data
 are
 shown
 in

 The
 impor-
tant
 data
 are
 the

 of

 with
 an
 average
 diameter
 of
200
 nm,
 which
 was
 due
 to
 the
 macropores
 inside

ticles.
 These
 macropores
 correspond
 to
 the
 macropores
 shown
 in
the

 result
 in

 and
 these
 data
 veriﬁed
 the

 of
the

 none
 in

 while
 it
 was

 above
 that

 In

 this

 in

 The

 of

 and

 also
 showed
 no

which
 indicated
 that
 there
 was
 no

 in

 The

 of
 the

 in
 Table

 were
 very

 The

 was

 with
 the

 Diffusion

Typical
 response
 curves
 of
 propene
 diffusing
 out
 from
 TS-C
 and
TS-H
 at
 40 ◦C
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 5,
 which
 showed
 that
 there
 was
a
 large
 difference
 in
 the
 diffusion
 rates
 inside
 the
 two
 samples.
The
 gas
 diffusion
 out
 from
 TS-H
 was
 clearly
 much
 faster
 than
 from
TS-C.
 Curve
 ﬁtting
 of
 the
 response
 curves
 with
 the
 diffusion
 equa-
tion
 gave
 the
 apparent
 diffusion
 coefﬁcient
 of
 propene
 in
 TS-H
 as
1.1
 ×
 10−13 m2/s
 (Table
 1)
 and
 showed
 that
 it
 was
 one
 order
 of
 mag-
nitude
 larger
 than
 that
 in
 TS-C.
 The
 measured
 smaller
 diffusion
coefﬁcient
 of
 propene
 in
 TS-C
 was
 in
 fair
 agreement
 with
 the
 value
reported
 in
 Ref.
 [22].
 The
 apparent
 diffusion
 coefﬁcients
 of
 propane
for
 the
 two
 samples
 also
 showed
 a
 similar
 trend,
 that
 is,
 the
 appar-
ent
 diffusion
 coefﬁcient
 in
 TS-H
 was
 much
 larger
 than
 that
 in
 TS-C.
Since
 the
 particle
 size
 of
 TS-H
 was
 about
 the
 same
 as
 that
 of
 TS-
C,
 and
 since
 their
 crystalline
 phases
 were
 the
 same
 (which
 would
mean
 that
 the
 diffusion
 rates
 were
 the
 same
 inside
 the
 crystalline
phases),
 these
 data
 indicated
 that
 the
 effective
 diffusion
 path
 in
 TS-
H
 was
 signiﬁcantly
 reduced
 by
 the

 of

 Dimethyl
 ether
 in
 the
 product
 was
 treated
 as
 unreacted
methanol
 because
 experimental
 observations
 obtained
 with
 it
 as
a
 feed
 showed
 that
 it
 reacts
 via
 its
 conversion
 to
 methanol
 [23].
As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 6,
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 reaction,
 the
 activity
 of
 TS-
C
 was
 slightly
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 TS-H.
 However,
 after
 5
 min,
 the
conversion
 of
 TS-C
 had
 dropped
 rapidly
 to
 be
 below
 10%,
 while
 that
of
 TS-H
 was
 maintained
 at
 15%
 up
 to
 40
 min
 reaction
 time.
 SAPO-
34
 has
 high
 catalytic
 activity
 for
 the
 MTO
 reaction
 because
 it
 can
form
 a
 catalytic
 hydrocarbon
 pool
 that
 is
 trapped
 in
 its
 cages,
 but
the
 hydrocarbon
 species
 can
 also
 cause
 fast
 deactivation
 by
 caus-
ing
 coke
 formation
 [9,24].
 Thus,
 it
 is
 of
 interest
 to
 understand
 more
about
 the
 coke
 formation,
 which
 was
 shown
 by
 the
 weight
 of
 coke
on
 the
 sample
 versus
 time
 on
 stream
 (TOS).
 These
 data
 are
 shown
 in
Fig.
 6,
 which
 showed
 that
 as
 a
 function
 of
 TOS,
 the
 amount
 of
 coke
accumulated
 on
 the
 two
 samples
 were
 different.
 With
 TS-C,
 the
 rate
of
 coking
 in
 the
 initial
 stage
 of
 reaction
 was
 fast,
 but
 after
 15
 min,
the
 weight
 ratio
 of
 coke
 in
 the
 catalyst
 was
 stabilized
 at
 14%,
 which
is
 a
 similar
 result
 with
 Chen
 et
 al.
 [24].
 After
 that,
 it
 only
 increased
slightly
 with
 TOS.
 The
 trend
 was
 quite
 different
 with
 TS-H,
 on
 which
the
 coke
 accumulated
 slowly
 and
 almost
 linearly
 with
 TOS,
 and
 the
amount
 was
 always
 lower
 than
 that
 in
 TS-C.
 This
 difference
 with
TS-H
 as
 the
 catalyst
 would
 be
 due
 to
 its
 low
 acidity
 and
 hierarchical
structure.
Many
 data
 sets
 of
 catalyst
 activity
 reported
 in
 the
 literature
 use
only
 the
 gaseous
 products
 to
 calculate
 reaction
 rates
 because
 there
was
 no
 online
 collection
 of
 coke
 data.
 This
 would
 underestimate
the
 activity
 and
 overestimate
 the
 selectivity
 of
 gaseous
 products
 if
the
 coking
 rate
 was
 not
 negligible.
 When
 the
 coke
 selectivity
 is
 not
low
 enough
 to
 be
 ignored,
 the
 conversions
 to
 all
 products
 includ-
ing
 coke
 should
 be
 used
 to
 get
 the
 accurate
 measure
 of
 catalyst
activity
 and
 product
 selectivities.
 Fig.
 7
 gives
 the
 selectivities
 to
 the
main
 gaseous
 products
 and
 coke
 on
 the
 two
 catalysts
 determined
by
 TG–GC.
 The
 selectivity
 to
 propene
 of
 TS-H
 increased
 slightly
 from
42%
 to
 44%
 with
 TOS,
 which
 is
 a
 slightly
 higher
 selectivity
 than
 that
reported
 for
 a
 nanosized
 SAPO-34
 catalyst
 [7]
 and
 a
 low-silica
 AlPO-
34
 [13].
 However,
 on
 TS-C,
 it
 decreased
 from
 41%
 to
 25%
 under
 the
same
 conditions
 (Fig.
 7a
 and
 b).
 The
 selectivity
 to
 butene
 was
 stable
at
 ∼22%
 on
 TS-H,
 which
 was
 5%
 higher
 than
 the
 highest
 value
 on
TS-C.
TS-H
 gave
 a
 lower
 selectivity
 to
 ethene,
 but
 this
 was
 not
 due
 to
 a
slower
 rate
 of
 production
 of
 ethene.
 It
 was
 due
 to
 the
 production
 of
more
 propene
 and
 butene,
 which
 was
 because
 of
 the
 faster
 diffusion
of
 propene
 (and
 presumably
 butene)
 out
 from
 TS-H,
 which
 gave
 it
higher
 propene
 and
 butene
 selectivities
 as
 described
 in
 the
 above
paragraph.
 This
 would
 be
 due
 to
 its
 hierarchical
 structure
 which
gave
 it
 a
 behavior
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 a
 particle
 composed
 of
 small
crystallites
 with
 short
 diffusion
 distances,
 which
 was
 veriﬁed
 by
the
 propene
 diffusivity
 data
 discussed
 earlier.
 In
 addition,
 TS-H
 gave
a
 lower
 selectivity
 to
 propane,
 which
 is
 also
 desirable,
 and
 which
was
 possibly
 due
 to
 its
 milder
 acidity.
 That
 is,
 its
 fewer
 acid
 sites
was
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 selectivity
 to
 propane
 over
 TS-H
 was
 only
0.5%,
 which
 was
 one
 order
 of
 magnitude
 lower
 than
 that
 on
 TS-
C,
 which
 has
 more
 acid
 sites,
 where
 this
 selectivity
 was
 5%.
 These
data
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 7c
 and
 d.
 The
 value
 of
 5%
 for
 TS-C
 is
 similar
to
 the
 values
 reported
 in
 Yang
 et
 al.
 [7]
 and
 Hereijgers
 et
 al.
 [4]
 for
 a
more
 acidic
 SAPO-34.
 The
 explanation
 that
 the
 lower
 value
 for
 TS-H
was
 due
 to
 the
 fewer
 acid
 sites
 on
 TS-H
 assumed
 that
 propane
 was
produced
 by
 oleﬁn
 oligomerization
 and
 then
 beta
 scission
 of
 the
oligomer,
 and
 that
 oligomerization
 is
 promoted
 by
 a
 high
 density
of
 acid
 sites.
The
 selectivity
 to
 coke
 on
 TS-C
 was
 almost
 10%
 at
 the
 beginning
of
 the
 reaction,
 which
 became
 much
 reduced
 after
 10
 min
 proba-
bly
 due
 to
 the
 lowered
 activity,
 and
 then
 it
 increased
 a
 little
 again
at
 the
 end.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 on
 the
 better
 TS-H
 catalyst,
 there
was
 only
 4%
 coke
 selectivity
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 reaction,
 which
then
 decreased
 slowly
 with
 TOS
 to
 1%.
 The
 methane
 selectivity
 con-
ﬁrmed
 the
 quite
 different
 deactivation
 rates
 of
 the
 two
 catalysts
as
 on
 TS-C,
 it
 increased
 remarkably
 after
 20
 min;
 but
 on
 TS-H,
 it
was
 always
 quite
 low.
 This
 association
 of
 methane
 selectivity
 with
deactivation
 rate
 assumes
 that
 methane
 was
 produced
 by
 a
 path-
way
 that
 was
 parallel
 to
 that
 of
 the
 hydrocarbon
 pool
 (HC)
 pathway,
and
 that
 the
 methane
 pathway
 was
 insigniﬁcant
 when
 it
 was
 dom-
inated
 by
 the
 HC
 pathway
 when
 the
 zeolite
 was
 very
 active
 but
 it
becomes
 signiﬁcant
 when
 the
 HC
 pathway
 was
 deactivated.

 Discussion
In
 general,
 the
 size
 of
 the
 window
 of
 the
 cages
 in
 the
 three
dimensional
 pore
 system
 of
 SAPO-34
 is
 the
 bottleneck
 for
 the
 dif-
fusion
 of
 molecules
 in
 the
 zeolite
 [25,26].
 In
 a
 simpliﬁed
 picture
of
 SAPO-34
 shape
 selectivity,
 its
 window
 size
 only
 allows
 ethene,
propene
 and
 n-butene
 to
 escape
 from
 the
 cages,
 while
 it
 prevents
other
 larger
 molecules
 from
 leaving
 the
 cages,
 which
 explains
 well
its
 attraction
 as
 a
 catalyst
 for
 making
 light
 oleﬁns.
 Further
 cata-
lyst
 development
 and
 reactor
 engineering
 requires
 more
 details
to
 this
 picture,
 which
 have
 been
 considered
 from
 the
 aspects
 of
changes
 in
 the
 density
 of
 acid
 sites
 and
 diffusion
 rates.
 Thus,
 cata-
lyst
 development
 has
 focused
 on
 two
 strategies:
 (1)
 use
 SAPO-34
with
 milder
 acidity
 [5],
 and
 (2)
 use
 a
 zeolite
 particle
 morphol-
ogy
 that
 promotes
 faster
 diffusion
 [7–12].
 Our
 results
 above
 are
in
 good
 agreement
 with
 these
 strategies.
 The
 slower
 coke
 deposit
rate
 on
 TS-H
 would
 be
 due
 to
 its
 lower
 acidity
 [5],
 since
 coke
 has
 to
be
 formed
 by
 oligomerization,
 which
 needs
 a
 high
 density
 of
 acid
sites
 and
 the
 very
 low
 propane
 selectivity
 of
 TS-H
 veriﬁed
 that
 its
oligomerization
 reaction
 rate
 was
 slow.
The
 second
 factor
 of
 the
 diffusion
 rates
 makes
 use
 of
 the
 con-
sideration
 that
 when
 the
 diffusion
 distance
 of
 alkenes
 inside
 the
particle
 is
 long,
 this
 can
 result
 in
 the
 further
 conversion
 of
 these
molecules
 into
 coke.
 The
 apparent
 diffusivity
 in
 TS-H
 was
 much
larger
 than
 in
 TS-C,
 which
 indicated
 that
 the
 hierarchical
 struc-
ture
 effectively
 decreased
 the
 diffusion
 distance,
 and
 the
 alkene
products
 thus
 remained
 in
 the
 catalyst
 for
 a
 shorter
 time.
 Thus,
the
 plentiful
 macropores
 in
 TS-H
 had
 the
 important
 contribution
that
 they
 shortened
 the
 diffusion
 path
 lengths
 of
 the
 alkene
 inter-
mediate
 products.
 Consistent
 with
 this
 explanation
 is
 the
 result
that
 the
 effect
 on
 propene
 is
 larger
 than
 on
 ethene
 which
 would
 be
because
 propene
 is
 larger
 and
 would
 be
 more
 liable
 to
 suffer
 diffu-
sion
 limitation
 than
 ethene,
 that
 is,
 this
 explanation
 is
 consistent
with
 the
 higher
 selectivity
 to
 propene
 on
 TS-H.
 Thus,
 both
 the
 hier-
archical
 structure
 and
 moderate
 acidity
 contributed
 to
 signiﬁcantly
improve
 TS-H’s
 catalytic
 performance
 in
 MTO.

 Conclusion
A
 hierarchical
 SAPO-34/18
 zeolite
 with
 an
 intergrowth
 CHA/AEI
crystal
 structure
 and
 a
 particle
 morphology
 comprising
 small
zeolitic
 phase
 crystallites
 separated
 by
 well-ordered
 macropores
was
 synthesized
 by
 using
 a
 decreased
 Si
 content
 in
 the
 gel
 mix-
ture.
 The
 production
 of
 the
 hierarchical
 morphological
 structure
did
 not
 need
 an
 extra
 template
 or
 demetallation
 procedure.
 In
addition,
 it
 fortuitously
 had
 milder
 acidity
 due
 to
 the
 lower
 Si/Al
ratio.
 The
 hierarchical
 structure
 resulted
 in
 a
 shorter
 diffusion
 dis-
tance
 for
 the
 gaseous
 products
 because
 the
 macropores
 separated
the
 solid
 phase
 into
 small
 zeolitic
 phase
 crystallites.
 The
 shorter
diffusion
 distance
 and
 lower
 acidity
 resulted
 in
 higher
 selectivi-
ties
 to
 propene
 (44%)
 and
 butenes
 (22%),
 and
 lower
 selectivities
 to
propane
 (0.5%)
 and
 coke
 (1–4%),
 which
 preserved
 a
 longer
 lifetime
for
 the
 catalyst
 and
 a
 higher
 yield
 of
 alkenes
 in
 the
 MTO
 process.
