"In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."
"Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."
"The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."
"The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."
"The above characterization data allow the active sites for CO2-ODH and DR to be deduced93."

Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, are crucial for understanding the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. XRD provides insights into the structural properties of these catalysts, while XANES data reveal the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. EXAFS fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of specific sizes. The presence of FeCe bonding and a low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicates that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which is corroborated by ADF-STEM with EELS. High-resolution micrographs highlight differences in CeO2 particle morphology between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts, showing contact with a thin layer of FeOx in the former. These techniques collectively allow deducing the active sites for CO2-ODH and DR, providing valuable information for catalyst performance and design.

先进的原位和离线分析技术，包括同步辐射X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)、扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)以及环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜(ADF-STEM)结合电子能量损失光谱(EELS)，对于理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中的活性位点的结构特性、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征至关重要。通过XRD可以获取这些催化剂的结构信息，而XANES数据揭示了Ni和Fe的氧化状态。EXAFS拟合结果表明，金属Ni或FeNi合金构成了特定大小的颗粒。FeCe键的存在以及Fe位点附近氧原子数量较少表明氧化态Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上，这一结论得到了ADF-STEM结合EELS技术的支持。高分辨率显微图像是Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中CeO2粒子形态差异的直观体现，前者与一层薄薄的FeOx接触。这些技术共同作用于识别CO2-ODH和DR的活性位点，为催化剂性能和设计提供了宝贵的信息。
