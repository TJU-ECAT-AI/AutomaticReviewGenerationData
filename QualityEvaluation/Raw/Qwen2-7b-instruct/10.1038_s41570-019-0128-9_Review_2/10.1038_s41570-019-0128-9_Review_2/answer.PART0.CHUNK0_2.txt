"In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b). Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm. The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93. The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. XRD patterns reveal the structural properties of the catalysts, while XANES data provide insights into the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. EXAFS fitting results indicate the composition of metallic Ni or FeNi alloys within the catalyst particles. The presence of FeCe bonding and the low coordination of oxygen atoms to Fe sites suggests that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2. This finding is corroborated by ADF-STEM with EELS, which offers high-resolution micrographs showing differences in the CeO2 particles between the two catalyst types. Specifically, the high-resolution micrographs demonstrate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx, differing from the morphology observed in Fe1Ni3/CeO2.

先进的原位和离线分析技术，包括同步辐射X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线吸收边近端结构（XANES）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）以及环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜（ADF-STEM）结合电子能量损失光谱（EELS），协同作用于理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征。XRD模式揭示了催化剂的结构性质，而XANES数据提供了Ni和Fe的氧化状态信息。EXAFS拟合结果表明金属Ni或FeNi合金存在于催化剂颗粒内。FeCe键的存在和Fe位点附近氧原子的低配位表明氧化态Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上。ADF-STEM与EELS的结合提供高分辨率图像，证实了这一发现。具体而言，高分辨率图像显示Fe3Ni1/CeO2中的CeO2与FeOx薄层接触，这与Fe1Ni3/CeO2的形态观察存在差异。
