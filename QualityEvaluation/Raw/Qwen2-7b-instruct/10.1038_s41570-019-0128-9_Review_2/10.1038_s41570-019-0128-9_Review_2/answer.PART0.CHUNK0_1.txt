"In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."
"In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b)."
"Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."
"The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."
"The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."

Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These methods reveal that Ni exists as metallic particles or NiFe alloys with diameters ranging from 2.5 to 4.0 nm. The presence of FeCe bonding and the low coordination of O atoms to Fe sites indicates that oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2. The spatial distribution of active sites varies between the two catalysts, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 having CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx. This detailed characterization elucidates the differences in catalyst performance and design implications.

先进的原位和离线分析技术，包括同步辐射X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)、扩展X射线吸收精细结构(EXAFS)以及暗场环形扫描透射电子显微镜(ADF-STEM)结合电子能量损失光谱(EELS)，为Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征提供了全面的理解。这些方法表明，Ni以金属颗粒或NiFe合金的形式存在，直径在2.5到4.0纳米之间。FeCe键的存在和Fe位点低氧原子协调表明，氧化态Fe物种以薄层形式存在于CeO2上。两种催化剂中活性位点的空间分布不同，Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂中CeO2与FeOx薄层接触。这种详细表征揭示了催化剂性能和设计的差异性。
