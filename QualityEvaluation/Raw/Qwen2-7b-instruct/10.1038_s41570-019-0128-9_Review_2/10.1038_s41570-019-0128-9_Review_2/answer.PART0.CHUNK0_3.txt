"In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93."
"In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b)."
"Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.54.0nm."
"The existence of FeCe bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93."
"The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f)."
"The above characterization data allow the active sites for CO2-ODH and DR to be deduced93. In Ni/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 helps enable facile CO2 dissociation to give a *O species that participates in C2H6 activation on the Ni particles at the NiCeO2 interfaces."
"When a small amount of Fe was added, the resulting Fe1Ni3/CeO2 materials feature NiCeOx interfacial sites that process C2H6 and CO2 faster than other sites, and allow the catalyst to maintain high CO selectivity (>95%)."
"When a large amount of Fe was introduced, a material of formula Fe3Ni1/CeO2 resulted, which has amorphous FeOx regions that extend far enough to form NiFeOx interfacial sites on the perimeter of Ni particles."
"DFT calculations of reactions on FeNi surfaces The in situ measurements give us an idea of the possible FeNi structures responsible for catalytic activity. These candidate structures can be studied using DFT calculations to investigate possible reaction pathways for the oxidative CH bond cleavage (dehydrogenation; Fig. 7) and CC bond scission (reforming)."

Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, are crucial for comprehending the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These methods provide insights into the composition and arrangement of metals within the catalysts, their interaction with support materials, and the presence of specific active sites.

Key differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts emerge from the characterization data. In Fe3Ni1/CeO2, larger amounts of Fe lead to the formation of amorphous FeOx regions that facilitate the creation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which are responsible for high activity in CO2-ODH of C2H6. Conversely, in Fe1Ni3/CeO2, a smaller amount of Fe results in NiCeOx interfacial sites that process C2H6 and CO2 more efficiently, maintaining high CO selectivity.

Implications for catalyst performance and design include the optimization of metal loading and distribution to achieve desired reactivity and selectivity. The spatial arrangement of metals and their interactions with the support material play critical roles in determining the catalytic activity and stability.

DFT calculations further elucidate the reaction mechanisms by predicting the energetics and kinetics of oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage on FeNi surfaces. These theoretical insights complement the experimental data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes and guiding the rational design of advanced catalysts for CO2-ODH and DR.

先进的原位和离线分析技术，包括同步辐射X射线衍射（XRD）、X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）、扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）以及环形暗场扫描透射电子显微镜（ADF-STEM）结合电子能量损失光谱（EELS），对于理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征至关重要。这些方法提供了关于催化剂中金属成分和排列的信息，以及它们与支撑材料的相互作用，揭示了特定活性位点的存在。

Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂之间的关键差异可以从表征数据中看出。在Fe3Ni1/CeO2中，较大的Fe量导致形成非晶态FeOx区域，从而促进NiFeOx界面位点的形成，这些位点负责CO2-ODH中C2H6的高活性。相反，在Fe1Ni3/CeO2中，少量的Fe导致NiCeOx界面位点的形成，这些位点处理C2H6和CO2更有效，维持了高的CO选择性。

对催化剂性能和设计的启示包括优化金属负载和分布以实现所需的反应性和选择性。金属的空间排列及其与支撑材料的相互作用在确定催化活性和稳定性方面起着关键作用。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算进一步阐明了反应机制，通过预测FeNi表面上的氧化CH和CC键断裂的热力学和动力学。这些理论见解补充了实验数据，为全面了解CO2-ODH和DR的催化过程，并指导高级催化剂的设计提供了指导。
