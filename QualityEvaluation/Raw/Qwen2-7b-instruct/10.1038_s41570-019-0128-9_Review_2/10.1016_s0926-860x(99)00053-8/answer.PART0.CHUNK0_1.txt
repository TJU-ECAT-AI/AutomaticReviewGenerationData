The catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides were studied for n-butane hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. The materials were synthesized through temperature-programmed reactions of metal oxides with NH3 or a CH4/H2 mixture. The nitrides and carbides were mostly mesoporous with surface areas up to 81 m2/g. The gravimetric butane conversion rates were generally higher than those for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Activities for the nitrides and carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/cm2 s at 723 K and decreased as follows: g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92. The metal atom type had the most significant effect on the activity and selectivity. The Group VI metal nitrides and carbides were much more active than the Group V metal compounds. In general, the Group VI metal compounds catalyzed butane hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation with similar selectivities while the vanadium compounds had dehydrogenation selectivities in excess of 98%. The b-W2N catalyst also catalyzed butane isomerization possibly as a consequence of the presence of oxygen on the surface. The effect of lattice structure was significant and obvious for the tungsten carbides where WC (hex) was almost twice as active as WC1x (fcc) despite having similar C/W ratios. Nitrides and carbides of the same metal and lattice structure had similar activities suggesting that the effect of the non-metal atom type was small. Variations in the catalytic properties of the nitrides and carbides were the result of differences between their electronic structures.

对早期过渡金属氮化物和碳化物的催化性质进行了研究，以考察其在丁烷氢解、脱氢和异构化过程中的表现。这些材料是通过将金属氧化物与NH3或CH4/H2混合气体进行温度程序反应制备的。这些氮化物和碳化物主要为介孔结构，表面积可达81 m2/g。其对丁烷的重量转化率通常高于铂锡/氧化铝催化剂。在723 K下，这些材料的分子量比范围从0.41012到101012 cm2 s，并按以下顺序递减：g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92。金属原子类型对活性和选择性的影响最大。第VI族金属氮化物和碳化物的活性远高于第V族金属化合物。一般来说，第VI族金属化合物催化丁烷氢解和脱氢具有相似的选择性，而钒化合物的脱氢选择性超过98%。b-W2N催化剂也催化丁烷异构化，可能是因为表面存在氧原子。钨碳化物的晶格结构对活性有显著影响，其中六边形的WC（hex）几乎是立方晶相WC1x的两倍活跃，尽管它们的C/W比例相同。同种金属和晶格结构的氮化物和碳化物具有类似的活性，表明非金属原子类型的影响较小。这些氮化物和碳化物催化性能的变化结果是由于它们电子结构的不同。
