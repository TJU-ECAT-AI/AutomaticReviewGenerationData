The materials were synthesized by reacting metal oxides with a flowing ammonia or methane/hydrogen mixture. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the phase-purity of the nitrides and carbides. The surface areas of the nitrides and carbides were significantly higher than their parent oxides, ranging up to 81 m2/g. These materials exhibited high catalytic activity, especially for butane dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization. The nitrides and carbides showed comparable or higher butane consumption rates than a commercial PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The corresponding activities reached up to 1.01013 molecules/cm2 s, decreasing in the following order: Mo2N>W2CWC >W2NWC1x>Mo2C>VNVCNbNNbC. The turnover frequencies of the nitride and carbide catalysts matched those of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The nitrides and carbides had comparable activities to Pt powders. The metal atom type significantly influenced the catalytic properties, with Group VI compounds being notably more active than Group V metal nitrides and carbides. The lattice structure also impacted the catalytic properties, but the non-metal atom type's effect was negligible. The mechanism for butane hydrogenolysis was similar across all nitrides and carbides, except for the Mo2C catalyst, which showed equal hydrogenolysis frequencies at central and terminal CC bonds.

材料通过与氨气或甲烷/氢气流反应金属氧化物进行合成。X射线衍射图案证实了氮化物和碳化物的相纯度。氮化物和碳化物的表面积远高于其母体氧化物，高达81 m2/g。这些材料表现出高催化活性，尤其是对于丁烷脱氢、氢解和异构化。氮化物和碳化物的丁烷消耗速率比商用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂高。相应的活性达到1.01013分子/cm2 s，按照以下顺序递减：Mo2N>W2CWC >W2NWC1x>Mo2C>VNVCNbNNbC。硝酸盐和碳化物的转速频率与PtSn/Al2O3催化剂相同。硝酸盐和碳化物的活性与Pt粉末相当。金属原子类型显著影响催化性能，其中第VI族化合物的活性明显高于第V族金属氮化物和碳化物。晶格结构也影响催化性能，但非金属原子类型的影响很小。丁烷氢解的机制在所有氮化物和碳化物中相似，除了Mo2C催化剂，该催化剂在中央和末端CC键上具有相同的氢解频率。
