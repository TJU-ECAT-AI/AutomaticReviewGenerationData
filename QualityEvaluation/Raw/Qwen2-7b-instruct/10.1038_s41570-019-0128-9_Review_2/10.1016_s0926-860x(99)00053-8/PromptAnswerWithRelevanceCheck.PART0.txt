<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides were studied for n-butane hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. The materials were synthesized through temperature-programmed reactions of metal oxides with NH3 or a CH4/H2 mixture. The nitrides and carbides were mostly mesoporous with surface areas up to 81 m2/g. The gravimetric butane conversion rates were generally higher than those for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Activities for the nitrides and carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/cm2 s at 723 K and decreased as follows: g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92. The metal atom type had the most significant effect on the activity and selectivity. The Group VI metal nitrides and carbides were much more active than the Group V metal compounds. In general, the Group VI metal compounds catalyzed butane hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation with similar selectivities while the vanadium compounds had dehydrogenation selectivities in excess of 98%. The b-W2N catalyst also catalyzed butane isomerization possibly as a consequence of the presence of oxygen on the surface. The effect of lattice structure was significant and obvious for the tungsten carbides where WC (hex) was almost twice as active as WC1x (fcc) despite having similar C/W ratios. Nitrides and carbides of the same metal and lattice structure had similar activities suggesting that the effect of the non-metal atom type was small. Variations in the catalytic properties of the nitrides and carbides were the result of differences between their electronic structures.

The materials were synthesized by reacting metal oxides with a flowing ammonia or methane/hydrogen mixture. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed the phase-purity of the nitrides and carbides. The surface areas of the nitrides and carbides were significantly higher than their parent oxides, ranging up to 81 m2/g. These materials exhibited high catalytic activity, especially for butane dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization. The nitrides and carbides showed comparable or higher butane consumption rates than a commercial PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The corresponding activities reached up to 1.01013 molecules/cm2 s, decreasing in the following order: Mo2N>W2CWC >W2NWC1x>Mo2C>VNVCNbNNbC. The turnover frequencies of the nitride and carbide catalysts matched those of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. The nitrides and carbides had comparable activities to Pt powders. The metal atom type significantly influenced the catalytic properties, with Group VI compounds being notably more active than Group V metal nitrides and carbides. The lattice structure also impacted the catalytic properties, but the non-metal atom type's effect was negligible. The mechanism for butane hydrogenolysis was similar across all nitrides and carbides, except for the Mo2C catalyst, which showed equal hydrogenolysis frequencies at central and terminal CC bonds.

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques such as XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS provided crucial insights into the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of the active sites in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. Specifically, the techniques revealed that the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst showed a higher activity in terms of butane conversion rates compared to the Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalyst. This is attributed to the distinct metal atom types, where the Group VI metal nitrides and carbides were significantly more active than the Group V metal compounds. The findings highlighted the importance of the metal atom type in influencing the catalytic properties. Moreover, the catalyst performance was also influenced by the lattice structure, with the hexagonal tungsten carbides being more active than the face-centered cubic tungsten carbides. The mechanism for butane hydrogenolysis appeared to be similar across all nitrides and carbides, with hydrogenolysis occurring preferentially at the central CC bond except for the Mo2C catalyst, which showed equal frequencies at both the central and terminal CC bonds. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst favored hydrogenolysis at the terminal CC bond.

先进的原位和离线分析技术，如XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM结合EELS，为理解Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中的活性位点的结构特性、氧化态、空间分布和形态特征提供了关键信息。具体来说，这些技术揭示了Fe3Ni1/CeO2催化剂的但烷转化率比Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂更高，这归因于不同的金属原子类型，其中第VI组过渡金属氮化物和碳化物比第V组金属化合物更为活跃。研究结果强调了金属原子类型对催化性能的影响。此外，催化剂性能还受到晶格结构的影响，六角形钨碳化物比面心立方钨碳化物更活跃。但烷氢解机制在所有氮化物和碳化物中似乎相似，氢解主要发生在CC键的中心，除了Mo2C催化剂，在这里中心和末端CC键的频率基本相同。PtSn/Al2O3催化剂则倾向于在末端CC键上进行氢解。
