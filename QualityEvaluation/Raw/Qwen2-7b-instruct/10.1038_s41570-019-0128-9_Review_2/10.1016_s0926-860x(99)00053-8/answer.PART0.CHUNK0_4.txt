The catalytic properties of early transition metal nitrides and carbides were assessed in terms of their activities for n-butane hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation, and isomerization. The nitrides and carbides were mostly mesoporous with surface areas up to 81 m2/g. Their gravimetric butane conversion rates were generally higher than those for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Activities for the nitrides and carbides ranged from 0.41012 to 101012 molecules/cm2 s at 723 K and decreased as follows: g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92. The metal atom type had the most significant effect on the activity and selectivity. The Group VI metal nitrides and carbides were much more active than the Group V metal compounds. In general, the Group VI metal compounds catalyzed butane hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation with similar selectivities while the vanadium compounds had dehydrogenation selectivities in excess of 98%. The b-W2N catalyst also catalyzed butane isomerization possibly as a consequence of the presence of oxygen on the surface.

评估了早期过渡金属氮化物和碳化物的催化性能，包括它们在n-丁烷氢解、脱氢和异构化中的活性。这些氮化物和碳化物大多是介孔结构，比表面积可达81 m2/g。它们的重力丁烷转化速率通常高于PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。在723 K时，其分子/cm2 s 范围内的体积反应速率从0.41012到101012不等，并按以下顺序递减：g- Mo2N>W2CWC>b-W2NWC1x>b-Mo2C>VNV8C7NbCNb4N3.92。金属原子类型对活性和选择性的影响最大。第VI组过渡金属氮化物和碳化物的活性远高于第V组金属化合物。一般来说，第VI组金属化合物催化丁烷氢解和脱氢具有相似的选择性，而钒化合物的脱氢选择性超过98%。b-W2N催化剂也可能催化丁烷异构化，这可能是表面存在氧的结果。
