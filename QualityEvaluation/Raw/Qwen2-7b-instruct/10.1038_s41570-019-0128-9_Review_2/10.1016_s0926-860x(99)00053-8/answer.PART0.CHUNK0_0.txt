1. The materials were synthesized by reacting metal oxides with a flowing ammonia or methane/hydrogen mixture.
2. The properties of the materials were characterized through X-ray diffraction and sorption analysis.
3. The reaction rates for the nitrides and carbides showed stabilization after initial slight decrease.
4. Over the entire temperature range, the reaction rates of the nitrides and carbides were generally higher than those of the PtSn catalyst, except for Group V metal compounds.
5. In the comparison of catalysts with similar lattice structures, such as VN vs. VC, the differences in activity and selectivity could be attributed to the type of metal atom rather than the lattice structure.
6. Vanadium carbide selectively catalyzed butane dehydrogenation, whereas tungsten carbide catalyzed both hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation of butane.
7. The hydrogenolysis mechanism for the early transition metal nitrides and carbides was similar across the materials, except for the Mo2C catalyst.
8. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst favored hydrogenolysis at the terminal CC bond of butane molecules.
9. The apparent activation energies for butane conversion over the nitrides and carbides varied between 18 and 41 kcal/mol.

1. 材料通过将金属氧化物与氨气或甲烷/氢气流混合物反应合成。
2. 材料的性质通过X射线衍射和吸附分析进行了表征。
3. 在初始轻微下降后，硝化物和碳化物的反应速率稳定下来，没有显著的额外失活。
4. 在整个温度范围内，除了第五组元金属化合物外，硝化物和碳化物的反应速率普遍高于PtSn催化剂。
5. 对于具有相似晶格结构的催化剂，如VN与VC，在活性和选择性上的差异可以归因于金属原子类型而非晶格结构。
6. 钒碳化物仅催化正丁烷的脱氢，而钨碳化物则催化正丁烷的氢解和脱氢。
7. 早期过渡金属氮化物和碳化物的氢解机制在所有材料中相似，除了Mo2C催化剂。
8. PtSn/Al2O3催化剂倾向于在正丁烷分子的末端CC键上进行氢解。
