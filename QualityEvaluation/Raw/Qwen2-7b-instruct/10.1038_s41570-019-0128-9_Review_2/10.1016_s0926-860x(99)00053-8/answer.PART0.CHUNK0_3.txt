1. 含氮和碳的早期过渡金属化合物的丁烷消耗速率通常大于商用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。

2. 这些材料是相纯的，而碳化物不含多余的碳。

3. Ⅵ族金属氮化物和碳化物含有一小部分微孔结构，然而，与Ⅴ族金属化合物类似，最大的孔密度位于介孔范围内。

4. 除了NbN和NbC之外，所有材料都具有活性，催化丁烷的脱氢、氢解和/或异构化。

5. Ⅵ族金属氮化物和碳化物主要催化丁烷的氢解和脱氢。W2N催化剂对异构产物的选择性很高。Ⅴ族化合物仅催化丁烷脱氢。

6. 晶格结构在一定程度上影响了催化性能，但非金属原子类型的影响较小。

7. 丁烷氢解的机制对所有氮化物和碳化物来说似乎相似。

8. 含氮和碳的早期过渡金属化合物对丁烷转换的显热活化能范围从18到41 kcal/mol。
