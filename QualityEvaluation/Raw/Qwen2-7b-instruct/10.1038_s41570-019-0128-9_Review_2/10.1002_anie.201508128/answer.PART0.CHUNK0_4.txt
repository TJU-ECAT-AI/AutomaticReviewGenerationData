[1] "Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates."
[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity."
[3] "Treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis."
[4] "Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree."
[5] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C."

These advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, such as XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, provide crucial insights into the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in catalysts. They allow for a detailed understanding of how these catalysts perform under reaction conditions. Specifically, they reveal how the catalysts interact with reactants and products, helping to elucidate the mechanisms of reaction and deactivation. These findings are essential for optimizing catalyst design and improving their efficiency and stability in industrial applications.

In the case of Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts, the XANES measurements confirm that treatment with hydrogen (H2) significantly reduces the amount of oxide species formed during the synthesis process, leading to improved catalytic activity. The results also show that upon reacting with ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized, while treatment with pure CO2 fully oxidizes Mo2C. This indicates that the adsorbed oxygen from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane but also contributes to the deactivation seen in Mo2C-based catalysts.

这些先进的原位和离线分析技术，如XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM结合EELS，为催化剂的结构性质、氧化状态、空间分布和活性位点的形态特征提供了关键信息。它们允许深入了解催化剂在反应条件下的性能。具体来说，它们揭示了催化剂如何与反应物和产物相互作用，有助于阐明反应和失活的机制。这些发现对于优化催化剂设计并提高其工业应用中的效率和稳定性至关重要。

针对Pt/CeO2和Mo2C基催化剂的情况，XANES测量表明，氢气（H2）处理显著减少了合成过程中形成的氧化物种，从而提高了催化活性。结果还显示，在与乙烷和CO2反应后，Mo2C被氧化，而纯CO2处理完全氧化了Mo2C。这表明吸附于CO2的氧是形成氧化碳化物相的必要条件，该相可以脱氢乙烷，但同时也导致Mo2C基催化剂的部分失活。
