<p>The recent shale gas boom combined with the requirement to reduce atmospheric CO2 have created an opportunity for using both raw materials (shale gas and CO2) in a single process.</p>
<p>Shale gas is primarily made up of methane, but ethane comprises about 10% and reserves are underutilized.</p>
<p>Two routes have been investigated by combining ethane decomposition with CO2 reduction to produce products of higher value.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>These findings are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) characterization of the catalysts under insitu reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation.</p>
<p>The high activity of Cr-based catalysts could stem from their ability to exist in several oxidation states, similar to Mn-based molecular sieve catalysts.</p>
<p>Although there have been studies into CO2 reduction by ethane, details are lacking on how to control the extent of dry reforming versus ODH.</p>
<p>In the current study, two types of catalysts, metals (Pt-based) and metal carbides (Mo2C), are investigated under identical reaction conditions to differentiate the two reaction pathways.</p>
<p>To help identify reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare differences in binding energies of potential reaction intermediates.</p>
<p>DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Figure1a shows that on Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*.</p>
<p>The difference in activity between the two classes of catalysts can be further explained through measuring the apparent activation barrier of both CO2 and ethane over Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the behavior of Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 is more similar to that of pure Mo2C than Mo2C/CeO2, which is likely from the low surface area and CO uptake of Mo2C/CeO2 (0.8μmolg1).</p>
<p>To further understand the mechanism of deactivation over Mo2C, insitu XANES measurements were performed over pure Mo2C.</p>
<p>The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane.</p>
<p>Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts.</p>
<p>In summary, Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively.</p>
<p>Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates.</p>
<p>FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD FOCUS ON DESIGNING MATERIALS THAT SELECTIVELY PRODUCE ETHYLENE WITH HIGH STABILITY AND MINIMAL DEACTIVATION.</p>

The literature discusses the development of catalysts for the conversion of ethane and CO2 into synthesis gas and ethylene. It highlights the use of Pt/CeO2 catalysts for synthesis gas production and Mo2C-based catalysts for ethylene production. DFT calculations and XANES characterization are employed to understand the reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance. The study identifies the importance of controlling the reaction pathways to produce desired products and suggests future research on designing catalysts that produce ethylene with high stability and minimal deactivation.
