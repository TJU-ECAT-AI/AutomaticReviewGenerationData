[1] "To help identify reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare differences in binding energies of potential reaction intermediates."
[2] "DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces."
[3] "The DFT results suggest that similar to Pt(111), CeO2/Pt(111) also enhances the reforming of ethane."
[4] "Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2."
[5] "To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane."
[6] "The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane."
[7] "Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, were employed to comprehensively analyze the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. The XRD analysis elucidated the crystal structure and lattice parameters, revealing the preferred orientation and crystallinity of the catalysts. XANES provided insights into the local electronic environment around the active metal atoms, allowing for the determination of their oxidation states and coordination numbers. EXAFS was utilized to probe the coordination geometry of the metal atoms and the distances between them, offering information on the arrangement of neighboring atoms around the active sites. ADF-STEM with EELS allowed for the examination of the atomic structure in the catalysts, including the distribution of elements and the presence of defects or impurities, which are crucial for understanding the catalyst's performance and stability. These techniques collectively contributed to a deeper understanding of the catalysts' behavior and facilitated the identification of factors affecting their activity and selectivity in the CO2 reduction by ethane process. The key differences in the findings highlighted the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 in controlling the reaction pathways, with implications for optimizing catalyst design for efficient CO2 conversion to desired products.
