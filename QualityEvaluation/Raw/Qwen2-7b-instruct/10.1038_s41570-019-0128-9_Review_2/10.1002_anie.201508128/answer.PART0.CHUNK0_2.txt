<p>Recent exploitation of shale gas reserves has increased the importance of using methane and the heavier gas fractions as raw materials for producing chemicals and fuels.</p>
<p>Methane is the primary component of shale gas, but ethane comprises approximately 10%, with the exact concentration depending on the particular source.</p>
<p>Most ethane is converted by thermal dehydrogenation into ethylene, a valuable commodity chemical, at high temperatures, between 750950C, in the presence of steam, which is energy-intensive and leads to coke formation on the reactor walls and catalyst bed.</p>
<p>CO2 reduction by ethane can proceed through two distinct pathways: 1) reforming to produce synthesis gas (2CO2+C2H64CO+3H2) and 2) oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce ethylene (CO2+C2H6C2H4+CO+H2O).</p>
<p>The Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>It is highly desirable to identify distinct types of catalysts that can efficiently break the CC bond to produce synthesis gas, or selectively break CH bonds of ethane while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts. Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation.</p>
<p>Although there have been studies into CO2 reduction by ethane, details are lacking on how to control the extent of dry reforming versus ODH.</p>
<p>The findings of this study confirm that although there is deactivation, Pt/CeO2 favors the reforming reaction and Mo2C-based catalysts are more selective at producing the ODH product, ethylene.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Figure1a shows that on Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*.</p>
<p>The DFT-calculated energy profile for the reforming of ethane on CeO2/Pt(111) and Pt(111) shows a similar trend; however, the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable on CeO2/Pt(111), which is associated with the strong CeO2Pt(111) interaction and therefore strengthened binding of O-containing species at the interface.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane. Clearly, as shown in the Supporting Information, the reaction order is negative with respect to ethane, meaning increasing concentrations of ethane decreases the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis. Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree.</p>
<p>In summary, Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively.</p>
<p>Spin-polarized DFT26 calculations were performed using plane wave basis set Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.</p>
