The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, were employed to comprehensively analyze the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. The XRD analysis elucidated the crystal structure and lattice parameters, revealing the preferred orientation and crystallinity of the catalysts. XANES provided insights into the local electronic environment around the active metal atoms, allowing for the determination of their oxidation states and coordination numbers. EXAFS was utilized to probe the coordination geometry of the metal atoms and the distances between them, offering information on the arrangement of neighboring atoms around the active sites. ADF-STEM with EELS allowed for the examination of the atomic structure in the catalysts, including the distribution of elements and the presence of defects or impurities, which are crucial for understanding the catalyst's performance and stability. These techniques collectively contributed to a deeper understanding of the catalysts' behavior and facilitated the identification of factors affecting their activity and selectivity in the CO2 reduction by ethane process. The key differences in the findings highlighted the distinct roles of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 in controlling the reaction pathways, with implications for optimizing catalyst design for efficient CO2 conversion to desired products.

<p>Recent exploitation of shale gas reserves has increased the importance of using methane and the heavier gas fractions as raw materials for producing chemicals and fuels.</p>
<p>Methane is the primary component of shale gas, but ethane comprises approximately 10%, with the exact concentration depending on the particular source.</p>
<p>Most ethane is converted by thermal dehydrogenation into ethylene, a valuable commodity chemical, at high temperatures, between 750950C, in the presence of steam, which is energy-intensive and leads to coke formation on the reactor walls and catalyst bed.</p>
<p>CO2 reduction by ethane can proceed through two distinct pathways: 1) reforming to produce synthesis gas (2CO2+C2H64CO+3H2) and 2) oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce ethylene (CO2+C2H6C2H4+CO+H2O).</p>
<p>The Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>For decades, researchers have attempted dry reforming of methane and CO2, but breakthroughs have been difficult because of the high reaction temperatures (ca. 700C) and deactivation of catalysts.</p>
<p>It is highly desirable to identify distinct types of catalysts that can efficiently break the CC bond to produce synthesis gas, or selectively break CH bonds of ethane while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts. Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation.</p>
<p>Although there have been studies into CO2 reduction by ethane, details are lacking on how to control the extent of dry reforming versus ODH.</p>
<p>The findings of this study confirm that although there is deactivation, Pt/CeO2 favors the reforming reaction and Mo2C-based catalysts are more selective at producing the ODH product, ethylene.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Figure1a shows that on Pt(111), the CC bond cleavage of ethane to form CH3*, CO*, and H2O(g) is not only exothermic, but also more favorable compared to the selective CH bond cleavage to form CH2CH2*.</p>
<p>The DFT-calculated energy profile for the reforming of ethane on CeO2/Pt(111) and Pt(111) shows a similar trend; however, the reaction is more thermodynamically favorable on CeO2/Pt(111), which is associated with the strong CeO2Pt(111) interaction and therefore strengthened binding of O-containing species at the interface.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane. Clearly, as shown in the Supporting Information, the reaction order is negative with respect to ethane, meaning increasing concentrations of ethane decreases the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis. Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree.</p>
<p>In summary, Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively.</p>
<p>Spin-polarized DFT26 calculations were performed using plane wave basis set Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.</p>

<p>The recent shale gas boom combined with the requirement to reduce atmospheric CO2 have created an opportunity for using both raw materials (shale gas and CO2) in a single process.</p>
<p>Shale gas is primarily made up of methane, but ethane comprises about 10% and reserves are underutilized.</p>
<p>Two routes have been investigated by combining ethane decomposition with CO2 reduction to produce products of higher value.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate that the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows promise for the production of synthesis gas, while Mo2C-based materials preserve the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene.</p>
<p>These findings are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) characterization of the catalysts under insitu reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Previous research indicates that typical catalysts used for CO2 reduction by ethane are Cr-based oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation.</p>
<p>The high activity of Cr-based catalysts could stem from their ability to exist in several oxidation states, similar to Mn-based molecular sieve catalysts.</p>
<p>Although there have been studies into CO2 reduction by ethane, details are lacking on how to control the extent of dry reforming versus ODH.</p>
<p>In the current study, two types of catalysts, metals (Pt-based) and metal carbides (Mo2C), are investigated under identical reaction conditions to differentiate the two reaction pathways.</p>
<p>To help identify reaction pathways over the two types of catalysts, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to compare differences in binding energies of potential reaction intermediates.</p>
<p>DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces.</p>

<p>The difference in activity between the two classes of catalysts can be further explained through measuring the apparent activation barrier of both CO2 and ethane over Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of rapid deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, reaction order measurements were performed for ethane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the behavior of Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 is more similar to that of pure Mo2C than Mo2C/CeO2, which is likely from the low surface area and CO uptake of Mo2C/CeO2 (0.8μmolg1).</p>
<p>To further understand the mechanism of deactivation over Mo2C, insitu XANES measurements were performed over pure Mo2C.</p>
<p>The XANES measurements of Mo2C show clear changes in the oxidation state of Mo during all gas treatments, except for pure ethane.</p>
<p>Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts.</p>
<p>In summary, Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively.</p>
<p>Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates.</p>
<p>FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD FOCUS ON DESIGNING MATERIALS THAT SELECTIVELY PRODUCE ETHYLENE WITH HIGH STABILITY AND MINIMAL DEACTIVATION.</p>

These advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, such as XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, provide crucial insights into the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in catalysts. They allow for a detailed understanding of how these catalysts perform under reaction conditions. Specifically, they reveal how the catalysts interact with reactants and products, helping to elucidate the mechanisms of reaction and deactivation. These findings are essential for optimizing catalyst design and improving their efficiency and stability in industrial applications.

In the case of Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts, the XANES measurements confirm that treatment with hydrogen (H2) significantly reduces the amount of oxide species formed during the synthesis process, leading to improved catalytic activity. The results also show that upon reacting with ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized, while treatment with pure CO2 fully oxidizes Mo2C. This indicates that the adsorbed oxygen from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane but also contributes to the deactivation seen in Mo2C-based catalysts.

这些先进的原位和离线分析技术，如XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM结合EELS，为催化剂的结构性质、氧化状态、空间分布和活性位点的形态特征提供了关键信息。它们允许深入了解催化剂在反应条件下的性能。具体来说，它们揭示了催化剂如何与反应物和产物相互作用，有助于阐明反应和失活的机制。这些发现对于优化催化剂设计并提高其工业应用中的效率和稳定性至关重要。

针对Pt/CeO2和Mo2C基催化剂的情况，XANES测量表明，氢气（H2）处理显著减少了合成过程中形成的氧化物种，从而提高了催化活性。结果还显示，在与乙烷和CO2反应后，Mo2C被氧化，而纯CO2处理完全氧化了Mo2C。这表明吸附于CO2的氧是形成氧化碳化物相的必要条件，该相可以脱氢乙烷，但同时也导致Mo2C基催化剂的部分失活。
