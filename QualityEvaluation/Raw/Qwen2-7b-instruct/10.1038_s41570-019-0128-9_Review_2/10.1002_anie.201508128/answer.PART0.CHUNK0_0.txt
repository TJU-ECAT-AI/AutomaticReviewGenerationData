<p>Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2.</p>
<p>Deactivation is not only limited to Mo2C/CeO2, but is clearly seen for both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 in Figure2.</p>
<p>By comparing the XANES results in Table3, it is clear that treatment in H2 removes a significant amount of the oxide species formed during passivation of the carbide during synthesis.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The atomic hydrogen on Mo2C(001) tends to recombine and release as hydrogen gas.
2. The low activation barrier for CO2 over Pt/CeO2 indicates the high activity of CeO2-based materials in CO2 reduction.
3. Deactivation occurs in both Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, as evident in Figure 2.
4. Treatment in hydrogen significantly reduces the oxide species on Mo2C, as shown in Table 3.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. Mo2C(001)表面的原子氢倾向于重新组合并释放为氢气。
2. CO2在Pt/CeO2上的低活化能表明CeO2基材料在CO2还原中的高活性。
3. 图2中，Pt/CeO2和Mo2C/γ-Al2O3催化剂均显示出失活现象。
4. 氢处理显著减少了Mo2C上的氧化物物种，如表3所示。
