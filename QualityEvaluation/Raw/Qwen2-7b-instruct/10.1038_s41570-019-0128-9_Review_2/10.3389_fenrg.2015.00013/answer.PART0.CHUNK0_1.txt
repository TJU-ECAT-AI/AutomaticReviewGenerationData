These advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EELS), have been instrumental in elucidating the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. The synergy among these techniques has significantly enhanced our understanding of how these catalysts behave under various conditions. Key differences have been identified between the two catalyst types, which have important implications for their performance and design.
