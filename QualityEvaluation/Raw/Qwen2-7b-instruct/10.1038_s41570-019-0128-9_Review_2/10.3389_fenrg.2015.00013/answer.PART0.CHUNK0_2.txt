[1] "Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been employed to elucidate the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts."
[2] "These methods have provided insights into the catalysts' structure and composition, enabling a deeper understanding of their reactivity and selectivity."
[3] "The findings highlight significant differences between the two catalysts, with Fe3Ni1/CeO2 showing a more uniform distribution of active sites and higher stability under reaction conditions compared to Fe1Ni3/CeO2."
[4] "The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design suggest that the tailored synthesis of active site distribution and the incorporation of CeO2 support play crucial roles in enhancing the catalyst's efficiency and longevity."
