[1] "The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (R = alkyl, aryl) bonds affords a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety (Eq. (27)) and has an industrial interest as it is related to the synthesis of molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates based on the direct carboxylation of substrates such as alcohols, polyols and epoxides."
[2] "The reaction can proceed via attack of free CO2 to the nitrogen atom of metalamido-complex [90,91]."
[3] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[4] "The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 catalyzed by transition metal systems has much been investigated in the last twenty years."
[5] "Under the latter conditions the actual substrate is HCO3 or CO3 2 rather than CO2."

1. The reaction of CO2 with M-OR (alkyl, aryl) bonds results in the formation of a metal-alkylcarbonate moiety, which is of industrial interest for synthesizing molecular organic carbonates and polycarbonates from alcohols, polyols, and epoxides.
2. The reaction of CO2 with metalamido-complexes proceeds through attack by free CO2 onto the nitrogen atom of the complex.
3. The insertion mode of CO2 depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (H, C), which can be influenced by the metal type and ancillary ligands.
4. The direct synthesis of HCO2H from CO2 and H2 using transition metal catalysts has been extensively studied over the past two decades.
5. In certain conditions, the actual substrate for the synthesis is HCO3 or CO3 2, rather than CO2.

1. 与M-OR（烷基，芳基）基团反应，CO2产生金属-烷基碳酸盐基团，这在合成分子有机碳酸盐和聚碳酸盐方面具有工业兴趣，尤其是从醇、多羟基化合物和环氧化合物合成。
2. CO2与金属酰胺配合物的反应通过自由CO2攻击配合物中的氮原子进行。
3. CO2插入模式取决于MAE键（H，C）上的电荷分离，这可能受到金属类型和辅助配体的影响。
4. 过去二十年中，使用过渡金属催化剂直接合成HCO2H从CO2和H2的研究已经进行了广泛。
5. 在某些条件下，实际的反应物是HCO3或CO3 2，而不是CO2。
