[1] "In the field of catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels, chemical catalysis plays a crucial role."
[2] "The reactivity of MAH/CO2 systems has reached high levels of attention because of its relevance to reactions that may have industrial interest such as the hydrogenation of CO2 to afford for- mic acid (Eq. (32)) and the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to other C1 or C1+ molecules."
[3] "In the presence of a suitable metal center and form a metallacyclo-carboxylate (A) (Scheme 11)."
[4] "The synthesis of acrylic acid based on the direct combination of ethene with CO2 (Eq. (38)) is, in principle, a very attractive alternative as it is 100% atom economical as all the atoms of the reactants are found in the target product."
[5] "The direct CH carboxylation with CO2 provides another potential route to carboxylic acids (Eq. (40))."
[6] "CO2 and unsaturated organic substrates (alkynes, allenes, conjugated dienes and others) can be cooligomerized catalytically."
