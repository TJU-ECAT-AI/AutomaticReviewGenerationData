[1] "The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2."
[2] "In order to satisfy such condition, an immediate sub-condition is:the CO2-based process must be a consumer and not a producer of CO2."
[3] "The solvent can be one of the reagents. Solventless reactions can be a good solution. The use of supercritical CO2 may be beneficial."
[4] "Very active catalysts may favor the occurrence of several reactions at the same time, with increase of the conversion yield but lowering selectivity and increasing the post-process separation cost."
[5] "Having set such a frame to the objective of using CO2 for the production of chemicals and fuels, we can face the aspect of how we can use CO2 in profitable ways that contribute to the reduction of the CO2-emission, trying to size the amount of recyclable carbon in man-made processes."

1. The conversion of CO2 into chemicals and fuels is a complex issue due to the need for maintaining a strict carbon balance, emphasizing the avoidance of CO2 over its use. Processes must consume rather than produce CO2 to meet this requirement.

2. To fulfill the condition that a CO2-based process consumes rather than produces CO2, the process must be designed to minimize CO2 emissions compared to existing processes. This necessitates that the process not be a CO2-producing process.

3. Utilizing solvents can be advantageous in CO2 conversion processes. Using the solvent as a reagent can lead to solventless reactions, which might be favorable. The use of supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) can also be beneficial.

4. Highly active catalysts can lead to increased conversion yields, but this may come at the expense of selectivity, requiring additional costs for post-process separation.

5. To effectively utilize CO2 for producing chemicals and fuels in a manner that contributes to reducing CO2 emissions, one must find profitable methods that optimize the use of recyclable carbon in artificial processes.

1. 将CO2转化为化学物质和燃料是一个复杂的问题，因为需要保持严格的碳平衡，强调避免CO2而非其使用。过程必须消耗而不是产生CO2以满足这一要求。

2. 为了满足过程为消耗而不是产生CO2的条件，该过程必须设计成与现有过程相比，其CO2排放量更低。这要求过程不是CO2生成过程。

3. 利用溶剂可以有益于CO2转换过程。将溶剂作为反应物使用可能导致无溶剂反应，这可能更为有利。超临界CO2（sc-CO2）的使用也可能带来益处。

4. 高活性催化剂可能导致较高的转化率，但这也可能导致选择性降低，从而需要额外的成本进行后处理分离。

5. 为了有效地利用CO2进行化学物质和燃料生产，并减少CO2排放，必须找到有利可图的方法，优化人工过程中可回收碳的使用。
