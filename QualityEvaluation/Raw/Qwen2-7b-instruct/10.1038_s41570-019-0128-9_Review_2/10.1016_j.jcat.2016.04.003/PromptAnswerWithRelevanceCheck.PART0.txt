[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[3] "In this regard, it may be of interest to note that acrylic acid has been reported to react with Ni(cod)2 (1 equiv) in the presence of PCy3 (1 equiv) to give the nickel-lactone species Cy3PNi(CH2CH2-C(O)O)."
[4] "A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be co-polymerized with olefins to afford polyesters (Eq. (39))? If one considers the skeleton of the product (A) obtained by coupling an olefin with CO2 (Scheme 11), under which circumstances would it be possible to insert an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of (A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on?"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1. The insertion mode of CO2 into the MAE bond is influenced by the metal's properties and the ancillary ligands attached to it. The entire concept needs a comprehensive explanation.
2. There is still a need for a complete understanding and explanation of the process involved.
3. It has been documented that acrylic acid can react with Ni(cod)2 in the presence of PCy3 to form a nickel-lactone species.
4. Concerning the reader's inquiry, CO2 can indeed be co-polymerized with olefins to create polyesters. The condition for inserting an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of the product formed by coupling an olefin with CO2, followed by another CO2 molecule, and so forth, would be the ability to maintain the integrity of the MAO bond during the insertion process.

State of the art and perspectives in catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels: The distinctive contribution of chemical catalysis and biotechnology

The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial processes were developed as early as in the 1880-1893s, namely:the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3].

Interestingly, in the former process CO2 recovered from the synthesis of NH3 is used. In the 1900s there was not a great interest in developing new applications of CO2. As a matter of fact, since the late 1800s the chemistry of CO (derived from fossil carbon) has been developed for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels that had its golden era in the 1900-1970s, and still today plays a key role in the production of chemicals and fuels. Only in the 1970s there was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct carboxylation.

The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2.

The reactivity patterns outlined above can be recognized easily when considering the behavior of CO2 as a ligand or, more generally, the interaction of CO2 with metal centers. Despite the significant advances achieved since the isolation and X-ray characterization of the first metalCO2 complex [52], this field still represents a challenging research area.

In principle, coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. In general, the C-atom of CO2 bound to a metal in the g1-C or g2-C,O-coordination mode is expected to be less prone to react with nucleophilic species than the free molecule.

The insertion reactions of CO2 into MAE (E = H, C, N, O, etc.) bonds are key steps of stoichiometric processes and catalytic cycles implying CO2 incorporation into organic substrates with the generation of a new EAC bond.

Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR) properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance).

The use of CO2 as a soft and selective oxidant has been demonstrated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene (Eq. (22)) [83].

1. The conversion of CO2 into chemicals and fuels is a complex issue due to the need for maintaining a strict carbon balance, emphasizing the avoidance of CO2 over its use. Processes must consume rather than produce CO2 to meet this requirement.

2. To fulfill the condition that a CO2-based process consumes rather than produces CO2, the process must be designed to minimize CO2 emissions compared to existing processes. This necessitates that the process not be a CO2-producing process.

3. Utilizing solvents can be advantageous in CO2 conversion processes. Using the solvent as a reagent can lead to solventless reactions, which might be favorable. The use of supercritical CO2 (sc-CO2) can also be beneficial.

4. Highly active catalysts can lead to increased conversion yields, but this may come at the expense of selectivity, requiring additional costs for post-process separation.

5. To effectively utilize CO2 for producing chemicals and fuels in a manner that contributes to reducing CO2 emissions, one must find profitable methods that optimize the use of recyclable carbon in artificial processes.

1. 将CO2转化为化学物质和燃料是一个复杂的问题，因为需要保持严格的碳平衡，强调避免CO2而非其使用。过程必须消耗而不是产生CO2以满足这一要求。

2. 为了满足过程为消耗而不是产生CO2的条件，该过程必须设计成与现有过程相比，其CO2排放量更低。这要求过程不是CO2生成过程。

3. 利用溶剂可以有益于CO2转换过程。将溶剂作为反应物使用可能导致无溶剂反应，这可能更为有利。超临界CO2（sc-CO2）的使用也可能带来益处。

4. 高活性催化剂可能导致较高的转化率，但这也可能导致选择性降低，从而需要额外的成本进行后处理分离。

5. 为了有效地利用CO2进行化学物质和燃料生产，并减少CO2排放，必须找到有利可图的方法，优化人工过程中可回收碳的使用。
