[1] "An order of complexity higher would be represented by the integration of biotechnology and catalysis for an effective CO2 conversion, using selective catalysts such as enzymes, or even whole microorganisms, coupled to chemical technologies for energy supply to enzymes, using perennial sources as sun or wind or geothermal as primary energy."
[2] "Such practice would fall again into the utilization of renewable carbon, as the man-made process would perfectly mimic the natural process."
[3] "This paper aimed at making the state of the art in CO2 conversion and giving a perspective on the potential of such technology."
[4] "The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial processes were developed as early as in the 1880-1893s, namely:the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3]."
[5] "It is quite evident that when the oxidation state of the carbon atom is reduced from +4 in CO2 to 2 or lower, a significant amount of energy is needed, while when the oxidation state remains +4 or close to it (+3 in C2 species such as oxalic acid, HO2CACO2H) the reaction is quasi-neutral (i.e., synthesis of organic carbonates and carbamates, located in the circle around CO2) or even exothermic as in the synthesis of inorganic carbonates, which lie well below CO2."
[6] "We anticipate that what has value is the amount of avoided CO2 more than the amount of used CO2: the ratio avoided/used may span over a range 25, with a good average around 3."
[7] "This gives a different weight to the utilization option as 1 Gt/y of avoided CO2 may be a realistic goal in 2030."
[8] "Should CO2 be converted into fuels, a new perspective opens and the Carbon Capture and Utilization-CCU option may play a fundamental role in avoiding CO2."

1. The integration of biotechnology and catalysis for CO2 conversion could use enzymes or whole microorganisms along with chemical technologies powered by renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or geothermal. This would mimic natural carbon processes efficiently.

2. This method of CO2 conversion would utilize renewable carbon resources, as the artificial process would replicate the natural carbon cycle accurately.

3. The paper's aim is to outline the current state of CO2 conversion technologies and to forecast the potential of this technology.

4. The industrial use of CO2 dates back to the late 1800s, with processes like urea synthesis, the Solvay process for soda, and salicylic acid production.

5. Reducing the oxidation state of carbon from +4 in CO2 to 2 or lower requires substantial energy, whereas reactions maintaining or closely resembling +4 or +3 (like in oxalic acid) are quasi-neutral or even exothermic.

6. The value of CO2 conversion lies more in the avoided CO2 emissions rather than the CO2 utilized, with a ratio spanning approximately 25, averaging around 3.

7. Achieving 1 Gt/y of avoided CO2 is a realistic goal for 2030 in terms of CO2 utilization.

8. If CO2 is converted into fuels, this could open up new possibilities for avoiding CO2 emissions, potentially making the CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) option crucial.

1. 对生物技术和催化剂的集成用于CO2转化，可以使用酶或整个微生物，结合化学技术以及由可再生能源如太阳能、风能或地热作为主要能源。这将准确模仿自然碳循环进行高效转化。

2. 这种CO2转化方法会利用可再生碳资源，因为人工过程会精确复制自然碳循环。

3. 论文的目标是概述CO2转化技术的现状，并预测该技术的潜力。

4. CO2的工业应用可以追溯到19世纪末期，包括尿素合成、苏尔维过程生产苏打和水杨酸的生产等过程。

5. 将碳的氧化状态从CO2的+4降低至2或更低需要大量能量，而保持或接近+4或+3（如在草酸中）的反应则是几乎无热量或甚至放热的（如有机碳酸盐和酰胺的合成），这些位于CO2周围的圈层内。

6. CO2转化的价值更多体现在避免排放的CO2量而非使用的CO2量上，其比例大约在25范围内，平均约为3。

7. 在2030年实现每年1 Gt的避免CO2排放是一个现实目标。

8. 如果CO2被转化为燃料，这可能会开启新的可能性，使CCU（碳捕获与利用）选项成为避免CO2排放的关键。
