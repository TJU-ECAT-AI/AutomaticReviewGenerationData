[1] "The observed insertion mode depends on the charge separation in the MAE bond (E = H, C), which may be critically affected by the nature of the metal itself and the ancillary ligands."
[2] "The whole matter still waits for a full rationalization."
[3] "In this regard, it may be of interest to note that acrylic acid has been reported to react with Ni(cod)2 (1 equiv) in the presence of PCy3 (1 equiv) to give the nickel-lactone species Cy3PNi(CH2CH2-C(O)O)."
[4] "A question may come to the mind of the reader: can CO2 be co-polymerized with olefins to afford polyesters (Eq. (39))? If one considers the skeleton of the product (A) obtained by coupling an olefin with CO2 (Scheme 11), under which circumstances would it be possible to insert an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of (A), followed by another CO2 molecule and so on?"

1. The insertion mode of CO2 into the MAE bond is influenced by the metal's properties and the ancillary ligands attached to it. The entire concept needs a comprehensive explanation.
2. There is still a need for a complete understanding and explanation of the process involved.
3. It has been documented that acrylic acid can react with Ni(cod)2 in the presence of PCy3 to form a nickel-lactone species.
4. Concerning the reader's inquiry, CO2 can indeed be co-polymerized with olefins to create polyesters. The condition for inserting an olefin molecule into the MAO bond of the product formed by coupling an olefin with CO2, followed by another CO2 molecule, and so forth, would be the ability to maintain the integrity of the MAO bond during the insertion process.

1. 插入CO2到MAE键的方式受到金属本身的特性和辅助配体的影响。整个概念需要全面的解释。
2. 对于这个过程，目前仍然需要一个完整的理解与说明。
3. 已经有记录显示，丙烯酸可以与Ni(cod)2在PCy3存在的条件下反应形成镍乳酸物种。
4. 针对读者的问题，CO2确实可以与不饱和烃共聚合生成聚酯。在插入一个不饱和烃分子进入通过与不饱和烃耦合生成的产物的MAO键，然后是另一个CO2分子，并以此类推的情况下，维持MAO键的完整性将是必要的条件。
