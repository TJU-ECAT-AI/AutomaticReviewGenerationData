[1] "In the presence of a suitable metal center, CO2 and olefins can react and form a metallacyclo-carboxylate (A)."

[2] "Formation of a terminal carboxylic moiety CACO2 is achieved through various routes such as oxidation of hydrocarbons or aldehydes, base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols, or carbonylation reactions often coupled with H2O addition."

[3] "CO2 and unsaturated organic substrates (alkynes, allenes, conjugated dienes) can be cooligomerized catalytically. These processes open new perspectives in the synthesis of industrially relevant classes of compounds, such as cyclic and linear esters."

[4] "The synthesis of carboxylic acids by oxidative coupling CO2 and olefins has been extensively studied. Olefins, alkenes, and conjugated dienes can react with CO2 in the presence of a suitable metal center to generate a variety of metal-carboxylated species."
