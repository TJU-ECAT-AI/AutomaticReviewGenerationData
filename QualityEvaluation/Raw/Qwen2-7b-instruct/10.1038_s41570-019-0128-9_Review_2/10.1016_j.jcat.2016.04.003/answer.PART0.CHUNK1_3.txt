The literature discusses the catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels, focusing on the insertion of CO2 into various metal complexes. It covers the role of CO2 coordination in insertion processes, oxidative coupling reactions with unsaturated molecules, and the synthesis of carboxylic acids and other functionalized compounds. The text also delves into the direct carboxylation of organic substrates and the challenges associated with it, such as the stabilization of intermediates and the kinetic barriers involved. Additionally, it explores the conversion of CO2 into chemicals and the potential of CO2 as a C1-synthon for the synthesis of fine and commodity chemicals. The literature outlines the importance of these catalytic processes in implementing more direct or safer synthetic routes and reducing the environmental impact of chemical synthesis.
