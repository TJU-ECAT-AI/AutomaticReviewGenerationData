State of the art and perspectives in catalytic processes for CO2 conversion into chemicals and fuels: The distinctive contribution of chemical catalysis and biotechnology

The chemical utilization of CO2 is not a new attitude. Industrial processes were developed as early as in the 1880-1893s, namely:the synthesis of urea [1], the soda Solvay process, the synthesis of hydrogen carbonates [2], and the production of salicylic acid [3].

Interestingly, in the former process CO2 recovered from the synthesis of NH3 is used. In the 1900s there was not a great interest in developing new applications of CO2. As a matter of fact, since the late 1800s the chemistry of CO (derived from fossil carbon) has been developed for the synthesis of chemicals and fuels that had its golden era in the 1900-1970s, and still today plays a key role in the production of chemicals and fuels. Only in the 1970s there was a revival in the exploitation of CO2 as additive to CO in the synthesis of methanol [4] and as co-monomer in the pioneering production of organic carbonates from epoxides [5], via direct carboxylation.

The conversion of CO2 is a quite complex issue [8], complicated by the fact that if it targets carbon mitigation, the carbon balance must be kept under strict control, with the concept of avoided CO2 winning on that of used CO2.

The reactivity patterns outlined above can be recognized easily when considering the behavior of CO2 as a ligand or, more generally, the interaction of CO2 with metal centers. Despite the significant advances achieved since the isolation and X-ray characterization of the first metalCO2 complex [52], this field still represents a challenging research area.

In principle, coordinated carbon dioxide can undergo either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. In general, the C-atom of CO2 bound to a metal in the g1-C or g2-C,O-coordination mode is expected to be less prone to react with nucleophilic species than the free molecule.

The insertion reactions of CO2 into MAE (E = H, C, N, O, etc.) bonds are key steps of stoichiometric processes and catalytic cycles implying CO2 incorporation into organic substrates with the generation of a new EAC bond.

Coordination of carbon dioxide to a metal center produces marked changes of the structural and spectroscopic (IR, 13C NMR) properties of the cumulene (loss of linearity; elongation of C@O bonds; shift of the IR frequencies and 13C NMR resonance).

The use of CO2 as a soft and selective oxidant has been demonstrated in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to afford styrene (Eq. (22)) [83].
