1. What matters more than the amount of CO2 used is the amount of CO2 avoided. In the process based on phosgene, about 69 t of CO2 is emitted compared to 1.32 t in the direct carboxylation.

2. Ionic metal hydroxides react with CO2 through the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide ion onto the electrophilic carbon of CO2.

3. Basic amines are used not only for capturing CO2 from gas streams, but also for synthetic purposes.

4. Coordination of CO2 to metals can lead to significant changes in the IR spectrum of the CO2 moiety.

5. The behavior of CO2 as a ligand or in interaction with metal centers can be recognized by its reactivity patterns.

6. Coordination to a metal center results in notable alterations to the structure and spectroscopic properties of CO2, including loss of linearity, elongation of C@O bonds, shifts in IR frequencies, and 13C NMR resonance.

7. CO2 has been used as a precursor in chemical synthesis for bulk and fine chemicals since the 1980s.

8. Predicting the behavior of reactive systems based on assumptions is speculative.

1. 避免的二氧化碳量比使用的二氧化碳量更重要。基于光气的过程会排放大约69吨二氧化碳，而直接羧化过程则排放1.32吨二氧化碳。

2. 无机金属氢氧化物与二氧化碳反应通过羟基离子对二氧化碳中电负性碳的亲核攻击。

3. 基本胺不仅用于从气体流中捕获二氧化碳，而且还用于合成目的。

4. CO2与金属的配位会导致其红外光谱中的CO2基团显著变化。

5. 作为配体或与金属中心相互作用时，二氧化碳的反应模式可以被识别。

6. 配位到金属中心会导致结构和光谱属性（如线性的丢失、C@O键的伸长、红外频率和13C NMR共振的偏移）的明显改变。

7. 自1980年代以来，二氧化碳一直被用作制造大宗化学品和精细化学品的前体。

8. 根据假设预测反应系统的行为是推测性的。
