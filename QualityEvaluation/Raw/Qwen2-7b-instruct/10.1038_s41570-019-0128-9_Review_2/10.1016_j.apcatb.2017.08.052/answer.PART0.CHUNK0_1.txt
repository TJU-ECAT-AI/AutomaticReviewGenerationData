These advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, synergistically contributed to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These methods provided insights into the catalysts' dynamic behavior and reactivity under operating conditions. XRD determined the crystalline structure and phase composition, while XANES and EXAFS elucidated the local coordination environment and oxidation state of the active metal species. ADF-STEM with EELS offered high-resolution imaging and elemental mapping capabilities, revealing the spatial distribution of the active sites within the catalyst particles.
