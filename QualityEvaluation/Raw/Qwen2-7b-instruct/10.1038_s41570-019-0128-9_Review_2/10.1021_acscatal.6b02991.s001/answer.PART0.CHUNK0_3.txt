[1] "The synergy of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (ADF-STEM with EELS) has significantly enhanced our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in complex catalyst systems like Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2."
[2] "These techniques have revealed the intricate interplay between the composition, structure, and activity of the catalysts, providing insights into how different components influence each other and affect catalytic performance."
[3] "In particular, the combination of XRD and XANES/EXAFS has allowed for detailed characterization of the local environment around active sites, including the identification of specific coordination environments and the determination of oxidation states under various reaction conditions."
[4] "ADF-STEM with EELS, on the other hand, offers high-resolution imaging and chemical analysis, enabling the mapping of elemental distributions and chemical states within the catalyst particles, thus providing a comprehensive view of the catalyst's microstructure and its impact on activity."
[5] "By integrating the results from these techniques, researchers have been able to correlate structural features with catalytic behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the performance of these catalysts."
[6] "Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of considering both the bulk properties and the local environment of active sites when designing catalysts for specific applications."
