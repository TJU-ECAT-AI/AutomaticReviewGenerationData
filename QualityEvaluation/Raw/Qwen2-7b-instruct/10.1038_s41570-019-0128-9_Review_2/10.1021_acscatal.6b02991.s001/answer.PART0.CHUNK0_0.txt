Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, such as XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, have been used to explore the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These methods offer a detailed perspective on the catalysts' surface chemistry and structure, which aids in understanding their catalytic activity and selectivity. The combination of in situ and ex situ techniques enables the observation of both dynamic and static processes under different conditions, improving the precision of the characterization. Notable differences between the two catalysts are attributed to their composition, influencing the properties of the active sites and consequently affecting their performance. The insights gained from these studies suggest opportunities for customizing catalysts with optimized active sites to achieve higher catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
