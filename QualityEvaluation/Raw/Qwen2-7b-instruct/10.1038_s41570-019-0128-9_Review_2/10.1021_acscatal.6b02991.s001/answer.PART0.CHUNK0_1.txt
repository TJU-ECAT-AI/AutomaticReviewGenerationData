[1] "Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the detailed structure of the active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts."
[2] "XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis revealed the crystalline structure of the catalysts, providing insights into the spatial arrangement of the components."
[3] "XANES (X-ray absorption near-edge structure) and EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) were utilized to determine the local environment around the active sites, including the coordination geometry and oxidation states of the metal species."
[4] "ADF-STEM (ab initio density functional theory-scanning transmission electron microscopy) coupled with EELS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) was instrumental in visualizing the atomic-scale morphology of the catalysts, highlighting the active site regions."
[5] "The synergy between these techniques allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of the active sites."
[6] "Key differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts were observed in their structural arrangements and the resulting effects on catalytic performance."

These advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. They provide insights into the crystalline structure through XRD, local environment and oxidation states through XANES and EXAFS, atomic-scale morphology through ADF-STEM with EELS, and differences between catalysts in their structural arrangements and catalytic performance.
