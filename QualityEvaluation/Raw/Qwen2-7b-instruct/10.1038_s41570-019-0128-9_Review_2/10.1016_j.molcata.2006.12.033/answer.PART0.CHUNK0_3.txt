<p>Table 1 presents the catalytic conversions and selectivity of oxidative dehydrogenations of ethane with CO2 to ethylene over modified and unmodified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts at various temperatures.</p>
<p>The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst.</p>
<p>Inversely, the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst showed the highest ethane and CO2 conversions, much higher than even the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while it demonstrated the lowest selectivity to ethylene among the prepared catalysts.</p>
<p>No diffraction peaks of Cr2O3 and modifiers were observed on the XRD spectra of modified and unmodified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composites, probably due to their lower intensities or highly dispersed in the composites.</p>
<p>According to Bachiller-Baeza and Jung [16,17], the monoclinic structure of ZrO2 brings about stronger surface adsorption sites for CO2 than the tetragonal structure.</p>
<p>Only the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite exhibited monoclinic ZrO2 among these catalysts, so there were more activity sites that can adsorb and activate CO2 on its surface than other catalysts.</p>
<p>The XPS spectra of Cr 2p on all catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Two peaks occurred for Cr 2p3/2 spectra on all catalysts: one at 576 eV and the other at 579 eV.</p>
<p>The addition of modifiers increased the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts, and the Fe5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst showed the greatest Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio.</p>
<p>From the XPS spectra of O 1s over the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, a C 1s peak at 288.2 eV can be observed in addition to the C 1s peak of hydrocarbon contaminant carbon at 284.6 eV.</p>
<p>The new type of surface oxygen species (near 532 eV) has been reported to be adsorbed oxygen species (O, O22) (hereafter denoted as OIII).</p>
<p>The lattice oxygen species (OI) are mainly responsible for selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, and adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) are involved in deep oxidation, leading to COx product formation.</p>
<p>The results show that acidic and basic sites coexist on the surface of all catalysts.</p>

The study elucidates how the introduction of Fe, Co, and Mn oxides into Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts significantly enhances ethylene selectivity during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, while Ni incorporation primarily promotes side reactions such as reforming and cracking. The enhanced ethylene selectivity is attributed to the formation of more active sites for ethane activation and CO2 adsorption, as evidenced by the increased concentration of adsorbed oxygen species (OIII) and strong acid sites on the catalyst surface. The monoclinic structure of ZrO2 in the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, which is induced by the addition of Ni oxide, leads to stronger surface adsorption sites for CO2, further enhancing ethylene production. The distribution of chromium species, oxygen species, and acid/base properties on the catalyst surface collectively determines the catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of these factors in optimizing catalyst performance for the specific reaction conditions.

研究揭示了将Fe、Co和Mn氧化物引入Cr2O3/ZrO2纳米复合催化剂中，显著提高了乙烷与CO2进行氧化脱氢生成乙烯的乙炔选择性，而Ni的引入主要促进副反应如重整和裂解。增强的乙炔选择性归因于乙烷活化和CO2吸附活性位点的形成，这从催化剂表面吸附氧物种（OIII）和强酸位点的增加中可以观察到。Ni5-Cr10/Zr纳米复合催化剂中的ZrO2单斜结构的形成，是由Ni氧化物诱导的，导致了更强的CO2表面吸附位点，进一步增强了乙炔的产生。催化剂表面铬物种、氧物种以及酸/碱性质的分布共同决定了脱氢过程的催化活性，强调了这些因素在优化特定反应条件下的催化剂性能的重要性。
