[1] "The objective of this work is to attempt to improve the ethylene selectivity in the dehydrogenation of ethanewith CO2 on the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst with the addition of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Co oxides."
[2] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[3] "Based on this result and other proposed reaction pathways [1,7], the overall reactions can be described as follows:"
[4] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[5] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, contributed to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. Specifically, XRD provided insights into the crystal structure and phase composition, while XANES and EXAFS helped elucidate the local environment around transition metal sites and the coordination geometry of oxygen atoms. ADF-STEM with EELS allowed for the examination of the elemental composition and nanoscale morphology of the catalysts. These techniques collectively revealed how the modifiers influenced the catalyst's properties, affecting the distribution of chromium species, oxygen species, and acid/base properties on the surface, thus impacting catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide.

The key differences in findings included variations in the extent of modification effects on the catalyst's textural and structural properties, the spatial distribution of active sites, and the overall catalytic performance. For instance, Fe, Co, and Mn oxides led to distinct changes in the catalyst's morphology, oxidation states, and surface properties, resulting in altered selectivities and efficiencies in the dehydrogenation reaction. The implication of these findings for catalyst performance and design lies in the potential to tailor catalyst properties through strategic modification, thereby optimizing the balance between selectivity and conversion rates for desired products in the dehydrogenation process.
