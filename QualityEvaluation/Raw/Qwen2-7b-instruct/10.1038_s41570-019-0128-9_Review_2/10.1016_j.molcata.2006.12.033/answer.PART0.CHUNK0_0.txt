[1] "In the past decade, nano-particles (especially, oxides) attracted much attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique physical and chemical properties."
[2] "Chemical and structural properties of these catalysts were characterized and these results were used to establish a correlation with their catalytic activity."
[3] "Based on this result and other proposed reaction pathways, the overall reactions can be described as follows:"
[4] "The ethylene was produced by the direct dehydrogenation of ethane (1) and the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 (3), which could also be seen as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction (1) coupled with the reverse water-gas shift reaction (2)."
[5] "The ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts was markedly higher than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst, while their ethane and CO2 conversions were lower than that of the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst."
[6] "In the catalytic experiment, the ethylene selectivity of the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts were markedly higher than that of the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, which mainly favored the reforming and cracking reactions."
[7] "The nature of the modifier exerted an influence upon the textural and structural property of catalyst, distribution of chromium species and oxygen species, and acid/base property of the catalyst surface, which in turn determined the catalytic activity of modified Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide."

1. In the last decade, nanoparticles, particularly oxides, have garnered significant interest in heterogeneous catalysis due to their distinctive physical and chemical properties.

2. The chemical and structural properties of the catalysts were studied and utilized to correlate them with their catalytic performance.

3. The overall reactions for the dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide could be summarized as: direct dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation, and a coupled process of ethane dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift.

4. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts showed higher ethylene selectivity compared to the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst.

5. The ethane and CO2 conversions were lower for the Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts compared to the Cr2O3/ZrO2 nano-composite catalyst.

6. The Fe5-Cr10/Zr, Mn5-Cr10/Zr, and Co5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalysts showed higher ethylene selectivity than the Ni5-Cr10/Zr nano-composite catalyst, which favored reforming and cracking reactions.

7. The type of modifier affected the textural and structural characteristics of the catalyst, the distribution of chromium and oxygen species, and the acid/base properties of the catalyst surface, thus impacting the catalytic activity in the ethane dehydrogenation process using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.
