Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.3389/fenrg.2015.00013\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.3389/fenrg.2015.00013\], \[10.3389/fenrg.2015.00013\], and \[10.3389/fenrg.2015.00013\]. The utilization of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EELS), has provided profound insights into the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. This synergy among the techniques has significantly enhanced our understanding of their behavior under various operational conditions. The findings highlight key differences between the two catalyst types, which have significant implications for their performance and design.
