340 MoO3/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnating silica (Cab-O-Sil, area: 200 m2/g) with a basic solution of ammonium paramolybdate to yield a nominal 2wt% of MOO3.
The flow rate was in most cases 12 ml/min. The carrier gas was Ar.
Relevant XPS spectra are presented in Fig. lB.
Characteristic XPS data for different Mo compounds are collected in Table 1.
The same IR spectroscopic measurements have been carried out in the presence of CO2.
We found practically identical spectral features as in the absence of CO2 with slight variation in the position and intensities of the absorption bands.
First we tested the catalytic effect of pure Mo2C.
The ratio of the gas mixture, C02/C3H8,was 1.0.
Variation of the flow rate showed that the conversion of propane decreased with the rise of space velocity, but the rate of the formation of propylene slightly increased.
Comparison was made at 60 rain of reaction time.
Results are presented in Fig. 3.
In the interpretation of the results of catalytic measurements it appears clearly that CO2 opened a new route for the formation of propylene.

The synthesis of the MoO3/SiO2 catalyst involved impregnating silica with a basic solution of ammonium paramolybdate to achieve a nominal 2wt% of MOO3. The catalytic experiments utilized argon as the carrier gas, and the flow rate was typically set at 12 ml/min. The XPS spectra for various Mo compounds are listed in Table 1. The IR spectroscopic measurements conducted in the presence of CO2 revealed minor variations in the positions and intensities of the absorption bands compared to the absence of CO2. When pure Mo2C was tested, the catalytic effect was examined under a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 1.0. By adjusting the flow rate, it was observed that the propane conversion decreased with increased space velocity, while the formation rate of propylene slightly increased. The catalytic performance of Mo2C was compared across different reaction times, with the results illustrated in Figure 3. The analysis of the catalytic measurements indicated that CO2 introduced a new pathway for propylene formation.

MoO3/SiO2催化剂的合成是通过将硅胶与四氨合钼酸铵的基本溶液浸渍，以获得名义上2wt%的MOO3。催化实验使用氩气作为载气，通常的流速为12 ml/min。Table 1列出了各种Mo化合物的XPS谱图。在存在CO2的情况下进行的红外光谱测量显示，吸收带的位置和强度与没有CO2的情况相比有轻微的变化。当纯Mo2C被测试时，催化效果在CO2/C3H8比例为1.0的条件下进行评估。通过调整流速，观察到随着空间速度的增加，丙烷转化率下降，而丙烯生成速率略有增加。在不同反应时间下对Mo2C的催化性能进行了比较，结果在图3中展示。催化测量分析表明，CO2引入了丙烯形成的新途径。

The XPS spectra demonstrate the slow reaction of CO2 with Mo2C at 873 K, evidenced by the emergence of peaks at 233.3 and 236.2 eV, indicative of Mo oxidation. Propane interacts with the active oxygen of the carbide, forming a surface complex and leading to C-H bond cleavage, particularly in weaker methylene C-H bonds compared to methyl groups. Hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation reacts with oxygen to form water, and CO2 can react with hydrogen to produce methane and water, contributing to the formation of various hydrocarbons and water.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over supported Mo2C catalysts leads to the formation of various hydrocarbons, primarily propylene, along with ethylene, methane, and butane. The process involves the oxidation of Mo2C by CO2, resulting in the formation of Mo oxycarbide. This compound is believed to play a crucial role in activating propane, facilitating its conversion into propylene. The selectivity towards propylene is quite high, reaching 85-90% under the conditions of 773-873 K. The presence of CO2 influences the formation of surface species such as 7r-bonded and di-o-bonded propylene, and propylidyne, which are identified through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

The interaction of CO2 with Mo2C catalysts was studied. Initially, CO2 adsorbs weakly and non-dissociatively on Mo2C catalysts below 773 K. At higher temperatures, CO2 oxidizes the Mo2C, a process that was followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts are effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The selectivity to propylene at temperatures ranging from 773 to 873 K is 85-90%. Other hydrocarbon products include ethylene, methane, and butane. It is hypothesized that the Mo oxycarbide formed in the reaction between CO2 and Mo2C plays a crucial role in activating propane.
