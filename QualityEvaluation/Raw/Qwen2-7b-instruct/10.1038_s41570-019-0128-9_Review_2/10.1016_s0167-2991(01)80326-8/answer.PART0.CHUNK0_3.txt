The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over supported Mo2C catalysts leads to the formation of various hydrocarbons, primarily propylene, along with ethylene, methane, and butane. The process involves the oxidation of Mo2C by CO2, resulting in the formation of Mo oxycarbide. This compound is believed to play a crucial role in activating propane, facilitating its conversion into propylene. The selectivity towards propylene is quite high, reaching 85-90% under the conditions of 773-873 K. The presence of CO2 influences the formation of surface species such as 7r-bonded and di-o-bonded propylene, and propylidyne, which are identified through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

在Mo2C支持催化剂上进行的丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应，主要生成丙烯、乙烯、甲烷和丁烷等烃类化合物。该过程包括CO2对Mo2C的氧化，形成Mo氧碳化物。这种化合物被认为在激活丙烷、促进其转化为丙烯方面起着关键作用。在773-873 K的条件下，丙烯的选择性很高，达到85-90%。CO2的存在影响表面物种的形成，如π键合和二价键合的丙烯以及丙炔，这些通过傅里叶变换红外光谱法被识别出来。
