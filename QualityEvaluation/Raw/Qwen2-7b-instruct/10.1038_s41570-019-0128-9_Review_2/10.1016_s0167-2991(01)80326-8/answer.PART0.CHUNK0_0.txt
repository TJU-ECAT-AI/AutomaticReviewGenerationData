340 MoO3/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by impregnating silica (Cab-O-Sil, area: 200 m2/g) with a basic solution of ammonium paramolybdate to yield a nominal 2wt% of MOO3.
XPS (Kratos XSAM 800) was used to follow the oxidation of Mo2C with CO2.
Before the study of the interaction of propane with Mo2C, we examined the reaction between MoO3 and propane.
Characteristic XPS data for different Mo compounds are collected in Table 1.
The effects of the CO2/C3H8 ratio on the rate and selectivities of several products were investigated at 873 K.
