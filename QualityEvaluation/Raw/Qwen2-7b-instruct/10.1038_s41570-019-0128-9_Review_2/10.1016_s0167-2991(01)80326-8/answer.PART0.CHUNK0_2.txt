[1] "In Fig.1A we show the XPS spectra of Mo2C/SiO2 treated with CO2. It shows that CO2 reacts slowly with Mo2C at 873 K, but the oxidation of Mo can be clearly seen by the appearance of new peaks at 233.3 and 236.2 eV."

The XPS spectra demonstrate the slow reaction of CO2 with Mo2C at 873 K, evidenced by the emergence of peaks at 233.3 and 236.2 eV, indicative of Mo oxidation. Propane interacts with the active oxygen of the carbide, forming a surface complex and leading to C-H bond cleavage, particularly in weaker methylene C-H bonds compared to methyl groups. Hydrogen produced from propane dehydrogenation reacts with oxygen to form water, and CO2 can react with hydrogen to produce methane and water, contributing to the formation of various hydrocarbons and water.

XPS光谱显示，在873 K下，CO2与Mo2C缓慢反应，通过出现233.3和236.2 eV的峰值，表明Mo的氧化。丙烷与碳化物中的活性氧形成表面复合物，并导致C-H键断裂，特别是在较弱的甲基C-H键相比。从丙烷脱氢产生的氢与氧气反应形成水，而CO2可以与氢反应生成甲烷和水，从而产生各种烃类和水。
