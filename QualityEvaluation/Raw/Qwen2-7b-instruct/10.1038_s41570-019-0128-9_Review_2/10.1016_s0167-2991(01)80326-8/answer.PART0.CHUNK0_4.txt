The interaction of CO2 with Mo2C catalysts was studied. Initially, CO2 adsorbs weakly and non-dissociatively on Mo2C catalysts below 773 K. At higher temperatures, CO2 oxidizes the Mo2C, a process that was followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts are effective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The selectivity to propylene at temperatures ranging from 773 to 873 K is 85-90%. Other hydrocarbon products include ethylene, methane, and butane. It is hypothesized that the Mo oxycarbide formed in the reaction between CO2 and Mo2C plays a crucial role in activating propane.

与Mo2C催化剂的相互作用被研究。最初，CO2在低于773 K的温度下以弱非解离的方式吸附在Mo2C催化剂上。在较高温度下，CO2氧化Mo2C，这一过程通过X射线光电子能谱进行了跟踪。Mo2C/SiO2催化剂对于丙烷的氧化脱氢反应是有效的。在773至873 K的温度范围内，丙烯的选择性为85-90%。其他烃类产物包括乙烯、甲烷和丁烷。推测在CO2与Mo2C反应形成的Mo氧化羰基中，对丙烷的活化起着关键作用。
