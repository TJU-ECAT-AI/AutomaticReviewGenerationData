[1] "The TCD reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a reasonable yield without a catalyst. However, both metal and carbon materials are active catalysts that can lower the reaction temperature."
[2] "The rate of methane decomposition activity on the transition metals follows the order: Co, Ru, Ni, Rh > Pt, Re, Ir > Pd, Cu, W, Fe, Mo."
[3] "Carbon deposits produced in the reaction also dramatically reduce the surface area of the carbon catalyst, which leads to the deactivation of the catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon involves the use of catalysts, both metal and carbon-based, to lower the reaction temperature required for the process. Transition metals such as cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), nickel (Ni), and rhodium (Rh) are more active than others like palladium (Pd), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), iron (Fe), and molybdenum (Mo) in this context. The presence of carbon deposits during the reaction can decrease the surface area of the carbon catalyst, leading to its deactivation.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

TCD将甲烷分解为纯氢和固体碳的过程利用催化剂，无论是金属还是碳基材料，都能降低反应所需的温度。过渡金属如钴（Co）、钌（Ru）、镍（Ni）和钯（Rh）在这一过程中更为活跃，比其他金属如钯（Pd）、铜（Cu）、钨（W）、铁（Fe）和钼（Mo）更有效。反应中产生的碳沉积物会减少碳催化剂的表面积，导致催化剂失效。

[1] "The TCD process requires more than 1500 K to achieve a reasonable yield without a catalyst. However, both metal and carbon materials are active catalysts that can lower the reaction temperature."
[2] "For example, for Ni-based catalysts, the optimum loading of Ni was 40%, while the particle size of the Ni catalysts is pivotal for good activity."
[3] "The TCD process offers a convenient way to maximize the production of hydrogen gas from the methane molecule, and many forms of value-added carbon products add importance to this process."
[4] "With activated carbon and carbon black, which are the most widely used catalysts, activated carbon shows a higher initial reaction rate and a faster deactivation rate than carbon black."
[5] "It was suggested that the pores in activated carbon, especially the micropores, are readily blocked by the carbonaceous deposits, whereas the surface of carbon black is much more accessible to methane since the size of the carbon black particles is between 10 and 250 nm."
[6] "The reasons why this process is not applied on a large scale are: first, a continuous reaction process that is suitable for TCD industrial application is still to be developed."
[7] "Second, carbon market value is believed to be a key factor in the economics of the TCD process."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon requires high temperatures without a catalyst, but metals and carbon materials can lower the reaction temperature. For Ni-based catalysts, an optimum loading of 40% is ideal, and the particle size significantly impacts activity. The TCD process benefits from hydrogen production maximization and adds value through various carbon products. Activated carbon exhibits a higher initial reaction rate but a quicker deactivation compared to carbon black. The micropores in activated carbon are prone to blocking by carbon deposits, whereas the surface of carbon black remains accessible due to its particle size range. The TCD process faces challenges in developing a continuous industrial process and establishing economic viability, primarily due to the high production of carbon and its market value.

热催化分解（TCD）将甲烷分解为纯氢气和固体碳，需要在没有催化剂的情况下达到较高的温度。然而，金属和碳材料可以降低反应温度。对于Ni基催化剂，理想的负载量为40%，而催化剂的颗粒大小对活性有重大影响。TCD过程通过最大化氢气的生产以及各种碳产品的价值增加而受益。活性炭表现出更高的初始反应速率，但比碳黑更快的失活。活性炭的微孔容易被碳沉积物堵塞，而碳黑的表面由于其颗粒尺寸范围而保持可访问性。TCD过程面临发展连续工业过程的挑战，并且在经济可行性方面存在困难，主要原因是大量生产碳及其市场价值。

Answer: The three possible reforming processes for the conversion of methane to syngas are: steam reforming (eqn 1), CO2 reforming (eqn 2), and partial oxidation of methane to syngas (eqn 3). These processes produce syngas with different CO/H2 ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 3, respectively).
