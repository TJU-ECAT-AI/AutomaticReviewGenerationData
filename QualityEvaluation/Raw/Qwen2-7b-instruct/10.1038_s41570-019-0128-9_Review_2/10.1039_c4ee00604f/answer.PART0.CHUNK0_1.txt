[1] "The TCD reaction requires more than 1500 K to achieve a reasonable yield without a catalyst. However, both metal and carbon materials are active catalysts that can lower the reaction temperature."
[2] "The rate of methane decomposition activity on the transition metals follows the order: Co, Ru, Ni, Rh > Pt, Re, Ir > Pd, Cu, W, Fe, Mo."
[3] "Carbon deposits produced in the reaction also dramatically reduce the surface area of the carbon catalyst, which leads to the deactivation of the catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermocatalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane to pure hydrogen and solid carbon involves the use of catalysts, both metal and carbon-based, to lower the reaction temperature required for the process. Transition metals such as cobalt (Co), ruthenium (Ru), nickel (Ni), and rhodium (Rh) are more active than others like palladium (Pd), copper (Cu), tungsten (W), iron (Fe), and molybdenum (Mo) in this context. The presence of carbon deposits during the reaction can decrease the surface area of the carbon catalyst, leading to its deactivation.

TCD将甲烷分解为纯氢和固体碳的过程利用催化剂，无论是金属还是碳基材料，都能降低反应所需的温度。过渡金属如钴（Co）、钌（Ru）、镍（Ni）和钯（Rh）在这一过程中更为活跃，比其他金属如钯（Pd）、铜（Cu）、钨（W）、铁（Fe）和钼（Mo）更有效。反应中产生的碳沉积物会减少碳催化剂的表面积，导致催化剂失效。
