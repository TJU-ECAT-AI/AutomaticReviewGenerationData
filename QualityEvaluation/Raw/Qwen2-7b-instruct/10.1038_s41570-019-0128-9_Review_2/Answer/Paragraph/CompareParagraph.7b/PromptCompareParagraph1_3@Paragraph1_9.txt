In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites
The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b). Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.5&ndash;4.0 nm. The existence of Fe&ndash;Ce bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93. The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f).
The above characterization data allow the active sites for CO2-ODH and DR to be deduced93. In Ni/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 helps enable facile CO2 dissociation to give a *O species that participates in C2H6 activation on the Ni particles at the Ni&ndash;CeO2 interfaces. When a small amount of Fe was added, the resulting Fe1Ni3/CeO2 materials feature Ni&ndash;CeOx interfacial sites that process C2H6 and CO2 faster than other sites, and allow the catalyst to maintain high CO selectivity (>95%). The Ni&ndash;CeOx interfaces were thus identified as the most likely active sites for DR of C2H6 with CO2 over Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 6). When a large amount of Fe was introduced, a material of formula Fe3Ni1/CeO2 resulted, which has amorphous FeOx regions that extend far enough to form Ni&ndash;FeOx interfacial sites on the perimeter of Ni particles (these probably form at the expense of Ni&ndash;CeOx sites). It appears likely that the Ni&ndash;FeOx interfaces are responsible for the high activity of Fe1Ni3/CeO2 for CO2-ODH of C2H6.
Fig. 6: Conversion of C2H6 and CO2 occurs at interfacial sites of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts.
Interfacial Ni&ndash;FeOx sites perform selective C&ndash;H cleavage of C2H6 to dehydrogenate it in tandem with CO2 reduction to produce C2H4. By contrast, Ni&ndash;CeOx sites perform C&ndash;H and C&ndash;C cleavage and mediate the dry reforming of C2H6 with CO2 to produce synthesis gas93.
DFT calculations of reactions on FeNi surfaces
The in situ measurements give us an idea of the possible FeNi structures responsible for catalytic activity. These candidate structures can be studied using DFT calculations to investigate possible reaction pathways for the oxidative C&ndash;H bond cleavage (dehydrogenation; Fig. 7) and C&ndash;C bond scission (reforming). The calculated enthalpy changes suggest that the first step along the C&ndash;H bond cleavage pathway is thermodynamically more favourable than the C&ndash;C bond cleavage pathway on FeOx/Ni(111). Comparing the activation energy (Ea) for each process, the *O-mediated scission of the first C&ndash;H bond in C2H6 is likely the most difficult step in the oxidative C&ndash;H and C&ndash;C cleavage of C2H6. On Ni(111), *O insertion (*C2H5 + *O → *OC2H5 + *, where the latter asterisk denotes a free surface site) is part of the C&ndash;C cleavage pathway (∆E = −0.14 eV and Ea = 0.44 eV) and is thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable than oxidative dehydrogenation (*C2H5 + *O → *C2H4 + *OH) along the C&ndash;H cleavage pathway (∆E = 0.09 eV and Ea = 0.97 eV). On Ni-terminated Ni3Fe(111), *O insertion to form *OC2H5 should occur at a comparable rate to oxidative dehydrogenation to give *C2H4. On bulk-terminated Ni3Fe(111), the activation energy of oxidative dehydrogenation is 0.16 eV lower than that for *O insertion. As a result, bulk-terminated Ni3Fe(111) likely promotes C&ndash;H cleavage in preference to C&ndash;C cleavage, suggesting that the presence of surface Fe sites is essential for selective C&ndash;H cleavage and C2H4 formation. Furthermore, the DFT calculations on FeOx/Ni(111) show that oxidative dehydrogenation (∆E = −0.13 eV and Ea = 1.08 eV) is more favourable than *O insertion (∆E = −0.04 eV and Ea = 1.67 eV). Thus, in agreement with the experimental results, the DFT calculations predict that the Ni&ndash;FeOx interface should be active for the dehydrogenation of C2H6, leading to the high CO2-ODH selectivity93.
CO2-ODH of C2H6 over carbide-based catalysts
Metal carbides such as Mo2C are highly attractive catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions because they are active for CO2 and alkane activation and have redox properties similar to those of reducible oxides94,95,96,97,98. For example, Mo2C and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 showed enhanced selectivity towards C2H4 production through the CO2-ODH pathway99. The DFT-calculated energy profiles of oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming of C2H6 over Mo2C(001) illustrated that oxidative C&ndash;H cleavage to give *C2H4 and H2 is energetically more favourable than C&ndash;C scission to form reforming products. The calculations indicate that Mo2C(001) has a very high affinity to adsorb atomic O. Flow reactor experiments were consistent with these predictions, and the Mo2C catalyst showed a C2H4 selectivity of 60%. These experiments also highlighted the different activities of unsupported and supported Mo2C. Mo2C supported on CeO2 showed lower activity than unsupported Mo2C, but the latter has slightly higher activity when supported on γ-Al2O3, a more acidic oxide. The low steady-state activity of Mo2C/CeO2 was attributed to the high initial intrinsic activity of CeO2 and Mo2C for C=O bond scission, resulting in an excess of *O on the surface that deactivates Mo2C/CeO2 through complete oxidation. The Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst also suffers from deactivation because it binds the *C2H4 product strongly, such that C2H4 undergoes decomposition and/or polymerization to form coke. In situ XANES measurements showed that, although CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase that dehydrogenates C2H6, excessive CO2 can lead to complete deactivation. Catalyst regeneration is possible by co-feeding H2 (5 vol%) with the reactants or by exposing the catalyst to H2 after the reaction. Lastly, we note that the selectivity and stability of Mo2C catalysts for CO2-ODH of C2H6 can be enhanced by partial oxidation of Mo2C, which affords a material that is slower at C&ndash;C cleavage of C2H6 and better at producing C2H4 (ref.100). Furthermore, the introduction of Fe accelerated the formation of *O, which increases C2H4 yield and improves catalyst stability.
