<p>Steam crackers are not standalone units but are highly integrated with downstream production units and the downstream demand for a range of cracker products.</p>
<p>Moreover, the large availability of crude oil has caused ethylene producers to shift toward this extreme as well.</p>
<p>ExxonMobil was the first to commission a large-scale plant that uses crude oil to produce olefins.</p>
<p>The abundance of ethane has widened the ethane cracking margins.</p>
<p>As a result of shale gas developments in the United States, ethane cracking has become more attractive due to its low cost.</p>
<p>There is a high abundance of ethane in shale gas, and more ethane is produced than US ethane crackers can consume.</p>
<p>China is undergoing two significant developments that are driven by a fast-growing dependence on imported oil: coal-based chemical production and propane dehydrogenation (PDH).</p>
<p>In addition, revamping SC facilities from liquid to ethane cracking is not always straightforward.</p>
<p>Thanks to technological advancements, shale gas has become a promising resource, causing its exploitation to increase exponentially since 2008.</p>
<p>The shift toward lighter feedstock utilization in the SC of hydrocarbons results in the decreased production of important co-products.</p>
<p>These feedstocks are of great benefit to the environment.</p>
<p>CO2 emission leads to global warming, and more effort must be made to reduce emissions and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, methane is an interesting starting material for the production of chemicals.</p>
<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a well-established process that accomplishes this goal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the abundance of methane has caused an increased interest in developing processes to valorize methane to higher hydrocarbons or chemicals.</p>
<p>Several of these processes were identified as potential alternatives for the SC process: FTS, MTO, and OCM.</p>
<p>Both the FTS and the MTO processes are proven technologies, with some plants already operational worldwide.</p>
<p>Despite the maturity of these technologies, both are inherently inefficient due to the syngas production step.</p>
<p>However, improvements to these processes are still possible, especially with regard to catalyst design.</p>
<p>For OCM, major efforts are still required before it can be considered as an alternative to SC.</p>
<p>Catalyst design and the development of a reactor technology that is able to deal with the strong exothermicity of this reaction are mandatory.</p>

The literature discusses the current state of olefin production, focusing on steam cracking as the leading technology. It mentions that with the rise of shale gas, ethane cracking has become more attractive due to its low cost. The abundance of ethane leads to increased margins and the potential for export. The paper also notes that the availability of crude oil has encouraged producers to shift towards using it as a feedstock, particularly ExxonMobil being the pioneer in this field. It highlights the importance of environmental factors, such as CO2 emissions, and the potential of methane as a cost-effective feedstock for chemical production. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is seen as a method to produce olefins directly, while processes like FTS, MTO, and OCM are discussed as alternative routes to valorize methane. These processes, though proven, face challenges in terms of efficiency and catalyst design, particularly for OCM which requires further development in reactor technology to handle the exothermic nature of the reaction.

文献讨论了目前烯烃生产的现状，以蒸汽裂解作为主导技术。它提到随着页岩气的发展，由于乙烷成本低廉，乙烷裂解变得更具吸引力。乙烷的丰富导致了更高的利润空间，并且有可能出口。文章还指出，原油的可用性促使生产商转向使用原油作为原料，特别是埃克森美孚是这一领域的先驱。它强调了环境因素的重要性，如二氧化碳排放，并认为甲烷作为一种成本效益高的原料，对于化学品生产具有潜力。催化脱氢轻烷烃被视为直接生产烯烃的方法，而FTS、MTO和OCM等过程被讨论为利用甲烷的替代途径。这些过程虽然已经得到验证，但在效率和催化剂设计方面仍面临挑战，尤其是对于OCM，它需要进一步发展反应器技术来处理反应的强放热性质。
