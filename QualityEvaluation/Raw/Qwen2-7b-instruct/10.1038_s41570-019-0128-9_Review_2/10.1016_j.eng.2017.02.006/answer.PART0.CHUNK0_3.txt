<p>Declining crude oil reserves and increasing social awareness of the human impact on the environment have had very little impact on the petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>These technologies emerge especially from the abundance of cheap propane, ethane, and methane from shale gas and stranded gas.</p>
<p>The huge availability of crude oil and the expected substantial decline in the demand for fuels imply that the future for proven technologies such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or methanol to gasoline is not bright.</p>
<p>The shift toward lighter feedstocks has resulted in increasing interest in developing on-purpose production routes toward propylene and higher olefins.</p>
<p>Steam crackers are not standalone units but are highly integrated with downstream production units and the downstream demand for a range of cracker products.</p>
<p>Since the discovery and exploitation of big oil fields, the world has been supplied with cheap crude-oil-based fuels and chemicals.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, methane is an interesting starting material for the production of chemicals.</p>
<p>The abundance of cheap propane, ethane, and methane from shale gas and stranded gas will facilitate cost-competitive paths in the production of light olefins.</p>
<p>Methanol is produced mainly catalytically via syngas, which is a valuable gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The MTO technology has been well developed and demonstrated in China, which has led to the successful construction and commissioning of the world's first CTO plant.</p>
<p>In order to improve the MTO process, some efforts are still required to face the main challenge of the process - the rapid deactivation of the catalyst.</p>
<p>The selectivity is rather low and the product spectra cover a broad carbon range, as described by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution.</p>
<p>Although the door toward successful commercialization has already been opened by Siluria, further investigation to enhance ethylene yields is still necessary.</p>
<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides the possibility of high selectivity to a single olefin product much higher than can be expected from SC alone.</p>
<p>Carbon capture and storage or utilization techniques are a promising way to further cut the carbon emissions from light-olefin-production technologies.</p>
<p>This perspective discussed some of the most promising alternative technologies and feedstocks for olefin production.</p>
<p>As a response to low ethane prices and large ethane availability, the SC feedstock portfolio is making a shift to ethane feedstocks.</p>
