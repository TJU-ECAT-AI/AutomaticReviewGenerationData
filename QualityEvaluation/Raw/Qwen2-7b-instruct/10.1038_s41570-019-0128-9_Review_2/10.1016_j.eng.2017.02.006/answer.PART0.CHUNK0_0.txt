<p>Thanks to technological advancements and refinements in frack- ing, the methane supply has increased enormously since 2008 and the price of methane has dropped significantly [3,4]. This makes shale gas a game changer and an interesting cost-competitive feed- stock.</p>
<p>The abundance of ethane has widened the ethane cracking margins [16]. Therefore, there is a strong push to minimize liquid feedstocks and, preferably, even to fully replace them with ethane. Steam crackers are not standalone units but are highly integrated with downstream production units and the downstream demand for a range of cracker products. Furthermore, shipping and transport via pipes of ethane has become advantageous and allows ethylene producers outside of the United States to take advantage of the local low ethane prices. On the other hand, the large availability of crude oil has caused ethylene producers to shift toward this extreme as well.</p>
<p>ExxonMobil was the first to commission a large-scale plant that uses crude oil to produce olefins.</p>
<p>Recent investments and the huge capital in current production facilities suggest that SC of hydrocarbons will remain the leading technology for the production of ethylene. The large number of projects coming online will lead to a substantial capacity expansion for ethylene producers. As a result, biomass and waste stream conversion technologies will have to become even more competitive than before, or else their focus should be on olefin complexes.</p>
<p>For OCM,major efforts are still required before it can be considered as an alternative to SC. Catalyst design and the development of a reactor technology that is able to deal with the strong exothermicity of this reaction are mandatory.</p>
<p>In the near future, SC will still be the predominant process for the production of olefins, albeit with a mainly lighter feedstock. The alternative technologies discussed in this perspective are promising, provided that the bottlenecks in their process efficiency and CO2 footprint are resolved.</p>

1. Fracking technology advancements have significantly increased the supply of methane and lowered its price since 2008, making shale gas a competitive and game-changing feedstock.

2. The abundance of ethane has widened the margins for ethane cracking, leading to a strong push to replace liquid feedstocks with ethane.

3. ExxonMobil pioneered the use of crude oil in large-scale plants for olefin production.

4. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons will remain the leading technology for ethylene production, despite substantial capacity expansions for ethylene producers.

5. Biomass and waste stream conversion technologies must become more competitive or focus on olefin complexes to compete with established technologies.

6. Significant efforts are needed to improve catalyst design and reactor technology for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to make it a viable alternative to steam cracking.

7. In the near future, steam cracking will dominate olefin production, even with lighter feedstocks, until the process efficiency and CO2 footprint bottlenecks of alternative technologies are resolved.
