<p>Thanks to technological advancements and refinements in frack- ing, the methane supply has increased enormously since 2008 and the price of methane has dropped significantly [3,4]. This makes shale gas a game changer and an interesting cost-competitive feed- stock. The large availability of shale gas has reinforced the interest in routes for valorizing methane in the form of olefins and higher hy- drocarbons, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The abundance of ethane has widened the ethane cracking margins [16]. Therefore, there is a strong push to minimize liquid feedstocks and, preferably, even to fully replace them with ethane. There is a high abundance of ethane in shale gas, and more ethane is produced than US ethane crackers can consume. This excess opens the doors for ethane export, as many ethylene producers outside of the United States want to take advantage of the low ethane price. The margins are large enough that even shipping ethane and converting it to ethylene becomes profitable [17]. Pipelines and export terminals are ready for the future export of ethane, as depicted in Fig. 1 [18]. Projections estimate that 8 × 10 6 t of ethane will be exported by 2022. Ethylene producers located mainly in India, Brazil, Canada, and several European countries will import ethane to feed their crackers. To date, no shipment to China has been confirmed. Ole- fin production in China still mainly depends on naphtha cracking;hence, shifting toward ethane could increase Chinas competiveness.</p>
<p>In addition, revamping SC facilities from liquid to ethane cracking is not always straightforward. Steam crackers are not standalone units but are highly integrated with downstream production units and the downstream demand for a range of cracker products. Furthermore, the shift toward lighter feedstock utilization in the SC of hy- drocarbons results in the decreased production of important co- products. The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), and syngas-based routes such as the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and methanol synthesis followed by methanol to olefins (MTO) are of interest.</p>
<p>Novel technologies for olefin production need to be viable from an environmental perspective as well as from a technical one. In this regard, it is important to evaluate the CO2 emissions associated with the different technologies discussed above. Fig. 4 [69] shows the to- tal CO2 emissions per ton of high-value chemicals (HVC) such as eth- ylene, propylene, and aromatics. These data were taken partly from a recent review by Ren et al. [69] and partly from various figures published by the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>
<p>Recent investments and the huge capital in current production facilities suggest that SC of hydrocarbons will remain the leading technology for the production of ethylene. The large number of pro- jects coming online will lead to a substantial capacity expansion for ethylene producers. As a result, biomass and waste stream conver- sion technologies will have to become even more competitive than before, or else their focus should be on olefin complexes.</p>

1. Shale gas has increased the availability of methane, leading to a decrease in its price. This has made shale gas a competitive feedstock for olefin production. The abundance of ethane from shale gas has opened opportunities for its export to countries like India, Brazil, Canada, and Europe, enhancing their competitiveness in olefin production. 

2. Ethane cracking is more profitable and efficient than liquid feedstocks. This shift towards ethane cracking has led to a decrease in the production of co-products like propylene. Technologies like catalytic dehydrogenation, oxidative coupling of methane, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are being explored for olefin production.

3. The CO2 emissions from different olefin production technologies vary. SC of hydrocarbons has the lowest emissions, while coal-based techniques produce high emissions both energetically and chemically. Carbon capture techniques are being developed to reduce emissions further.

4. SC of hydrocarbons will continue to dominate olefin production, with a shift towards lighter feedstocks like ethane. Biomass and waste streams will need to become more competitive or focus on olefin complexes to maintain their relevance in the industry.

1. 砂岩气的增加极大地提升了甲烷的供应量，导致其价格大幅下降。这使得砂岩气成为生产烯烃的有竞争力的原料。从砂岩气中丰富的乙烷为出口至印度、巴西、加拿大和欧洲等国家提供了机会，从而增强了它们在烯烃生产的竞争力。

2. 乙烷裂解比液态原料更为盈利且效率更高。这种转向乙烷裂解导致了丙烯等副产品的产量降低。催化脱氢、甲烷氧化耦合和费歇尔-特罗斯合成等技术正在被探索用于烯烃生产。

3. 不同烯烃生产技术的二氧化碳排放量各不相同。蒸汽裂解碳氢化合物的过程排放最低，而基于煤炭的技术则产生大量的能源和化学二氧化碳排放。正在开发碳捕获技术以进一步减少排放。

4. 蒸汽裂解碳氢化合物将仍然主导烯烃生产，同时会向轻质原料（如乙烷）转变。生物质和废物流转化技术需要变得更具有竞争力，或者专注于烯烃复合体，以保持其在行业中的相关性。
