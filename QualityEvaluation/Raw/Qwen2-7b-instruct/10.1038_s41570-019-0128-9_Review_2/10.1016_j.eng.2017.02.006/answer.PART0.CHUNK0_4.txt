[1] "The abundance of cheap propane,ethane, and methane from shale gas and stranded gas will facilitate cost-competitive paths in the production of light olefins (Fig. 3)."
[2] "Steam cracker units cannot fill this gap due to the low pro- pylene/ethylene ratio."
[3] "The main challenges for OCM to be economically successful are hence twofold, with catalyst de- velopment on the one hand and a novel reactor design on the other [23,47]."
[4] "The occurring reaction is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, so high temperatures and low pressures are favored."
[5] "Novel technologies for olefin production need to be viable from an environmental perspective as well as from a technical one."

1. The abundance of cheap propane, ethane, and methane from shale gas and stranded gas will facilitate cost-competitive paths in the production of light olefins. Steam cracker units struggle to meet the demand for propylene due to the low propylene/ethylene ratio.
2. The main challenges for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to be economically successful involve catalyst development and reactor design.
3. The oxidative coupling of methane reaction is characterized by high endothermicity and equilibrium limitations, favoring high temperatures and low pressures.
4. Novel technologies for olefin production must be environmentally viable alongside being technically feasible.

1. 石油页岩和断层气中廉价的丙烷、乙烷和甲烷的丰富将促进轻质烯烃生产成本竞争力的路径。蒸汽裂解单元难以满足丙烯需求，因为其丙烯/乙烯比过低。
2. 脂肪酸耦合甲烷技术经济成功的最大挑战在于催化剂开发和反应器设计的两方面。
3. 脂肪酸耦合甲烷反应具有高热吸收性和平衡限制性，倾向于在高温低压下进行。
4. 新型烯烃生产技术必须同时具备环境友好和技术可行的双重优势。
