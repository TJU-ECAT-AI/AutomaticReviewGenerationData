[1] "The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K is the dehydrogenation process to give propylene with 44% selectivity."
[2] "Deposition of Mo2C on silica in a highly dispersed state produced a much more effective catalyst. The initial products determined at 873 K suggest that the main reaction in the first stage is the decomposition of propane into methane and ethylene,"
[3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The dehydrogenation process on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K yields propylene with 44% selectivity.
2. Depositing Mo2C on silica creates a more effective catalyst, where the initial reaction is the decomposition of propane into methane and ethylene.
3. Over Mo2C/ZSM-5, the dominant reaction for propane is aromatization.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在873 K时，未支持的Mo2C的脱氢过程产生丙烯，选择性为44%。
2. 将Mo2C沉积在硅酸盐上会产生一个更有效的催化剂，初始反应是丙烷分解成甲烷和乙烯。
3. 在Mo2C/ZSM-5上，丙烷的主要反应是芳香化。
