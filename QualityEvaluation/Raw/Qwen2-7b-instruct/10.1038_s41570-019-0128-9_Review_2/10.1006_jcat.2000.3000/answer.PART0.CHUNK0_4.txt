[1] "Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne were observed."
[2] "Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the highest selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K."
[3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."

1. Propane interacts weakly and reversibly with supported Mo2C at temperatures below 273 K. However, the interaction becomes stronger at temperatures above 300 K, as evidenced by the observation of vibrations associated with adsorbed propylene and propylidyne.
2. Mo2C deposited on silica acts as an efficient dehydrogenating catalyst for propane. At 873 K, the maximum selectivity for propylene reaches 50% with a conversion of 25%.
3. The process of propane reaction over Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts differs significantly from the reaction pathway observed with pure Mo2C or silica-supported Mo2C. The main reaction involves the aromatization of propane.

1. 在低于273 K的温度下，丙烷与支持的Mo2C以弱且可逆的方式相互作用。然而，在高于300 K的温度下，由于观察到吸附的丙烯和丙炔振动，相互作用变得更强。
2. 将Mo2C沉积在硅酸盐上可以作为高效的脱氢催化剂用于丙烷。在873 K时，丙烯的最大选择性达到50%，转化率为25%。
3. Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷反应过程与纯Mo2C或硅酸盐支持的Mo2C观察到的反应路径大不相同。主要反应是丙烷的芳构化。
