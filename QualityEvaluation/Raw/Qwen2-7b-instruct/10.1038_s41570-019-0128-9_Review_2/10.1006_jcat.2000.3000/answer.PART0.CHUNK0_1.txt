[1] "The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K is the dehydrogenation process to give propylene with 44% selectivity."
[2] "At lower temperatures much higher selectivities, 85-75%, were reached."
[3] "The change in the selectivities of product formation with time on stream suggests that the deactivation of the catalyst, very likely due to the deposition of carbon, is disad- vantageous for the cracking of propane."
[4] "A completely different picture was obtained on Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. The formation of aromatics came into prominence, which was negligible on silica-supported Mo2C."

1. The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K involves the dehydrogenation process leading to propylene with a selectivity of 44%.

2. At lower temperatures, much higher selectivities, ranging from 85-75%, were achieved.

3. The change in the selectivities of product formation over time indicates that the deactivation of the catalyst, possibly due to carbon deposition, negatively impacts the cracking of propane.

4. A distinct pattern emerged on Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts, with the formation of aromatics becoming prominent, a negligible feature on silica-supported Mo2C.

1. 在873 K时，未支持的Mo2C的主要反应是脱氢过程，产生丙烯，选择性为44%。

2. 在较低温度下，获得了更高选择性，范围从85-75%。

3. 产物形成选择性的变化表明催化剂的失活（可能由于碳沉积引起）对丙烷裂解不利。

4. Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上出现了完全不同的图景，芳香烃的形成变得突出，这是在硅基Mo2C上难以观察到的。
