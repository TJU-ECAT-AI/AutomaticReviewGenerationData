How do advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts, and what are the key differences and implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design?

[1] "The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K is the dehydrogenation process to give propylene with 44% selectivity."
[2] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The main reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K involves the dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in propylene with a selectivity of 44%.

2. The reaction path of propane differs significantly when it interacts with Mo2C/ZSM-5. The primary reaction here is the aromatization of propane.

[1] "The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K is the dehydrogenation process to give propylene with 44% selectivity."
[2] "At lower temperatures much higher selectivities, 85-75%, were reached."
[3] "The change in the selectivities of product formation with time on stream suggests that the deactivation of the catalyst, very likely due to the deposition of carbon, is disad- vantageous for the cracking of propane."
[4] "A completely different picture was obtained on Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. The formation of aromatics came into prominence, which was negligible on silica-supported Mo2C."

1. The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K involves the dehydrogenation process leading to propylene with a selectivity of 44%.

2. At lower temperatures, much higher selectivities, ranging from 85-75%, were achieved.

3. The change in the selectivities of product formation over time indicates that the deactivation of the catalyst, possibly due to carbon deposition, negatively impacts the cracking of propane.

4. A distinct pattern emerged on Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts, with the formation of aromatics becoming prominent, a negligible feature on silica-supported Mo2C.
