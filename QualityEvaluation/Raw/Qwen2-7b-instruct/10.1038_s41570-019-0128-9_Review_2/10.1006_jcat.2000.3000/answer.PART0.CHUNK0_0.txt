[1] "The dominant reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K is the dehydrogenation process to give propylene with 44% selectivity."
[2] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The main reaction on unsupported Mo2C at 873 K involves the dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in propylene with a selectivity of 44%.

2. The reaction path of propane differs significantly when it interacts with Mo2C/ZSM-5. The primary reaction here is the aromatization of propane.

1. 在873 K时，无支撑Mo2C的主要反应是将丙烷脱氢生成丙烯，选择性为44%。

2. 当丙烷与Mo2C/ZSM-5相互作用时，其反应路径显著不同。这里的主要反应是丙烷的芳构化。
