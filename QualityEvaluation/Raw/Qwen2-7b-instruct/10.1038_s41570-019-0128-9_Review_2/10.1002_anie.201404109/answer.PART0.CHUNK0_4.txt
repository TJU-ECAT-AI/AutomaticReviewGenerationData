[1] "Precious metals are the most commonly used catalysts for CO2 conversion by H2."
[2] "It is generally accepted that catalytic conversion of CO2 by H2 occurs over precious metal catalysts in two principle steps."
[3] "However, in an effort to reduce material costs for CO2 conversion, it is important to minimize or eliminate precious metals in catalysts."
[4] "Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are attractive alternatives because they have similar properties to precious metal catalysts in reforming, hydrogenation, water-gas shift (WGS), and CO oxidation reactions."
[5] "Mo2C is particularly interesting for CO2 conversion because of its low cost, dual functionality for H2 dissociation and CO bond scission, and potential to behave similarly to reducible oxides."
[6] "The ability of Co-Mo2C to dissociate CH4 is most likely responsible for improving the CO:CH4 selectivity by reacting with the CH4 product or CHx intermediate that leads to CH4 formation."
[7] "Furthermore, because Mo2C is made from much more abundant elements than precious metals, the catalyst can be manufactured at much lower cost, which is critical for achieving a substantial reduction of CO2 levels by large-scale CO2 catalytic conversion processes."

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as an active and selective catalyst for CO2 conversion by hydrogen. Mo2C is shown to be effective in flow reactor experiments over powder catalysts, with in-situ XANES measurements verifying its oxidation-carburization cycle. Modifying Mo2C with small amounts of cobalt further improves catalytic performance. The research highlights the potential of Mo2C as a low-cost alternative to precious metals for CO2 conversion, which is crucial for reducing CO2 levels through large-scale catalytic processes. The combination of Mo2C and cobalt enhances activity, selectivity, and stability, making it a promising catalyst for CO2-to-CO conversion.
