[1] "In CO2 conversion by H2, CO is a desired product for its ability to be used in the FischerTropsch process, while CH4 is undesired because of its low volumetric energy density and abundance."
[2] "Therefore, modifying Mo2C with a metal that can dissociate the unwanted product, CH4, and thereby recarburize the catalyst to maintain its active, carbidic form is highly desirable."
[3] "The findings show that Mo2C outperforms precious metal bimetallic catalysts and is highly active and selective for CO2 conversion to CO. The activity, selectivity and stability of Mo2C can be further improved by modifying the carbide with another metal, cobalt (Co)."
[4] "Further evidence of the effect of Co on Mo2C for CO2 conversion is shown as a function of Co loading in FigureS8."
[5] "It is likely that after reduction, a CoMoCyOz phase formed, which would explain the inability of a combination of Mo2C and MoO3 to accurately represent the catalyst."

This research highlights the effectiveness of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as a catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to CO using hydrogen. Mo2C demonstrates superior activity and selectivity compared to precious metal bimetallic catalysts. The introduction of cobalt (Co) to the Mo2C significantly enhances its performance, improving both activity and selectivity. The ability of Mo2C to break the CO bond and dissociate hydrogen makes it a dual-functional catalyst ideal for CO2 activation. Moreover, the use of non-precious metals in catalysts is crucial for reducing costs, making large-scale CO2 catalytic conversion processes economically viable.

这项研究强调了钼碳化物（Mo2C）在使用氢气将CO2转化为CO方面的催化作用。Mo2C在活性和选择性方面均优于贵金属双金属催化剂。向Mo2C中引入钴（Co）显著提高了其性能，改善了活性和选择性。Mo2C能够断裂CO键并分解氢气，使其成为理想的CO2激活催化剂。此外，在催化剂中使用非贵金属材料对于降低成本至关重要，这使得大规模CO2催化转化过程经济可行。
