[1] "In-situ XANES measurements were also performed on the 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst to determine the effect of Co on the oxidation/recarburization cycle."
[2] "The ability of Mo2C to break the CO bond, as well as to dissociate hydrogen to either perform hydrogenation of CO2 or remove oxygen from Mo2C-O, makes it dual functional and ideal for CO2 activation."
[3] "Furthermore, because Mo2C is made from much more abundant elements than precious metals, the catalyst can be manufactured at much lower cost, which is critical for achieving a substantial reduction of CO2 levels by large-scale CO2 catalytic conversion processes."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in the catalysts by providing detailed insights into their behavior during the reaction process. XRD helps in understanding the crystal structure, while XANES offers information on the local atomic environment and oxidation state of the catalyst components. EXAFS provides information on the coordination geometry around the active sites, and ADF-STEM with EELS allows for the examination of the catalyst morphology and the real-time changes in the active sites. These techniques collectively reveal how the catalysts maintain their active sites during the reaction, how the active sites are distributed within the catalyst matrix, and the changes in the oxidation states of the active components, which are crucial for their catalytic activity. The key differences in findings from these techniques highlight the dynamic nature of the active sites and their interactions with reactants and products. The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design include the optimization of the catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the CO2 conversion process.
