[Molybdenum Carbide as Alternative Catalysts to Precious Metals for Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 to CO]

The TPSR experiments over a Mo2C model surface, prepared by carburizing a single-crystal Mo(110) substrate, were conducted using the AP-XPS system at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The TPSR for CO2 hydrogenation was conducted under 100mTorr CO2 and 700mTorr H2. Five gas-phase species, m/e=44 (CO2), 31 (methanol), 28 (CO), 18 (H2O) and 15 (CH4), were recorded while the sample was heated to 523K and then cooled to 373K.

AP-XPS investigations of the Mo2C/Mo(110) surface under CO2 reduction by H2 conditions were performed to identify possible surface reaction intermediates. Figure2 shows the C1s and O1s regions of surface species on Mo2C/Mo(110) under near-ambient pressures.

Figure 3 shows that bimetallic catalysts containing Co outperform their Ni containing counterparts. Therefore, by combining Co with the highly active Mo2C catalyst, it is possible to further improve the catalytic performance of Mo2C.

In-situ XANES measurements were also performed on the 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst to determine the effect of Co on the oxidation/recarburization cycle. The composition, according to the linear combination fit of the fresh 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst was found to be 29.0% Mo2C/71.0% MoO3, a much higher degree of oxidation than the pure Mo2C.

This document outlines the use of advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, to understand the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. The key differences highlighted include the synergy of these techniques in providing comprehensive insights into catalyst performance and design. Specifically, XRD elucidates the crystal structure, XANES reveals the oxidation states, EXAFS maps the coordination environments, and ADF-STEM with EELS offers high-resolution imaging of active sites. The implications of these findings are significant for optimizing catalyst efficiency and guiding the synthesis of more effective catalysts.
