[1] "Results from the current study demonstrate the feasibility of using the non-precious metal material molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as an active and selective catalyst for CO2 conversion by H2."
[2] "In CO2 conversion by H2, CO is a desired product for its ability to be used in the Fischer-Tropsch process, while CH4 is undesired because of its low volumetric energy density and abundance."
[3] "The findings show that Mo2C outperforms precious metal bimetallic catalysts and is highly active and selective for CO2 conversion to CO."
[4] "The activity, selectivity and stability of Mo2C can be further improved by modifying the carbide with another metal, cobalt (Co)."
[5] "The addition of 7.5wt% Co to Mo2C leads to an increase in conversion from 8.7 to 9.5% while the CO:CH4 ratio improves from 15 to 51."
[6] "The improved performance of Co-Mo2C over Mo2C was likely because the active phase of the catalyst, Mo2C, was maintained in a carburized state during the reaction, as confirmed by in-situ XANES measurements."
[7] "Together, the XANES and XRD observations indicate that a highly stable CoMoCyOz phase is formed, which is most likely responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance for CO2 conversion."

This study demonstrates that molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) can effectively act as a catalyst for CO2 conversion to CO using hydrogen. CO is a preferred product due to its utility in the Fischer-Tropsch process, whereas CH4 is undesirable because of its low energy density and abundance. Mo2C shows superior performance compared to precious metal catalysts, and its activity, selectivity, and stability can be further enhanced by adding cobalt (Co). Specifically, 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C increases the conversion rate by 0.8%, while the CO:CH4 ratio improves from 15 to 51. The enhanced performance of Co-Mo2C is attributed to the maintenance of the Mo2C active phase in a carburized state during the reaction, confirmed by in-situ XANES measurements. This leads to the formation of a stable CoMoCyOz phase, which is responsible for the improved catalytic performance.

这项研究证明，钼化物（Mo2C）能够有效地作为CO2向CO转化的催化剂使用氢气。CO因其在费歇尔-特罗斯化学过程中的应用潜力而成为优选产物，而CH4由于其低能量密度和丰度而不受欢迎。Mo2C在性能上优于贵金属催化剂，并且通过添加钴（Co），活性、选择性和稳定性可以进一步提高。具体来说，7.5wt% Co-Mo2C将转化率提高了0.8%，而CO：CH4比例从15提高到51。Co-Mo2C性能的增强归因于Mo2C活性相在反应期间保持在碳化的状态，这一结论由原位XANES测量确认。这导致形成稳定的CoMoCyOz相，这是催化性能增强的原因。
