[1] "In CO2 conversion by H2, CO is a desired product for its ability to be used in the FischerTropsch process, while CH4 is undesired because of its low volumetric energy density and abundance."
[2] "Therefore, modifying Mo2C with a metal that can dissociate the unwanted product, CH4, and thereby recarburize the catalyst to maintain its active, carbidic form is highly desirable."
[3] "The findings show that Mo2C outperforms precious metal bimetallic catalysts and is highly active and selective for CO2 conversion to CO. The activity, selectivity and stability of Mo2C can be further improved by modifying the carbide with another metal, cobalt (Co)."
[4] "Further evidence of the effect of Co on Mo2C for CO2 conversion is shown as a function of Co loading in FigureS8."
[5] "It is likely that after reduction, a CoMoCyOz phase formed, which would explain the inability of a combination of Mo2C and MoO3 to accurately represent the catalyst."

This research highlights the effectiveness of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as a catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to CO using hydrogen. Mo2C demonstrates superior activity and selectivity compared to precious metal bimetallic catalysts. The introduction of cobalt (Co) to the Mo2C significantly enhances its performance, improving both activity and selectivity. The ability of Mo2C to break the CO bond and dissociate hydrogen makes it a dual-functional catalyst ideal for CO2 activation. Moreover, the use of non-precious metals in catalysts is crucial for reducing costs, making large-scale CO2 catalytic conversion processes economically viable.

[5] "The addition of 7.5wt% Co to Mo2C leads to an increase in conversion from 8.7 to 9.5% while the CO:CH4 ratio improves from 15 to 51."
[6] "The improved performance of Co-Mo2C over Mo2C was likely because the active phase of the catalyst, Mo2C, was maintained in a carburized state during the reaction, as confirmed by in-situ XANES measurements."
[7] "Together, the XANES and XRD observations indicate that a highly stable CoMoCyOz phase is formed, which is most likely responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance for CO2 conversion."

This study demonstrates that molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) can effectively act as a catalyst for CO2 conversion to CO using hydrogen. CO is a preferred product due to its utility in the Fischer-Tropsch process, whereas CH4 is undesirable because of its low energy density and abundance. Mo2C shows superior performance compared to precious metal catalysts, and its activity, selectivity, and stability can be further enhanced by adding cobalt (Co). Specifically, 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C increases the conversion rate by 0.8%, while the CO:CH4 ratio improves from 15 to 51. The enhanced performance of Co-Mo2C is attributed to the maintenance of the Mo2C active phase in a carburized state during the reaction, confirmed by in-situ XANES measurements. This leads to the formation of a stable CoMoCyOz phase, which is responsible for the improved catalytic performance.

这项研究证明，钼化物（Mo2C）能够有效地作为CO2向CO转化的催化剂使用氢气。CO因其在费歇尔-特罗斯化学过程中的应用潜力而成为优选产物，而CH4由于其低能量密度和丰度而不受欢迎。Mo2C在性能上优于贵金属催化剂，并且通过添加钴（Co），活性、选择性和稳定性可以进一步提高。具体来说，7.5wt% Co-Mo2C将转化率提高了0.8%，而CO：CH4比例从15提高到51。Co-Mo2C性能的增强归因于Mo2C活性相在反应期间保持在碳化的状态，这一结论由原位XANES测量确认。这导致形成稳定的CoMoCyOz相，这是催化性能增强的原因。

[Molybdenum Carbide as Alternative Catalysts to Precious Metals for Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 to CO]

The TPSR experiments over a Mo2C model surface, prepared by carburizing a single-crystal Mo(110) substrate, were conducted using the AP-XPS system at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The TPSR for CO2 hydrogenation was conducted under 100mTorr CO2 and 700mTorr H2. Five gas-phase species, m/e=44 (CO2), 31 (methanol), 28 (CO), 18 (H2O) and 15 (CH4), were recorded while the sample was heated to 523K and then cooled to 373K.

AP-XPS investigations of the Mo2C/Mo(110) surface under CO2 reduction by H2 conditions were performed to identify possible surface reaction intermediates. Figure2 shows the C1s and O1s regions of surface species on Mo2C/Mo(110) under near-ambient pressures.

Figure 3 shows that bimetallic catalysts containing Co outperform their Ni containing counterparts. Therefore, by combining Co with the highly active Mo2C catalyst, it is possible to further improve the catalytic performance of Mo2C.

In-situ XANES measurements were also performed on the 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst to determine the effect of Co on the oxidation/recarburization cycle. The composition, according to the linear combination fit of the fresh 7.5wt% Co-Mo2C catalyst was found to be 29.0% Mo2C/71.0% MoO3, a much higher degree of oxidation than the pure Mo2C.

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, synergistically contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in the catalysts by providing detailed insights into their behavior during the reaction process. XRD helps in understanding the crystal structure, while XANES offers information on the local atomic environment and oxidation state of the catalyst components. EXAFS provides information on the coordination geometry around the active sites, and ADF-STEM with EELS allows for the examination of the catalyst morphology and the real-time changes in the active sites. These techniques collectively reveal how the catalysts maintain their active sites during the reaction, how the active sites are distributed within the catalyst matrix, and the changes in the oxidation states of the active components, which are crucial for their catalytic activity. The key differences in findings from these techniques highlight the dynamic nature of the active sites and their interactions with reactants and products. The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design include the optimization of the catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the CO2 conversion process.
