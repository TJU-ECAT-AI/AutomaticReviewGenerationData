[1] "Hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite with an intergrowth CHA/AEI crystal structure and a particle morphology comprising small zeolitic phase crystallites separated by well-ordered macropores was synthesized by using a decreased Si content in the gel mixture."
[2] "The production of the hierarchical morphological structure did not need an extra template or demetallation procedure."
[3] "In addition, it fortuitously had milder acidity due to the lower Si/Al ratio."
[4] "The hierarchical structure resulted in a shorter diffusion distance for the gaseous products because the macropores separated the solid phase into small zeolitic phase crystallites."
[5] "The shorter diffusion distance and lower acidity resulted in higher selectivities to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), and lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%)."

The synthesis of the hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite involves a decrease in silicon content within the gel mixture, leading to a structure with an intergrowth CHA/AEI crystal pattern. This structure is characterized by a particle morphology consisting of small zeolitic phase crystallites separated by well-ordered macropores. Notably, the formation of this hierarchical morphology does not require the use of an additional template or demetallation process. Furthermore, the reduced Si/Al ratio contributes to milder acidity. The hierarchical structure effectively decreases the diffusion distance for gaseous products by dividing the solid phase into smaller crystallites. This results in enhanced selectivity towards propene (44%) and butenes (22%), accompanied by reduced selectivity for propane (0.5%) and coke (14%). These findings suggest improved catalyst performance and longevity in the methanol-to-olefins process.

合成的分级SAPO-34/18沸石具有CHA/AEI晶体结构的层合晶体结构和由有序大孔分隔的小沸石相晶粒组成的粒子形态。这种结构的形成涉及胶体混合物中硅含量的减少。此外，它不需要额外的模板或去金属化过程。进一步地，较低的Si/Al比导致酸性较温和。分级结构有效地减少了气体产物的扩散距离，通过将固体相分成更小的晶粒。这导致丙烯（44%）和丁二烯（22%）选择性的提高，同时降低了丙烷（0.5%）和焦炭（14%）的选择性。这些发现表明在甲醇到烯烃过程中催化剂性能和持久性的显著改善。
