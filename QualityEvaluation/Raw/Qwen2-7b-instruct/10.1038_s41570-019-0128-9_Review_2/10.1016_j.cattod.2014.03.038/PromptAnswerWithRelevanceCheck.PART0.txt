3.1.
Catalyst characterization The
SEM
images in Fig. 1 showed that there were large morpho- logical differences between
TS-C
and
TS-H.
TS-C
comprised solid cubic particles with smooth surfaces (Fig. 1a),which is a morphol- ogy that is commonly reported for particles of
SAPO-34.
In contrast,the surfaces of
TS-H
(Fig. 1b and c) had plentiful 50 to 500 nm macropore openings.
From a large number of observations using
SEM,
it was observed that the pore distribution on the
TS-H
sur- face had regularity,that is,they were observed to be well-ordered macropores with a unique structure which differed from those pre- viously reported for mesoporous [21] and layered [8]
SAPO-34.

3.2.
Diffusion rates Typical response curves of propene diffusing out from
TS-C
and
TS-H
at
40 C
are shown in Fig. 5,which showed that there was a large difference in the diffusion rates inside the two samples.
The gas diffusion out from
TS-H
was clearly much faster than from
TS-C.
Curve fitting of the response curves with the diffusion equa- tion gave the apparent diffusion coefficient of propene in
TS-H
as
1.1
× 1013 m2/s (Table 1) and showed that it was one order of mag- nitude larger than that in
TS-C.

3.3.
MTO
reaction The conversion of methanol over the two catalysts and their selectivities to the products of the
MTO
reaction,including coke and gaseous products,measured by
TGGC
are shown in Figs. 6 and
7.
In the experiment,the conversion was kept low in order to approx- imate a differential reactor so that the conversion can be used to give a quantitative comparison of the activities of the two sam- ples.
The conversion was calculated as moles of product per mole of reactant (sum of moles of carbon in all products including gaseous products and coke divided by moles of carbon in the methanol at

The hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite has a distinct morphology compared to the conventional SAPO-34. The SEM images revealed that TS-C consists of solid cubic particles with smooth surfaces, while TS-H displays numerous 50 to 500 nm macropore openings on its surface. The macropores in TS-H are well-ordered and form a unique structure that differs from previously reported mesoporous and layered SAPO-34. The diffusion rates of propene from TS-H were significantly higher than from TS-C, indicating that the presence of macropores in TS-H reduces the diffusion distance within the zeolitic phase, resulting in improved catalytic performance. In the MTO reaction, TS-H exhibited higher selectivities to propene and butenes, lower selectivities to propane and coke, leading to a longer catalyst lifetime and higher yields of alkenes.

SAPO-34/18分子筛的结构与常规SAPO-34存在明显差异。扫描电子显微镜（SEM）图像显示，TS-C由带有光滑表面的固态立方体颗粒组成，而TS-H表面布满了50至500纳米的大量大孔开口。TS-H的大孔具有规则排列的独特结构，与之前报告的介孔和层状SAPO-34不同。TS-H中的丙烯扩散速率远高于TS-C，这表明TS-H中大孔的存在缩短了大分子在分子筛相内部的扩散距离，从而提高了催化性能。在甲醇转化为烯烃（MTO）反应中，TS-H对丙烯和丁烯的选择性更高，对丙烷和焦炭的选择性更低，导致催化剂寿命延长以及更多的烯烃生成。

[1] "The method did not need to use extra template or demetallation procedures to produce the hierarchical structure."
[2] "The hierarchical structure reduced the diffusion distance inside the zeolitic phase because the void space made it equivalent to being comprised of small zeolitic crystallites, which gave a catalytic performance akin to that of nanosized zeolite particles."
[3] "Reac- tivity studies that used a thermogravimetryGC combination that simultaneously measured coke in the zeolite in addition to the gaseous products from the methanol-to-olefins process showed that the hierarchical structure and low acid site density resulted in a longer lifetime, lower selectivities to coke and propane and higher selectivities to propene and butene."
[4] "Since the particle size of TS-H was about the same as that of TS-C, and since their crystalline phases were the same (which would mean that the diffusion rates were the same inside the crystalline phases), these data indicated that the effective diffusion path in TS-H was significantly reduced by the presence of macropores in the particle."
[5] "Many data sets of catalyst activity reported in the literature use only the gaseous products to calculate reaction rates because there was no online collection of coke data. This would underestimate the activity and overestimate the selectivity of gaseous products if the coking rate was not negligible. When the coke selectivity is not low enough to be ignored, the conversions to all products including coke should be used to get the accurate measure of catalyst activity and product selectivities."
[6] "The slower coke deposit rate on TS-H would be due to its lower acidity, since coke has to be formed by oligomerization, which needs a high density of acid sites."
[7] "The second factor of the diffusion rates makes use of the consideration that when the diffusion distance of alkenes inside the particle is long, this can result in the further conversion of these molecules into coke."

1. The hierarchical structure was created without using additional templates or demetallation procedures.
2. The reduced diffusion distance within the zeolite phase led to a catalytic performance similar to that of nanoparticles.
3. The hierarchical structure and lower acid site density led to a longer catalyst lifetime, lower coke and propane selectivity, and higher propene and butene selectivity.
4. The presence of macropores in the TS-H particle significantly reduced the effective diffusion path length.
5. Including the coke accumulation data in the calculation of catalyst activity provides a more accurate measure of the activity and product selectivities.
6. The lower coke deposition rate on TS-H was attributed to its lower acidity, as coke formation requires a high density of acid sites.
7. The longer diffusion distance of alkenes inside the particle increases the risk of further conversion into coke.

5. 包括焦炭积累数据在内的催化剂活性计算提供了更准确的活性和产品选择性的测量。

[1] "The method did not need to use extra template or demetallation procedures to produce the hierarchical structure."
[2] "The advantage of having macropores in the particle is that they separate the solid zeolitic phase into patches so that the particle is virtually comprised of many much smaller crystallites, which results in much short diffusion distances inside these small inter- nal zeolitic crystallites as compared to the diffusion distance in a solid particle of the same size without macropores."
[3] "The shorter diffusion distance and lower acidity resulted in higher selectivi- ties to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), and lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%), which preserved a longer lifetime for the catalyst and a higher yield of alkenes in the MTO process."

The synthesis of the hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite utilized a conventional hydrothermal method by reducing the silica content in the gel mixture. This process led to the formation of a hierarchical structure without requiring additional templating or demetallation steps. The creation of macropores in the particle morphology served to partition the solid zeolitic phase into smaller crystallite patches, significantly reducing the diffusion distance within these small internal zeolitic crystallites. As a result, the catalyst exhibited improved performance in the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, characterized by higher selectivities to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%), and an extended lifetime. These enhancements were attributed to the combination of a shorter diffusion distance and a milder acidity profile, which together contributed to a higher yield of alkenes.

合成分级SAPO-34/18沸石采用常规水热法，通过降低胶体混合物中的硅含量实现。这一过程无需额外模板或去金属化步骤即可形成分级结构。在颗粒形态中创建的微孔将固体沸石相划分为小晶粒碎片，大大缩短了这些小内部沸石晶体内部的扩散距离。因此，催化剂在甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程中表现出改进性能，表现为更高的丙烯（44%）和丁二烯（22%）选择性、更低的丙烷（0.5%）和焦炭（14%）选择性以及更长的寿命。这些改善归因于较短的扩散距离和较温和的酸性特征，两者共同促进了烯烃的更高产率。

[1] "Hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite with an intergrowth CHA/AEI crystal structure and a particle morphology comprising small zeolitic phase crystallites separated by well-ordered macropores was synthesized by using a decreased Si content in the gel mixture."
[2] "The production of the hierarchical morphological structure did not need an extra template or demetallation procedure."
[3] "In addition, it fortuitously had milder acidity due to the lower Si/Al ratio."

The synthesis of the hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite involves a decrease in silicon content within the gel mixture, leading to a structure with an intergrowth CHA/AEI crystal pattern. This structure is characterized by a particle morphology consisting of small zeolitic phase crystallites separated by well-ordered macropores. Notably, the formation of this hierarchical morphology does not require the use of an additional template or demetallation process. Furthermore, the reduced Si/Al ratio contributes to milder acidity. The hierarchical structure effectively decreases the diffusion distance for gaseous products by dividing the solid phase into smaller crystallites. This results in enhanced selectivity towards propene (44%) and butenes (22%), accompanied by reduced selectivity for propane (0.5%) and coke (14%). These findings suggest improved catalyst performance and longevity in the methanol-to-olefins process.
