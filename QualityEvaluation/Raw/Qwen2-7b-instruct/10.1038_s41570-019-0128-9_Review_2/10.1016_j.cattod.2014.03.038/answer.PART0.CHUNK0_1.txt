1. The conversion was controlled to be low to enable a direct comparison of the activities of the two catalyst samples.
2. The micropore sizes and quantities were identical for both samples.
3. The area of the peaks for TS-C was twice that of TS-H, correlating with the Si/Al ratio analysis.
4. The diffusion coefficient of propene in TS-C matched the reported value in [22].
5. Initially, TS-C demonstrated slightly higher reactivity compared to TS-H.
6. On TS-H, the coke selectivity started at 4% and gradually decreased to 1% over time.
7. The methane selectivity illustrated distinct deactivation rates for the two catalysts.

1. 实验中将转化率控制在较低水平，以便对两种催化剂样本的活性进行定量比较。
2. 两个样品的微孔大小和数量相同。
3. TS-C的峰面积是TS-H的两倍，这与两者Si/Al比率的分析结果一致。
4. TS-C中丙烯的扩散系数与[22]中报道的值相匹配。
5. 初始时，TS-C的反应活性略高于TS-H。
6. 在TS-H上，初始的焦炭选择性为4%，随后缓慢降低至1%。
7. 甲烷选择性表明了两种催化剂不同的失活速率。
