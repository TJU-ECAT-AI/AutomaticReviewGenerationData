[1] "The method did not need to use extra template or demetallation procedures to produce the hierarchical structure."
[2] "The advantage of having macropores in the particle is that they separate the solid zeolitic phase into patches so that the particle is virtually comprised of many much smaller crystallites, which results in much short diffusion distances inside these small inter- nal zeolitic crystallites as compared to the diffusion distance in a solid particle of the same size without macropores."
[3] "The shorter diffusion distance and lower acidity resulted in higher selectivi- ties to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), and lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%), which preserved a longer lifetime for the catalyst and a higher yield of alkenes in the MTO process."

The synthesis of the hierarchical SAPO-34/18 zeolite utilized a conventional hydrothermal method by reducing the silica content in the gel mixture. This process led to the formation of a hierarchical structure without requiring additional templating or demetallation steps. The creation of macropores in the particle morphology served to partition the solid zeolitic phase into smaller crystallite patches, significantly reducing the diffusion distance within these small internal zeolitic crystallites. As a result, the catalyst exhibited improved performance in the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process, characterized by higher selectivities to propene (44%) and butenes (22%), lower selectivities to propane (0.5%) and coke (14%), and an extended lifetime. These enhancements were attributed to the combination of a shorter diffusion distance and a milder acidity profile, which together contributed to a higher yield of alkenes.

合成分级SAPO-34/18沸石采用常规水热法，通过降低胶体混合物中的硅含量实现。这一过程无需额外模板或去金属化步骤即可形成分级结构。在颗粒形态中创建的微孔将固体沸石相划分为小晶粒碎片，大大缩短了这些小内部沸石晶体内部的扩散距离。因此，催化剂在甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程中表现出改进性能，表现为更高的丙烯（44%）和丁二烯（22%）选择性、更低的丙烷（0.5%）和焦炭（14%）选择性以及更长的寿命。这些改善归因于较短的扩散距离和较温和的酸性特征，两者共同促进了烯烃的更高产率。
