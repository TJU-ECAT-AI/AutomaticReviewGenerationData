In the study of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide, thermodynamic calculations were conducted for the process to occur within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. The research revealed that the conversion of propane is significantly influenced by the partial pressure of propane within this temperature range. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a reduction in propane conversion but simultaneously enhanced the selectivity of propylene production. This outcome can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of generated propylene and inactive propane on the catalyst surface, which inhibits further cracking effects on propylene to produce byproducts. Moreover, increasing the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) also decreased the propane conversion to a similar extent, but it did not limit the further cracking of propylene.

在对丙烷在二氧化碳存在的催化脱氢的研究中，进行了热力学计算以确定300-500摄氏度范围内的过程。研究发现，在此温度范围内，丙烷的转化受到丙烷分压的影响。提高丙烷的分压导致丙烷转化率降低，同时提高了丙烯的选择性。这种结果可以归因于生成的丙烯和失活的丙烷在催化剂表面的竞争吸附，这抑制了丙烯进一步裂解产生副产品。此外，增加气体小时空间速度（GHSV）也使丙烷转化率降低到相似程度，但没有限制丙烯的进一步裂解。
