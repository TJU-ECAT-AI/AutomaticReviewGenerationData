3. "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
4. "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
5. "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
6. "As a comparison, the increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited."

3. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide is a promising catalytic method for producing propylene.
4. Thermodynamic studies were conducted on the dehydrogenation of propane using carbon dioxide as the reactant, within the temperature range of 300 to 500 degrees Celsius, for processes utilizing sustainable solar thermal energy.
5. Increasing the partial pressure of propane led to a decrease in propane conversion, but notably improved propylene selectivity.
6. Boosting the overall gas hourly space velocity had a similar effect on reducing propane conversion, yet did not restrict the further cracking of propylene.
