The thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) using carbon dioxide (CO2) was thoroughly examined in this study as a possible method for CO2 utilization under conditions compatible with solar thermal energy applications. The research revealed that the Gibbs free energy changes for CO2 reactions become increasingly favorable when transitioning to higher alkane homologous series members. This shift in equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane was confirmed through thermodynamic analysis. The dehydrogenation process was found to be complex, involving not just the direct dehydrogenation of propane but also interactions with CO2, which shifts the equilibrium towards product formation. Additionally, the research conducted thermodynamic calculations and simulations to understand the process better, considering the multiple reaction systems involved. XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after the catalytic tests were also presented to provide insights into the structural changes during the reaction process.
