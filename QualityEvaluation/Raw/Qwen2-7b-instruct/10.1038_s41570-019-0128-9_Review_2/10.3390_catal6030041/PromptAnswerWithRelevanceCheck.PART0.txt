<p>The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1.</p>
<p>XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume.</p>
<p>As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K.</p>
<p>In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1.</p>

The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were developed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The high surface area of MSU-1 facilitated the dispersion of VOx species, and the optimal VOx loading was determined to be 12.0 wt.%. At this loading, the catalyst showed the highest activity with a conversion of isobutane at 58.8% and a selectivity of isobutene at 78.5% at 873 K. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation efficiency by removing hydrogen through the RWGS reaction and suppressing coke formation, thus improving the stability of the catalyst.

In the study of VOx/MSU-1 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2, the catalysts demonstrated high activity and selectivity. The catalytic performance was influenced by the VOx loading and the substantial surface area of MSU-1. Through XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR analysis, it was found that the ideal VOx loading was 12.0 wt. %. An increase in VOx loading resulted in the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals, leading to a reduction in surface area and pore volume. Consequently, the 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity, achieving a conversion of isobutane at 58.8% and an isobutene selectivity of 78.5% at a temperature of 873 K. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture played a crucial role in enhancing the dehydrogenation of isobutane.
