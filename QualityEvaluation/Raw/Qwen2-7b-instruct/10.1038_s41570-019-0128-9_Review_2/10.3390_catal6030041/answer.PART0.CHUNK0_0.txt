<p>The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1.</p>
<p>XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume.</p>
<p>As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K.</p>
<p>In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1.</p>

The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were developed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The high surface area of MSU-1 facilitated the dispersion of VOx species, and the optimal VOx loading was determined to be 12.0 wt.%. At this loading, the catalyst showed the highest activity with a conversion of isobutane at 58.8% and a selectivity of isobutene at 78.5% at 873 K. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation efficiency by removing hydrogen through the RWGS reaction and suppressing coke formation, thus improving the stability of the catalyst.

VOx/MSU-1催化剂用于异丁烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应。MSU-1的高比表面积有利于VOx物种的分散，最优的VOx负载量为12.0 wt.％。在这一负载量下，催化剂表现出最高的活性，异丁烷转化率为58.8％，异丁烯选择性为78.5％，在873 K时。反应流体中的CO2对脱氢作用起到了重要作用，通过逆水煤气变换反应去除生成的氢，并抑制焦炭沉积，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。
