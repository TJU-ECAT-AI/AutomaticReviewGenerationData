[1] "Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %, was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "The obtained catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) methods."
[3] "The large surface area of MSU-1 was favorable for the dispersion of VOx species and the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. %."
[4] "Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions."
[5] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The conversion of isobutane gradually increased with VOx loading, and reached maximum value, 58.8% (Entry 4), when VOx loading was 12 wt. %."
[7] "The presence of CO2 significantly enhanced the efficiency of isobutane dehydrogenation, which was generally attributed to that CO2 as a weak oxidant could eliminate hydrogen produced during the dehydrogenation through RWGS reaction."
[8] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream here could obviously enhance the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were developed as highly active catalysts in the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The large surface area of MSU-1 was favorable for the dispersion of VOx species, and the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. %. The catalyst with 12.0 wt. % VOx content showed the highest catalytic activity, with 58.8% conversion of isobutane and 78.5% selectivity of isobutene. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could enhance the dehydrogenation efficiency, and the stability of the catalyst could be improved with the presence of CO2.

开发的VOx/MSU-1催化剂在异丁烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出高活性。MSU-1的大比表面积有利于VOx物种的分散，最佳的VOx负载量为12.0 wt. %。含有12.0 wt. % VOx的催化剂显示出最高的催化活性，异丁烷转化率为58.8%，异丁烯选择性为78.5%。反应流中含有CO2可以增强脱氢效率，并且在反应流中加入CO2可以提高催化剂的稳定性。
