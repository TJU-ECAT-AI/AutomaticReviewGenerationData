[1] "Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %, was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "The obtained catalysts of VOx/MSU-1 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) methods and the results showed that the large surface area of MSU-1 was favorable for the dispersion of VOx species and the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. %."
[3] "Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions."
[4] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

The study focused on developing a highly active catalyst for dehydrogenating isobutane with CO2, using vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR methods. It was found that the large surface area of MSU-1 facilitated the dispersion of vanadium oxide species, with the optimal loading of vanadium oxide being 12.0 wt. %. Under optimal conditions, the catalyst with 12.0 wt. % vanadium oxide content showed the highest catalytic activity, converting 58.8% of isobutane and producing 78.5% isobutene. The presence of CO2 in the reaction stream significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of isobutane, increasing both the conversion and the stability of the catalyst.

该研究专注于开发一种用于在CO2存在的条件下催化异丁烷脱氢的高效催化剂，通过将五氧化二钒负载到MSU-1上。通过X射线衍射、氮气吸附-脱附和H2温度程序还原（H2-TPR）方法对催化剂进行了表征。发现MSU-1的大比表面积有利于五氧化二钒物种的分散，最佳的五氧化二钒负载量为12.0 wt. %。在最优反应条件下，12.0 wt. %五氧化二钒含量的催化剂显示出最高的催化活性，转化率高达58.8%，异丁烯选择性达到78.5%。CO2在反应流中的存在显著增强了异丁烷的脱氢作用，提高了反应的转化率和催化剂的稳定性。
