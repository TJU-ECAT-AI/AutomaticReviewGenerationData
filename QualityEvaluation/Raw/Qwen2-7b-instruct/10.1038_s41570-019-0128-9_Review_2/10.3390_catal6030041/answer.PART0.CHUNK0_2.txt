The catalysts of VOx/MSU-1, prepared by loading VOx over MSU-1, were active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. Their catalytic properties were related to the VOx loading and high surface area of MSU-1. XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume. As a result, 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 exhibited the highest catalytic activity,with the conversion of isobutane 58.8% and the selectivity of isobutene 78.5% at 873 K. In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane,

In the study of VOx/MSU-1 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2, the catalysts demonstrated high activity and selectivity. The catalytic performance was influenced by the VOx loading and the substantial surface area of MSU-1. Through XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, and H2-TPR analysis, it was found that the ideal VOx loading was 12.0 wt. %. An increase in VOx loading resulted in the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals, leading to a reduction in surface area and pore volume. Consequently, the 12.0 wt. % VOx/MSU-1 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity, achieving a conversion of isobutane at 58.8% and an isobutene selectivity of 78.5% at a temperature of 873 K. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture played a crucial role in enhancing the dehydrogenation of isobutane.

在对VOx/MSU-1催化剂进行的异丁烷氧化脱氢与CO2反应的研究中，这些催化剂表现出高活性和选择性。催化剂性能受到VOx负载量和MSU-1的大量表面积的影响。通过XRD、N2吸附-脱附以及H2-TPR分析，发现理想的VOx负载量为12.0 wt. %。增加VOx负载导致形成更大块状结构的VOx晶体，导致表面面积和孔体积减少。因此，12.0 wt. %的VOx/MSU-1催化剂显示出最高的催化活性，在873 K的温度下实现了异丁烷转化率为58.8%，异丁烯选择性为78.5%。反应物中的CO2的存在在增强异丁烷脱氢方面发挥了关键作用。
