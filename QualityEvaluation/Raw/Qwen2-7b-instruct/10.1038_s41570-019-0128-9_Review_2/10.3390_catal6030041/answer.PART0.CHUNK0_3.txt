[1] "Vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1, with VOx loading ranging from 2.5 to 17.5 wt. %, was developed as a highly active catalyst in dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2."
[2] "Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of VOx/MSU-1 was investigated, and VOx/MSU-1 with 12.0 wt. % VOx content was found to be the best one, with the conversion of isobutane (58.8%) and the selectivity of isobutene (78.5%) under the optimal reaction conditions."
[3] "In contrast with the reaction in the absence of CO2, the presence of CO2 in the reaction stream could obviously enhance the isobutane dehydrogenation, which raised the conversion of reaction and the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

The study involved developing a catalyst composed of vanadium oxide supported on MSU-1 for the dehydrogenation of isobutane with CO2. The VOx loading ranged from 2.5 to 17.5 wt.%. The researchers found that when the VOx content was optimized to 12.0 wt.%, the catalyst exhibited the highest activity, converting 58.8% of isobutane and producing 78.5% isobutene under ideal conditions. Moreover, the presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture enhanced the dehydrogenation process, increasing both the conversion rate and the stability of the catalyst.

[1] "XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption and H2-TPR characterization for VOx/MSU-1 showed that the optimal loading of VOx was 12.0 wt. % and more VOx could led to the formation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals and the decrease of the surface area and pore volume."

The X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analyses of VOx/MSU-1 revealed that the most effective loading of VOx was 12.0 wt.%. Increasing the VOx loading resulted in the creation of larger bulk-like VOx crystals, leading to a reduction in the catalyst's surface area and pore volume.

[1] "In the feed of reactants, the presence of CO2 played quite important role on the dehydrogenation of isobutane, which not only could remove H2 produced in the reaction through RWGS reaction but also suppress the formation of coke deposits and improve the stability of VOx/MSU-1."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the mixture of reactants, the inclusion of CO2 played a significant role in isobutane dehydrogenation. Not only could it remove H2 produced during the reaction via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, but it also prevented the buildup of coke deposits and enhanced the stability of the VOx/MSU-1 catalyst.
