[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise conversion measurements impossible."
[3] "Consequently, much is to be done to achieve active and coke resistant catalysts to make use of the advantages of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, can contribute significantly to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These techniques allow researchers to observe the catalysts under operational conditions, revealing the dynamic changes in their structure and composition. Key differences in findings between these catalysts might include variations in the size, shape, and distribution of active sites, which can impact their reactivity and stability. The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design are profound, as they can guide the development of more efficient and durable catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of dehydrogenation processes. For instance, understanding the specific conditions under which coke forms and deactivates the catalyst can lead to strategies for mitigating coke buildup, such as improving catalyst design or optimizing operating parameters. Overall, these techniques offer a powerful toolset for advancing the field of catalysis by providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern catalyst behavior.
