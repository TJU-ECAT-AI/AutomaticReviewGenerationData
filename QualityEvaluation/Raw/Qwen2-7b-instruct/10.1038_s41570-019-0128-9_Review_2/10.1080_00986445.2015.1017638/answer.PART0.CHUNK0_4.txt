<p>The conversion of propane is nearly complete and the selectivity to propylene is negligibly small.</p>
<p>The conversion of carbon dioxide is relatively high over the range shown.</p>
<p>The main carbon-containing product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>At very low CO2 mole fractions, the main reaction is propane pyrolysis.</p>
<p>At very high CO2 concentrations, the mole fractions of H2O, H2 and coke become identical but smaller than that of CO.</p>

The document does not provide specific information on how advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, contribute to understanding the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the provided literature.
