[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, can contribute significantly to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These techniques allow researchers to observe the catalysts under operational conditions, revealing the dynamic changes in their structure and composition. Key differences in findings between these catalysts might include variations in the size, shape, and distribution of active sites, which can impact their reactivity and stability. The implications of these findings for catalyst performance and design are profound, as they can guide the development of more efficient and durable catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of dehydrogenation processes. For instance, understanding the specific conditions under which coke forms and deactivates the catalyst can lead to strategies for mitigating coke buildup, such as improving catalyst design or optimizing operating parameters. Overall, these techniques offer a powerful toolset for advancing the field of catalysis by providing insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern catalyst behavior.

1. In the presence of CO2, propane conversions are higher compared to an inert gas or hydrogen, with the twostep process being more effective than the onestep process.
2. Experimental propane conversion levels for one and twostep dehydrogenation are lower than equilibrium predictions due to rapid catalyst deactivation.
3. Incorporating side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to increased propane conversion and decreased propylene selectivity, as these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable.
4. Higher temperatures increase the selectivity for CO and hydrogen, corresponding to enhanced propane dry reforming.
5. Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios decrease the propensity for coke formation and propylene yield, except when catalysts control undesired side reactions kinetically.

[1] "In this work, results are presented for a detailed computational study of the chemical equilibria that apply to the CO2PDH. The chemical equilibria of one and twostep oxidative PDH with CO2, in the absence and presence of competing side reactions, is studied."
[2] "Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is an important step in the design of suitable catalyst for a particular reaction (Richardson,1989)."
[3] "The thermodynamics of CO2 propane dehydrogenation has been studied earlier (Ogonowski and Skrzynska 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2011)."

The study focuses on the computational investigation of chemical equilibria in CO2 propane dehydrogenation (CO2PDH), particularly the one and two-step oxidative PDH with CO2, considering both the absence and presence of competing side reactions. The thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is crucial for designing catalysts for specific reactions, as previously noted by Richardson (1989). Earlier studies have explored the thermodynamics of CO2 propane dehydrogenation, yet this work aims to fill the gap by comprehensively studying the effects of different cofeeds and individual side reactions.
