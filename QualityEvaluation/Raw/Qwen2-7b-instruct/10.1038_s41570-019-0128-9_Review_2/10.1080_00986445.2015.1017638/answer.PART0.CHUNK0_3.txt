[1] "In this work, results are presented for a detailed computational study of the chemical equilibria that apply to the CO2PDH. The chemical equilibria of one and twostep oxidative PDH with CO2, in the absence and presence of competing side reactions, is studied."
[2] "Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is an important step in the design of suitable catalyst for a particular reaction (Richardson,1989)."
[3] "The thermodynamics of CO2 propane dehydrogenation has been studied earlier (Ogonowski and Skrzynska 2008; Michorczyk et al., 2011)."
[4] "However, a detailed study incorporating the effect of different cofeeds and the effect of individual side reactions is scarce."

The study focuses on the computational investigation of chemical equilibria in CO2 propane dehydrogenation (CO2PDH), particularly the one and two-step oxidative PDH with CO2, considering both the absence and presence of competing side reactions. The thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions for a series of feed components is crucial for designing catalysts for specific reactions, as previously noted by Richardson (1989). Earlier studies have explored the thermodynamics of CO2 propane dehydrogenation, yet this work aims to fill the gap by comprehensively studying the effects of different cofeeds and individual side reactions.

这项研究集中在对CO2PDH的计算性研究，特别是考虑CO2的一步和两步氧化性PDH及其与竞争副反应的存在或不存在。对一系列组分反应的热力学分析对于设计特定反应的催化剂至关重要，这是Richardson（1989）先前提出的观点。以前的研究已经探讨了CO2丙烷脱氢的热力学特性，但本工作旨在通过全面研究不同共给体和单个副反应的影响来填补这一空白。
