[1] "The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions."
[2] "The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[4] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[5] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, contribute to our understanding of the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts by providing detailed insights into their atomic structure and electronic environment. These techniques reveal the intricate details of the catalyst's surface chemistry, which is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms of the catalytic processes. The key differences in the findings for Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts pertain to their distinct reactivity patterns, stability, and selectivity, which are influenced by factors such as the composition, morphology, and surface area. These differences have significant implications for catalyst performance and design, as they guide the optimization of catalysts for specific applications and the development of more efficient and selective catalysts. The synergy between these analytical techniques allows for a comprehensive characterization of the catalysts, leading to a deeper understanding of their behavior under various operational conditions.
