1. In the presence of CO2, propane conversions are higher compared to an inert gas or hydrogen, with the twostep process being more effective than the onestep process.
2. Experimental propane conversion levels for one and twostep dehydrogenation are lower than equilibrium predictions due to rapid catalyst deactivation.
3. Incorporating side reactions in thermodynamic simulations leads to increased propane conversion and decreased propylene selectivity, as these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable.
4. Higher temperatures increase the selectivity for CO and hydrogen, corresponding to enhanced propane dry reforming.
5. Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios decrease the propensity for coke formation and propylene yield, except when catalysts control undesired side reactions kinetically.

1. 在CO2存在下，丙烷转化率高于惰性气体或氢气，两步过程比一步过程更有效。
2. 一和两步丙烷脱氢实验转化率低于平衡预测，这是由于催化剂快速失活所致。
3. 在热力学模拟中包含副反应可显著提高丙烷转化率并降低丙烯选择性，因为这些副反应在热力学上更为有利。
4. 更高的温度增加了CO和氢的选择性，对应于增强的丙烷干重整。
5. 更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比率降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除了当催化剂控制不希望的副反应动力学时。
