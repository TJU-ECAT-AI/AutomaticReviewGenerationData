[1] "Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques have been employed to gain insights into the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts."
[2] "These techniques include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (ADF-STEM with EELS)."
[3] "The synergy among these methods provides a comprehensive understanding of the catalysts' behavior under operational conditions."
[4] "The findings highlight significant differences in the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics between the two catalysts, which are crucial for their performance and design."
