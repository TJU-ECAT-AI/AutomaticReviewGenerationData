[1] "Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts."
[2] "The experimental and theoretical results reveal that the Ni FeOx interfacial sites can selectively break the CH bonds and preserve the CC bond of C2H6 to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas."
[3] "The role of Fe in controlling the ethylene selectivity is mainly due to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites."
[4] "The results demonstrated that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, are crucial for comprehensively characterizing the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These techniques enable researchers to precisely identify and differentiate between NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces, which are responsible for the selective activation of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and the efficient activation of dry reforming of ethane, respectively. The findings highlight the importance of Fe's role in controlling ethylene selectivity by facilitating the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites that replace NiCeOx interfacial sites. This understanding provides valuable insights into the structure-function relationships and offers strategic guidance for optimizing and tailoring the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.
