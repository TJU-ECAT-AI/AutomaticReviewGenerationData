[1] "Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts."
[2] "The results demonstrated that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively."
[3] "The role of Fe in controlling the ethylene selectivity is mainly due to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites."
[4] "These results gain better understanding of the structure-function relationships between the active site and catalytic performance, offering strategies for controlling and tuning the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation."

在CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂中，采用原位和离线分析技术，包括XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM结合EELS，成功识别了两种活性位点用于CO2辅助的乙烷脱氢反应。这些技术提供了有关Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征的见解。发现NiFeOx和NiCeOx界面是选择性断裂CH键以产生乙烯和高效断裂CC键以产生合成气的最可能活性位点。Fe在控制乙烯选择性中的作用归因于NiFeOx界面的形成，这取代了NiCeOx界面。这些发现增强了我们对活性位点与催化性能之间结构-功能关系的理解，为控制和调整CO2还原和乙烷脱氢串联反应中氧化物支持金属催化剂的活性和选择性提供了策略。

[1] "Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts."
[2] "The experimental and theoretical results reveal that the Ni FeOx interfacial sites can selectively break the CH bonds and preserve the CC bond of C2H6 to produce ethylene, while the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas."
[3] "A small amount of Fe introduction promotes the CC bond scission activity (e.g., Ni3Fe1/CeO2 with 99% CO selectivity), while an optimal amount of Fe greatly increases the selective CH bond cleavage activity (e.g., Ni1Fe3/CeO2 with 78% C2H4 selectivity)."
[4] "The NiFeOx interfaces and NiCeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (i.e., selectively cleave the CH bonds while preserving the CC bond to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane (efficiently break all of the CH and CC bonds to produce synthesis gas), respectively."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, provide detailed information about the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of the active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. Specifically, XRD reveals the lattice expansions and average bond lengths indicating the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, and the presence of metallic Ni or NiFe alloy structures. XANES and EXAFS offer insights into the valence states of Ni and Fe, showing that the oxidation state of Ni is metallic, while Fe exhibits features between FeO and Fe3O4. ADF-STEM with EELS analysis confirms the formation of amorphous FeOx layers on the surface of Ni particles, suggesting the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and NiCeOx interfacial sites for dry reforming of ethane. The key differences between Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts are the presence of metallic FeFe(Ni) bonding on Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and the absence of such bonding on Fe1Ni3/CeO2, which impacts the selectivity towards ethylene and synthesis gas production. These findings have significant implications for the design of catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.

先进的原位和离线表征技术，包括XRD、XANES、EXAFS以及ADF-STEM与EELS，提供了关于Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构性质、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征的详细信息。具体而言，XRD揭示了晶格膨胀和平均键长，表明Ce4+部分还原为Ce3+，并存在金属Ni或NiFe合金结构。XANES和EXAFS提供了Ni和Fe价态的见解，显示Ni的氧化状态为金属态，而Fe表现出FeO和Fe3O4之间的特性。ADF-STEM与EELS分析确认了FeOx层在Ni颗粒表面的存在，表明形成了NiFeOx界面位点用于CO2辅助乙烷脱氢反应和干重整反应，以及NiCeOx界面位点用于乙烷干重整。Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂的关键差异在于Fe3Ni1/CeO2上存在金属态FeFe(Ni)结合，而Fe1Ni3/CeO2上不存在这种结合，这影响了乙烯和合成气产率的选择性。这些发现对设计具有优化活性和选择性的催化剂，以平行进行CO2还原和乙烷脱氢反应具有重要意义。

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, are crucial for comprehensively characterizing the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. These techniques enable researchers to precisely identify and differentiate between NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces, which are responsible for the selective activation of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and the efficient activation of dry reforming of ethane, respectively. The findings highlight the importance of Fe's role in controlling ethylene selectivity by facilitating the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites that replace NiCeOx interfacial sites. This understanding provides valuable insights into the structure-function relationships and offers strategic guidance for optimizing and tailoring the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.
