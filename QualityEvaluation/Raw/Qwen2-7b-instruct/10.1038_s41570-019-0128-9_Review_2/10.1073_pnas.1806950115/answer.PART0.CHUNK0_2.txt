1. Advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, are used together with DFT calculations to confidently identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane on CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts.
2. The Ni FeOx interfacial sites selectively break the CH bonds while preserving the CC bond of ethane, resulting in the production of ethylene. Meanwhile, the NiCeOx interfacial sites efficiently cleave all of the CH and CC bonds, producing synthesis gas.
3. XRD measurements were carried out at Beamline 17-BM of Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).
4. XANES experiments were performed at Beamline 9-BM of APS at ANL.
5. A STEM-EELS analysis was conducted on spent Ni3Fe1/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2 samples using a Hitachi 2700C STEM with a probe aberration corrector operated at 200 kV.
6. Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.

1. 高级原位和离位分析技术，包括XRD、XANES、EXAFS以及ADF-STEM结合EELS，与DFT计算相结合，用于确信地识别CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂上CO2辅助脱氢乙烷的两种活性位点。
2. Ni FeOx界面位点选择性地断裂乙烷的CH键并保留CC键以产生乙烯。而NiCeOx界面位点有效地断裂所有CH和CC键，产生合成气。
3. XRD测量在阿贡国家实验室的先进光子源（APS）第17束线进行。
4. XANES实验在阿贡国家实验室的先进光子源（APS）第9束线进行。
5. 对消耗的Ni3Fe1/CeO2和Ni1Fe3/CeO2样品进行了STEM-EELS分析，使用了配备探针校正器的Hitachi 2700C STEM，在200 kV下运行。
6. 使用维也纳初始化模拟包（VASP）代码进行了自旋极化DFT计算。
