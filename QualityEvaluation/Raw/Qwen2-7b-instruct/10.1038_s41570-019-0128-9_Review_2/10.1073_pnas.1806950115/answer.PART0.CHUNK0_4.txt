[1] "Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts."
[2] "The results demonstrated that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively."
[3] "The NiFeOx interfaces are identified as the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce C2H4)."
[4] "The NiCeOx interfacial sites are proposed as the most likely active sites for dry reforming of ethane as they are more active than the metallic Ni sites in irreducible SiO2."
