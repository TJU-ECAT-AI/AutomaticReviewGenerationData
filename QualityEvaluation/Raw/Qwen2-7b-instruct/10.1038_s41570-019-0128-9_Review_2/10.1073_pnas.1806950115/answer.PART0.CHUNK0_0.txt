[1] "Combined in situ/ex situ characterization with DFT calculations were employed to convincingly identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts."
[2] "The results demonstrated that the NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces are the most likely active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane (selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene) and dry reforming of ethane with CO2 (efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas), respectively."
[3] "The role of Fe in controlling the ethylene selectivity is mainly due to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites replacing the NiCeOx interfacial sites."
[4] "These results gain better understanding of the structure-function relationships between the active site and catalytic performance, offering strategies for controlling and tuning the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation."

The advanced in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, including XRD, XANES, EXAFS, and ADF-STEM with EELS, were used to identify the two types of active sites for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane over CeO2-supported NiFe catalysts. These techniques provided insights into the structural properties, oxidation states, spatial distribution, and morphological characteristics of active sites in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 catalysts. The NiFeOx and NiCeOx interfaces were found to be the most likely active sites for selective CH bond cleavage to produce ethylene and efficient CC bond scission to produce synthesis gas, respectively. The role of Fe in controlling the ethylene selectivity is attributed to the formation of NiFeOx interfacial sites, which replace the NiCeOx interfacial sites. These findings enhance our understanding of the structure-function relationships between the active site and catalytic performance, providing strategies for controlling and tuning the activity and selectivity of oxide-supported metal catalysts for the tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and ethane dehydrogenation.

在CeO2支持的NiFe催化剂中，采用原位和离线分析技术，包括XRD、XANES、EXAFS和ADF-STEM结合EELS，成功识别了两种活性位点用于CO2辅助的乙烷脱氢反应。这些技术提供了有关Fe3Ni1/CeO2和Fe1Ni3/CeO2催化剂中活性位点的结构特性、氧化状态、空间分布和形态特征的见解。发现NiFeOx和NiCeOx界面是选择性断裂CH键以产生乙烯和高效断裂CC键以产生合成气的最可能活性位点。Fe在控制乙烯选择性中的作用归因于NiFeOx界面的形成，这取代了NiCeOx界面。这些发现增强了我们对活性位点与催化性能之间结构-功能关系的理解，为控制和调整CO2还原和乙烷脱氢串联反应中氧化物支持金属催化剂的活性和选择性提供了策略。
