[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."
[2] "Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins. However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins."
[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins, because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

The demand for light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butene has significantly increased due to their use as essential components in the production of valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. Traditional methods of producing these olefins through steam cracking of crude oil or fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil suffer from high energy consumption, substantial CO2 emissions, and low selectivity towards olefin production. In contrast, catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides an eco-friendly and practical alternative. This process utilizes inexpensive light alkanes from sources like shale or natural gas as feedstocks, which can be readily converted into olefins with high selectivity and efficiency.

对于乙烯、丙烯和丁烯等轻烯烃的需求已经显著增加，因为它们在高价值聚合物、氧化物和化学中间体的生产中扮演着基础组件的角色。传统的生产这些烯烃的方法，如通过原油蒸汽裂解或重油催化裂解，面临着高能耗、大量二氧化碳排放以及低轻烯烃选择性的问题。相比之下，轻烷烃的非氧化脱氢催化过程提供了一种环保且实用的替代方案。这一过程利用来自页岩或天然气的廉价轻烷烃作为原料，可以高效且选择性地转化为烯烃。
