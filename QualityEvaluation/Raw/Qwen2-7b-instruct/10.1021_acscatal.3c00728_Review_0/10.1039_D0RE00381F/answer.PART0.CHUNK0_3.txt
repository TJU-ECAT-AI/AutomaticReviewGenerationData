[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."
[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."
[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."
[4] "This reaction is highly endothermic and typically operates at high temperature (400750 C), which makes it difficult to control the selectivity to the target olefins."
[5] "In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins."
[6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes involves the breaking of two carbonhydrogen bonds with simultaneous release of a corresponding alkene together with a molecular hydrogen."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved as a key building block for the production of polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation due to its ability to efficiently convert abundant and inexpensive light alkanes into high-value olefins. This approach meets the growing needs for propene across various applications by offering a practical, environmentally friendly, and economically viable alternative compared to traditional methods that rely on crude oil or heavy oil.

2. Almost all of the demand for propene is met through its production from propane via dehydrogenation, with a small percentage coming from other sources. The high selectivity and efficiency of the process allow for the conversion of propane into propene with minimal waste, making it a preferred method for industries requiring large quantities of this olefin.

1. 在化工行业中，丙烯的重要性体现在它是生产高附加值聚合物、氧化剂和重要化学中间体的基石。随着需求的增长，采用丙烷脱氢的方法来生产丙烯变得越来越普遍，这得益于它能够高效地将廉价且丰富的轻烃转化为高价值的烯烃。这种方法通过提供一种经济可行、环境友好且与依赖原油或重油的传统方法相比效率更高的途径，满足了各行业对丙烯不断增长的需求。

2. 几乎所有丙烯的需求都是通过从丙烷中脱氢生产而得到的，其余的小部分可能来自于其他来源。由于其高度的选择性和效率，该过程能够将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时产生极少量的副产品，使其成为需要大量这种烯烃的行业首选的生产方法。
