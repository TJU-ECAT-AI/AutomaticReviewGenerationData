[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."
[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."
[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins."
[4] "This reaction is highly endothermic and typically operates at high temperature (400750 C), which makes it difficult to control the selectivity to the target olefins."
[5] "Metal-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in particular, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their excellent activity and high selectivity to olefins."
[6] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology (the Pacol process) on the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst was commercialized by UOP for producing linear alkenes for detergents in 1968."
[7] "Compared with non-oxidative dehydrogenation, it suffers from deep oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes to COx, which results in loss of olefin selectivity and yield."
[8] "In this regard, this review will focus on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[9] "The introduction of the promoters can remarkably improve their catalytic performances, especially in terms of selectivity to target olefins and catalytic stability."
[10] "However, the loading amount of active metals is quite low (0.5 wt%), resulting in low catalytic productivity."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become a versatile olefin used for the production of polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic and environmental advantages. The process allows for the efficient production of propene from abundant natural gas resources, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional methods that rely on crude oil. 

2. The growing needs for propene across various applications necessitate the development of more efficient production methods. Propane dehydrogenation, facilitated by metal-based catalysts, particularly Pt-based catalysts, is favored for its ability to selectively convert propane into propene with high efficiency and stability. The use of promoters in these catalysts enhances their performance, specifically in terms of olefin selectivity and catalyst longevity, addressing the challenge of low catalytic productivity.
