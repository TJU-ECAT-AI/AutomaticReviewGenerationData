[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."
[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly.911 Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins.12 However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins."
[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,13 because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."
[4] "In this regard, this review will focus on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. We summarize the most recent and impactful progress in understanding the metal-catalyzed non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, with a primary focus on Pt-, Pd-, Rh- and Ni-based catalysts."
[5] "The introduction of the promoters can remarkably improve their catalytic performances, especially in terms of selectivity to target olefins and catalytic stability."

1. The demand for light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, and butene, has rapidly increased. These olefins are crucial for the production of valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. Traditional methods of producing light olefins, like steam cracking of crude oil and fluid catalytic cracking, are energy-intensive, produce significant CO2 emissions, and have low selectivity for olefins. This has led to the exploration of alternative methods like catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, which uses inexpensive light alkanes from sources like shale gas or natural gas as feedstock and allows for the production of olefins with high selectivity.

2. The review focuses on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically summarizing recent advancements in understanding the metal-catalyzed non-oxidative dehydrogenation process. The primary emphasis is placed on catalysts containing platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and nickel (Ni).

3. The addition of promoters to metal-based catalysts has been shown to significantly enhance their catalytic performance, particularly in terms of olefin selectivity and stability.

1. 对轻烯烃（如乙烯、丙烯和丁烯）的需求迅速增长。这些烯烃对于生产有价值的聚合物、氧化剂和重要化学中间体至关重要。传统的轻烯烃生产方法，如原油蒸汽裂解和重油催化裂化，能源消耗高，产生大量二氧化碳排放，并且对轻烯烃的选择性低。这促使人们探索替代方法，如轻烷烃非氧化脱氢制备轻烯烃，该方法使用来自页岩气或天然气等低成本轻烷烃作为原料，能够实现高选择性地生产烯烃。

2. 本文综述主要关注非氧化性轻烷烃脱氢，特别总结了在理解金属催化非氧化性轻烷烃脱氢过程方面的最新进展。重点放在铂（Pt）、钯（Pd）、铑（Rh）和镍（Ni）基催化剂上。

3. 添加助剂到金属基催化剂中可以显著提高其催化性能，尤其是在目标烯烃的选择性和稳定性方面。
