[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."
[2] "Currently, steam cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the main technologies for the production of light olefins. However, these two existing routes suffer from high-energy demands, enormous CO2 emissions and low selectivity towards light olefins."
[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins, because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."
[4] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes involves the breaking of two carbonhydrogen bonds with simultaneous release of a corresponding alkene together with a molecular hydrogen."
[5] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology (the Pacol process) on the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst was commercialized by UOP for producing linear alkenes for detergents in 1968."
[6] "In addition, PtSn bimetallic-based catalysts are also employed in two other industrial processes, the STAR process and the LindeBASF process, for the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[7] "The catalytic properties of metal-based catalysts strongly depend on their structures."
[8] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is thermodynamically limited, strongly endothermic and prone to volume expansion. Consequently, a high reaction temperature (500700 C) and/or low alkane partial pressure are required to achieve economically relevant conversions of 3050%."
[9] "Under a certain condition, the dehydrogenation equilibrium conversions for the light alkanes increase with the carbon numbers and the degrees of branching (C2 < C3 < C4 < i-C4)."
[10] "The addition of an optimal amount of hydrogen to the feed can enhance the formation of olefins by promoting the dehydrogenation of adsorbed alkyl species on the catalyst surface under kinetic conditions."
[11] "On the other hand, when the alkane molecules are effectively activated, the formed intermediates and the olefins are much more reactive than the alkanes and can easily undergo undesirable side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, cracking, isomerization, and polymerization."
[12] "Fortunately, the active sites for the side reactions are not required for dehydrogenation. This makes it possible to potentially eliminate side reactions and exclusively enable CH bond activation via rational catalyst design."
[13] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes is another promising route for the production of olefins. Several interesting reviews have already been published in this field."
[14] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology (the Pacol process) on the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst was commercialized by UOP for producing linear alkenes for detergents in 1968."
[15] "In addition, PtSn bimetallic-based catalysts are also employed in two other industrial processes, the STAR process and the LindeBASF process, for the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[16] "The addition of Sn greatly improves the selectivity towards target alkene products and slows down catalytic deactivation."
[17] "Remarkably, the activity of the catalyst can be maintained even after 796 h time-on-stream."
[18] "Other supports, such as SiO2,7678 Mg(Zn)AlOx hydrotalcites79 and titanate ETS-2,80 are also investigated in a number of studies."
[19] "The introduction of Ga results in a remarkable enhancement of selectivity toward the desired products and catalytic stability, which is also attributed to the combination of geometric and electronic effects."
[20] "In the cases of supported nanoparticles, the binding mode of alkene is totally different from the observation on extended metal surfaces."
[21] "Moreover, ethylidyne is suggested to be an intermediate in the ethylene cracking to methane and coke during ethane dehydrogenation based on isotopic labeling experiments (Scheme 1)."

Answer: Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, serving as a crucial building block for the production of polymers, oxygenates, and other important chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand is driven by its use in various applications, including packaging materials, synthetic fibers, and solvents. This demand has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic and environmental advantages. Propane dehydrogenation allows for the production of propylene from abundant sources like shale gas and natural gas, offering a more sustainable and efficient alternative compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This process reduces the reliance on crude oil and heavy oil, decreases energy consumption, and minimizes CO2 emissions, making it an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propylene across diverse industries.

Answer: The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower costs due to the utilization of cheaper feedstocks like natural gas and shale gas, which are abundant resources. This leads to more competitive pricing for propylene, a key commodity in the chemical industry. Additionally, the process is generally more energy-efficient and produces fewer greenhouse gases compared to conventional methods, contributing to a more sustainable manufacturing process. Environmental benefits include reduced carbon footprint, minimized pollution, and less dependency on fossil fuels, aligning with the growing emphasis on sustainability and green chemistry practices.

Answer: The environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation primarily stem from its reduced energy consumption and lower carbon dioxide emissions compared to traditional methods of propylene production. By utilizing natural gas and shale gas as feedstocks, the process can tap into renewable resources, which are considered cleaner alternatives to oil-based feedstocks. This not only reduces the overall carbon footprint of propylene production but also helps in mitigating climate change impacts. Furthermore, propane dehydrogenation may involve less severe environmental regulations due to its inherent efficiency and lower pollution generation, making it a more environmentally friendly choice for propylene production. Additionally, advancements in catalyst design and process optimization continue to push the boundaries of energy efficiency and reduce waste, further enhancing the environmental benefits of this method.
