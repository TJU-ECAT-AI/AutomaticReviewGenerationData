[1] "BP mixed oxide was the active and selective catalyst for partial oxidation of propane."
[2] "The selectivity and the yield of the partial oxidation products (propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, propylene, etc.) were 50% and 27%, respectively."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The partial oxidation of propane is effectively catalyzed by BP mixed oxide. Under the specified conditions (temperature of 806 K, propane pressure of 20 kPa, oxygen pressure of 30 kPa, and a weight-to-flow ratio of 0.67 g/h), the catalyst exhibits a high level of selectivity, achieving a 50% selectivity rate for the formation of partial oxidation products. Specifically, the yield of these products includes propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, and propylene, with the highest yield being 27% for propylene.
