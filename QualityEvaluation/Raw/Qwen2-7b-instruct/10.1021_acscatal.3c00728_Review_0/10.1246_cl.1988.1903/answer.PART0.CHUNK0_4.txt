[1] "BP mixed oxide was the active and selective catalyst for partial oxidation of propane."
[2] "The selectivity and the yield of the partial oxidation products (propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, propylene, etc.) were 50% and 27%, respectively, under the reaction conditions; T=806 K, P(C3H8)=20 kPa, P(O2)=30 kPa, and W/F=0.67 g h−1."
