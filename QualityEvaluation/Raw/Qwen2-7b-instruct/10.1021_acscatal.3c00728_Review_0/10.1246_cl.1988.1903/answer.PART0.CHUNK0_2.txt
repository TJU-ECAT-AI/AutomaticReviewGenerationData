BP mixed oxide was the active and selective catalyst for partial oxidation of propane. The selectivity and the yield of the partial oxidation products (propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, propylene, etc.) were 50% and 27%, respectively, under the reaction conditions; T=806 K, P(C3H8)=20 kPa, P(O2)=30 kPa, and W/F=0.67 g h 11.

BP mixed oxide served as an effective and selective catalyst for the partial oxidation of propane under the specified conditions. The selectivity and yield of the resulting products, including propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, and propylene, were 50% and 27%, respectively. The conditions were as follows: temperature (T) = 806 K, pressure of propane (P(C3H8)) = 20 kPa, pressure of oxygen (P(O2)) = 30 kPa, and weight-to-flow ratio (W/F) = 0.67 g/hour.
