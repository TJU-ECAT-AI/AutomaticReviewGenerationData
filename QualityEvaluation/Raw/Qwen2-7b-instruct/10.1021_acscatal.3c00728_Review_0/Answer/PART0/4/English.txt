In recent years, the abundance and low cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have spurred the development of industrial techniques aimed at gas-based dehydrogenation pathways to produce light olefins. Currently, about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is deemed an economically and environmentally favorable route. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, the Catofin process and Oleflex process are commonly utilized, with the former employing a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin catalyst. Direct dehydrogenation, being endothermic in nature, necessitates significant energy input and high temperatures to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, which constrains its overall energy efficiency. In addition, under such challenging operational conditions, sintering and coking become severe, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration under high-temperature oxidative conditions. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, characterized by its inherent exothermicity and absence of coke formation, presents a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation. ODH processes occur at lower temperatures without the requirement for catalyst regeneration. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of alkanes is typically believed to exhibit a complex reaction pattern, manifested by the coexistence of various reaction pathways under ODH conditions. The extensive range of products arises from rich side reactions, such as partial oxidation to oxygenated products and deep oxidation to COx. An uncatalyzed ODH reaction inevitably encounters the low selectivity issue; thus, catalysts are needed to promote desired reactions by manipulating reaction kinetics, aiming to achieve high selectivity for olefins in an oxidative atmosphere. Boron-based metal-free catalysts demonstrate superior olefin selectivity, excellent stability, and atom economy in the production of valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emissions, indicating high potential for future industrialization. Metal-free boron- and carbon-based catalysts have exhibited both fundamental and practical value in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. Carbonaceous catalysts also displayed impressive performance in ODH processes, aided by surface oxygen-containing functional groups.
