          [2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."
          [3] "Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, two popularly used processes are the Catofin process and Oleflex process where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst."
          [4] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."
          [5] "In addition, under such tough operation conditions, sintering and coking become serious and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, which thus requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts under high temperature oxidative conditions."
          [6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."
          [7] "It proceeds at a lower temperature without the need of catalyst regeneration."
          [8] "The oxidation of alkanes under aerobic conditions is generally believed to have a complicated reaction pattern demonstrated by the co-existence of various reaction channels under ODH conditions."
          [9] "The rich side reaction channels, e.g. partial oxidation to oxygenated products and deep oxidation to COx, resulted in wide spectrum distribution of products."
          [10] "Thus, an uncatalyzed ODH reaction inevitably suffers from the low selectivity problem, and catalysts are required to promote the targeted reactions by manipulating the reaction kinetics in order to achieve high selectivity for olefins in the oxidative atmosphere."
          [11] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts showed a superior selectivity toward olefins, excellent stability and atom-economy to valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, which are highly promising in future industrialization."
          [12] "Metal-free boron- and carbon-based catalysts have shown both great fundamental and practical value in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
          [13] "The carbonaceous catalysts also exhibited impressive behavior in the ODH of light alkanes helped along by surface oxygen-containing functional groups."
