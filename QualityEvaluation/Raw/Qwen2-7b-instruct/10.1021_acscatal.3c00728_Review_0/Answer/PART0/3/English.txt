The worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene has escalated to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a). Natural gas reserves in 2018 reached 197 trillion cubic meters, which contains significant quantities of light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane, that can be separated from the natural gas. Currently, about 10% of the global propylene is produced through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is recognized as an economically and environmentally beneficial route. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, the Catofin process and Oleflex process are commonly used, with the former employing a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin catalyst. Direct dehydrogenation, being endothermic, requires significant energy input and high temperatures to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, which limits its overall energy efficiency. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, characterized by its inherent exothermicity and absence of coke formation, presents a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation. Boron-based catalysts demonstrate superior olefin selectivity, excellent stability, and atom economy in the production of valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emissions, which holds great promise for future industrialization. The economic and environmental benefits of PDH are attributed to its lower energy consumption, reduced carbon emissions, and efficient utilization of natural gas resources. This method enables the production of propene with minimal environmental impact, making it a preferred choice for fulfilling the growing demand for this versatile olefin.
