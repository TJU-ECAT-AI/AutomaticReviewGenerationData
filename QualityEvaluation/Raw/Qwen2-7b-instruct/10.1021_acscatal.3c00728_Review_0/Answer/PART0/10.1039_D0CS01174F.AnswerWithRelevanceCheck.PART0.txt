          Metal-free boron-based catalysts demonstrate high catalytic efficiency and exceptional olefin selectivity, surpassing many metal oxide catalysts. They are considered promising for industrializing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, offering superior selectivity towards light olefins and minimizing CO2 emissions. Under the ODH conditions, no measurable conversion of propylene was observed when tested with C3H6/O2/He, and they exhibit low COx selectivity with negligible CO2 emission during the ODH of light alkanes. At a propane conversion level of around 20%, the total COx selectivity remains below 10%, and the CO2 selectivity is less than 1%. Metal-free boron-based catalysts hold significant promise for industrial ODH processes, offering the benefits of high activity, excellent olefin selectivity, and reduced CO2 emissions, thus promoting atom economy in the production of valuable carbon-based products.

Natural gas reserves in 2018 reached 197 trillion cubic meters, which contains significant quantities of light alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and propane, that can be separated from the natural gas. Currently, about 10% of the global propylene is produced through propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is recognized as an economically and environmentally beneficial route. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, the Catofin process and Oleflex process are commonly used, with the former employing a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin catalyst. Direct dehydrogenation, being endothermic, requires significant energy input and high temperatures to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, which limits its overall energy efficiency.

          In recent years, the abundance and low cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have spurred the development of industrial techniques aimed at gas-based dehydrogenation pathways to produce light olefins. Currently, about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is deemed an economically and environmentally favorable route. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, the Catofin process and Oleflex process are commonly utilized, with the former employing a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin catalyst. Direct dehydrogenation, being endothermic in nature, necessitates significant energy input and high temperatures to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, which constrains its overall energy efficiency. In addition, under such challenging operational conditions, sintering and coking become severe, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration under high-temperature oxidative conditions. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, characterized by its inherent exothermicity and absence of coke formation, presents a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation. ODH processes occur at lower temperatures without the requirement for catalyst regeneration. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of alkanes is typically believed to exhibit a complex reaction pattern, manifested by the coexistence of various reaction pathways under ODH conditions. The extensive range of products arises from rich side reactions, such as partial oxidation to oxygenated products and deep oxidation to COx. An uncatalyzed ODH reaction inevitably encounters the low selectivity issue; thus, catalysts are needed to promote desired reactions by manipulating reaction kinetics, aiming to achieve high selectivity for olefins in an oxidative atmosphere. Boron-based metal-free catalysts demonstrate superior olefin selectivity, excellent stability, and atom economy in the production of valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emissions, indicating high potential for future industrialization. Metal-free boron- and carbon-based catalysts have exhibited both fundamental and practical value in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. Carbonaceous catalysts also displayed impressive performance in ODH processes, aided by surface oxygen-containing functional groups.

          近年来，全球天然气和页岩气产量丰富且成本低廉（图1b），推动了旨在基于气体的脱氢途径生产轻烯烃的工业技术的发展。当前，全球约10%的丙烯通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）生产，这被认为是经济和环保的路线。在直接脱氢工业化的协议中，Catofin过程和Oleflex过程是常用的两种，前者使用氧化铝铬催化剂，后者使用铂锡催化剂。直接脱氢，由于其吸热性，需要大量的能量输入和高温来实现目标烯烃的可接受转化和高产率，这限制了其整体能效。此外，在这样的艰难操作条件下，烧结和结焦变得严重，导致催化剂快速失活，因此需要在高温氧化条件下频繁再生催化剂。轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）至烯烃，以其内在的放热性和无焦炭形成特性，为直接脱氢提供了一个有前景的替代方案。ODH过程在较低温度下进行，不需要催化剂再生。在有氧条件下，轻烷烃的氧化通常认为具有复杂的反应模式，表现为在ODH条件下各种反应途径的共存。丰富的副反应通道，如部分氧化到氧化产物和深度氧化到COx，导致了产品谱的广泛分布。因此，无催化剂的ODH反应不可避免地遇到了低选择性的问题，催化剂需要通过调节反应动力学来促进目标反应，以便在氧化气氛中实现烯烃的高选择性。硼基无金属催化剂在生产有价值的碳基产品时显示出对烯烃的优越选择性、出色的稳定性和原子经济性，并通过减少二氧化碳排放，为未来的工业化提供了巨大的可能性。无金属硼-碳基催化剂在轻烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）中显示出根本价值和实际价值。碳基催化剂在ODH过程中也表现出令人印象深刻的行为，得益于表面含氧官能团的帮助。
