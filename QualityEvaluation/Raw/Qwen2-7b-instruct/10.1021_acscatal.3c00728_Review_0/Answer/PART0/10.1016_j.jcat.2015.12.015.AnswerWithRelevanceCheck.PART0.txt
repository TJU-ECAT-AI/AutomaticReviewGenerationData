          [1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
          [2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
          [3] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
          [4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
          [5] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
          [6] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."

          The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to significantly increase in the near future. Traditional methods such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are employed for olefin production, but they face challenges like being endothermic and causing coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen presents an appealing alternative, offering lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation. Additionally, CO2 plays a key role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and catalysts with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M show the highest efficiency in propene conversion, though higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6.

          预计未来几年对烯烃，尤其是丙烯的需求将显著增加。传统的裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）等方法被用于烯烃生产，但这些方法存在吸热反应和焦炭生成等问题。通过分子氧进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODP）作为一种有吸引力的替代方案，能够提供较低的反应温度并有效防止表面焦炭形成。此外，二氧化碳在丙烷转化为丙烯的氧化脱氢过程中发挥关键作用。在W/V比为0.1摩尔的催化剂中，丙烯的平均周转频率最高，但W/V比为0.6的催化剂显示出更高的选择性。
