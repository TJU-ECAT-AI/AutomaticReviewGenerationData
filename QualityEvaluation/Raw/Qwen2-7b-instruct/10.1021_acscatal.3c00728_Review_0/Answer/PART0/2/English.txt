The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown significantly, driven by its increasing demand across various applications. This has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propene, a key olefin used across various applications. The process offers several economic advantages, such as lower energy consumption and reduced emissions compared to other processes.

Propene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry due to its versatile applications in various sectors such as polymers, oxygenates, and bulk chemical intermediates. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages over traditional production processes, including lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability, which can lead to lower capital and operating costs.

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an alternative to PDH that offers an exothermic, non-equilibrium-limited process, which does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed. Recent studies have shown that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP, offering higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts. This has opened up new possibilities for producing propene with fewer environmental impacts and potentially lower costs.

          Other research has also demonstrated the success of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over hBN. The results of these studies, along with those found in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over hBN materials, are summarized in Table 1 of the document. This highlights the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propene and other olefins.

Light olefins, including ethylene, propylene, and butene, are essential bulk commodities and foundational components in the production of valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The rapid growth in demand for these useful olefins has encouraged the exploration of alternative production methods, particularly catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This process is characterized by a high degree of endothermicity, typically requiring operation at high temperatures (400-750°C), which complicates the precise control of olefin selectivity. Given the current limitations in producing sufficient light olefins to meet the escalating market demand, there is a growing interest in developing new techniques to enhance olefin production. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes entails the cleavage of two carbon-hydrogen bonds, simultaneously releasing the corresponding alkene along with a molecular hydrogen.

The growing demand for propene in the chemical industry has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This process is favored because it efficiently converts propane into propene, offering both economic and environmental benefits.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propene is driven by its ability to efficiently convert propane to propene, thereby meeting the growing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. Economically, this process is advantageous due to its high conversion rates and lower dependency on fossil fuels compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, it promotes sustainability by potentially utilizing alternative feedstocks like coal and biomass-derived syngas with a lower H2/CO ratio, reducing the carbon footprint and promoting the circular economy. The process is not only economically viable but also environmentally sustainable, making it a preferred choice for propene production.

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly grown, leading to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the expanding needs for propene across various applications. Propane dehydrogenation enables the direct conversion of propane to propylene, a versatile olefin, without the need for additional refining steps. This not only enhances efficiency but also reduces environmental impact by minimizing energy consumption and waste generation compared to traditional methods. Economically, it provides a cost-effective way to produce propylene, a key component in the synthesis of numerous chemicals and plastics, thereby supporting the growth of industries relying on these products.

Metal-free boron-based catalysts demonstrate high catalytic efficiency and exceptional olefin selectivity, surpassing many metal oxide catalysts. They are considered promising for industrializing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, offering superior selectivity towards light olefins and minimizing CO2 emissions. Under the ODH conditions, no measurable conversion of propylene was observed when tested with C3H6/O2/He, and they exhibit low COx selectivity with negligible CO2 emission during the ODH of light alkanes. At a propane conversion level of around 20%, the total COx selectivity remains below 10%, and the CO2 selectivity is less than 1%. Metal-free boron-based catalysts hold significant promise for industrial ODH processes, offering the benefits of high activity, excellent olefin selectivity, and reduced CO2 emissions, thus promoting atom economy in the production of valuable carbon-based products.
