          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."
          [2] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."
          [3] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."
          [4] "Another important advantage of ODH of propane is the availability of water as a product, which helps to avoid thermodynamics limitations as observed during catalytic cracking reactions."
          [5] "Keeping this in mind, a mixed γAl2O3/CaO support is synthesized to achieve the appropriate balance between metal and support functionality."
          [6] "It is observed that VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 displays higher propylene selectivity (94.1%) and lower selectivity of CO2 due to it is moderate active sitesupport interactions."
          [7] "On the other hand, the performance of the VOx based catalysts can be improved by controlling their surface morphology and acid-base properties."
          [8] "These values are consistent with the product selectivity as observed in the catalyst evaluation experiments."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its broad applications, serving as a critical building block. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because of the energy efficiency and minimal environmental impact of this approach. Economically, the ODH route is more cost-effective due to the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery gases. Environmentally, it produces fewer emissions compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking. The use of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts offers a distinct advantage, characterized by lower activation energy for propene formation (120.3 kJ/mol) and higher activation energy for undesired CO2 formation (55.2 kJ/mol) compared to VOx/CaO catalysts (126.7 kJ/mol for propene and 32.8 kJ/mol for CO2), resulting in superior propene selectivity and lower CO2 selectivity, aligning with the observed product selectivity in the catalyst evaluation experiments.

          丙烯在化工行业的地位已经随着它广泛的应用而不断演变，作为关键的基础材料之一。其需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢化作为一种优选生产方法的采用，这归功于这种方法在能源效率和对环境影响的最小化方面的优势。经济上，ODH途径更具成本效益，因为丙烷在天然气和炼油厂气体中的丰富可用性。环境上，它与传统的催化裂解方法相比产生了更少的排放。使用VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂提供了独特的优势，表现为用于丙烯形成的激活能较低（120.3 kJ/mol）和用于不期望的二氧化碳形成的激活能较高（55.2 kJ/mol），与基于VOx/CaO的催化剂相比（丙烯为126.7 kJ/mol，二氧化碳为32.8 kJ/mol），这导致了更高的丙烯选择性和更低的二氧化碳选择性，与催化剂评估实验观察到的产品选择性一致。
