          [1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."
          [2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."
          [3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins, because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."
          [4] "This reaction is highly endothermic and typically operates at high temperature (400750 C), which makes it difficult to control the selectivity to the target olefins."
          [5] "Metal-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts in particular, have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their excellent activity and high selectivity to olefins."
          [6] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology (the Pacol process) on the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst was commercialized by UOP for producing linear alkenes for detergents in 1968."
          [7] "Compared with non-oxidative dehydrogenation, it suffers from deep oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes to COx, which results in loss of olefin selectivity and yield."
          [8] "In this regard, this review will focus on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
          [9] "The introduction of the promoters can remarkably improve their catalytic performances, especially in terms of selectivity to target olefins and catalytic stability."
          [10] "However, the loading amount of active metals is quite low (0.5 wt%), resulting in low catalytic productivity."

          The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as a key component for producing valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, which offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods. This process efficiently converts abundant and inexpensive light alkanes into high-value olefins, particularly propene, providing a sustainable alternative to methods relying on crude oil or heavy oil. Metal-based catalysts, especially those containing platinum, are widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their high activity and selectivity for olefins. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized by UOP in 1968 for producing linear alkenes for detergents. While non-oxidative dehydrogenation offers an alternative approach, it suffers from deep oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes to COx, leading to a loss of olefin selectivity and yield. Promoters can significantly enhance the catalytic performance, particularly in terms of olefin selectivity and stability. However, the low loading amount of active metals (0.5 wt%) results in low catalytic productivity.

          丙烯在化工行业的地位已经演变成为生产高价值聚合物、氧化剂和化学中间体的关键组成部分。对其需求的增长推动了采用丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法，这一方法在经济和环保方面优于传统方法。该过程能够高效地将丰富的、价格低廉的轻烷烃转化为高价值的烯烃，特别是丙烯，提供了一种可持续的替代方法，无需依赖原油或重油。金属基催化剂，尤其是铂基催化剂，广泛用于烷烃脱氢，因其具有高活性和烯烃选择性。1968年，UOP商业化的首个工业烷烃脱氢技术——Pacol过程，用于生产用于洗涤剂的线性烯烃。虽然非氧化脱氢提供了另一种方法，但它会导致轻烷烃和烯烃深度氧化为COx，从而导致烯烃选择性和产量的损失。添加助剂可以显著提高催化剂的性能，特别是在目标烯烃的选择性和催化剂稳定性方面。然而，活性金属的低负载量（0.5 wt%）导致了低催化生产力。

          [5] "In addition, these routes right now cannot produce sufficient light olefins to satisfy the increasing market demand, which motivates an interest in seeking other means for producing light olefins."
          [6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes involves the breaking of two carbonhydrogen bonds with simultaneous release of a corresponding alkene together with a molecular hydrogen."

          Light olefins, including ethylene, propylene, and butene, are essential bulk commodities and foundational components in the production of valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The rapid growth in demand for these useful olefins has encouraged the exploration of alternative production methods, particularly catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This process is characterized by a high degree of endothermicity, typically requiring operation at high temperatures (400-750°C), which complicates the precise control of olefin selectivity. Given the current limitations in producing sufficient light olefins to meet the escalating market demand, there is a growing interest in developing new techniques to enhance olefin production. The dehydrogenation of light alkanes entails the cleavage of two carbon-hydrogen bonds, simultaneously releasing the corresponding alkene along with a molecular hydrogen.

          包括乙烯、丙烯和丁烯在内的轻烯烃是重要的大宗商品和生产高价值聚合物、氧化剂和化学中间体的基础成分。这些有用烯烃需求的快速增长促进了对替代生产方法的研究，尤其是轻烷烃的非氧化脱氢催化过程。这一过程具有高度的吸热性，通常需要在较高温度（400-750°C）下运行，这使得精确控制目标烯烃的选择性变得复杂。鉴于目前无法生产足够的轻烯烃以满足不断增长的市场需求，开发新的技术以增强烯烃生产已成为研究热点。轻烷烃脱氢涉及切断两个碳-氢键，同时释放相应的烯烃以及分子氢。
