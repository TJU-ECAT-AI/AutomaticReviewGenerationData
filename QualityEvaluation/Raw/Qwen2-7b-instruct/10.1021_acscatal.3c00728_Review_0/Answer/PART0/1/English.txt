The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by its increasing demand. This has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propene, a key olefin used across various applications. The process offers several economic advantages, such as higher yield and lower operational costs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, it provides environmental benefits by potentially reducing emissions and improving energy efficiency.

Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry as a key feedstock for producing various valuable products, especially thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in the manufacturing of household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. Its most significant advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which doesn't require additional energy to speed up the process. High yields of propylene can be achieved with an efficient catalyst. In contrast to conventional commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more appealing due to its low operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The formation of water as a by-product in the ODH process helps to avoid thermodynamic constraints observed in non-oxidative methods. Selective production of propylene at low propane conversion rates is only advantageous because of the lower reactivity of propane compared to propylene. There is a need to design a catalyst that provides the optimal level of lattice oxygen for selectively producing propylene with minimal carbon oxides through primary and secondary combustions. Controlling the redox properties, surface morphology of VOx, and acid-base characteristics can enhance catalyst performance. The addition of calcium oxide (CaO) improves the catalyst's surface area and acidity, maximizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while minimizing propylene and propane combustion. The main advantage of this process is the potential to achieve higher propylene selectivity by controlling the lattice oxygen of the catalysts. This process has a significant economic impact, with worldwide sales/demand for propylene exceeding $90 billion.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by the increasing demand for versatile olefins in various applications. Traditionally, propene is produced through naphtha cracking, but this method only yields limited amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene. This gap in supply and demand for propylene has led to the exploration of alternative production methods, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability.

          One alternative to PDH is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed. In recent years, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have emerged as active and selective catalysts for ODHP, offering higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts.

          Research shows that these materials can effectively convert propane to propylene under certain conditions, and studies by other researchers have demonstrated success in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over hBN. Table 1 in the document summarizes the results of these studies, highlighting the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propylene and other olefins.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its broad applications, serving as a critical building block. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because of the energy efficiency and minimal environmental impact of this approach. Economically, the ODH route is more cost-effective due to the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery gases. Environmentally, it produces fewer emissions compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking. The use of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts offers a distinct advantage, characterized by lower activation energy for propene formation (120.3 kJ/mol) and higher activation energy for undesired CO2 formation (55.2 kJ/mol) compared to VOx/CaO catalysts (126.7 kJ/mol for propene and 32.8 kJ/mol for CO2), resulting in superior propene selectivity and lower CO2 selectivity, aligning with the observed product selectivity in the catalyst evaluation experiments.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as a key component for producing valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates.

The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized by UOP in 1968 for producing linear alkenes for detergents. While non-oxidative dehydrogenation offers an alternative approach, it suffers from deep oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes to COx, leading to a loss of olefin selectivity and yield. Promoters can significantly enhance the catalytic performance, particularly in terms of olefin selectivity and stability. However, the low loading amount of active metals (0.5 wt%) results in low catalytic productivity.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved over time due to its extensive use in manufacturing plastics, solvents, and other chemicals. Its increasing demand across sectors like packaging, automotive, and pharmaceuticals has led to the development of more efficient production methods. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become a preferred technique because it converts propane into propene more efficiently than traditional processes. Economically, PDH offers lower capital costs and operational expenses, making it a cost-effective solution. Environmentally, PDH reduces greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation. As the demand for propene grows, the adoption of PDH is anticipated to increase, supporting sustainable industrial expansion and fulfilling the growing needs for this versatile olefin.

The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to significantly increase in the near future. Traditional methods such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are employed for olefin production, but they face challenges like being endothermic and causing coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen presents an appealing alternative, offering lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation. Additionally, CO2 plays a key role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and catalysts with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M show the highest efficiency in propene conversion, though higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by its increasing demand. This has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propene, a key olefin used across various applications. The process offers several economic advantages, such as higher yield and lower operational costs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, it provides environmental benefits by potentially reducing emissions and improving energy efficiency.

Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry as a key feedstock for producing various valuable products, especially thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in the manufacturing of household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. Its most significant advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which doesn't require additional energy to speed up the process. High yields of propylene can be achieved with an efficient catalyst. In contrast to conventional commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more appealing due to its low operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The formation of water as a by-product in the ODH process helps to avoid thermodynamic constraints observed in non-oxidative methods. Selective production of propylene at low propane conversion rates is only advantageous because of the lower reactivity of propane compared to propylene. There is a need to design a catalyst that provides the optimal level of lattice oxygen for selectively producing propylene with minimal carbon oxides through primary and secondary combustions. Controlling the redox properties, surface morphology of VOx, and acid-base characteristics can enhance catalyst performance. The addition of calcium oxide (CaO) improves the catalyst's surface area and acidity, maximizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while minimizing propylene and propane combustion. The main advantage of this process is the potential to achieve higher propylene selectivity by controlling the lattice oxygen of the catalysts. This process has a significant economic impact, with worldwide sales/demand for propylene exceeding $90 billion.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by the increasing demand for versatile olefins in various applications. Traditionally, propene is produced through naphtha cracking, but this method only yields limited amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene. This gap in supply and demand for propylene has led to the exploration of alternative production methods, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability.

          One alternative to PDH is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed. In recent years, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have emerged as active and selective catalysts for ODHP, offering higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts.

          Research shows that these materials can effectively convert propane to propylene under certain conditions, and studies by other researchers have demonstrated success in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over hBN. Table 1 in the document summarizes the results of these studies, highlighting the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propylene and other olefins.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its broad applications, serving as a critical building block. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because of the energy efficiency and minimal environmental impact of this approach. Economically, the ODH route is more cost-effective due to the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery gases. Environmentally, it produces fewer emissions compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking. The use of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts offers a distinct advantage, characterized by lower activation energy for propene formation (120.3 kJ/mol) and higher activation energy for undesired CO2 formation (55.2 kJ/mol) compared to VOx/CaO catalysts (126.7 kJ/mol for propene and 32.8 kJ/mol for CO2), resulting in superior propene selectivity and lower CO2 selectivity, aligning with the observed product selectivity in the catalyst evaluation experiments.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved as a key component for producing valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, which offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods. This process efficiently converts abundant and inexpensive light alkanes into high-value olefins, particularly propene, providing a sustainable alternative to methods relying on crude oil or heavy oil. Metal-based catalysts, especially those containing platinum, are widely used for alkane dehydrogenation due to their high activity and selectivity for olefins. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process, was commercialized by UOP in 1968 for producing linear alkenes for detergents. While non-oxidative dehydrogenation offers an alternative approach, it suffers from deep oxidation of light alkanes and alkenes to COx, leading to a loss of olefin selectivity and yield. Promoters can significantly enhance the catalytic performance, particularly in terms of olefin selectivity and stability. However, the low loading amount of active metals (0.5 wt%) results in low catalytic productivity.

The increasing demand for propene has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Economic advantages include lower capital costs and higher efficiency compared to traditional methods. Environmental benefits come from reduced emissions and the potential for more sustainable feedstocks. This approach meets the growing needs for propene across various applications due to its versatility and efficiency.

The development of a bifunctional catalyst system for converting syngas to light olefins, specifically targeting high selectivity for C2=C4= olefins (up to 80%) and C2C4 hydrocarbons (94% at 17% CO conversion), surpasses conventional catalyst limitations. The catalyst comprises a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) with a hierarchical pore structure. This system allows for the separation of CO activation and CC coupling onto distinct active sites with complementary properties, enhancing the selectivity for desired products. The process achieves high yields of light olefins with minimal formation of unwanted methane and C5+ products, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTTO) methods. The bifunctional nature of the catalyst, characterized by the ability to adjust CO conversion through the mass ratio of oxide to zeolite, contributes to its superior performance in producing light olefins with high purity and selectivity.
