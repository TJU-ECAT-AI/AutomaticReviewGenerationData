          [5] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts."

[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
          [2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
          [3] "Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation [6]."

          [3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins, because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

          [9] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
          [10] "Furthermore, CO conversion could be tuned by varying the relative mass ratio of oxide/zeolite (fig. S4) (9), which lends further support to the above hypothesis that the composite catalyst is bifunctional and that the reaction involves intermediate transport in gas phase."

[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
          [2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
          [3] "Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation [6]."

          [3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins, because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

          [3] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1) (9)."
          [4] "Selectivities varied in the range from 67 to 80% for C2=C4= and 81 to 94% for C2C4 in the studied H2/CO (0.5 to 3.0) and space velocity ranges (1285 to 7714 ml/h·gcat) and different ratios of ZnCrOx/MSAPO."
          [5] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
          [6] "In contrast, the C1 and C5+ products were difficult to suppress simultaneously in FTTO; causing one to decline caused the other to increase (1, 7)."
          [7] "The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat."
          [8] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
          [9] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
          [10] "Furthermore, CO conversion could be tuned by varying the relative mass ratio of oxide/zeolite (fig. S4) (9), which lends further support to the above hypothesis that the composite catalyst is bifunctional and that the reaction involves intermediate transport in gas phase."
