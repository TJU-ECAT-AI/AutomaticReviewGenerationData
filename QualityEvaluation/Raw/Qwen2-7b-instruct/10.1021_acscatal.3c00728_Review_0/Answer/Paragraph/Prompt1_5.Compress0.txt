Its most significant advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which doesn't require additional energy to speed up the process. High yields of propylene can be achieved with an efficient catalyst. In contrast to conventional commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more appealing due to its low operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The formation of water as a by-product in the ODH process helps to avoid thermodynamic constraints observed in non-oxidative methods. Selective production of propylene at low propane conversion rates is only advantageous because of the lower reactivity of propane compared to propylene. There is a need to design a catalyst that provides the optimal level of lattice oxygen for selectively producing propylene with minimal carbon oxides through primary and secondary combustions. Controlling the redox properties, surface morphology of VOx, and acid-base characteristics can enhance catalyst performance. The addition of calcium oxide (CaO) improves the catalyst's surface area and acidity, maximizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while minimizing propylene and propane combustion. The main advantage of this process is the potential to achieve higher propylene selectivity by controlling the lattice oxygen of the catalysts. This process has a significant economic impact, with worldwide sales/demand for propylene exceeding $90 billion.", "Doi": "10.1039/C6CY00078A"},
