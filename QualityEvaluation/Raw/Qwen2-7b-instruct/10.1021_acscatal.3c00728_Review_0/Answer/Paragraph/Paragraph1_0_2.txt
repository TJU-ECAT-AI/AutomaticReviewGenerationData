        The evolving significance of propene in the chemical industry: Drivers of increasing demand, diverse applications, and the emergence of propane dehydrogenation as an economically viable and environmentally friendly production method, has been comprehensively analyzed through the lens of recent studies \[1-22\]. Propane dehydrogenation, notably through oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, offers a more sustainable and cost-effective route to propene production, especially when compared to traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). This approach leverages the exothermic nature of the reactions, thereby requiring less energy input, and minimizes the formation of coke, a byproduct of conventional methods that often necessitates additional processing steps.

        The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation are manifold. It provides a more cost-effective method for propene production, reducing operational expenses and capital costs. Moreover, the environmental benefits are significant, as propane dehydrogenation processes emit fewer pollutants compared to traditional methods, contributing to a more sustainable industrial practice.

        From an environmental standpoint, propane dehydrogenation has the potential to reduce carbon footprints, aligning with the growing emphasis on sustainability in the chemical industry. The integration of advanced catalysts, such as those composed of partially reduced ZnCrOx and mesoporous SAPO zeolite MSAPO \[2\], showcases how optimized catalyst designs can achieve high selectivity for desired products, such as propylene, with minimal waste and energy consumption.

        The use of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane \[7\] represents a novel advancement, offering higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts. This highlights the potential for emerging materials to revolutionize propene production, making the process more efficient and sustainable.

        The future of propane dehydrogenation holds promise in addressing the growing demands for propene across various applications. By focusing on the optimization of the propane dehydrogenation process, industries can ensure a reliable supply of propene while minimizing environmental impact. The development of new catalysts and reactor designs, along with the integration of advanced materials like hBN, are poised to drive the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method.

        The evolving landscape of propane dehydrogenation underscores its pivotal role in the chemical industry's quest for sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective propene production. The advancements in catalyst design, process optimization, and the exploration of new materials like hBN are expected to further enhance the economic and environmental advantages of this approach, positioning propane dehydrogenation as a key player in the industry's ongoing evolution towards more sustainable practices.

        化学工业中丙烯日益重要的地位：需求增加、应用多样以及通过丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为经济可行且环境友好的生产方法的兴起，通过近来研究 \[1-22\] 的深入分析得到了全面阐述。通过分子氧进行的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）为丙烯生产提供了一种更可持续和成本效益更高的途径，相较于传统的裂解方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）。该方法利用反应的放热性质，因此需要较少的能量输入，并减少了焦炭的形成，后者是传统方法中的一个常见副产品。

        PDH在经济上的优势显而易见。它提供了更低成本的丙烯生产方式，降低了运营费用和资本成本。此外，从环境角度来看，PDH排放的污染物较少，与化学工业对可持续性的重视相一致。

        在环境保护方面，PDH有潜力减少碳足迹，使其成为行业更可持续实践的关键部分。通过优化催化剂设计，例如使用部分还原的ZnCrOx和介孔SAPO沸石MSAPO \[2\]，可以实现对所需产品的高选择性，如丙烯，同时减少浪费和能源消耗。

        以六方氮化硼（hBN）作为丙烷氧化脱氢催化剂 \[7\] 的应用标志着一种新颖的进步，其选择性高于之前研究的催化剂。这表明新材料有可能彻底改变丙烯生产，使过程更加高效和环保。

        预计PDH的发展将在满足各种应用领域不断增长的丙烯需求方面发挥关键作用。通过优化PDH过程，行业可以确保可靠地供应丙烯，同时最小化环境影响。新催化剂的设计、过程优化以及对新材料如hBN的探索，有望进一步增强经济和环境优势，将PDH定位为化学工业持续向更可持续实践转型的关键参与者。
