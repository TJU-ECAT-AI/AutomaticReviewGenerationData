        The evolving significance of propene in the chemical industry is underscored by its growing demand and diverse applications, necessitating innovative production methods. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a preferred choice due to its economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods. The pivotal role of propene in manufacturing plastics, solvents, and other chemicals has seen a surge in its demand, driving the industry towards more efficient and sustainable production techniques.

        Economic advantages of PDH include lower capital costs and higher efficiency compared to traditional methods, enabling a more cost-effective route to propene production. This is particularly crucial given the vast applications of propene in various sectors such as packaging, automotive, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, environmental benefits come from reduced emissions and the potential for more sustainable feedstocks, aligning with the industry's push towards sustainability.

        The increasing demand for olefins, notably propylene, has propelled the adoption of PDH as a favored production method. This process, employing molecular oxygen, offers lower reaction temperatures and effective coke suppression, making it more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. CO2's role in enhancing the process underscores its efficiency, while the use of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts maximizes propene conversion and reduces CO2 selectivity, aligning with observed product selectivity in the catalyst evaluation experiments.

        Propane dehydrogenation is an attractive alternative to traditional methods like catalytic cracking, which suffer from high energy requirements, considerable coke formation, high operating costs, and low efficiency. The exothermic nature of the overall reactions in the ODH process results in minimal energy demand, and the availability of water as a product helps avoid thermodynamics limitations, further highlighting its economic viability.

        Emerging catalysts, such as those containing hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), offer higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts, demonstrating the potential for optimized PDH processes. This not only improves the efficiency of propene production but also supports the industry's growth in a sustainable manner.

        The pivotal role of propene in the chemical industry has been further emphasized by its increasing demand, driving the development of more efficient production methods. Propane dehydrogenation, with its economic and environmental advantages, has become a preferred solution to meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

        Looking ahead, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining catalysts to optimize selectivity, enhancing the process to reduce energy consumption, and exploring the integration of renewable feedstocks to further reduce environmental impact. This could lead to the development of more sustainable and efficient propene production processes, ensuring the chemical industry's growth aligns with sustainability goals.

        化学工业中丙烯的重要性不断演变，其需求增长和广泛应用推动了生产方法的创新。丙烷脱氢（PDH）因其经济和环境优势而成为首选，超越了传统方法。丙烯在塑料、溶剂和其他化学品制造中的关键作用及其日益增长的需求，促使行业转向更高效和可持续的生产技术。

        PDH的经济优势包括较低的资本成本和更高的效率，使得丙烯生产更具成本效益。这特别重要，因为丙烯在包装、汽车和制药等多个领域有着广泛的应用。此外，环境优势在于减少了排放，并有可能使用更可持续的原料，符合行业向可持续性转变的目标。

        丙烯需求的增长推动了PDH作为首选生产方法的采用。这一过程利用分子氧，提供较低的反应温度和有效的焦炭抑制，使其更加节能和环保。CO2在增强过程中起到的作用突显了其效率，而使用VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂可以最大化丙烯转化并降低CO2选择性，与催化剂评估实验观察到的产品选择性一致。

        与传统方法如催化裂化相比，PDH具有更高的经济性，后者面临高能效需求、大量焦炭形成、高运营成本和低效率的问题。总体反应的放热性质使ODH过程的能源需求降至最低，而产品水的可用性有助于避免催化裂化反应的热力学限制，进一步证明其经济可行性。

        新型催化剂，如含六方氮化硼（hBN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs），显示出比先前研究的催化剂更高的丙烯选择性，表明优化PDH过程的潜力。这不仅提高了丙烯生产的效率，而且支持了行业在可持续性方面的增长。

        丙烯在化学工业中的核心地位进一步凸显了其日益增长的需求，推动了更高效生产方法的发展。PDH以其经济和环境优势成为满足各种应用中这一多用途烯烃需求的首选解决方案。

        展望未来，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来的研发工作可能专注于改进催化剂以优化选择性、增强过程以减少能耗，并探索可再生原料的整合，以进一步减少环境影响。这可能导致开发更可持续和高效的丙烯生产流程，确保化学工业的发展与可持续发展目标保持一致。
