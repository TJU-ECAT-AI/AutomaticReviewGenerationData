            The evolving significance of propene in the chemical industry is underpinned by its critical role as a versatile building block for a myriad of applications, from plastics to pharmaceuticals. This pivotal position has driven the industry towards more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) standing out as a preferred choice. This review highlights how PDH, through its ability to convert propane into propene in a cost-effective and sustainable manner, meets the growing demands for this essential olefin.

            The economic and environmental advantages of PDH are compelling. It offers a more cost-effective route to propene production compared to traditional methods, with reduced operational costs and a minimized carbon footprint. This approach not only ensures a reliable supply of propene but also aligns with the industry's commitment to sustainability. The use of PDH in tandem with advanced catalysts, such as VOx/CaO-γAl2O3, showcases the method's potential to enhance propene selectivity and reduce emissions.

            Looking ahead, the integration of PDH into the chemical industry's production landscape promises a future of increased efficiency and environmental responsibility. The optimization of the PDH process, guided by insights from cutting-edge research, holds the key to ensuring a steady supply of propene that meets the diverse needs of the market while minimizing environmental impact. 

            The future of PDH is likely to be marked by the development of more efficient catalysts, improved reactor designs, and the integration of renewable feedstocks. These advancements will not only increase the propene output but also reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable chemical industry. As the global demand for propene continues to grow, the adoption of PDH will play a crucial role in supporting industrial growth while maintaining environmental stewardship.

            The review draws from multiple sources that collectively underscore the importance of PDH in the chemical industry, detailing its economic advantages, environmental benefits, and the role of advanced catalysts in enhancing its performance. The future outlook emphasizes the potential for innovation and the integration of PDH into a broader, more sustainable chemical production framework.
