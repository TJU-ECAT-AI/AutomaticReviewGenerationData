[1] "For supported metal catalysts, coke formation mechanisms consist of two stages: hydrocarbon molecules are dehydrogenated, and this is followed by the formation of unsaturated species on the metallic sites."
[2] "Moreover, a significant amount of coke formation in the reactor will increase the pressure drop, block the flow and decrease the production capacity, which affects the production efficiency."
[3] "Under the tough operating conditions, side reactions are promoted even more dramatically."
[4] "The catalyst using as-synthesized alumina as the support possessed a moderate acidity that could minimize the undesirable side reactions and inhibit the coke formation."
[5] "It was observed that the amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts was determined by TG analysis in a temperature-programmed oxidation mode (TPO), and the weight loss curves of the two deactivated samples and corresponding digital photographs are shown in Fig. 3a."
[6] "The different colors of the two types of spent catalysts may be related to the different coke species, which was further investigated by using FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown substantially due to its versatile applications across various sectors, including polymers, solvents, and fuels. Its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method of production. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation enables the direct conversion of abundant propane resources into valuable propene, enhancing profitability and reducing reliance on imported crude oil. Environmentally, this method often involves lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods, contributing to sustainability efforts. Additionally, the propene produced can be utilized efficiently in the manufacture of plastics, packaging materials, and other consumer goods, driving innovation and growth in multiple industries.

The as-synthesized alumina nanosheet, with its defect-rich structure, significantly influences the catalytic performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The presence of unsaturated coordinate Al3+ enhances the electronic interactions between platinum and tin species, tuning the electronic state of platinum. The lower acidity of the catalyst inhibits side reactions and coke formation, leading to excellent catalytic reactivity and stability. The lab-made catalyst facilitates an isobutene formation rate of 23.0 mol gPt1 h1 with a low deactivation rate of 0.0135 h1, compared to the reference catalyst's rates of 15.1 mol gPt1 h1 and 0.0303 h1, respectively. More importantly, the coke species are predominantly located on the support surface of the as-synthesized catalyst, possessing more aliphatics and a higher degree of disorder. This characteristic is advantageous for its elimination during combustion, enhancing the catalyst's regeneration performance. The isobutane conversion remains above 50% across recycling tests, with the isobutene selectivity close to 99% remaining unchanged, showcasing the potential of the as-synthesized alumina for Pt-based catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation.

1. The increasing demand for propene in the chemical industry has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its versatility across various applications. Economic advantages include cost-effectiveness and scalability, while environmental benefits focus on sustainable production methods and reduced emissions compared to traditional methods.

2. The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower operational costs, higher yields of valuable olefin products, and the potential for integrating renewable energy sources. Environmental advantages include reduced carbon footprint, minimized waste generation, and the ability to produce high-quality olefins from renewable propane sources.

3. The environmental impact of propane dehydrogenation is minimized through the use of advanced catalysts and optimized processes that reduce energy consumption and emissions. This includes the strategic placement of catalysts to control the reaction pathways and enhance selectivity, thereby reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts and increasing the efficiency of the conversion process.

4. The development of efficient and selective catalysts is critical for the success of propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts must be able to withstand harsh operating conditions, maintain high activity and stability over time, and minimize the formation of coke, which can degrade catalyst performance and lead to increased energy consumption for regeneration processes.

5. The use of alumina nanosheets as a support for PtSn catalysts has been found to improve the stability and selectivity of the catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation reactions. This is due to the unique structure of the alumina nanosheets, which provides a high surface area and allows for better dispersion of the metal components. The specific surface area of the alumina nanosheet (Al2O3-NS) was 228 m²/g, and it was synthesized using a hydrothermal method.

6. The alumina nanosheet supported PtSn catalyst showed an improved stability, selectivity, and activity compared to previously studied alumina-supported Pt-based catalysts. The key factor contributing to this improved performance was the rational design of the support structure, which allowed for better control of the acid sites on the surface of the catalyst. This resulted in a more efficient conversion of isobutane to isobutene with minimal coke formation.
