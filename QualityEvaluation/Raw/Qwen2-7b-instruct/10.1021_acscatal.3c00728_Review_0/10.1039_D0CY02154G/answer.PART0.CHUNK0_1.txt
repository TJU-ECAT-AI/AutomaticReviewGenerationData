[1] "For supported metal catalysts, coke formation mechanisms consist of two stages: hydrocarbon molecules are dehydrogenated, and this is followed by the formation of unsaturated species on the metallic sites."
[2] "These unsaturated species then migrate to the acid sites to further catalyze the formation of coke."
[3] "The ability to control the natural property of the acid sites is of great significance in improving the utilization efficiency of alumina-supported catalysts."
[4] "As reported, the catalytic behaviors of the acid sites are dependent on their type, strength and amount."
[5] "The use of the laboratory-made catalyst facilitated an isobutene formation rate of 23.0 mol gPt1 h1 with a low deactivation rate of 0.0135 h1, whereas those values for the reference catalyst were 15.1 mol gPt1 h1 and 0.0303 h1, respectively."
[6] "Furthermore, more coke species were located on the as-synthesized support surface, and the coke possessed more aliphatics and a higher degree of disorder, which was beneficial for its elimination during the combustion process."

1. The increasing demand for propene in the chemical industry has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its versatility across various applications. Economic advantages include cost-effectiveness and scalability, while environmental benefits focus on sustainable production methods and reduced emissions compared to traditional methods.

2. The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower operational costs, higher yields of valuable olefin products, and the potential for integrating renewable energy sources. Environmental advantages include reduced carbon footprint, minimized waste generation, and the ability to produce high-quality olefins from renewable propane sources.

3. The environmental impact of propane dehydrogenation is minimized through the use of advanced catalysts and optimized processes that reduce energy consumption and emissions. This includes the strategic placement of catalysts to control the reaction pathways and enhance selectivity, thereby reducing the formation of unwanted byproducts and increasing the efficiency of the conversion process.

4. The development of efficient and selective catalysts is critical for the success of propane dehydrogenation. These catalysts must be able to withstand harsh operating conditions, maintain high activity and stability over time, and minimize the formation of coke, which can degrade catalyst performance and lead to increased energy consumption for regeneration processes.

5. The use of alumina nanosheets as a support for PtSn catalysts has been found to improve the stability and selectivity of the catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation reactions. This is due to the unique structure of the alumina nanosheets, which provides a high surface area and allows for better dispersion of the metal components. The specific surface area of the alumina nanosheet (Al2O3-NS) was 228 m²/g, and it was synthesized using a hydrothermal method.

6. The alumina nanosheet supported PtSn catalyst showed an improved stability, selectivity, and activity compared to previously studied alumina-supported Pt-based catalysts. The key factor contributing to this improved performance was the rational design of the support structure, which allowed for better control of the acid sites on the surface of the catalyst. This resulted in a more efficient conversion of isobutane to isobutene with minimal coke formation.

1. 丙烯在化学工业中的需求增长推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为它在各种应用中具有灵活性。经济优势包括成本效益和可扩展性，而环境优势则集中在可持续生产方法以及与传统方法相比减少排放。

2. 丙烷脱氢的优势经济方面包括较低的操作成本、更高的有价值烯烃产品的产量，以及可能集成可再生能源源的能力。环境优势包括降低碳足迹、减少废物生成，并能够从可再生丙烷来源生产高质量的烯烃。

3. 丙烷脱氢的环境影响通过使用先进的催化剂和优化过程来最小化，这些过程可以降低能耗和排放。这包括将催化剂战略性地放置在控制反应途径和增强选择性的位置上，从而减少副产品的形成并提高转化过程的效率。

4. 高效且选择性的催化剂对于丙烷脱氢的成功至关重要。这些催化剂必须能够在恶劣的运行条件下保持高活性和稳定性，并尽可能减少焦炭的形成，焦炭会降解催化剂性能并导致增加能量消耗以进行再生过程。

5. 使用氧化铝纳米片作为PtSn催化剂的支撑物已被发现可以改善异丁烷脱氢反应中催化剂的稳定性和选择性。这种改进是由于纳米片氧化铝的独特结构提供了高的比表面积，并允许金属成分的更好分散。纳米片氧化铝的比表面积为每克228平方米。

6. 所制备的Al2O3-NS支持的PtSn催化剂在异丁烷脱氢过程中显示了改进的稳定性和活性。关键因素是支撑结构的合理设计，这允许对催化剂表面的酸位有更有效的控制。这导致了更高效的异丁烷转化为异丁烯，并且焦炭形成最少。
