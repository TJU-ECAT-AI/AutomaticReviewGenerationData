[1] "Coke formation is one of the most frequent causes of catalyst deactivation in steam reforming, (de)hydrogenation, water-gas shift and other important industrial catalytic processes."
[2] "The coke can poison the active sites or limit the access of the reactants to the active sites by partial or complete blockage of the porosity, thereby reducing the catalytic activity and eventually deactivating the catalysts completely as the time on stream increases."
[3] "Under the tough operating conditions, side reactions are promoted even more dramatically.4,19"
[4] "The use of the laboratory-made catalyst facilitated an isobutene formation rate of 23.0 mol gPt1 h1 with a low deactivation rate of 0.0135 h1, whereas those values for the reference catalyst were 15.1 mol gPt1 h1 and 0.0303 h1, respectively."
[5] "More coke species were located on the as-synthesized support surface, and the coke possessed more aliphatics and a higher degree of disorder, which was beneficial for its elimination during the combustion process."

Isobutene is a highly valuable olefin in the chemical industry, essential for the production of numerous downstream chemicals, plastics, and fuels. Its increasing demand is driven by the growth in petrochemical industries, especially in the production of polyethylene and polypropylene. Propane dehydrogenation is preferred as it offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective route to produce propene compared to traditional methods like thermal cracking or steam cracking. Economic advantages include higher yield, lower energy consumption, and flexibility in feedstock usage. Environmentally, this approach reduces emissions and waste generation, making it a sustainable option for propene production. The use of a defect-rich alumina nanosheet as a support for a PtSn catalyst facilitates excellent catalytic reactivity and stability in isobutane dehydrogenation, enhancing propene production efficiency. The coke deposited on the support surface possesses more aliphatics and a higher degree of disorder, which improves its combustibility, ensuring efficient regeneration and maintaining high catalyst performance.
