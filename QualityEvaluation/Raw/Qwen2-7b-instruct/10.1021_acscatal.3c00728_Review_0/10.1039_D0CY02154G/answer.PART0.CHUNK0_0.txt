[1] "For supported metal catalysts, coke formation mechanisms consist of two stages: hydrocarbon molecules are dehydrogenated, and this is followed by the formation of unsaturated species on the metallic sites."
[2] "Moreover, a significant amount of coke formation in the reactor will increase the pressure drop, block the flow and decrease the production capacity, which affects the production efficiency."
[3] "Under the tough operating conditions, side reactions are promoted even more dramatically."
[4] "The catalyst using as-synthesized alumina as the support possessed a moderate acidity that could minimize the undesirable side reactions and inhibit the coke formation."
[5] "It was observed that the amount of coke deposited on the spent catalysts was determined by TG analysis in a temperature-programmed oxidation mode (TPO), and the weight loss curves of the two deactivated samples and corresponding digital photographs are shown in Fig. 3a."
[6] "The different colors of the two types of spent catalysts may be related to the different coke species, which was further investigated by using FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown substantially due to its versatile applications across various sectors, including polymers, solvents, and fuels. Its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method of production. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation enables the direct conversion of abundant propane resources into valuable propene, enhancing profitability and reducing reliance on imported crude oil. Environmentally, this method often involves lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods, contributing to sustainability efforts. Additionally, the propene produced can be utilized efficiently in the manufacture of plastics, packaging materials, and other consumer goods, driving innovation and growth in multiple industries.

The as-synthesized alumina nanosheet, with its defect-rich structure, significantly influences the catalytic performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The presence of unsaturated coordinate Al3+ enhances the electronic interactions between platinum and tin species, tuning the electronic state of platinum. The lower acidity of the catalyst inhibits side reactions and coke formation, leading to excellent catalytic reactivity and stability. The lab-made catalyst facilitates an isobutene formation rate of 23.0 mol gPt1 h1 with a low deactivation rate of 0.0135 h1, compared to the reference catalyst's rates of 15.1 mol gPt1 h1 and 0.0303 h1, respectively. More importantly, the coke species are predominantly located on the support surface of the as-synthesized catalyst, possessing more aliphatics and a higher degree of disorder. This characteristic is advantageous for its elimination during combustion, enhancing the catalyst's regeneration performance. The isobutane conversion remains above 50% across recycling tests, with the isobutene selectivity close to 99% remaining unchanged, showcasing the potential of the as-synthesized alumina for Pt-based catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation.
