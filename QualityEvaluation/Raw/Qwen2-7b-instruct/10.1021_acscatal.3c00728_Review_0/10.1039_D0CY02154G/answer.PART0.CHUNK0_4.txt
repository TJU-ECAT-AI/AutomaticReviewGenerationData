[1] "For supported metal catalysts, coke formation mechanisms consist of two stages: hydrocarbon molecules are dehydrogenated, and this is followed by the formation of unsaturated species on the metallic sites. These unsaturated species then migrate to the acid sites to further catalyze the formation of coke."
[2] "Compared to propane molecules, isobutane molecules with more CC and CH bonds are easier to activate under the same reaction conditions. The unwanted side reactions are promoted dramatically to lead to more by-products and coke formation."
[3] "Notably, the initial isobutane conversion over the PtSnAl2O3-NS catalyst (54.6%) was much higher than that over the PtSnAl2O3-Ref catalyst (43.5%), as was the isobutene selectivity (Fig. 1a)."
[4] "As a contrast, it was observed that there was significant enhancement in terms of reactivity and stability for PtSn/Al2O3-NS, and the isobutene formation rate only slightly decreased from 23.0 to 19.8 mol gPt1 h1."
[5] "This study demonstrated that rational design of the support structure could be an efficient strategy to govern the coke behaviors of supported catalysts, and thus could be used to provide guidelines for future catalyst design with high reactivity and stability for a variety of catalytic applications."

1. The increasing demand for propene in the chemical industry has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic advantages such as cost-effectiveness in production and environmental benefits including reduced carbon emissions compared to traditional methods. The versatility of propene across various applications makes this method increasingly attractive for meeting growing needs.

2. The economic advantage of propane dehydrogenation lies in its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. By converting propane to propene, industries can produce a more valuable chemical feedstock, potentially leading to higher profits. Environmentally, the method may offer lower carbon footprints compared to alternatives, contributing to sustainability goals.

3. The isobutane dehydrogenation catalyst, PtSnAl2O3-NS, demonstrated significantly higher initial conversion (54.6%) and isobutene selectivity compared to the reference catalyst (43.5%). This indicates a higher reactivity and selectivity.

4. Over time, the isobutene formation rate of the PtSnAl2O3-NS catalyst only slightly decreased from 23.0 to 19.8 mol gPt1 h1, showing remarkable stability. In contrast, the reference catalyst saw a drop from 15.1 to 9.9 mol gPt1 h1, highlighting the enhanced stability of the PtSnAl2O3-NS catalyst.

5. The study suggests that designing the support structure rationally can effectively manage the coke formation behavior of supported catalysts. This finding provides guidelines for creating catalysts with high reactivity and stability for diverse catalytic applications, potentially revolutionizing the field.
