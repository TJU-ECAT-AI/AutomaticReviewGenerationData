Abstract
Conspectus
Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene form the foundation of the modern chemical industry, with yearly production volumes well into the hundreds of millions of metric tons. Currently, these light olefins are mainly produced via energy-intensive steam cracking. Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to produce olefins allows for lower operation temperatures and extended catalyst lifetimes, potentially leading to valuable process efficiencies. The potential benefits of this route have led to significant research interest due to the wide availability of natural gas from shale deposits. Advances in this area have still not yielded catalysts that are sufficiently selective to olefins for industrial implementation, and ODH still remains a holy grail of selective alkane oxidation research. The main challenge in selective oxidation lies in preventing the overoxidation of the desired product, such as propylene during propane oxidation, to CO and CO2. Research into selective heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has led to the extensive use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, and studies on the surface mechanism involved have been used to improve the catalytic activity of the material. Despite decades of research, however, selectivity toward propylene has not proven satisfactory at industrially relevant conversions. It is imperative for new catalytic systems that minimize product overoxidation to be developed for future applications of oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
While rational catalyst design has been successful in developing homogeneous catalyst systems, its practical use in heterogeneous catalyst development remains modest. The complexity of surfaces with a variety of terminations and bulk structures, let alone their modification by the chemical potential of a reaction mixture, makes heterogeneous catalyst discovery serendipitous in many cases. The catalyst family presented in this Account is no exception. The importance of catalysis research lies in exploring the science behind serendipity.
In this Account, we will first present our initial discovery of boron nitride (BN) as an unexpected catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Beyond its surprising activity, BN also drew interest due to its low selectivity to carbon oxides. This observation made BN distinct from previously studied metal oxide catalysts for selective alkane oxidation. We narrowed down its unique reactivity to the oxygen functionalization of the catalyst surface, particularly the formation of B–O species as probed by various spectroscopic techniques. In investigating the critical role of each of the structural elements during ODH, we discovered that not only BN but an entire class of boron-containing compounds are active and selective for the formation of propylene from propane.
All these materials form a complex oxidized surface with a distribution of BOx surface sites. This discovery opens the doors to a new field of boron-based oxidation chemistry that currently has more questions than answers. We aim to make this Account a starting point for the research community to explore these new materials to understand their surface mechanisms and the surface species that offer a unique selectivity toward olefinic products. Effective use of these materials may lead to novel processes for efficient use of abundant light alkane resources by oxidation chemistry.

1. Introduction
 Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively. (1) Traditionally, these and other light olefins have been produced through the cracking of oil-derived naphtha. In recent years, natural gas has emerged as an abundant resource, and it has become economically viable to retrofit naphtha crackers to use ethane as a feedstock. In contrast to the cracking of naphtha, which produces a wide array of light olefins, the cracking of ethane mainly produces ethylene, and only sparing amounts of heavier olefins are formed (Figure 1). (2) This difference in product distribution has created a gap between the amount of C3 and C4 olefins produced from crackers and their market demand. Therefore, “on-purpose” processes, mainly nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation (DH), have been industrially implemented to close this gap. In fact, UOP estimates that by 2020 approximately 20% of propylene will be produced by on-purpose processes like DH. (3) There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels. Additionally, the two main catalysts employed in DH, CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, deactivate with time-on-stream due to severe coke deposition, which must be burned off periodically to regain activity. (4) These factors increase capital and operational costs for DH plants.

A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes. Despite these benefits, a selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to their respective olefins has been sought after for many decades to no avail, due to the delicate balance between the conversion of the alkane to the olefin and its subsequent overoxidation to CO and CO2. Supported vanadium oxides have shown decent selectivity to propylene in the ODH of propane, albeit at low conversions, leading to low olefin yields. With these catalysts, selectivity to propylene is only 60% at approximately 10% conversion. (5)
Within the ODH literature, it has been established that product selectivity is controlled by the type of oxygen speciation present on the catalyst surface under reaction conditions, and these are either nucleophilic or electrophilic in nature. (1) For metal oxides, nucleophilic species consist of metal bound oxo (M═O) or oxygen bridging metal centers (M–O–M) and are said to be selective for the conversion of alkane to olefin. On the other hand, electrophilic species such as metal bound peroxo (M>O2 or M–O–O–M) or superoxo (M–O2–) are more likely to burn the formed olefin to COx. (6) Decades of structural tuning based upon mechanistic insights and thorough spectroscopic characterization have unfortunately not yet yielded metal oxide catalysts that can activate oxygen in a manner that is only selective for producing the desired olefin.
Despite popular belief, reality shows very few examples where “rational design” insights resulted in a new heterogeneous catalyst system. Rather, major discoveries in catalysis have been made accidentally. Along these lines, our research group has serendipitously discovered that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a selective catalyst for the ODH of propane and maintains its selectivity at industrially attractive conversions. (7,8) The search for inert catalyst bed diluents for vanadium oxide-based ODH catalysts placed hBN on a shortlist of potential materials. However, while measuring the reactivity of this material, we were surprised to see a higher selectivity to propylene than what was reported for metal oxides. This finding was not easy to come to terms with: is hBN not as inert as the literature suggested? Fortunately, chance favors the prepared mind and what could have been disregarded as a fluke turned into a new family of selective ODH catalysts.
2. The Science behind Serendipity
Our initial research focused on the reactivity of hBN for ODH. At a moderate alkane conversion of ∼14%, we observed a propylene selectivity of ∼80%, noticeably higher than vanadium-based catalysts, among others. (7) Furthermore, the combined selectivity of hBN toward olefins, namely, ethylene and propylene, remained high (above 90%) throughout the tested conversion range. This high olefin selectivity was also observed during the ODH of n-butane and isobutane (Figure 2). (8) Since our initial work, other research groups have confirmed these observations, as well as showed high selectivity toward ethylene during the ODH of ethane. (9−11)
Figure 2
Figure 2. Product distribution of hBN (top) and literature references (bottom) during the ODH of propane, n-butane, and isobutane at comparable alkane conversion. Data obtained from refs (7and8).
The relatively constant total olefin selectivity over a wide conversion range indicates that the prevalent side-reaction that occurs with hBN is alkane cracking, rather than consecutive combustion. This product distribution contrasts with other reported ODH catalysts, which show COx as the prevalent secondary products (Figure 2). Furthermore, hBN is selective in the transformation of C2–C4 alkanes, while metal oxide catalyst systems need to be tailored to the particular substrate in order to optimize olefin selectivity. (1,12)
We monitored the influence of reactant partial pressures on the rate of alkane consumption and found a second order rate dependence on alkane partial pressure and only a minor dependence on oxygen partial pressure. Critically, if hBN was used under anaerobic conditions, no propane conversion occurred. These results contrast with the reactivity of supported vanadium oxide, which typically shows a first order dependence on alkane concentration (13,14) and dehydrogenation activity under anaerobic environments. In metal oxide-catalyzed ODH, there is a general consensus in the literature that the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism is predominant, where the role of gaseous oxygen is to primarily regenerate the lattice oxygen species responsible for alkane oxidation. (5) In contrast, the lack of lattice oxygen in hBN suggests that oxygen must be directly involved during a catalytic turnover. We hypothesize that hBN activates oxygen and forms surface oxygen species responsible for selective alkane oxidation.
The critical role of activated oxygen during hBN-catalyzed ODH, as well as additional reactivity differences with vanadium oxide catalysts, was highlighted by the selectivity dependence on oxygen partial pressure. (8) As shown in Figure 3, under oxygen lean conditions, C–C cracking products (propylene, ethylene, and methane) become significant. This result suggests that oxygen is involved in selectivity-determining steps of the reaction mechanism. In contrast, vanadium-based materials show a product distribution independent of oxygen partial pressure during ODH of propane. (13) Furthermore, our investigations also indicate that the reactivity of hBN does not track the weakest C–H bond strength of the alkane substrate used. The reaction rates of n-butane conversion were found to be higher than those of isobutane at comparable reaction conditions. (8) If the initial H abstraction, assumed to occur at the weakest C–H bond, were the only kinetically relevant step, we would expect isobutane reaction rates to be faster (i.e., Relative strength of weakest C–H bond: ethyl > isopropyl > sec-butyl > tert-butyl), as is observed with metal oxide catalysts. (15) Furthermore, during ODH of n-butane, we see a near statistical 1-butene/2-butene ratio of ∼1.5 suggesting that differences in C–H bond strength do not influence the second H abstraction step. (8)

These observations highlight the need for research focused on determining (a) a reaction mechanism explaining the product distribution and kinetics and (b) the active site structures under reaction conditions. The next section of this Account will highlight ongoing efforts in answering these two gaps in knowledge.
3. Initial Mechanistic Hypotheses and Active Site Characterizations
As already discussed, the reactivity of hBN seems inherently linked to oxygen activation under reaction conditions. Since the reactivity of the material quickly dropped after removing oxygen from the reactor feed stream, we aimed to confirm whether oxygen activation was only occurring in situ, or if evidence of its interaction with the hBN surface would remain after ODH. Figure 4 shows FTIR spectra of hBN materials treated at 500 °C with typical ODH feeds (using either propane, n-butane, or isobutane as reactant) or synthetic air, along with a fresh hBN reference.

Only in the samples treated with the ODH feed are IR vibrations characteristic of B–OH at ∼3200 cm–1 observed. This trend provided evidence of oxygen functionalization of the hBN surface as a result of ODH, and we furthered these observations by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Figure 5 shows the appearance of a B 1s feature at 194 eV after ODH of propane on the hBN surface, characteristic of BO3 coordination environments. (16) Quantification of the near-surface atomic compositions showed increased oxygen content on the used materials. These observations indicated that the hBN surface is oxidized during ODH and the interaction between B and O is long-lived enough to be seen with various ex situ characterization techniques. However, the precise structures formed on the hBN surface still remain an open question.

Since hBN has been rarely considered as a catalyst, we turned to studies related to its use in electronics and material science to develop hypotheses on the type of surface sites responsible for catalysis. (17) The basic structures in an hBN layer are depicted in Figure 6, and the thermal and mechanical stability of hBN arises from the covalent bonds between B and N in the basal plane. Computational studies exploring the reactivity of this plane show relatively weak interactions with oxygen, (18) and we hypothesized that surface reactions would occur along the hBN edges, similarly to those of graphene-based materials used in oxidation reactions. (19,20)

Our early DFT studies presented a B–O–O–N armchair edge site as the most stable oxygen-containing site among various O-terminated structures (Figure 7A). This armchair edge site also shows −OH vibrational frequencies similar to those observed experimentally (Figure 4). Additional DFT studies on the interaction of the B–O–O–N site with propane suggested that upon initial H abstraction, the formed propyl radical was stabilized on the surface via a radical rebound mechanism with a surface nitroxyl species. We hypothesized that this stabilization of the propyl radical minimized combustion side reactions, leading to the unique product selectivity of hBN.

After our initial contribution, follow up work from other research groups presented different hypotheses on the active site responsible for dehydrogenation activity in hBN. These include hBN zigzag edges with only boron exposed and with oxygen associatively (9) or dissociatively (10) adsorbed (Figure 7B,C). Other contributions have highlighted the possible importance of nitrogen in the reactivity of hBN, showing that an ammonia cofeed maintains stable propane conversions under otherwise deactivating conditions. (21) This variety of active site hypotheses highlight the need to clarify the importance of boron, oxygen, and other relevant elements that lead to ODH with hBN. Thus, the next step in our research was to vary the non-boron constituent element present on the catalyst to gain structural insights. This follow up study would, once more, drastically alter our understanding of ODH chemistry.
3.1. A New Family of ODH Catalysts
To verify the role of surface nitroxyl species in ODH, we entered the field of metal borides in order to vary the non-boron constituent element of ODH catalysts. We tested a selection of commercially available borides under the same ODH conditions used to study hBN. We expected conversion-selectivity trends with varying slopes due to differences in propyl radical stabilization by the non-boron constituent element, or no reactivity at all. These expected observations would highlight hBN as a unique material well-suited for partial oxidation chemistry.
Once again, however, we were surprised by the catalytic activity of the tested materials. As a first observation, many borides showed comparable, or improved, reactivity during ODH relative to hBN. (Figure 8). (22) In contrast, a material without boron, TiN, had low reactivity and poor selectivity toward the desired olefin product. Notably, elemental boron showed the highest reactivity among all tested materials, achieving propylene productivity values up to approximately 12 kgC3H6 kgcat–1 h–1, whereas all other tested borides had productivity values below 1 kgC3H6 kgcat–1 h–1. As elemental boron possesses no heteroatoms in its structure, it is clear that boron is the key active element for achieving selective alkane oxidation.

Perhaps most interesting, however, was the common conversion-selectivity trend found with all active borides. It appears that all active boron-containing compounds achieve the same propylene selectivity at isoconversion (Figure 8). Additionally, we do not see evidence of reactivity by the non-boron constituent element, as many of the tested metal oxide equivalents (e.g., TiO2, Mo2O3) are active propane combustion catalysts. These trends contrast with vanadium-based catalysts where variations in catalyst support or mixed oxide phase leads to significant differences in conversion-selectivity trends, attributed to changes in the rates of overoxidation reactions. (1,5) Could a common active site be present in all the tested materials? This observation, in addition to the high reactivity of elemental boron, make it clear that any active site and mechanistic hypotheses must be applicable to boron-containing materials beyond hBN.
As a first step to characterize these boron-based ODH catalysts, we analyzed the near-surface composition of the boride materials via XPS. A feature at approximately 188 eV in the B 1s region (Figure 9), which is related to B–B coordination, is present in all fresh samples, except hBN. In the used catalysts, this feature disappears and is replaced with a broad feature at 194 eV related to B–O coordination. This evidence suggested that a BOx layer over the bulk B-containing material is formed during ODH. The common oxidized boron environment, coupled to the constant conversion-selectivity trends observed with all B-based catalysts indicates that the formed BOx layer contains the active sites for ODH. Differences arise, however, in the per-mass reactivity of the tested catalysts, and this observation may be critical in identifying future improvement routes for B-based materials.

4. Support Effects and Revisiting Old Concepts
While the conversion-selectivity trends of boron-based ODH catalysts were the same, suggesting common active sites, we see a significant difference in their rate of alkane consumption, that is, the slope of propane conversion as a function of WHSV–1 (Figure 10). We hypothesize that this variation in reaction rates must be due to (a) differences in active site densities or (b) differences in the electronic environment of said active sites as suggested by the XPS spectra of spent catalysts. Both of these possibilities are inherently linked to the bulk material over which the BOx layer is formed during reaction.

The differences in active site densities between boron-based catalysts could be due to surface area. In our early work with hBN, we found boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) to also be active for the ODH of propane, and more reactive than bulk hBN. (7) While the BNNTs had a surface area about six times higher than hBN (97 versus 16 m2 g–1), the rates of propane consumption still differed upon normalization by the surface area of the respective catalysts. Similarly, other active boron-containing catalysts do not follow any discernible trend in their reactivity as a function of surface area (see Table 1). Elemental boron, the material with the highest mass-specific rate studied so far, shows significantly lower surface-specific rates of propane consumption than NiB and is comparable to Co(2-3)B. If surface area were the only factor leading to differences in active site density, we would expect all materials to show similar areal rates of reaction. As such, other structural factors may be playing a role in the development of active surface species.

Binary boride compounds can be catalogued by the boron motifs present in their crystal structure, with representative examples shown in Figure 11. The proximity of B atoms to non-boron elements within this crystal structure may influence the formation and reactivity of the active BOx layer. From the boron-containing materials that showed activity for ODH, we find examples of crystal structures featuring large continuous boron networks (B12 icosahedra in elemental boron, hexagonal B layers in NiB and TiB2). In contrast, the least active material in our study, WB, possesses a tetragonal structure, with boron atoms isolated from each other by W atoms. These observations are limited, however, by the heterogeneity of phases found in commercially available borides. Elucidating the role of these bulk crystal structures in the formation of active BOx species will prove critical in future boron-based catalyst development but require precise synthetic methods to generate phase-pure binary boride compounds. Only recently have methods become available to produce significant amounts of high-quality borides for catalytic testing. (23) Beyond phase-pure materials, controlled synthesis of BOx-boride systems may further elucidate the influence of the subsurface structures on ODH activity. Until these new, phase pure materials are studied, however, we may learn about the relationship between catalytic active sites and bulk materials from model systems found in the literature.

4.1. Early Developments in B-Based Catalysts
During the 1990s, there was significant interest in the study of supported boron oxide (boria) catalysts for the selective oxidation of ethane and propane to olefins and oxygenated compounds. (24−26) Buyevskaya et al. (24) aimed to build structure–activity relationships for B2O3/Al2O3 during the ODH of propane. We can draw several parallels from these studies to the catalytic activity of bulk B-based catalysts we have studied, as the observed reactivity of the supported boria catalysts shows moderate selectivities toward olefin products (∼45% propylene selectivity at 25% propane conversion), albeit lower than those observed with our bulk B-based catalysts. (24) The authors found a heterogeneity of BOx species on the surface of these materials, ranging from fully amorphous BO3 species to crystalline B2O3 and B–Al–O mixed phases. In particular, solid-state NMR allowed discrimination between BO3 and BO4 species and led the authors to conclude that 4-fold coordinated boron is inactive during ODH. Unfortunately, all kinetic studies carried out were done at varying propane conversions above 20%, making a direct comparison of the kinetic behavior of B2O3/Al2O3 with hBN and bulk borides difficult. Regardless, the selectivity to COx during these investigations was suppressed by the presence of BOx on the support surface, in agreement with the reactivity of our tested boron-based materials.
Inspired by this study and past successes using solid-state NMR within our research group, (27,28) we recently developed a systematic approach to characterize hBN catalysts using solid-state NMR. (29) We have found that two-dimensional correlation experiments during solid-state NMR are critical to interpret experimental spectra. Double resonance 1H–11B NMR experiments indicate that, after ODH, hBN exhibits a fraction of oxidized boron species with protons in close proximity. This observation agrees with our early ex situ XPS and FTIR characterization. Additional information provided by multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) 11B NMR experiments indicate that there is a wide distribution of oxidized species of the form B(OH)xO3–x, with x = 0–3 (Figure 12). We can estimate that 30% of the original BN3 species are oxidized after ODH. These experiments paint a picture that disproves the hypothesis of clean oxidized edges, as depicted in Figure 7, and instead validates the concept of an oxidized layer supported on the bulk hBN support. From here, future research may use the knowledge gained of surface speciation to construct structure–activity correlations.

The works of Buyevskaya et al. and Cucinieri Colorio et al. present additional approaches that may prove useful in characterization of B-based catalysts in the future to complement our NMR techniques. (24,30) As boron is not redox active, the authors hypothesized that reactivity of B2O3/Al2O3 will be governed by the acid/base properties of the surface. NH3 microcalorimetry suggested that surface acid sites increased in number with increasing boron loading, but their acidity was weaker than the Al2O3 support. The quantity of NH3 adsorbed, however, only showed a loose correlation with ODH activity using ethane as a substrate. Studying the acid–base properties of hBN and other borides may aid in quantification of surface active sites, which in turn may lead to comparisons of their TOFs. An important difficulty arises, however, from the in situ formation of active sites. The conditions used during probe molecule adsorption studies will differ significantly from those of ODH, and ensuring that the probed surface is representative of that found during reaction will be key for successful active site quantification.
An alternative to probe molecules for developing structure–activity relationships may be possible with isotopic labeling of reactants. Buyevskaya et al. carried out Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) experiments to determine the mechanism of propane and oxygen activation in B2O3/Al2O3. (24) The study demonstrated that BOx surface species hinder the H/D exchange between the surface and C3D8 as well as the formation of 18O16O isotopologues. These TAP experiments led the authors to conclude that surface BOx suppresses dissociative adsorption of reactants and was the likely reason for high selectivities toward the olefin product. The authors proposed a mechanism involving propyl radical formation on the catalyst surface and continuation of the reaction in the gas phase via alkyl hydroperoxides. While gas phase peroxide and radical decomposition mechanisms are common in combustion and methane conversion literature, (31−33) further investigations on their role during ODH chemistry will be needed, particularly in the context of high olefin selectivities of B-based catalysts.
5. A Growing Research Direction, with More Questions than Answers
Evidently, a new research field is characterized by the creation of more questions than answers, and this final section will describe key research topics for future research on boron-based ODH catalysts.
5.1. Reaction Kinetics
Current reports on hBN catalysts for ODH have established a second order dependence on alkane partial pressure and a near-zero order dependence on oxygen partial pressure. Additionally, the kinetic role, if any, of reaction products has not been established. More complete kinetic studies exploring reaction pathways leading to the observed reactor effluent products will help further catalyst optimization as well as inform mechanistic hypotheses. Ethylene and methane, for example, may come from direct conversion of propane or from subsequent reaction of propylene. The trend of propylene selectivity in Figure 8 suggests that, at the zero-conversion limit, boron-based catalysts have 90% selectivity toward propylene and 95% toward all olefins. Rigorous kinetic experimentation would help validate this preliminary observation and aid in developing microkinetic models for future reactor design considerations that consider all products. Furthermore, the role of gas phase chemistry must be established and its importance on the observed ODH activity under various conditions considered in future model development.
5.2. Catalyst Stability
Catalyst stability of boron-based catalysts is also critical in future reactor design endeavors. The supported B2O3/Al2O3 mentioned in section 4 suffered from severe deactivation under ODH conditions (26) and limited their long-term applicability. In contrast, Huang et al. established the stability of hBN during the ODH of ethane for 530 h on-stream at conversions up to 78%. (9) This difference in catalyst stability may be due to the in situ formation of surface BOx species that are more resistant to leaching than those formed during typical impregnation procedures. Separately, Chaturbedy et al. observed significant deactivation of their hBN materials within 12 h on-stream during the ODH of propane at conversions of ∼50%. (21) The activity was recovered upon NH3 treatments, showing the reversible nature of the deactivation. The difference in catalyst stability between these two studies may stem from the reaction feed used, with Chaturbedy et al. using a C3H8/O2 ratio of 1:50 and Huang et al. using a ratio of 1:2. These contrasting observations highlight the need for detailed stability studies under multiple reaction mixtures for hBN, as well as other boron-based catalyst systems of future industrial relevance.
5.3. Active Site Structure and Quantification
A stronger mechanistic foundation is needed for development of future boron-based ODH catalysts. This foundation can only come from knowledge on the nature of the surface species responsible for selective oxygen and alkane activation. Characterization techniques that can provide rich structural information under both ex situ and in situ conditions are critical. We have established new methodologies for analysis of boron-based materials focused on multidimensional solid-state NMR, which highlight the complexity of this family of materials and may lead to the discovery of common surface species among all active boron ODH catalysts.
With improved knowledge of the nature of active surface sites of these materials, we may enable their accurate quantification. We touched on differences in mass-specific and surface-specific reaction rates, but these discussions would be rendered moot by comparisons using turnover frequencies. While probe molecule adsorption techniques are common in metal-based catalysts and NH3 adsorption has been attempted on B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, difficulties arise from the in situ formation of active sites with hBN and other boron-based materials. An approach touched upon in section 4 was isotopic labeling, which has the advantage of probing the catalyst surface under the same conditions used for conventional reaction testing. Steady state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA), for example, is a technique widely used for quantitative analysis of surface species during catalysis. (34) This type of analysis, coupled with detailed surface characterization, will be crucial in future work developing structure–activity relationships to obtain a comprehensive mechanistic framework for boron-based ODH catalysts.
Beyond direct experimental observation, quantum chemical calculations may aid in identifying possible active sites present in boron-based materials under ODH conditions. We could predict the in situ formation of BOx structures, and these simulations may aid in gauging the importance of subsurface structures on ODH activity. It is imperative, however, to model the most realistic surface structures that are compatible with all active boron-based catalysts.
6. Summary
In this Account, we describe our initial discovery of hBN, and later a larger family of B-based materials, with a unique reactivity during the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2–C4 alkanes. The product distribution during ODH differs greatly from that of metal oxide catalysts, which typically show significant amounts of overoxidation products. We identified the formation of BOx species as critical to the observed catalysis via ex situ XPS, FTIR, and reaction kinetic measurements. While initial computational simulations suggested B–O–O–N species as possible active sites on hBN, the common conversion-selectivity trends of several borides suggests that further investigations to elucidate a common active site are critical to understand the high olefin selectivity of these materials. Solid-state NMR has allowed us to probe the surface of hBN after ODH and find a complex surface with a distribution of oxidized boron species. In situ characterization and chemisorption approaches will be important for elucidating the active sites of the working catalyst. These experiments may be informed by looking back at earlier works on similar systems to rationalize some of our observations as well as provide new tools that may be valuable for future developments in boron-based material investigations.
