[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
[2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to PDH and is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed [4]."
[4] "These advantages may lead to lower capital and operating costs due to lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability."

[6] "Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
[7] "Additionally, studies from other researchers demonstrate success in the ODH of ethane over hBN [10, 11]."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by the increasing demand for versatile olefins in various applications. Its traditional production method involves cracking naphtha, which yields limited amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene. This gap in supply and demand for propylene has led to the exploration of alternative production methods, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability. 

In particular, the use of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and other boron-containing materials has emerged as an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These materials offer higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts, without the production of undesirable COx byproducts. Research has shown that these catalysts perform well in the oxidative dehydrogenation of not just propane but also ethane, expanding the potential for the use of these materials in the chemical industry.

Table 1 in the document summarizes the results of studies involving the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over hBN materials, highlighting the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propylene and other olefins.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经显著演变，推动了对各种应用中所需多种烯烃日益增长的需求。传统上，通过裂解石脑油生产烯烃，但仅能产生少量比乙烯重的烯烃。这种供应与需求之间的缺口促使人们探索替代的生产方法，如丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH相对于传统方法提供了经济和环境优势，包括由于使用较低反应温度和催化剂稳定性而降低的资本和运营成本。

特别是，六方氮化硼（hBN）和其他硼基材料作为氧化脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的催化剂的使用已崭露头角。这些材料在生产丙烯方面的选择性比之前研究的催化剂更高，且不会产生不希望的COx副产品。研究表明，这些催化剂在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢中表现良好，扩大了这些材料在化学工业中的潜在应用。

文档中的表格1总结了涉及hBN材料在轻烷烃氧化脱氢方面的研究结果，突出了这些催化剂在生成丙烯和其他烯烃时的效率和选择性。
