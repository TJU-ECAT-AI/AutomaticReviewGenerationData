Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by the increasing demand for versatile olefins in various applications. Its traditional production method involves cracking naphtha, which yields limited amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene. This gap in supply and demand for propylene has led to the exploration of alternative production methods, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability. 

In particular, the use of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and other boron-containing materials has emerged as an effective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These materials offer higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts, without the production of undesirable COx byproducts. Research has shown that these catalysts perform well in the oxidative dehydrogenation of not just propane but also ethane, expanding the potential for the use of these materials in the chemical industry.

Table 1 in the document summarizes the results of studies involving the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over hBN materials, highlighting the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propylene and other olefins.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经显著演变，推动了对各种应用中所需多种烯烃日益增长的需求。传统上，通过裂解石脑油生产烯烃，但仅能产生少量比乙烯重的烯烃。这种供应与需求之间的缺口促使人们探索替代的生产方法，如丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH相对于传统方法提供了经济和环境优势，包括由于使用较低反应温度和催化剂稳定性而降低的资本和运营成本。

特别是，六方氮化硼（hBN）和其他硼基材料作为氧化脱氢丙烷生成丙烯的催化剂的使用已崭露头角。这些材料在生产丙烯方面的选择性比之前研究的催化剂更高，且不会产生不希望的COx副产品。研究表明，这些催化剂在丙烷和乙烷的氧化脱氢中表现良好，扩大了这些材料在化学工业中的潜在应用。

文档中的表格1总结了涉及hBN材料在轻烷烃氧化脱氢方面的研究结果，突出了这些催化剂在生成丙烯和其他烯烃时的效率和选择性。

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its wide range of applications, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation because it offers a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to produce propene compared to traditional methods like cracking naphtha. This approach reduces the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with propene production, making it a preferred choice for manufacturers looking to meet the growing demand for this versatile olefin.

2. The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower operational costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures, which can lead to reduced energy consumption. Additionally, this method ensures high olefin selectivity, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts like COx. This results in a cleaner process that reduces environmental impact. Moreover, the absence of COx production aligns with the growing trend towards sustainable manufacturing practices, enhancing the marketability of products derived from propane dehydrogenation.

3. Environmental benefits of propane dehydrogenation include a lower carbon footprint due to the use of less energy and the avoidance of COx emissions, which contribute to air pollution and climate change. This process supports the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote cleaner technologies in the petrochemical industry. Furthermore, the ability to produce propene without generating COx makes propane dehydrogenation a more sustainable option for chemical manufacturers, potentially leading to regulatory advantages and improved public perception.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its versatile applications in various sectors such as polymers, oxygenates, and bulk chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method because PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages over traditional production processes. 

PDH is exothermic and not equilibrium-limited, unlike other processes such as PDH, which are highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited due to the coproduction of hydrogen (H2). This allows for lower reaction temperatures, potentially reducing energy consumption and capital costs. Moreover, PDH catalysts do not deactivate as quickly as those used in other processes, leading to improved catalyst stability and reduced operational costs. 

While metal oxide catalysts like V/SiO2 have been traditionally used for PDH, they suffer from issues like carbon deposition (coking) on the catalyst surface, necessitating expensive regeneration processes. In contrast, boron-containing materials like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and metal borides have shown promise as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These catalysts offer higher selectivity to propylene and minimal production of unwanted byproducts like carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), making them particularly advantageous for meeting the growing demand for propene in various industries.

The use of boron-based catalysts for PDH not only reduces the need for expensive regeneration processes but also potentially lowers the overall environmental footprint due to the avoidance of COx emissions. Furthermore, the development of advanced catalysts like hBN enables more efficient and sustainable production of propene, supporting the industry's efforts to meet the escalating demand for this critical olefin in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.

丙烯在化工行业的地位日益重要，因为它在聚合物、氧化剂和大宗化学中间体等各个领域有着广泛的应用。其需求的增长促使人们采用丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选的生产方法，PDH相对于其他过程具有经济和环境上的优势。

与PDH等过程相比，PDH是放热的且不受平衡限制，后者由于副产氢气（H2），需要较高的反应温度才能驱动转化。这使得PDH能够使用较低的反应温度，可能降低能耗和资本成本。此外，PDH催化剂的稳定性较高，不易快速失活，降低了运营成本。

传统上使用的金属氧化物催化剂如V/SiO2在PDH过程中存在碳沉积（结焦）问题，需要昂贵的再生过程。相比之下，硼基材料如六方氮化硼（hBN）和金属硼化物作为丙烷脱氢到丙烯的催化剂显示出高度活性和选择性，能够提供更高的丙烯选择性和减少副产品的生成，特别是避免产生二氧化碳（CO2）和一氧化碳（CO）等有害气体，这使得它们在满足丙烯需求方面特别有优势。

采用硼基催化剂进行PDH不仅减少了昂贵的再生过程的需求，还可能通过避免COx排放来降低整体环境影响。此外，先进催化剂如hBN的发展使得丙烯生产更加高效和环保，支持行业在降低成本的同时满足对这一关键烯烃需求的持续增长。

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has increased significantly, leading to the exploration of new production methods beyond traditional naphtha cracking. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one such method, which offers advantages over conventional processes. PDH utilizes catalysts that can selectively produce propylene, albeit at higher temperatures and with potential issues related to catalyst deactivation. In contrast, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more efficient alternative. It is an exothermic process that doesn't require the high temperatures needed for PDH and avoids the formation of unwanted byproducts like COx, thanks to the presence of oxygen in the feed. This makes ODHP more environmentally friendly and potentially cost-effective, especially considering the lower energy demands and the avoidance of catalyst deactivation issues.

Propene's versatility in various applications necessitates reliable and efficient production methods. ODHP, with its ability to offer high olefin selectivity, lower operational costs, and environmental benefits, is a promising solution for meeting the growing demand for propene across industries.

化学工业中对丙烯的需求显著增长，推动了生产方法的探索，超越了传统的石脑油裂解。丙烷脱氢（PDH）就是其中一种方法，它提供了与传统过程相比的优势。PDH使用可以选择性地产生丙烯的催化剂，尽管这可能需要更高的温度和潜在的催化剂失活问题。相比之下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）提供了一个更有效的替代方案。它是一个放热过程，不需要PDH所需的高温，并且避免了形成COx等副产品的形成，因为反应介质中存在氧气。这使得ODHP在环境友好性和潜在的成本效益方面更具吸引力，尤其是在考虑较低的能量需求和避免催化剂失活问题的情况下。

丙烯在各个行业中的广泛用途要求可靠且高效的生产方法。通过其提供高烯烃选择性、降低运营成本和环境优势的能力，ODHP是一个满足对丙烯日益增长需求的有前景的解决方案。
