          [1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
          [2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
          [3] "Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation [6]."
          [4] "In 2016, our group reported that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP [7]."
          [5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to PDH and is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed [4]."
          [6] "Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
          [7] "Additionally, studies from other researchers demonstrate success in the ODH of ethane over hBN [10, 11]."
          [8] "Table 1 summarizes our results as well as those found in the literature for the ODH of light alkanes over hBN materials."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by the increasing demand for versatile olefins in various applications. Traditionally, propene is produced through naphtha cracking, but this method only yields limited amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene. This gap in supply and demand for propylene has led to the exploration of alternative production methods, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability.

          One alternative to PDH is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed. In recent years, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have emerged as active and selective catalysts for ODHP, offering higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts.

          Research shows that these materials can effectively convert propane to propylene under certain conditions, and studies by other researchers have demonstrated success in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over hBN. Table 1 in the document summarizes the results of these studies, highlighting the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propylene and other olefins.

          在化学工业中，丙烯的重要性已经显著增长，这是由各种应用中对多功能烯烃日益增长的需求所驱动的。传统上，丙烯通过石脑油裂解生产，但这仅能产生少量比乙烯重的烯烃。这种供应与需求之间的缺口促使人们探索替代的生产方法，例如丙烷脱氢（PDH）。PDH相对于传统方法提供了经济和环境上的优势，包括由于使用较低反应温度和催化剂稳定性而导致的较低资本和运营成本。

          一种替代PDH的方法是丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），这是一个放热过程，不是平衡限制的，并且不需要再生，因为焦炭沉积被反应介质中的氧抑制。近年来，六方氮化硼（hBN）和硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为ODHP的活性和选择性催化剂脱颖而出，其丙烯选择性高于之前研究的催化剂。

          研究表明，在特定条件下，这些材料可以有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，其他研究人员的研究也证明了在hBN上进行烷烃氧化脱氢的成功案例。文档中的表格1总结了这些研究的结果，强调了这些催化剂在生产丙烯和其他烯烃时的效率和选择性。

          Propene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry due to its versatile applications in various sectors such as polymers, oxygenates, and bulk chemical intermediates. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages over traditional production processes, including lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability, which can lead to lower capital and operating costs.

          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an alternative to PDH that offers an exothermic, non-equilibrium-limited process, which does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed. Recent studies have shown that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP, offering higher selectivity to propylene than previously studied catalysts. This has opened up new possibilities for producing propene with fewer environmental impacts and potentially lower costs.

          Other research has also demonstrated the success of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over hBN. The results of these studies, along with those found in the literature for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes over hBN materials, are summarized in Table 1 of the document. This highlights the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts in producing propene and other olefins.

          丙烯在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色，因为它在聚合物、氧化剂和大宗化学品中间体等多个领域有着广泛的应用。对丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选生产方法的采用。PDH相对于传统生产过程提供了经济和环境上的优势，包括更低的反应温度和催化剂稳定性，这可能导致更低的资本和运营成本。

          丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）是PDH的一个替代方案，它提供了一个放热、非平衡限制的过程，不需要再生，因为焦炭沉积被反应介质中的氧抑制。最近的研究表明，六方氮化硼（hBN）和硼纳米管（BNNTs）是ODHP的活性和选择性催化剂，其丙烯选择性高于之前研究的催化剂。这为以较少的环境影响和可能更低的成本生产丙烯开辟了新的可能性。

          其他研究还展示了在hBN上进行烷烃氧化脱氢的成功案例。这些研究的结果，以及关于在hBN材料上进行轻烷烃氧化脱氢的文献中发现的结果，都在文档中的表格1中进行了总结。这强调了这些催化剂在生产丙烯和其他烯烃时的效率和选择性。
