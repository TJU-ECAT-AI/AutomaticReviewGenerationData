[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
[2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
[3] "Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation [6]."
[4] "In 2016, our group reported that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP [7]. Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to PDH and is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed [4]."
[6] "We subsequently followed up on our disclosure of ODHP over hBN with the study of the ODH of n-butane and isobutane over hBN, which also demonstrated high selectivity to the corresponding olefins and displayed similar trends in kinetics as to that of ODHP [9]."
[7] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[8] "Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity."
[9] "The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower reaction temperatures, higher olefin selectivity, and the absence of COx production."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its wide range of applications, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation because it offers a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to produce propene compared to traditional methods like cracking naphtha. This approach reduces the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with propene production, making it a preferred choice for manufacturers looking to meet the growing demand for this versatile olefin.

2. The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower operational costs due to the use of lower reaction temperatures, which can lead to reduced energy consumption. Additionally, this method ensures high olefin selectivity, minimizing the production of unwanted byproducts like COx. This results in a cleaner process that reduces environmental impact. Moreover, the absence of COx production aligns with the growing trend towards sustainable manufacturing practices, enhancing the marketability of products derived from propane dehydrogenation.

3. Environmental benefits of propane dehydrogenation include a lower carbon footprint due to the use of less energy and the avoidance of COx emissions, which contribute to air pollution and climate change. This process supports the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote cleaner technologies in the petrochemical industry. Furthermore, the ability to produce propene without generating COx makes propane dehydrogenation a more sustainable option for chemical manufacturers, potentially leading to regulatory advantages and improved public perception.
