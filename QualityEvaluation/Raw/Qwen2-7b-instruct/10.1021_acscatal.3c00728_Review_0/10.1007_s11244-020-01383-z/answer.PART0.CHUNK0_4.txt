[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
[2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to PDH and is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed [4]."
[4] "Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation [6]."
[5] "Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity."
[6] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[7] "These advantages may lead to lower capital and operating costs due to lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability."

The increasing demand for propene in the chemical industry has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Propene is crucial for various applications, and traditional methods like cracking naphtha only produce limited amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene. This has created a supply-demand gap for propylene. PDH offers an exothermic, non-equilibrium-limited process that does not require catalyst regeneration, unlike conventional PDH processes. However, metal oxide catalysts like V/SiO2 have been widely studied, but their performance is compromised at industrially relevant conversion levels due to over-oxidation. The discovery of boron-containing materials, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), as active and selective catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) has shown promise in producing propylene with minimal COx selectivity. These materials offer high olefin selectivity, lower reaction temperatures, and improved catalyst stability, leading to potential cost savings in production.

化工行业对丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选生产方法的采用。丙烯对于各种应用至关重要，而传统方法如裂解石脑油只能产生少量比乙烯重的烯烃。这在丙烯供给和需求之间形成了缺口。PDH提供了一个放热、非平衡限制的过程，无需催化剂再生，这与传统的PDH过程不同。然而，金属氧化物催化剂如V/SiO2已被广泛研究，但在工业相关转化水平下，由于过氧化作用导致丙烯产量下降，其性能受到影响。硼基材料，尤其是六方硼氮化物（hBN），被发现是丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的活性和选择性催化剂，能够以极低的COx选择性生产丙烯。这些材料显示出高烯烃选择性、较低的反应温度和改进的催化剂稳定性，这可能带来生产成本的节省。
