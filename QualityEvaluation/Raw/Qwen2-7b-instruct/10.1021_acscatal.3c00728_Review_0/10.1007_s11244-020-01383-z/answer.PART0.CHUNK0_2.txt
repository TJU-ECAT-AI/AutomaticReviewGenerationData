[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
[2] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion."
[3] "Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation."
[4] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[5] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
[6] "These advantages may lead to lower capital and operating costs due to lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability."
[7] "In 2016, our group reported that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP [7]."
[8] "Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts."
[9] "We subsequently followed up on our disclosure of ODHP over hBN with the study of the ODH of n-butane and isobutane over hBN, which also demonstrated high selectivity to the corresponding olefins and displayed similar trends in kinetics as to that of ODHP [9]."
[10] "Studies from other researchers demonstrate success in the ODH of ethane over hBN [10, 11]."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its versatile applications in various sectors such as polymers, oxygenates, and bulk chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method because PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages over traditional production processes. 

PDH is exothermic and not equilibrium-limited, unlike other processes such as PDH, which are highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited due to the coproduction of hydrogen (H2). This allows for lower reaction temperatures, potentially reducing energy consumption and capital costs. Moreover, PDH catalysts do not deactivate as quickly as those used in other processes, leading to improved catalyst stability and reduced operational costs. 

While metal oxide catalysts like V/SiO2 have been traditionally used for PDH, they suffer from issues like carbon deposition (coking) on the catalyst surface, necessitating expensive regeneration processes. In contrast, boron-containing materials like hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and metal borides have shown promise as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. These catalysts offer higher selectivity to propylene and minimal production of unwanted byproducts like carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), making them particularly advantageous for meeting the growing demand for propene in various industries.

The use of boron-based catalysts for PDH not only reduces the need for expensive regeneration processes but also potentially lowers the overall environmental footprint due to the avoidance of COx emissions. Furthermore, the development of advanced catalysts like hBN enables more efficient and sustainable production of propene, supporting the industry's efforts to meet the escalating demand for this critical olefin in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.

丙烯在化工行业的地位日益重要，因为它在聚合物、氧化剂和大宗化学中间体等各个领域有着广泛的应用。其需求的增长促使人们采用丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选的生产方法，PDH相对于其他过程具有经济和环境上的优势。

与PDH等过程相比，PDH是放热的且不受平衡限制，后者由于副产氢气（H2），需要较高的反应温度才能驱动转化。这使得PDH能够使用较低的反应温度，可能降低能耗和资本成本。此外，PDH催化剂的稳定性较高，不易快速失活，降低了运营成本。

传统上使用的金属氧化物催化剂如V/SiO2在PDH过程中存在碳沉积（结焦）问题，需要昂贵的再生过程。相比之下，硼基材料如六方氮化硼（hBN）和金属硼化物作为丙烷脱氢到丙烯的催化剂显示出高度活性和选择性，能够提供更高的丙烯选择性和减少副产品的生成，特别是避免产生二氧化碳（CO2）和一氧化碳（CO）等有害气体，这使得它们在满足丙烯需求方面特别有优势。

采用硼基催化剂进行PDH不仅减少了昂贵的再生过程的需求，还可能通过避免COx排放来降低整体环境影响。此外，先进催化剂如hBN的发展使得丙烯生产更加高效和环保，支持行业在降低成本的同时满足对这一关键烯烃需求的持续增长。
