[1] "Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha."
[2] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."
[3] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."
[4] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion."
[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to PDH and is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed [4]."
[6] "Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation."
[7] "These advantages may lead to lower capital and operating costs due to lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has increased significantly, leading to the exploration of new production methods beyond traditional naphtha cracking. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one such method, which offers advantages over conventional processes. PDH utilizes catalysts that can selectively produce propylene, albeit at higher temperatures and with potential issues related to catalyst deactivation. In contrast, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more efficient alternative. It is an exothermic process that doesn't require the high temperatures needed for PDH and avoids the formation of unwanted byproducts like COx, thanks to the presence of oxygen in the feed. This makes ODHP more environmentally friendly and potentially cost-effective, especially considering the lower energy demands and the avoidance of catalyst deactivation issues.

Propene's versatility in various applications necessitates reliable and efficient production methods. ODHP, with its ability to offer high olefin selectivity, lower operational costs, and environmental benefits, is a promising solution for meeting the growing demand for propene across industries.

化学工业中对丙烯的需求显著增长，推动了生产方法的探索，超越了传统的石脑油裂解。丙烷脱氢（PDH）就是其中一种方法，它提供了与传统过程相比的优势。PDH使用可以选择性地产生丙烯的催化剂，尽管这可能需要更高的温度和潜在的催化剂失活问题。相比之下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）提供了一个更有效的替代方案。它是一个放热过程，不需要PDH所需的高温，并且避免了形成COx等副产品的形成，因为反应介质中存在氧气。这使得ODHP在环境友好性和潜在的成本效益方面更具吸引力，尤其是在考虑较低的能量需求和避免催化剂失活问题的情况下。

丙烯在各个行业中的广泛用途要求可靠且高效的生产方法。通过其提供高烯烃选择性、降低运营成本和环境优势的能力，ODHP是一个满足对丙烯日益增长需求的有前景的解决方案。
