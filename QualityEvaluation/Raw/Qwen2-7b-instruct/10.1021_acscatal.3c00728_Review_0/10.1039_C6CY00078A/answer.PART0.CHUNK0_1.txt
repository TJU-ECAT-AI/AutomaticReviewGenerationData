Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry, being a key feedstock for producing valuable products, particularly thermoplastic polypropylene, widely used in manufacturing household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The global sales and demand for propylene exceed $90 billion annually. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers several economic and environmental advantages. The exothermic nature of the reaction requires no additional energy input, making it an economically efficient process. The fluidized bed reactor, with its ability to maintain constant temperature and prevent hot spots, is a significant benefit over fixed bed reactors. This technology also allows for the transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit, enabling periodic catalyst re-oxidation. The use of calcium oxide (CaO) enhances the catalyst's surface area and acidity, which optimizes propane adsorption and propylene desorption, minimizing the formation of carbon oxides. Controlling the redox properties, morphology of surface species, and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst can significantly improve its performance. High propylene selectivity is crucial, as propane reactivity is lower compared to propylene. Achieving the right level of lattice oxygen on the catalyst surface is vital for maximizing propylene selectivity while minimizing the formation of carbon oxides. The acidic character of alkanes and their corresponding olefins decreases with an increase in carbon number and degree of saturation, suggesting that designing catalysts with controlled acidity could lead to higher selectivity in ODH. The prepared catalysts in this study exhibit surface areas ranging from 14 to 25 square meters per gram, which is beneficial for enhancing propane and propylene interactions.

丙烯在化学工业中扮演着重要角色，是生产多种有价值产品的关键原料，特别是用于制造家电、塑料薄膜等应用中的热塑性聚丙烯。全球丙烯的销售额和需求超过900亿美元。氧化脱氢（ODH）丙烷提供了经济和环境上的优势。反应的放热性质不需要额外的能量输入，使其成为经济高效的过程。流化床反应器能够维持恒定温度，防止热点，与固定床反应器相比是一个显著优势。此技术还允许将还原催化剂物种从氧化脱氢单元运输到再生单元，实现周期性催化剂氧化。使用钙氧化物（CaO）可以增强催化剂的表面积和酸度，优化丙烷吸附和丙烯脱附，最小化碳氧化物的形成。通过控制还原性、表面物种形态和酸碱特性，可以显著提高催化剂的性能。高丙烯选择性至关重要，因为丙烷的反应性低于丙烯。通过适当控制催化剂表面的氧量，可以最大化丙烯选择性并减少碳氧化物的生成。丙烷和其相应的烯烃的酸性随碳数增加和分子饱和度增加而降低，这表明设计具有可控酸性的催化剂可能有助于提高ODH的选择性。研究中制备的催化剂的比表面积范围为每克14至25平方米，这对于增强丙烷和丙烯的相互作用是有益的。
