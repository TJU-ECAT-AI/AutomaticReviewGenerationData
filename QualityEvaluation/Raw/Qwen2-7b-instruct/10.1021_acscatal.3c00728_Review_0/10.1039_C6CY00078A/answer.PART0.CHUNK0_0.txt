Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become a crucial feedstock for producing various valuable products. Approximately two-thirds of the propylene produced globally is utilized for the manufacturing of thermoplastic polypropylene, a widely used compound in household appliance fabrication, plastic films, and other applications. Propene's exothermic nature, which doesn't require additional energy to accelerate the reaction, makes it an attractive option for production. The development of efficient catalysts is vital for obtaining a high yield of propene. Compared to traditional commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene offers lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact. The formation of water as a by-product in the ODH process avoids thermodynamic constraints observed in non-oxidative routes. Appropriate reactor selection is essential to harness the benefits of ODH technology. Fluidized bed reactors have advantages like controlled operating conditions, uniform residence time distributions, and the capability to transport reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit, allowing periodic catalyst re-oxidation. High propene selectivity is only advantageous at lower propane conversions because propane is less reactive compared to propylene. Designing a catalyst that optimally controls the lattice oxygen level can enable the selective production of propene with minimal carbon oxides. Controlling the redox properties, morphology of surface species, and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst can enhance its performance. The incorporation of calcium oxide (CaO) improves the catalyst's surface area and provides a moderate level of acidity, maximizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while minimizing propylene and propane combustion. The process's key advantage is the potential for achieving higher propene selectivity through the appropriate control of lattice oxygen.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经发展成为生产各种有价值产品的关键原料。大约三分之二的全球丙烯产量用于制造热塑性聚丙烯，这是一种广泛用于家用电器、塑料薄膜和其他应用的化合物。丙烯的放热性质使其反应无需额外能量加速，使其成为生产的选择。开发高效催化剂对于获得高丙烯产量至关重要。与传统商业过程相比，丙烯氧化脱氢（ODH）到丙烯具有较低的操作成本和最小的环境影响。在ODH过程中形成的水副产品可以避免非氧化路线中观察到的热力学约束。适当的反应器选择是利用ODH技术的关键。流化床反应器具有控制操作条件、均匀停留时间分布和从氧化脱氢单元运输还原催化物种到再生单元的能力，允许周期性催化剂重新氧化。高丙烯选择性仅在较低的丙烷转化率下有利，因为丙烷在与丙烯比较时活性较低。通过优化设计催化剂，可以控制晶格氧水平，实现丙烯的选性生产并减少碳氧化物的生成。通过控制红/氧化性、表面物种形态和酸碱特性，可以增强催化剂性能。将钙氧化物（CaO）纳入可以改善催化剂的表面面积，并提供适度的酸性，最大化丙烷吸附和丙烯脱附，同时减少丙烯和丙烷燃烧。该过程的主要优势在于通过适当控制晶格氧，有可能实现更高的丙烯选择性。
