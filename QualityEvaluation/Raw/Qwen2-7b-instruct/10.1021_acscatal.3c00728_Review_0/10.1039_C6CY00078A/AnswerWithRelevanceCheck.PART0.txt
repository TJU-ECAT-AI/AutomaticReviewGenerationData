          [1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products."
          [2] "Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications."
          [3] "Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction."
          [4] "High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst."
          [5] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts."
          [6] "The formation of water as a by-product of the ODH makes it possible to avoid thermodynamic constraints as observed in the non-oxidative routes."
          [7] "However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology."
          [8] "Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation."
          [9] "This high selectivity is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene."
          [10] "There is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions."
          [11] "The performance of the catalyst can be enhanced by controlling its redox properties, morphology of surface species of VOx and acidbase characteristics."
          [12] "The use of CaO will improve a resulting catalyst's superficial area and also gives it the desired moderate level of acidity, that will maximize propane adsorption and propylene desorption and also minimize propylene and propane combustion."
          [13] "The major advantage of this process is the possibility of achieving higher propylene selectivity by appropriate control of the lattice oxygen of the catalysts."
          [14] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products."
          [15] "Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications."
          [16] "The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."
          [17] "The most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction."
          [18] "However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology."

          Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry as a key feedstock for producing various valuable products, especially thermoplastic polypropylene, which is widely used in the manufacturing of household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. Its most significant advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which doesn't require additional energy to speed up the process. High yields of propylene can be achieved with an efficient catalyst. In contrast to conventional commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more appealing due to its low operational costs and minimal environmental impact. The formation of water as a by-product in the ODH process helps to avoid thermodynamic constraints observed in non-oxidative methods. Selective production of propylene at low propane conversion rates is only advantageous because of the lower reactivity of propane compared to propylene. There is a need to design a catalyst that provides the optimal level of lattice oxygen for selectively producing propylene with minimal carbon oxides through primary and secondary combustions. Controlling the redox properties, surface morphology of VOx, and acid-base characteristics can enhance catalyst performance. The addition of calcium oxide (CaO) improves the catalyst's surface area and acidity, maximizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while minimizing propylene and propane combustion. The main advantage of this process is the potential to achieve higher propylene selectivity by controlling the lattice oxygen of the catalysts. This process has a significant economic impact, with worldwide sales/demand for propylene exceeding $90 billion.

          丙烯在化学工业中扮演着重要角色，作为生产各种有价值产品的关键原料，尤其是热塑性聚丙烯，广泛应用于制造家电、塑料薄膜和其他应用。其最重要的优势在于反应的放热性质，无需额外能量加速反应过程。通过高效催化剂可以获得高产率的丙烯。与传统的商业过程相比，丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯更具吸引力，因为它具有较低的操作成本和最小的环境影响。在ODH过程中形成的水副产品有助于避免非氧化途径中观察到的热力学约束。在较低的丙烷转化率下，仅能实现高丙烯选择性，因为与丙烯相比，丙烷的反应性较低。设计催化剂以提供最优的晶格氧水平，可以在通过初级和次级燃烧实现丙烯的选性生产时，将碳氧化物的生成降到最低。通过控制还原性质、VOx表面形态和酸碱特性可以增强催化剂性能。将钙氧化物（CaO）加入催化剂中可以提高其表面积和酸度，最大化丙烷吸附和丙烯脱附，同时减少丙烯和丙烷燃烧。该过程的主要优势在于通过控制催化剂的晶格氧，有可能实现更高的丙烯选择性。这一过程对全球经济产生了重大影响，全球丙烯的销售/需求超过900亿美元。
