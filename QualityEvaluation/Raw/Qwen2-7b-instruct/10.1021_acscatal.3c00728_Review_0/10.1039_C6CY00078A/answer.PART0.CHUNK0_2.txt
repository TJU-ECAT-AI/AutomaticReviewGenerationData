[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products."
[2] "Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications."
[3] "Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction."
[4] "However, the appropriate selection of the reactor is a key factor to achieve the above mentioned advantages of the ODH technology."
[5] "Fixed bed reactors are simple but difficult to operate under isothermal conditions."
[6] "The fluidized bed reactors have numerous advantages over the conventional fixed reactor systems."
[7] "Moreover, transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit is also one of the merits of fluidized bed reactors that allows periodic catalyst re-oxidation."
[8] "High yield of propylene can be obtained by employing an efficient catalyst."
[9] "It is reported in the literature that vanadium-based catalysts give the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity for ODH of lighter hydrocarbons."
[10] "The reactions involved in the oxidation of propane include the desired propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene as well as combustion of propane and produced propylene to carbon oxides."
[11] "High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene."
[12] "Thus, there is a need to design a catalyst that will provide the optimum level of lattice oxygen to selectively produce propylene with minimum carbon oxides via primary/secondary combustions."
[13] "The surface density of VOx increases with vanadium loading, which is the lowest for monovanadate isolated VOx species and the highest for monolayer coverage species."
[14] "Based on the above discussion, the present work is aimed at developing fluidizable vanadium oxide catalysts using a mixed γ-Al2O3CaO with different γ-Al2O3/CaO ratios as support."
[15] "In this approach, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is accomplished with the lattice oxygen of the catalysts."
[16] "The use of CaO will improve a resulting catalyst's superficial area and also gives it the desired moderate level of acidity, that will maximize propane adsorption and propylene desorption and also minimize propylene and propane combustion."
[17] "The measured BET surface areas of the prepared catalysts range from 14 to 25 m2 g1."
[18] "The catalyst performance was studied based on propane conversion, selectivity and yield given below."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, driven by its widespread use in the production of various valuable products, particularly thermoplastic polypropylene, which is utilized in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. Its exothermic nature and the ability to produce propene without additional energy make it an attractive option. However, the efficiency of the production process is crucial, requiring careful selection of reactors. Fixed bed reactors are simple but struggle with maintaining isothermal conditions, whereas fluidized bed reactors offer numerous advantages, including better control over operating conditions, uniform residence time distributions, and facilitated transportation of catalytic species. The development of efficient catalysts is paramount for propene production, with vanadium-based catalysts showing the highest alkane conversion and alkene selectivity. The optimization of lattice oxygen in the catalysts can lead to higher propene selectivity with minimal carbon oxides. The surface density of VOx increases with vanadium loading, influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity. The use of mixed γ-Al2O3CaO supports with different ratios aims to achieve a balance between surface area and acidity, maximizing propene adsorption and desorption while minimizing unwanted reactions. The BET surface areas of the catalysts range from 14 to 25 m2/g, indicating a higher surface area compared to γ-Al2O3 alone. The performance of the catalysts is evaluated based on propane conversion, selectivity, and yield.
