Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become a crucial feedstock for producing various valuable products. Approximately two-thirds of the propylene produced globally is utilized for the manufacturing of thermoplastic polypropylene, a widely used compound in household appliance fabrication, plastic films, and other applications. Propene's exothermic nature, which doesn't require additional energy to accelerate the reaction, makes it an attractive option for production. The development of efficient catalysts is vital for obtaining a high yield of propene. Compared to traditional commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene offers lower operational costs and reduced environmental impact. The formation of water as a by-product in the ODH process avoids thermodynamic constraints observed in non-oxidative routes. Appropriate reactor selection is essential to harness the benefits of ODH technology. Fluidized bed reactors have advantages like controlled operating conditions, uniform residence time distributions, and the capability to transport reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit, allowing periodic catalyst re-oxidation. High propene selectivity is only advantageous at lower propane conversions because propane is less reactive compared to propylene. Designing a catalyst that optimally controls the lattice oxygen level can enable the selective production of propene with minimal carbon oxides. Controlling the redox properties, morphology of surface species, and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst can enhance its performance. The incorporation of calcium oxide (CaO) improves the catalyst's surface area and provides a moderate level of acidity, maximizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while minimizing propylene and propane combustion. The process's key advantage is the potential for achieving higher propene selectivity through the appropriate control of lattice oxygen.

Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry, being a key feedstock for producing valuable products, particularly thermoplastic polypropylene, widely used in manufacturing household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The global sales and demand for propylene exceed $90 billion annually. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers several economic and environmental advantages. The exothermic nature of the reaction requires no additional energy input, making it an economically efficient process. The fluidized bed reactor, with its ability to maintain constant temperature and prevent hot spots, is a significant benefit over fixed bed reactors. This technology also allows for the transportation of reduced catalytic species from the oxidative dehydrogenation unit to the regeneration unit, enabling periodic catalyst re-oxidation. The use of calcium oxide (CaO) enhances the catalyst's surface area and acidity, which optimizes propane adsorption and propylene desorption, minimizing the formation of carbon oxides. Controlling the redox properties, morphology of surface species, and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst can significantly improve its performance. High propylene selectivity is crucial, as propane reactivity is lower compared to propylene. Achieving the right level of lattice oxygen on the catalyst surface is vital for maximizing propylene selectivity while minimizing the formation of carbon oxides. The acidic character of alkanes and their corresponding olefins decreases with an increase in carbon number and degree of saturation, suggesting that designing catalysts with controlled acidity could lead to higher selectivity in ODH. The prepared catalysts in this study exhibit surface areas ranging from 14 to 25 square meters per gram, which is beneficial for enhancing propane and propylene interactions.

Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry as a key feedstock for producing various valuable products, particularly thermoplastic polypropylene, widely utilized in manufacturing household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The exothermic nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene offers significant economic benefits as it doesn't require additional energy input to accelerate the reaction. However, achieving high selectivity for propylene necessitates controlling the propane conversion rate, as propylene becomes more reactive compared to propane at higher conversion levels. The incorporation of calcium oxide (CaO) in the catalyst formulation enhances the catalyst's surface area and provides a moderate level of acidity, optimizing the adsorption and desorption of propane and propylene. This, in turn, maximizes propylene production while minimizing unwanted reactions. The key advantage of ODH processes lies in their potential to achieve higher propylene selectivity by precisely managing the lattice oxygen present on the catalyst surface.
