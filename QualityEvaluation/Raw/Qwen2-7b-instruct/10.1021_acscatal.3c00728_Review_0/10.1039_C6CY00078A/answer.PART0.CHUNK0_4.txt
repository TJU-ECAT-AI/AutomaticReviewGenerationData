[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products."
[2] "Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications."
[3] "Its most important advantage is the exothermic nature of the reaction, which requires no additional energy to accelerate the reaction."
[4] "High selectivity for propylene is only favorable at low propane conversions due to lower propane reactivity when compared to propylene."
[5] "The use of CaO will improve a resulting catalyst's superficial area and also gives it the desired moderate level of acidity, that will maximize propane adsorption and propylene desorption and also minimize propylene and propane combustion."
[6] "The major advantage of this process is the possibility of achieving higher propylene selectivity by appropriate control of the lattice oxygen of the catalysts."

Propylene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry as a key feedstock for producing various valuable products, particularly thermoplastic polypropylene, widely utilized in manufacturing household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The exothermic nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene offers significant economic benefits as it doesn't require additional energy input to accelerate the reaction. However, achieving high selectivity for propylene necessitates controlling the propane conversion rate, as propylene becomes more reactive compared to propane at higher conversion levels. The incorporation of calcium oxide (CaO) in the catalyst formulation enhances the catalyst's surface area and provides a moderate level of acidity, optimizing the adsorption and desorption of propane and propylene. This, in turn, maximizes propylene production while minimizing unwanted reactions. The key advantage of ODH processes lies in their potential to achieve higher propylene selectivity by precisely managing the lattice oxygen present on the catalyst surface.

丙烯在化学工业中扮演着重要角色，是生产不同价值产品的重要原料，尤其是用于制造家电、塑料薄膜等应用中的热塑性聚丙烯。丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的放热性质为反应提供了经济优势，无需额外能量加速反应过程。然而，实现高丙烯选择性需要控制丙烷转化率，因为随着转化率提高，丙烯的反应性会高于丙烷。将钙氧化物（CaO）引入催化剂配方中可以增强催化剂的表面积并提供适度的酸性，从而优化丙烷和丙烯的吸附与脱附过程。这有利于最大化丙烯产量同时减少不必要的反应。ODH工艺的主要优势在于通过精确管理催化剂表面的晶格氧来实现更高的丙烯选择性。
