Propene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry, serving as a key feedstock for the production of various valuable products. It is predominantly utilized in the manufacturing of thermoplastic polypropylene, a widely used material in household appliances, plastic films, and other applications. The global demand for propene is substantial, reaching nearly $90 billion annually. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process stands out as a more economical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods, offering a lower operational cost and minimal environmental impact. This makes propene production through ODH propane more sustainable compared to conventional processes. The selection of the appropriate reactor is pivotal in realizing the benefits of ODH technology. Fluidized bed reactors are particularly advantageous, facilitating catalyst re-oxidation and minimizing thermodynamic constraints. Propene's selectivity in the ODH process is influenced by the catalyst's acidity, which in turn affects the protection of chemical species against oxidation to carbon oxides. The addition of CaO enhances the catalyst's surface area and acidity, optimizing propane adsorption and propylene desorption while reducing propylene and propane combustion. Controlling the redox properties, morphology of surface species, and acid-base characteristics of the catalyst can significantly improve its performance. The acidity of the catalyst directly impacts the prevention of oxidation reactions, ensuring a higher yield of propene. The use of CaO in the catalyst formulation improves its surface area and acidity, contributing to a balanced performance. The BET surface areas of the prepared catalysts vary from 14 to 25 m2 g1. The lattice oxygen of the catalysts is crucial in the ODH process, enabling the selective production of propene. By appropriately controlling the lattice oxygen, higher propylene selectivity can be achieved, making this process highly promising for propene production.
