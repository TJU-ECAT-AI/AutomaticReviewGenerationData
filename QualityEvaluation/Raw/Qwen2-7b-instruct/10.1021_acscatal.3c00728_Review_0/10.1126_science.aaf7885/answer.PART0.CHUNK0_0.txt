[1] "Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."
[2] "Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[3] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced."
[4] "Changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."
[5] "The more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins."
[6] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[7] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[8] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption."
[9] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."
[10] "Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, with its high demand driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The increasing scarcity of naphtha, a traditional feedstock for propene production, alongside the rising availability of low-cost ethene from shale gas, has created a demand-supply gap for propene and other higher olefins. Propane dehydrogenation offers a viable alternative by converting propane, a component of natural gas, directly into propene through reaction with oxygen. This method holds economic and environmental advantages, including a potential 45% reduction in energy consumption compared to non-oxidative processes. Meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications, such as in plastics, solvents, and monomers, is crucial for industries that rely on this versatile olefin. The development of selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) using materials like hexagonal boron nitride and boron nitride nanotubes demonstrates a promising pathway for improving reaction efficiency and selectivity, offering a potential solution to the challenges posed by traditional non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation methods.
