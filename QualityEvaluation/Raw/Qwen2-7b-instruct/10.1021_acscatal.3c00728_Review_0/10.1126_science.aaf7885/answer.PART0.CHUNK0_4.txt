[1] "Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."
[2] "Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[3] "As an example, at 14% propane conversion, we obtain selectivity of 79% propene and 12% ethene, another desired alkene."
[4] "The potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption."
[5] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[6] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[7] "Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart."
[8] "Although graphene and fullerene materials are emerging as catalysts for partial alkane oxidations, BN materials, one of the inorganic analogs of graphene, have yet to be explored for their own catalytic activity."
[9] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[10] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts."
[11] "The reaction parameters such as temperature, catalyst mass, total gas flow-rate, and partial pressures of propane and oxygen were varied to observe changes to product distributions by sampling the reactor exhaust stream via online gas chromatography and mass spectrometry."
[12] "The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion is indicative of the facile overoxidation of propene to COx."
[13] "We furthermore verified that the catalytic activity of the BN material remains stable for at least 32 hours on stream."

[16] "The analogous product distributions for both h-BN and BNNTs suggest a similar reaction mechanism for these BN materials."

[18] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts."
[19] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because of several economic and environmental advantages. This approach meets the growing needs for propene across various applications by offering energy savings, enhancing reaction efficiency through favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures), and preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. By using propane, a component of natural gas, as feedstock instead of naphtha, the method reduces the dependency on traditional oil sources and potentially decreases environmental impacts. Moreover, the development of selective oxidative dehydrogenation using boron nitride catalysts, which exhibit high selectivity to propene and ethene, provides an efficient alternative with minimal production of unwanted CO and CO2. The stability of the catalysts, their ability to maintain high selectivity over long periods, and the unique reaction mechanisms that prevent overoxidation contribute to the attractiveness of this technology in the chemical industry.
