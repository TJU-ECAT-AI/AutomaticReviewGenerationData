Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its widespread use in various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, particularly as a substitute for traditional naphtha-based methods. This approach offers economic advantages through potentially lower energy consumption and cost savings. Environmentally, it may reduce emissions, as it utilizes a more abundant feedstock like natural gas, and it can potentially lead to more efficient use of resources. The potential energy savings of 45% for moving to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) highlights its potential impact on reducing energy consumption in the chemical industry.
