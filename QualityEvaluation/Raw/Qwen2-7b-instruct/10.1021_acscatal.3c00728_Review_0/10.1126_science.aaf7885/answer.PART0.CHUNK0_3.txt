[1] "Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."
[2] "Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."
[3] "Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[4] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[5] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[6] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7)."
[7] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[8] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes BN materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[9] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity (kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1)."
[10] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its widespread use in various applications, including plastics, rubbers, and solvents. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, particularly since changes in the global supply chain have led to shortages. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages, such as reducing energy consumption by 45% compared to traditional methods. The key challenge is preventing the overoxidation of propene to CO and CO2. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown promise, but new materials like boron nitride (BN) have emerged, offering exceptional selectivity for propene production. The proposed mechanism involves an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN acting as the active site, leading to high olefin selectivity and enhanced propene productivity.
