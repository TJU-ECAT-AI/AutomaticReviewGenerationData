Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand driven by the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications. The traditional method of producing propene from naphtha faces challenges due to changes in the global supply chain, leading to shortages. Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, offers an attractive alternative, although existing approaches produce a significant amount of unwanted CO and CO2. Propane dehydrogenation, particularly selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP), holds promise for improving reaction efficiency compared to nonoxidative methods. This is due to favorable thermodynamics, such as exothermic reactions and lower temperatures, as well as enhanced catalyst stability. Adopting ODHP could result in substantial energy savings, up to 45% of the energy consumption. This technological shift is motivated by the disparity in propene supply and demand, prompting the exploration of on-purpose propene production methods.

In terms of catalysts, supported vanadium oxide catalysts have demonstrated promising activity for ODHP, benefiting from the redox properties of active vanadium sites. However, achieving high propene selectivity remains a challenge. Recent findings indicate that metal-free materials, specifically hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), exhibit exceptional selectivity for propene production, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. The product distribution highlights a distinct advantage of BN materials over traditional catalysts, with a notable reduction in CO and CO2 formation. The reaction mechanism for these materials involves oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN acting as active sites, leading to the stabilization of propyl radicals through the formation of nitroxyl radical sites. This mechanism explains the observed high olefin selectivity and the unique reaction dynamics of ODHP with BN materials.

丙烯在化工行业的地位随着其需求的增长而演变，这推动了对这种多功能烯烃在各种应用中的需求。传统的从石脑油生产丙烯的方法由于全球供应链的变化面临着挑战，导致短缺。通过天然气成分中的丙烷直接转化为氧气提供了一种有吸引力的选择，但现有的方法会产生大量不需要的二氧化碳和一氧化碳。选择性氧化脱氢（ODHP）具有改进反应效率的潜力，与非氧化性方法相比，这得益于有利的动力学特性，如放热反应和较低的反应温度，以及催化剂表面焦炭沉积的增强稳定性。转向ODHP有望实现高达45%的能量节省。这种技术转变是由供需差距激发的，促使探索专门的丙烯生产技术。

在催化剂方面，到目前为止，以五氧化二钒为活性中心的催化剂在ODHP中显示出最有可能的活性，得益于活性五氧化二钒位点的还原性和氧化性。然而，实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。最近的研究表明，无金属材料，尤其是六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs），在丙烯生产中的选择性极高，这是迄今为止在ODHP条件下报道的最高选择性之一。这些材料的产品分布凸显了它们与传统催化剂的区别，显著减少了二氧化碳和一氧化碳的形成。该反应机制涉及氮化硼臂椅边缘上的氧分子作为活性位点，通过形成硝基自由基位点来稳定丙基自由基，解释了观察到的高烯烃选择性和ODHP中BN材料的独特反应动力学。
