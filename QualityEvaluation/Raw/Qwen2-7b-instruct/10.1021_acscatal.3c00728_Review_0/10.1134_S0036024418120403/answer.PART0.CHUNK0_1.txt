The dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide has been studied using different chromium oxide/silica catalysts. The highest propylene selectivity was achieved with a 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst from Degussa, while the highest propane conversion was observed with a 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst from Acros. These findings suggest that these specific catalysts are highly effective in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
