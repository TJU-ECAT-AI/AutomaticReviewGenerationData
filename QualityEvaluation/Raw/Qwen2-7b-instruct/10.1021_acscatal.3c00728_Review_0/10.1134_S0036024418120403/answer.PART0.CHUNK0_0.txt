[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst."
[2] "The structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface was studied by UVVis spectroscopy. The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility and wide range of applications, including plastics, solvents, and synthetic fibers. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it efficiently converts propane into propene, which is a key feedstock for many chemical processes. Economically, this approach reduces costs associated with sourcing propene from other sources, such as natural gas. Environmentally, it minimizes the energy required for the conversion process compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving sustainability. The high propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates reported in the study suggest that using chromium oxide-supported catalysts could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the dehydrogenation process, offering a promising solution for meeting the growing needs for propene while maintaining economic and environmental benefits.
