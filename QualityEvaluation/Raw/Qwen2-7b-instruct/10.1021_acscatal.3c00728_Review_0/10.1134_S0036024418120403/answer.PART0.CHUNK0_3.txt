The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatile applications across various industries, such as plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it efficiently converts propane into propene, which is more valuable and widely used in the market. Economically, this process offers higher yields and lower costs compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, it reduces the emission of greenhouse gases by utilizing carbon dioxide as a reactant, promoting sustainability. This approach meets the growing needs for propene by providing a more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly production route.
