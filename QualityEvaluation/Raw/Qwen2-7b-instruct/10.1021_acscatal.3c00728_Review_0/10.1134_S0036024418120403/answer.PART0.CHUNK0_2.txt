[1] "The highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample."
[2] "The highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst."
[3] "The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium."

The dehydrogenation of propane with 2 on supported CrOx/SiO2 catalysts led to significant results. Specifically, the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) catalyst demonstrated high propylene selectivity, achieving 95%. Conversely, the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst showed the highest propane conversion rate, reaching 53%. These findings indicate that the structure of chromium oxide particles on the support surface plays a crucial role in the catalyst's performance, impacting both propylene selectivity and propane conversion efficiency.
