[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, the highest propylene selectivity (95%) was observed for the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Degussa) sample, and the highest propane conversion (53%) was reported on the 5% CrOx/SiO2 (Acros) catalyst."
[2] "The catalytic properties were correlated with the state of chromium."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its versatility in various applications, leading to increased demand. Its use in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals underscores its importance. As demand grows, so does the need for efficient production methods. Propane dehydrogenation emerges as a preferred approach because it offers economic and environmental advantages. Economically, this process can enhance yield and profitability, while environmentally, it promotes cleaner production methods compared to traditional techniques. The study highlights the effectiveness of chromium oxide catalysts in enhancing propylene selectivity and propane conversion rates, demonstrating the catalytic properties' correlation with the state of chromium. This indicates that optimized catalysts could lead to more efficient and sustainable propane dehydrogenation processes, aligning well with the industry's evolving requirements.
