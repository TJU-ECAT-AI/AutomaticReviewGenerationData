[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs via similar elementary steps on VOx and MoOx."
[2] "Activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion; this leads to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases."
[3] "Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions show similar activation energies, suggesting that the steps involved in determining the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (desorption vs subsequent oxidation) occur after the kinetically relevant CH activation steps in propane."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves similar steps on vanadium (VOx), molybdenum (MoOx), and tungsten (WOx) oxides. The activation energy for dehydrogenating propane is higher than for combusting propene, resulting in a reduction of the k3/k1 ratio as temperature rises. Propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion share similar activation energies, implying that the steps governing the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (whether they desorb or undergo further oxidation) happen after the critical CH bond activation in propane.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds through comparable steps on vanadium (VOx) and molybdenum (MoOx) oxides. The activation energies for both propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence. The difference in activation energy between propane ODH and propene combustion is significantly higher than the difference in bond dissociation enthalpies between the weakest CH bonds in propane and propene, indicating that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also impact their reaction rates. Propane ODH and propene combustion exhibit similar activation energies, implying that the processes dictating the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (desorption versus further oxidation) happen after the key CH activation steps in propane.

丙烷氧化脱氢在VOx和MoOx上通过相似的步骤进行。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按顺序增加：VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2，而相应的反应速率则按相反顺序递减。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧之间的活化能差远大于丙烷和丙烯中最弱C-H键的断裂焓差，表明丙烯和丙烷的吸附能差异也影响它们的反应速率。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能相近，意味着决定吸附醇中间体命运（脱附或进一步氧化）的过程发生在丙烷的亲核活性C-H键激活步骤之后。
