[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs via similar elementary steps on VOx and MoOx."
[2] "Activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion; this leads to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases."
[3] "Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions show similar activation energies, suggesting that the steps involved in determining the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (desorption vs subsequent oxidation) occur after the kinetically relevant CH activation steps in propane."

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane involves similar steps on vanadium (VOx), molybdenum (MoOx), and tungsten (WOx) oxides. The activation energy for dehydrogenating propane is higher than for combusting propene, resulting in a reduction of the k3/k1 ratio as temperature rises. Propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion share similar activation energies, implying that the steps governing the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (whether they desorb or undergo further oxidation) happen after the critical CH bond activation in propane.

丙烷氧化脱氢在VOx、MoOx和WOx氧化物上涉及相似的步骤。丙烷脱氢的活化能高于丙烯燃烧，导致温度升高时k3/k1比率降低。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧具有相似的活化能，这意味着决定吸附醇基物种命运的步骤（是脱附还是进一步氧化）发生在丙烷中的关键CH键激活之后。
