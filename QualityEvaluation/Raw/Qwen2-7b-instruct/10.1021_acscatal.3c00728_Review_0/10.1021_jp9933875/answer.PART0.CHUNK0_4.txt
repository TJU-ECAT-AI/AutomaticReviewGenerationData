[1] "Propane dehydrogenation occurs via similar pathways on VOx and MoOx."
[2] "The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2."
[3] "The higher redox properties of metal oxides show higher catalytic activity."
[4] "Less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1  ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio."
[5] "This suggests that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also influence the relative reaction rates of these two molecules."
[6] "Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions show similar activation energies."

1. Propane dehydrogenation follows similar pathways on VOx and MoOx catalysts. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion increase sequentially: VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. Higher redox properties in metal oxides correlate with enhanced catalytic activity. Less acidic metal oxides reduce ΔE1  ΔE3 and k3/k1 ratio, leading to increased propene yield. Propane ODH and combustion reactions exhibit comparable activation energies.

1. 烷基化在VOx和MoOx催化剂上遵循相似的途径。丙烷脱氢和丙烯燃烧的活化能按顺序增加：VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2。金属氧化物的高还原性与增强的催化活性相关。酸性较低的金属氧化物降低ΔE1  ΔE3和k3/k1比率，导致丙烯产率增加。丙烷脱氢和燃烧反应的活化能相近。
