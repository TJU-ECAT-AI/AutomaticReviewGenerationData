[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons:..."
[4] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1] ."
[5] "In the case of propane ODH, conversely, the best yields reported are lower than 30%."
[6] "The main problem encountered in propane ODH is the presence of the consecutive reaction of olefin combustion that rapidly decreases the propylene yield when the conversion of the alkane is increased."
[7] "Therefore, for both ethane and propane ODH, very little information is reported in literature concerning catalysts lifetime."

1. The demand for olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, is anticipated to surge in the coming years. Current primary production methods include steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. There is a notable research emphasis on creating catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes due to several reasons. For instance, the demand for propylene is outpacing that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, in contrast to ethane, presents a challenge. The highest yields reported for propane are under 30%, which is insufficient for commercial application.

3. The main hurdle in propane oxidative dehydrogenation is the rapid decline in propylene yield due to consecutive olefin combustion reactions as the alkane conversion increases.

4. There is a scarcity of detailed information regarding the lifespan of catalysts utilized in the oxidative dehydrogenation of both ethane and propane.

1. 未来几年，对烯烃的需求，特别是乙烯和丙烯，预计将显著增加。当前的主要生产方法包括蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂解和烷烃氧化脱氢。在开发用于烷烃氧化脱氢的催化剂方面存在显著的研究重点，原因包括以下几点：例如，在西欧地区，丙烯的需求增长速度超过了乙烯。

2. 对于丙烷氧化脱氢而言，与乙烷相比，最高报告的产量仍然远低于30%，这不符合工业应用的要求。

3. 丙烷氧化脱氢的主要障碍是，随着烷烃转化率的提高，连续烯烃燃烧反应导致丙烯产率迅速下降。

4. 关于在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢中使用的催化剂寿命的信息非常有限。
