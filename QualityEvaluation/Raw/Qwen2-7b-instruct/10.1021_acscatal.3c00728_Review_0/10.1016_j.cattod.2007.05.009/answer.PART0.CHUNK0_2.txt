[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons:"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown over time, and its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This is because the main sources of olefins, including steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation, have limitations and inefficiencies. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include its ability to provide a more sustainable and efficient way to produce propene, which is a versatile olefin used in various applications. By focusing on developing catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, industries aim to meet the growing needs for propene while optimizing production processes and enhancing sustainability.
