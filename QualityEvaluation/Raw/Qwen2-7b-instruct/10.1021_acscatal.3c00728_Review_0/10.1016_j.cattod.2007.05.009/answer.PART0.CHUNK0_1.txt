[1] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons: In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe."
[2] "Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[3] "Furthermore, oxygen becomes the limiting reactant, due to both the propane/oxygen feed ratio usually employed and the high O2 consumption in combustion reaction; consequently, propane conversions lower than 40% (with total oxygen conversion) are usually obtained."
[4] "The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides [231] ,[285] ,[286] ."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become increasingly important, especially in meeting the growing demands for versatile olefins across various applications. Its demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, offering economic and environmental advantages over traditional processes. Key drivers for this shift include:

1. Steam cracking predominantly produces ethylene, which meets the bulk demand. However, the demand for propylene grows faster, particularly in Western Europe, making it essential to develop alternative methods to meet this growing need.

2. Fluid-catalytic cracking (FCC) also produces propylene, but in lesser quantities compared to ethylene, further emphasizing the need for dedicated propylene production methods.

3. The current production of olefins does not align with the forecast market demand, necessitating the development of more efficient and specific methods for olefin production.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, high performance is achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides, which enable the production of propylene under conditions that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable.

These advancements in technology aim to address the increasing demand for propene by enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the production process, ensuring that the growing needs for this versatile olefin are met in a manner that is both profitable and sustainable.

丙烯在化工行业的地位正在不断演变，以满足其在各种应用领域日益增长的需求。由于对丙烯需求的增长速度快于乙烷，尤其是西欧地区，这促使人们采用丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法。这种方法在经济和环境方面具有优势，可以替代传统的生产方式：

1. 蒸汽裂解主要生产乙烯，而对丙烯的需求增长更快，特别是在欧洲西部，因此需要开发新的方法来满足这一增长的需求。

2. 流体催化裂化（FCC）也生产丙烯，但产量低于乙烯，进一步强调了专门生产丙烯方法的重要性。

3. 目前的烯烃生产与市场预测的需求不符，需要发展更高效、更特定的方法来生产烯烃。

4. 在丙烷脱氢中，使用不可还原的碱金属或碱土金属氧化物可以获得最佳性能，从而在经济可行性和环境可持续性方面实现丙烯的生产。

这些技术进步旨在通过提高生产过程的效率和选择性，满足对这种多用途烯烃日益增长的需求，同时确保生产过程既有利可图又可持续。
