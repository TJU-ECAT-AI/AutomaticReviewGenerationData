[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "The potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[5] "The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective."

[2] "Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[3] "Furthermore, oxygen becomes the limiting reactant, due to both the propane/oxygen feed ratio usually employed and the high O2 consumption in combustion reaction; consequently, propane conversions lower than 40% (with total oxygen conversion) are usually obtained."
[4] "The best performance in propane ODH has been obtained with non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides [231] ,[285] ,[286] ."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become increasingly important, especially in meeting the growing demands for versatile olefins across various applications. Its demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, offering economic and environmental advantages over traditional processes. Key drivers for this shift include:

1. Steam cracking predominantly produces ethylene, which meets the bulk demand. However, the demand for propylene grows faster, particularly in Western Europe, making it essential to develop alternative methods to meet this growing need.

2. Fluid-catalytic cracking (FCC) also produces propylene, but in lesser quantities compared to ethylene, further emphasizing the need for dedicated propylene production methods.

3. The current production of olefins does not align with the forecast market demand, necessitating the development of more efficient and specific methods for olefin production.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, high performance is achieved using non-reducible alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides, which enable the production of propylene under conditions that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable.

These advancements in technology aim to address the increasing demand for propene by enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the production process, ensuring that the growing needs for this versatile olefin are met in a manner that is both profitable and sustainable.

丙烯在化工行业的地位正在不断演变，以满足其在各种应用领域日益增长的需求。由于对丙烯需求的增长速度快于乙烷，尤其是西欧地区，这促使人们采用丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法。这种方法在经济和环境方面具有优势，可以替代传统的生产方式：

1. 蒸汽裂解主要生产乙烯，而对丙烯的需求增长更快，特别是在欧洲西部，因此需要开发新的方法来满足这一增长的需求。

2. 流体催化裂化（FCC）也生产丙烯，但产量低于乙烯，进一步强调了专门生产丙烯方法的重要性。

3. 目前的烯烃生产与市场预测的需求不符，需要发展更高效、更特定的方法来生产烯烃。

4. 在丙烷脱氢中，使用不可还原的碱金属或碱土金属氧化物可以获得最佳性能，从而在经济可行性和环境可持续性方面实现丙烯的生产。

这些技术进步旨在通过提高生产过程的效率和选择性，满足对这种多用途烯烃日益增长的需求，同时确保生产过程既有利可图又可持续。

1. The demand for olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, is anticipated to surge in the coming years. Current primary production methods include steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. There is a notable research emphasis on creating catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes due to several reasons. For instance, the demand for propylene is outpacing that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, in contrast to ethane, presents a challenge. The highest yields reported for propane are under 30%, which is insufficient for commercial application.

3. The main hurdle in propane oxidative dehydrogenation is the rapid decline in propylene yield due to consecutive olefin combustion reactions as the alkane conversion increases.

4. There is a scarcity of detailed information regarding the lifespan of catalysts utilized in the oxidative dehydrogenation of both ethane and propane.

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe."

[6] "The potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."

[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

[8] "In the case of propane ODH, the best yields reported are lower than 30%."

[9] "In the case of propane ODH, Fig. 2 shows that the best yields reported are lower than 30%."

[10] "The main problem encountered in propane ODH is the presence of the consecutive reaction of olefin combustion that rapidly decreases the propylene yield when the conversion of the alkane is increased."

[11] "Addition of Li to MgO increased reaction rate and selectivity to olefins from 40 to 70% [231], [238]; lithium is, therefore, an essential ingredient of the catalyst in order to create the active site."

[12] "The role of the catalyst is limited to initiating the exothermic oxidation reactions and determining the heat release, while it does not affects the cracking reaction significantly [358], [359], [360], [361]."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its increasing demand, especially for its use in Western Europe, where the demand for propylene is rising faster than for ethylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a preferred production method because it allows for the conversion of alkanes into olefins, which are versatile and widely used in various applications. The economic and environmental advantages of ODH include potentially higher efficiency and lower energy costs compared to traditional methods like steam cracking. However, the yield of olefins, particularly propylene, needs to be improved to make ODH economically viable. The energy losses associated with ODH, especially those related to the production of carbon dioxide (CO2), can also impact the overall costs. The use of lithium in magnesium oxide catalysts enhances the reaction rate and selectivity to olefins in propane ODH, making it an essential component for achieving high yields. Lastly, in ethane and propane ODH, the catalysts primarily initiate exothermic oxidation reactions, influencing the heat release but having a limited impact on the endothermic cracking reactions.

丙烯在化工行业的地位随着其需求的增长而提高，尤其是在西欧地区，对丙烯的需求增长速度超过乙烯。氧化脱氢（ODH）是烷烃的一种优选生产方法，因为它允许将烷烃转化为烯烃，这些烯烃在各种应用中具有广泛用途。ODH的经济和环境优势包括可能更高的效率和更低的能量成本与传统方法如蒸汽裂解相比。然而，烯烃，特别是丙烯的产量需要得到改善以使ODH在经济上可行。与ODH相关的能量损失，尤其是与二氧化碳（CO2）的生产有关的损失，也可能影响总体成本。在烷基和丙烷ODH中，催化剂主要启动放热氧化反应，影响热释放但对热力学上吸热的裂解反应的影响有限。最后，在乙烷和丙烷ODH中，催化剂主要启动放热氧化反应，影响热释放但对热力学上吸热的裂解反应的影响有限。使用锂在镁氧化物催化剂中的使用可以增强反应速率和选择性到烯烃，使其成为实现高产率的必要成分。
