[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "The potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[5] "The case of propane ODH is different because the best yields reported are still far from being interesting for industrial implementation. Conditions leading to best propylene yields also lead to the co-production of significant amounts of ethylene; therefore, the finding of a catalyst capable of combining industrially acceptable conversion/productivity with specificity to this olefin is still the major objective."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by its increasing demand. Its versatility and wide usage across various applications necessitate a reliable and efficient production method. Propane dehydrogenation offers an environmentally friendly and economically viable alternative to traditional cracking processes, aiming to meet the growing needs for propene. This approach provides an advantage in terms of energy efficiency, process simplicity, and lower carbon footprint compared to conventional methods. However, the challenge lies in developing catalysts that can produce propene with high selectivity while achieving industrially acceptable conversion and productivity. This remains the major objective in the research and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies.
