[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, due to the following reasons:"

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe."

[4] "The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[6] "The potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."

[7] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

[8] "In the case of propane ODH, the best yields reported are lower than 30%."

[9] "In the case of propane ODH, Fig. 2 shows that the best yields reported are lower than 30%."

[10] "The main problem encountered in propane ODH is the presence of the consecutive reaction of olefin combustion that rapidly decreases the propylene yield when the conversion of the alkane is increased."

[11] "Addition of Li to MgO increased reaction rate and selectivity to olefins from 40 to 70% [231], [238]; lithium is, therefore, an essential ingredient of the catalyst in order to create the active site."

[12] "The role of the catalyst is limited to initiating the exothermic oxidation reactions and determining the heat release, while it does not affects the cracking reaction significantly [358], [359], [360], [361]."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its increasing demand, especially for its use in Western Europe, where the demand for propylene is rising faster than for ethylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a preferred production method because it allows for the conversion of alkanes into olefins, which are versatile and widely used in various applications. The economic and environmental advantages of ODH include potentially higher efficiency and lower energy costs compared to traditional methods like steam cracking. However, the yield of olefins, particularly propylene, needs to be improved to make ODH economically viable. The energy losses associated with ODH, especially those related to the production of carbon dioxide (CO2), can also impact the overall costs. The use of lithium in magnesium oxide catalysts enhances the reaction rate and selectivity to olefins in propane ODH, making it an essential component for achieving high yields. Lastly, in ethane and propane ODH, the catalysts primarily initiate exothermic oxidation reactions, influencing the heat release but having a limited impact on the endothermic cracking reactions.

丙烯在化工行业的地位随着其需求的增长而提高，尤其是在西欧地区，对丙烯的需求增长速度超过乙烯。氧化脱氢（ODH）是烷烃的一种优选生产方法，因为它允许将烷烃转化为烯烃，这些烯烃在各种应用中具有广泛用途。ODH的经济和环境优势包括可能更高的效率和更低的能量成本与传统方法如蒸汽裂解相比。然而，烯烃，特别是丙烯的产量需要得到改善以使ODH在经济上可行。与ODH相关的能量损失，尤其是与二氧化碳（CO2）的生产有关的损失，也可能影响总体成本。在烷基和丙烷ODH中，催化剂主要启动放热氧化反应，影响热释放但对热力学上吸热的裂解反应的影响有限。最后，在乙烷和丙烷ODH中，催化剂主要启动放热氧化反应，影响热释放但对热力学上吸热的裂解反应的影响有限。使用锂在镁氧化物催化剂中的使用可以增强反应速率和选择性到烯烃，使其成为实现高产率的必要成分。
