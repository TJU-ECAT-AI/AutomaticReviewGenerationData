Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, primarily due to its wide range of applications, including as a key feedstock for the production of plastics, rubbers, and other synthetic materials. Its demand has surpassed that of ethylene, leading to a shortage of propylene supplies from traditional steam cracking processes. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred alternative method to address the growing propylene demand. This approach offers economic advantages by providing a more flexible and potentially cost-effective method of propylene production. Additionally, environmental benefits include reduced emissions and waste compared to conventional cracking processes. The use of tin in Pt/support catalyst systems enhances stability and selectivity in olefin production, while additives like alkali metals and rare earth metals further improve catalytic performance. Zinc aluminate supports are noted for their high catalytic efficiency in paraffin dehydrogenation, contributing to the overall effectiveness of propane dehydrogenation processes.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性显著增长，主要由于其广泛的应用领域，包括塑料、橡胶和其他合成材料的生产。其需求已超过乙烯，导致蒸汽裂解过程中丙烯供应短缺。因此，丙烷脱氢作为一种替代方法来应对日益增长的丙烯需求。这种方法提供了经济优势，提供了一种更灵活且可能更经济的丙烯生产方式。此外，它还具有环境效益，与传统裂解过程相比，减少了排放和废物。在铂/支持催化剂系统中使用锡提高了稳定性及烯烃选择性，在此过程中添加碱金属和稀土金属进一步提高了催化剂性能。锌铝酸盐支撑物因其在烷基化脱氢反应中的高效催化作用，对丙烷脱氢过程的整体有效性做出了贡献。
