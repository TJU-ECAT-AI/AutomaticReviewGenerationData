[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."
[3] "The role of tin is proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt by forming PtSn alloys and dilution Pt sites, respectively [1] ,[2] ."
[4] "However, the stability of PtSn supported catalysts is still unsatisfactory."
[5] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength [8] ,[9] ,[10] ."
[6] "Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modified Pt dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of the stability and selectivity."
[7] "In this study, we prepared PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts and compared their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation."
[8] "To better understand the relationship between the catalytic stability and the PtSn bimetallic alloy system, the PtSn bimetallic phases were investigated through CO chemisorption, XRD, XPS, TPR, and HRTEM with fresh and spent catalysts."
[9] "The formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases were directly observed during the reaction over both catalysts and the different influences of the Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 supports on the behavior of PtSn alloy phases."
[10] "Moreover, the different PtSn alloy phases led to differences in the coke mobility over the catalysts and eventually had a strong effect on the catalyst stability."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its increasing demand. This demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it allows for more efficient and cost-effective production of propylene, a key component in numerous applications. The economic advantages include reduced costs associated with propylene production, increased supply reliability, and the ability to meet growing market demands. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers a cleaner alternative compared to traditional methods, potentially leading to reduced emissions and environmental impact.

Answer: Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become increasingly crucial due to its growing demand. This demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it facilitates more efficient and cost-effective production of propylene. Economically, this approach reduces production costs, enhances supply reliability, and enables the industry to meet rising market demands. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation represents a cleaner alternative compared to traditional methods, potentially contributing to reduced emissions and a minimized environmental footprint.
