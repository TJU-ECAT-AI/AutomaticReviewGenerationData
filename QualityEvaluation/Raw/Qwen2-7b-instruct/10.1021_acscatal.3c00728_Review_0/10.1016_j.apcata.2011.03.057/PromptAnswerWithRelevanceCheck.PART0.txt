Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, primarily due to its wide range of applications, including as a key feedstock for the production of plastics, rubbers, and other synthetic materials. Its demand has surpassed that of ethylene, leading to a shortage of propylene supplies from traditional steam cracking processes. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred alternative method to address the growing propylene demand. This approach offers economic advantages by providing a more flexible and potentially cost-effective method of propylene production. Additionally, environmental benefits include reduced emissions and waste compared to conventional cracking processes. The use of tin in Pt/support catalyst systems enhances stability and selectivity in olefin production, while additives like alkali metals and rare earth metals further improve catalytic performance. Zinc aluminate supports are noted for their high catalytic efficiency in paraffin dehydrogenation, contributing to the overall effectiveness of propane dehydrogenation processes.
