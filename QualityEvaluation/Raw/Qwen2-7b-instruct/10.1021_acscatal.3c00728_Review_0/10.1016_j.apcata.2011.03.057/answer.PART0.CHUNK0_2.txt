[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."
[3] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[4] "However, the stability of PtSn supported catalysts is still unsatisfactory."
[5] "To improve the catalytic stability, several promoters, including alkali metals (Li, K, Na) and rare earth metals (La, Ce), have been added to PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts."
[6] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[7] "The route for synthesizing the supports also has a strong influence on the activity and coke tolerance in paraffin dehydrogenation."
[8] "Various characterization techniques have been applied to understand the active phases in PtSn catalysts, since the catalytic performance strongly depends on the PtSn bimetallic phases."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, especially considering its versatility across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method primarily due to its ability to meet the growing needs for propene more efficiently and economically than traditional steam cracking processes. 

This approach offers several advantages:
1. **Economic Efficiency**: Propane dehydrogenation typically yields propene at a lower cost compared to steam cracking, enhancing profitability for producers.
2. **Environmental Impact**: Compared to conventional methods, propane dehydrogenation may have a smaller environmental footprint, contributing positively to sustainability efforts within the chemical industry.
3. **Resource Utilization**: This process effectively utilizes propane, a readily available resource, thus reducing reliance on oil-based feedstocks.
4. **Versatility in Product Range**: Propane dehydrogenation allows for the production of propene alongside other valuable chemicals, expanding the range of products that can be derived from propane.

In summary, the economic benefits, environmental considerations, efficient resource utilization, and expanded product range make propane dehydrogenation a preferred method for propene production, addressing the growing global demand for this essential olefin.
