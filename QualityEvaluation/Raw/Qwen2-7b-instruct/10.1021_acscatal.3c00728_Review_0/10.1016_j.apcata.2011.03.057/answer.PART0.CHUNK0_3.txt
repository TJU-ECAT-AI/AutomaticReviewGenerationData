Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to the increasing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. Its demand outpaces that of ethylene, leading to shortages in propylene supply from traditional steam cracking processes. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred method to meet the growing demand for propylene. This process offers economic advantages by producing propylene more efficiently than conventional methods, thereby reducing costs. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation can decrease reliance on fossil fuels and minimize carbon emissions, contributing positively to sustainability efforts in the chemical industry.
