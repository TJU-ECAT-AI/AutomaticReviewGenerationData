[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking."
[2] "As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."
[3] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."
[4] "Zn has been used as an additive and a support, due to its neutral characteristics, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength."
[5] "Wang et al. [11] reported that ZnO modified Pt dispersion and the interaction between the metal and support in the PtSn catalyst, resulting in high catalytic performance in terms of the stability and selectivity."
[6] "By contrast, Li et al. [19], [20] reported that a portion of the tin in PtSn/Al2O3 is Sn (0); additionally, the composition of the PtSn alloy increases with increasing Sn/Pt atomic ratios."
[7] "The role of tin is proposed to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt by forming PtSn alloys and dilution Pt sites, respectively [1] , [2] ."
[8] "The amount of coke accumulated on the PtSn/ZnAlO was slightly less than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst, and the transport of the coke from metallic sites to the support on PtSn/ZnAlO became easier than that on the PtSn/Al catalyst."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, driven by its increasing demand across various applications. The growing demand outpaces that of ethylene, leading to a shortage in propylene supply from traditional steam cracking methods. Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred alternative, offering a viable solution to meet the growing needs for propene. Economically, this approach reduces reliance on conventional cracking processes, potentially lowering costs and improving efficiency. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation might offer a cleaner alternative, depending on the feedstock and process used, as it can potentially reduce emissions compared to traditional methods. The use of tin in catalysts enhances stability and selectivity towards olefin production, while the addition of zinc improves thermal stability and mechanical strength, contributing to more efficient and effective catalyst performance. The difference in coke mobility between PtSn/ZnAlO and PtSn/Al catalysts indicates that zinc-aluminate support may facilitate easier transport of coke from metallic sites to the support, potentially enhancing the catalyst's tolerance for deactivation and improving its overall stability.
