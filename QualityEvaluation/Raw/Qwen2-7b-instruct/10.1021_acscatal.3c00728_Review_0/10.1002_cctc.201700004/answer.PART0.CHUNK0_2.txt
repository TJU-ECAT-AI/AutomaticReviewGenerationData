[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."
[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."
[3] "However, this process practically suffered from thermodynamic limitations in further prompting the reaction efficiency and also rapid catalyst deactivation by coking and catalyst sintering that required a frequent regeneration of the catalysts under harsh conditions."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2."
[5] "Under the reaction conditions, the formed electron-rich propylene reacted more easily with molecular oxygen over the metal oxide catalysts, resulting in the cleavage of the CC bond through consecutive oxygen insertion and thus forming the final product, CO2."
[6] "From a chemical point of view, an ideal catalyst should be highly selective for CH bond cleavage but not for CC bond cleavage under the oxidative dehydrogenation conditions."
[7] "As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane."
[8] "We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%)."
[9] "At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%."
[10] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide usage across various applications, leading to increased demand. Its economic and environmental advantages in production methods are evident in its more efficient use of resources and lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional processes. The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method is driven by its ability to meet the growing needs for propene while being more economically and environmentally sustainable. This process, particularly when utilizing edge-hydroxylated boron nitride as a catalyst, provides high selectivity towards propylene, reduces the formation of unwanted CO2, and maintains stability under operational conditions, making it a promising alternative for industrial production.
