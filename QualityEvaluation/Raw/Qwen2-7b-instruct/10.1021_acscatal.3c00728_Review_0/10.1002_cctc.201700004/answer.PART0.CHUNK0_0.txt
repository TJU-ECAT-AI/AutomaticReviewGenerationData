[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."
[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."
[3] "However, this process practically suffered from thermodynamic limitations in further prompting the reaction efficiency and also rapid catalyst deactivation by coking and catalyst sintering that required a frequent regeneration of the catalysts under harsh conditions."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2."
[5] "Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."
[6] "At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%."
[7] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved from its pivotal role in various applications, including the production of polymers, solvents, and monomers. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to the economic and environmental advantages. This approach offers a more efficient and less polluting alternative compared to traditional methods that involve extensive energy consumption and significant CO2 emissions. By utilizing metal-free catalysts like edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, the process achieves high selectivity for propylene production, minimizes CO2 formation, and demonstrates remarkable stability over long periods of operation, thus potentially enabling industrial-scale application with reduced environmental impact.
