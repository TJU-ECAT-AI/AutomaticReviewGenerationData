[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."
[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion."
[4] "The current BNOH catalyst provides surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C. The conversion of propane approached 20.6%, which is equivalent to a reaction rate of 7.74g gcat1h1; the product slate consisted of propylene, ethylene, methane, CO, and CO2."
[5] "The formation of CO2 (0.5%) was considerably lower than for the traditional ODH processes (1060% CO2), demonstrating the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved from its essential role as a building block for numerous polymers and solvents, contributing to the production of plastics, packaging materials, and various chemical intermediates. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to the process's economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation offers a more cost-effective alternative compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking and multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, which involve high energy consumption. Environmentally, this approach reduces CO2 emissions, aligning with the industry's sustainability goals. The BNOH catalyst, for instance, demonstrates superior selectivity for propylene production with minimal CO2 formation, showcasing the potential for this technology to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications while minimizing environmental impact.
