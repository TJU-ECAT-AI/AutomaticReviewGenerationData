[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."
[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2."
[4] "Recent, boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane."
[5] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved from being a key intermediate in the production of a wide array of products, including plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and lubricants. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic and environmental advantages. This approach is more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking and multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, which involve significant energy consumption and CO2 emissions. 

The direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as an alternative route, offering a more efficient use of resources and reducing environmental impact. This method has been commercialized by companies like UOP and ABB Lummus since the 1990s, using catalysts like platinum and chromium oxide.

However, traditional oxidative dehydrogenation processes of propane face difficulties in controlling selectivity for olefins, often resulting in substantial CO2 formation due to the overoxidation of propylene. Recent advancements have focused on improving selectivity and stability in the ODH reaction. Boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at its edges, has been found to efficiently catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering high selectivity towards propylene (up to 80.2%) with minimal CO2 formation.

The boron nitride catalyst selectively activates the CH bond in propane, promoting the desired dehydrogenation process, while simultaneously suppressing the overoxidation of propylene to CO2. This selective activation is attributed to the presence of BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride, which facilitate the cleavage of the CH bond without promoting the cleavage of the CC bond in propylene. This results in a highly selective process with reduced CO2 emissions, making it an attractive alternative for industrial applications.

丙烯在化工行业的地位已经从一种重要的轻质烯烃，它被用作一系列产品（包括塑料、合成纤维、溶剂和润滑剂）的关键中间体。随着其需求的增长，人们越来越倾向于采用丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法，这得益于其经济性和环保性优势。与传统的裂解方法和多阶段煤炭基甲醇到烯烃过程相比，这种方法更加经济和环保，因为它们消耗大量的能源并产生大量的二氧化碳排放。

直接催化丙烷脱氢到丙烯的方法已被开发出来，并于20世纪90年代由UOP和ABB Lummus商业化，使用铂和铬氧化物催化剂。

然而，传统的氧化脱氢工艺在控制烯烃选择性方面遇到困难，常常导致大量二氧化碳排放，这是由于形成的丙烯过氧化为二氧化碳。最近的研究重点是提高脱氢反应的选择性和稳定性。经过蒸汽活化的硼氮化物，在其边缘生成BOH基团，被发现能够高效催化丙烷的氧化脱氢，提供高达80.2%的丙烯选择性，同时显著减少二氧化碳排放。

硼氮化物催化剂通过在其边缘存在BOH基团来选择性地激活丙烷中的CH键，促进所需脱氢过程，同时抑制丙烯过氧化为二氧化碳。这种选择性激活的原因在于硼氮化物边缘的BOH基团促进了CH键的断裂，而不会促进丙烯中CC键的断裂。这导致了一个高度选择性的过程，二氧化碳排放量减少，使其成为工业应用的有吸引力的替代方案。
