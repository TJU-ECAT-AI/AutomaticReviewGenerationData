[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."
[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."
[3] "However, this process practically suffered from thermodynamic limitations in further prompting the reaction efficiency and also rapid catalyst deactivation by coking and catalyst sintering that required a frequent regeneration of the catalysts under harsh conditions."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route."
[5] "Unfortunately, the development of such a highly selective catalyst is still challenging."
[6] "As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved to become a critical component for the production of various plastics, solvents, and other chemicals due to its versatility and wide range of applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, offering several economic and environmental advantages. By converting propane to propylene, this approach reduces the reliance on traditional, energy-intensive methods such as catalytic cracking and multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, which are known for their high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The use of metal-free catalysts, such as edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, provides a more sustainable option that avoids the issues of coking and catalyst deactivation, leading to improved reaction efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The development of highly selective catalysts, capable of activating the CH bond in propane while suppressing the overoxidation of propylene, ensures a more efficient conversion process, ultimately enhancing the sustainability and economic viability of propene production.
