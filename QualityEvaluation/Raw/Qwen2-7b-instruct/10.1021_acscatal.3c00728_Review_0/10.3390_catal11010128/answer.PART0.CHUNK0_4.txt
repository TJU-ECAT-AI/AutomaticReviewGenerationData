[1] "Propene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others."
[2] "Despite the great potential of Pt catalysts, they suffer from deactivation [4] due to coke deposition [5]."
[3] "Our literature review in this topic indicated that the incorporation of a three-dimensional support in the catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been hardly researched."
[4] "Rising the Sn/Pt ratio on catalysts with support synthesized at 100 C (samples: 0.5-Pt-0-Sn/SBA-100, 0.5-Pt-1-Sn/SBA-100 and 0.5-Pt-2-Sn/SBA-100) increased the conversion only to a certain extent: Sn/Pt ratio from 0.00 in sample 0.5-Pt-0-Sn/SBA-100, to 3.86 in sample 0.5-Pt-1-Sn/SBA-100."
[5] "Using a nominal Sn/Pt ratio of 2, the influence of the hydrothermal treatment temperature on propane conversion was straightforward; the higher the temperature the greater the conversion."
[6] "The results of specific activity of propylene formation are presented in Figure 4A. It was considered that all Pt in the catalysts was available for the reaction to occur, i.e., 100% Pt dispersion."
[7] "For these catalysts, the production of propylene through all the experiment was effectively constant."
[8] "This behavior has already been observed in others studies [26,27,28]; those studies, however, did not provide information on the soft and hard coke contribution."
[9] "The total coke content increases drastically during the first 60 min of experimentation followed by a moderate linear increase."
[10] "In Figure 6, the amount of soft and hard coke is plotted against the TOS."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its use in producing essential chemicals such as polypropylene, acrolein, and isopropyl alcohol. Its demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Economically, this approach allows for the conversion of abundant propane resources into valuable propene, reducing dependency on synthetic alternatives. Environmentally, it offers a cleaner process compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing emissions and waste. The process is favored for its scalability and adaptability to meet the growing needs for propene in various applications, including packaging, automotive components, and pharmaceuticals.
