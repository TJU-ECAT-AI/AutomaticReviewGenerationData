[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others."
[2] "Despite the great potential of Pt catalysts, they suffer from deactivation [4] due to coke deposition [5]."
[3] "Several reports in the technical literature shed some light in the current understanding of ways of dealing with catalyst deactivation, for example, by adding a second metal to the Pt catalyst [6], using other supports rather than the typically employed Al2O3 [7], modifying the Pt particle size [8], and others [9,10]."
[4] "Our literature review in this topic indicated that the incorporation of a three-dimensional support in the catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been hardly researched."
[5] "Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved as a versatile olefin, widely used across various applications."
[6] "Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method."
[7] "This approach offers economic advantages such as higher efficiency and yield, making it more cost-effective compared to traditional methods."
[8] "Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation produces fewer emissions, contributing to cleaner production processes."
