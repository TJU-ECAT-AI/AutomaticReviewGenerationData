[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others."
[2] "For propane production via catalytic routes, some of the most effective catalytic systems are the ones containing Pt or CrOx. Pt catalysts are preferred due the higher toxicity of Cr species."
[3] "Despite the great potential of Pt catalysts, they suffer from deactivation [4] due to coke deposition [5]."
[4] "Several reports in the technical literature shed some light in the current understanding of ways of dealing with catalyst deactivation, for example, by adding a second metal to the Pt catalyst [6], using other supports rather than the typically employed Al2O3 [7], modifying the Pt particle size [8], and others [9,10]."
[5] "The incorporation of a highly connected support is a less commonly implemented methodology to address coke deposits and the subsequent catalyst deactivation [11,12]."
[6] "Highly ordered mesoporous materials with a three-dimensional porous structure [13], similar to KIT-6 and SBA-16, can be incorporated as support in the catalyst yielding good dispersion of the active phase during catalyst synthesis thereby enhancing diffusion of both, species involved in the main reaction and the coke precursor species."
[7] "A catalyst containing a three-dimensional material as support reduces catalyst deactivation by coke deposits more than a catalyst synthesized with a two-dimensional porous structure (SBA-15 and MCM-41)."
[8] "Literature reports have demonstrated advantages of using a more pore-connected support in various reactions where catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by coke deposition [14,15]."
[9] "Our literature review in this topic indicated that the incorporation of a three-dimensional support in the catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been hardly researched."
[10] "Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown considerably, serving as a crucial raw material for the synthesis of polypropylene, acrolein, isopropyl alcohol, and other essential chemicals. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to the abundance of propane in natural gas and the discovery of shale gas resources. This approach offers economic benefits by utilizing readily available feedstocks and environmental advantages by potentially reducing the reliance on petroleum-based sources for propene production.

[8] "In contrast, using a nominal Sn/Pt ratio of 2, the influence of the hydrothermal treatment temperature on propane conversion was straightforward; the higher the temperature the greater the conversion."
[9] "For these catalysts, the production of propylene through all the experiment was effectively constant."
[10] "The information of TGA results is summarized in Table 2."
[11] "The amount of soft and hard coke is plotted against the TOS over the 0.5-Pt-1-Sn/SBA-100 catalysts without considering the weight loss of the reduced sample."
[12] "The G band position shifted from 1605 to 1600 cm1, this implies that the crystal size of the coke increased [38]."
[13] "Although there were more coke deposits on the catalyst, this deposits were located on the support as deduced by TGA, therefore, having no influence on the performance of the catalyst."
[14] "The conversion to propane with the 0.5-Pt-1-Sn/SBA-100 catalyst had a sudden drop of conversion within the first 60 min of reaction (Figure 2) and then it was practically maintained constant."
[15] "The specific activity of this catalyst toward propylene formation was maintained during the whole experimentation time and displayed one of the highest values reported so far in the literature."

1. Propene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry, serving as a key raw material in the production of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrolein, and isopropyl alcohol. Its widespread use and increasing demand have driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages, including efficient utilization of abundant propane resources, reduced energy consumption, and minimized environmental impact through cleaner production processes. 

2. The literature suggests that the incorporation of a three-dimensional support in catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an underexplored area. This approach could potentially enhance the efficiency of the process by reducing catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition. By using more pore-connected supports, the likelihood of coke buildup being confined to the support rather than the active sites of the catalyst is increased, thus preserving the catalyst's performance and productivity.

2. 文献表明，在催化裂解丙烷生成丙烯的过程中使用三维支撑体的催化剂是一个尚未充分研究的领域。这种方法可能通过减少导致催化剂失活的焦炭沉积，从而提高过程效率。使用更孔连通的支撑体可以增加焦炭积聚的可能性被限制在支撑体上而不是催化剂的活性位点，从而保持催化剂的性能和生产力。

[5] "Using a nominal Sn/Pt ratio of 2, the influence of the hydrothermal treatment temperature on propane conversion was straightforward; the higher the temperature the greater the conversion."
