[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others."
[2] "For propane production via catalytic routes, some of the most effective catalytic systems are the ones containing Pt or CrOx. Pt catalysts are preferred due the higher toxicity of Cr species."
[3] "Despite the great potential of Pt catalysts, they suffer from deactivation [4] due to coke deposition [5]."
[4] "Several reports in the technical literature shed some light in the current understanding of ways of dealing with catalyst deactivation, for example, by adding a second metal to the Pt catalyst [6], using other supports rather than the typically employed Al2O3 [7], modifying the Pt particle size [8], and others [9,10]."
[5] "The incorporation of a highly connected support is a less commonly implemented methodology to address coke deposits and the subsequent catalyst deactivation [11,12]."
[6] "Highly ordered mesoporous materials with a three-dimensional porous structure [13], similar to KIT-6 and SBA-16, can be incorporated as support in the catalyst yielding good dispersion of the active phase during catalyst synthesis thereby enhancing diffusion of both, species involved in the main reaction and the coke precursor species."
[7] "A catalyst containing a three-dimensional material as support reduces catalyst deactivation by coke deposits more than a catalyst synthesized with a two-dimensional porous structure (SBA-15 and MCM-41)."
[8] "Literature reports have demonstrated advantages of using a more pore-connected support in various reactions where catalyst deactivation is mainly caused by coke deposition [14,15]."
[9] "Our literature review in this topic indicated that the incorporation of a three-dimensional support in the catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been hardly researched."
[10] "Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications."
