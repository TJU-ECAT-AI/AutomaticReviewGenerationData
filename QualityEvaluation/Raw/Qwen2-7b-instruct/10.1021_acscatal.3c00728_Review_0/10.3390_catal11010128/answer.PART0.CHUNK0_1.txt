[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others."
[2] "Despite the great potential of Pt catalysts, they suffer from deactivation due to coke deposition."
[3] "Several reports in the technical literature shed some light in the current understanding of ways of dealing with catalyst deactivation, for example, by adding a second metal to the Pt catalyst."
[4] "For propane production via catalytic routes, some of the most effective catalytic systems are the ones containing Pt or CrOx. Pt catalysts are preferred due to the higher toxicity of Cr species."
[5] "In this study, a series of Pt-Sn catalysts containing mesoporous silica SBA-16 as support were designed, successfully synthesized and their performance during the dehydrogenation of propane yielding propylene was evaluated."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown considerably, serving as a crucial raw material for the synthesis of polypropylene, acrolein, isopropyl alcohol, and other essential chemicals. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to the abundance of propane in natural gas and the discovery of shale gas resources. This approach offers economic benefits by utilizing readily available feedstocks and environmental advantages by potentially reducing the reliance on petroleum-based sources for propene production.
