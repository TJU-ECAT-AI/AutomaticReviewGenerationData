[1] "During the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[3] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[5] "Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[6] "A combination of UVVis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor the state of the catalyst during its lifetime would provide a much better insight in the catalyst health and allow making other choices based on this information to keep the process running most efficiently."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly over the last decade, surpassing the supply capabilities of traditional sources such as ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The economic advantages of this approach include higher efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to conventional methods. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers a cleaner alternative, potentially reducing emissions associated with traditional propene production processes. The Catofin process, utilizing chromium oxide on alumina catalysts, is one of the available propane dehydrogenation methods. Its cyclic operation in multiple reactors allows for continuous production, maintaining the process efficiency and output. However, the current cycle times are based on historical data, suggesting room for optimization. Implementing real-time monitoring techniques like UVVis and Raman spectroscopy can enhance process control, enabling adjustments that improve efficiency and extend catalyst life, thus keeping the process running optimally.
