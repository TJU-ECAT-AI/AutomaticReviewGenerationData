<quotes>
[1] "During the past decade, the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[6] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane dehydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[7] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[8] "Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[9] "During the lifetime of the catalyst (typically 2 years), the reaction temperature is gradually increased to maintain the desired conversion level."
[10] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[11] "Adjustments to the cycle times, pressure, temperature and feedrates can be made."
[12] "UVVis spectroscopy is a good method to track the oxidation state of the catalyst and thereby see the chromium go through its redox cycle."
[13] "Chromium oxide is slowly lost' during the catalyst life as a result of migration of chromium into the alumina support, which can also be monitored excellently using UVVis spectroscopy."
[14] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the different types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst."
[15] "Both techniques can be applied easily in Operando (under realistic reaction conditions), since they both are non-contact techniques and can be done using optical fibers with the measuring electronics a safe distance away from the reactor."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased, surpassing the supply capabilities of traditional methods like ethane steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC). This surge in demand has driven the exploration of alternative production methods, including the dehydrogenation of propane. The Catofin process, offered by ABB Lummus, utilizes five cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst. The process operates at temperatures around 850 K and subatmospheric pressures of 0.20.5 bar. Each reactor completes a cycle consisting of 12 minutes of propane dehydrogenation, 3 minutes of purge/evacuation, 12 minutes of catalyst regeneration with air, and an optional 3-minute purge/evacuation followed by catalyst reduction. The catalyst activity fluctuates during the cycle due to coke formation and chromium reduction. Currently, cycle times are fixed based on historical data, but adjustments to temperature, pressure, and feedrates can improve efficiency. UVVis spectroscopy tracks catalyst oxidation states and chromium redox cycles, while Raman spectroscopy monitors coke types and deposition. Both techniques enable real-time monitoring, facilitating process control and optimization.

过去十年，丙烯的需求显著增加，超过了传统方法如乙烷蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解（FCC）的供应能力。这一需求的增长推动了生产方法的探索，包括丙烷脱氢。ABB Lummus提供的Catofin过程使用五个循环操作的反应器，其中包含氧化铬在氧化铝催化剂上。该过程在约850K的温度和亚大气压下0.20.5巴运行。每个反应器完成一个循环，包括12分钟的丙烷脱氢、3分钟的抽真空/排空、12分钟的空气再生催化剂、以及可选的3分钟抽真空/排空后进行催化剂还原。催化剂活性在循环中由于焦炭形成和铬的还原而波动。目前，循环时间基于历史数据固定，但可以通过调整温度、压力和进料速率来提高效率。紫外可见光谱跟踪催化剂的氧化状态和铬的氧化还原周期，而拉曼光谱监测焦炭类型和沉积。这两种技术均能实现在线监控，有助于过程控制和优化。

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly over the last decade, surpassing the supply capabilities of traditional methods like ethane steam crackers and FCCs. This has led to an increased interest in propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The economic advantages include the ability to meet the growing demand for propene across various applications. Environmentally, this approach allows for more efficient and flexible production processes, potentially reducing emissions and waste compared to traditional methods. The Catofin process, for instance, utilizes a series of reactors containing chromium oxide on alumina catalysts, which are cycled through dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge phases to maintain efficiency. The use of spectroscopy, particularly UVVis and Raman, offers a direct method to monitor catalyst health in real-time, allowing for adjustments to process parameters such as cycle times, pressure, temperature, and feedrates to optimize performance. The focus on coke as a function of the bed height highlights its critical role in catalytic activity, with small amounts improving activity but exceeding a threshold that leads to deactivation. By tracking coke content, process control decisions can be made to extend cycle times if the catalyst remains active longer or reduce them if coke accumulation is causing excessive heat during regeneration.

在过去的十年里，丙烯的需求显著增加，超过了传统方法如乙烷蒸汽裂解和FCC（流化床催化裂解）提供的数量。这导致了对丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的兴趣增加。经济优势包括能够满足丙烯在各种应用中的不断增长的需求。从环境角度来看，这种方法允许更高效、更灵活的生产过程，可能与传统方法相比减少排放和废物。Catofin工艺就是一个例子，它利用一系列包含铬氧化物在氧化铝催化剂的反应器进行循环操作：脱氢、再生和净化，以维持效率。使用光谱学，特别是紫外可见光和拉曼光谱，提供了一种直接方法来实时监控催化剂的状态，允许对过程参数如循环时间、压力、温度和进料速率进行调整以优化性能。关注焦炭在床高中的作用强调了其在催化剂活性中的关键角色，少量焦炭可以提高活性，但超过一定阈值会导致失活。通过跟踪焦炭含量，可以做出控制决策，如果催化剂保持活跃状态更长，则延长循环时间，或者如果焦炭积累导致再生过程中产生过多热量，则缩短循环时间。
