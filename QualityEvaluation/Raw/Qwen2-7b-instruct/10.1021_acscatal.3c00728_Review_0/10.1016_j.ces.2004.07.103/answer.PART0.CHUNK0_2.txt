[1] "During the past decade, the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "Currently, the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[6] "During the lifetime of the catalyst (typically 2 years), the reaction temperature is gradually increased to maintain the desired conversion level."
[7] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[8] "A combination of UVVis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor the state of the catalyst during its lifetime would provide a much better insight in the catalyst health and allow making other choices based on this information to keep the process running most efficiently."
[9] "This is done for a chromium on alumina catalyst similar to that being used commercially, the primary focus being on the role of coke as a function of the bed height."
[10] "During the dehydrogenation cycle, the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly over the last decade, surpassing the supply capabilities of traditional methods like ethane steam crackers and FCCs. This has led to an increased interest in propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The economic advantages include the ability to meet the growing demand for propene across various applications. Environmentally, this approach allows for more efficient and flexible production processes, potentially reducing emissions and waste compared to traditional methods. The Catofin process, for instance, utilizes a series of reactors containing chromium oxide on alumina catalysts, which are cycled through dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge phases to maintain efficiency. The use of spectroscopy, particularly UVVis and Raman, offers a direct method to monitor catalyst health in real-time, allowing for adjustments to process parameters such as cycle times, pressure, temperature, and feedrates to optimize performance. The focus on coke as a function of the bed height highlights its critical role in catalytic activity, with small amounts improving activity but exceeding a threshold that leads to deactivation. By tracking coke content, process control decisions can be made to extend cycle times if the catalyst remains active longer or reduce them if coke accumulation is causing excessive heat during regeneration.

在过去的十年里，丙烯的需求显著增加，超过了传统方法如乙烷蒸汽裂解和FCC（流化床催化裂解）提供的数量。这导致了对丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的兴趣增加。经济优势包括能够满足丙烯在各种应用中的不断增长的需求。从环境角度来看，这种方法允许更高效、更灵活的生产过程，可能与传统方法相比减少排放和废物。Catofin工艺就是一个例子，它利用一系列包含铬氧化物在氧化铝催化剂的反应器进行循环操作：脱氢、再生和净化，以维持效率。使用光谱学，特别是紫外可见光和拉曼光谱，提供了一种直接方法来实时监控催化剂的状态，允许对过程参数如循环时间、压力、温度和进料速率进行调整以优化性能。关注焦炭在床高中的作用强调了其在催化剂活性中的关键角色，少量焦炭可以提高活性，但超过一定阈值会导致失活。通过跟踪焦炭含量，可以做出控制决策，如果催化剂保持活跃状态更长，则延长循环时间，或者如果焦炭积累导致再生过程中产生过多热量，则缩短循环时间。
