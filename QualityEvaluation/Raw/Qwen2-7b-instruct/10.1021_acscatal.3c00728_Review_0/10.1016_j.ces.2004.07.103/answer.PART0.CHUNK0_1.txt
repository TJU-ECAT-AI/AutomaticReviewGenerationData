[1] "During the past decade, the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "Currently, the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[6] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[7] "A combination of UVVis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor the state of the catalyst during its lifetime would provide a much better insight in the catalyst health and allow making other choices based on this information to keep the process running most efficiently."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly due to its increasing demand. This demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications. Economically, this approach offers several advantages, including higher yield and lower costs compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation can lead to cleaner processes, as it typically requires less energy and produces fewer emissions than alternative methods. The ability to monitor the state of the catalyst in real-time using UVVis and Raman spectroscopy allows for more efficient control of the process, potentially extending cycle times and reducing waste.
