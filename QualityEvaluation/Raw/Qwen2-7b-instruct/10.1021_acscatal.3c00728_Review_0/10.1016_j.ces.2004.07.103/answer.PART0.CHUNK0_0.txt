[1] "During the past decade, the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[6] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane dehydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[7] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[8] "Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[9] "During the lifetime of the catalyst (typically 2 years), the reaction temperature is gradually increased to maintain the desired conversion level."
[10] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[11] "Adjustments to the cycle times, pressure, temperature and feedrates can be made."
[12] "UVVis spectroscopy is a good method to track the oxidation state of the catalyst and thereby see the chromium go through its redox cycle."
[13] "Chromium oxide is slowly lost' during the catalyst life as a result of migration of chromium into the alumina support, which can also be monitored excellently using UVVis spectroscopy."
[14] "Raman spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the different types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst."
[15] "Both techniques can be applied easily in Operando (under realistic reaction conditions), since they both are non-contact techniques and can be done using optical fibers with the measuring electronics a safe distance away from the reactor."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased, surpassing the supply capabilities of traditional methods like ethane steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC). This surge in demand has driven the exploration of alternative production methods, including the dehydrogenation of propane. The Catofin process, offered by ABB Lummus, utilizes five cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst. The process operates at temperatures around 850 K and subatmospheric pressures of 0.20.5 bar. Each reactor completes a cycle consisting of 12 minutes of propane dehydrogenation, 3 minutes of purge/evacuation, 12 minutes of catalyst regeneration with air, and an optional 3-minute purge/evacuation followed by catalyst reduction. The catalyst activity fluctuates during the cycle due to coke formation and chromium reduction. Currently, cycle times are fixed based on historical data, but adjustments to temperature, pressure, and feedrates can improve efficiency. UVVis spectroscopy tracks catalyst oxidation states and chromium redox cycles, while Raman spectroscopy monitors coke types and deposition. Both techniques enable real-time monitoring, facilitating process control and optimization.

过去十年，丙烯的需求显著增加，超过了传统方法如乙烷蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解（FCC）的供应能力。这一需求的增长推动了生产方法的探索，包括丙烷脱氢。ABB Lummus提供的Catofin过程使用五个循环操作的反应器，其中包含氧化铬在氧化铝催化剂上。该过程在约850K的温度和亚大气压下0.20.5巴运行。每个反应器完成一个循环，包括12分钟的丙烷脱氢、3分钟的抽真空/排空、12分钟的空气再生催化剂、以及可选的3分钟抽真空/排空后进行催化剂还原。催化剂活性在循环中由于焦炭形成和铬的还原而波动。目前，循环时间基于历史数据固定，但可以通过调整温度、压力和进料速率来提高效率。紫外可见光谱跟踪催化剂的氧化状态和铬的氧化还原周期，而拉曼光谱监测焦炭类型和沉积。这两种技术均能实现在线监控，有助于过程控制和优化。
