[1] "During the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)."
[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."
[3] "One of the propane dehydrogenation processes available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus)."
[4] "A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina catalyst."
[5] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."
[6] "Each reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane dehydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally followed by a catalyst reduction."
[7] "Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed and based on past experience."
[8] "Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of the catalyst during the process."
[9] "Adjustments to the cycle times, pressure, temperature and feedrates can be made."
[10] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
[11] "In the regeneration cycle the coke is combusted and the chromium is reoxidized."
[12] "The catalyst is reheated by the heat of combustion of the coke and usually the combustion of a small amount of natural gas added to the regeneration air, in this way providing the heat required for the endothermal dehydrogenation reaction."
[13] "As a result of the growing demand for propene and the inefficiency of traditional production methods, the dehydrogenation of propane offers a more attractive solution for supplying propene to meet market needs."
[14] "This process allows for the conversion of propane into propene, which is essential for various applications across industries."
[15] "Economic advantages include the ability to produce propene more efficiently and cost-effectively, reducing dependency on conventional sources and potentially lowering production costs."
[16] "Environmental advantages are associated with minimizing waste and reducing emissions, as well as the potential for recycling resources."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown considerably, surpassing the supply capabilities of traditional methods like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach is economically advantageous because it enables the efficient and cost-effective conversion of propane into propene, which is essential for various applications across industries. It reduces dependency on conventional sources and may lead to lower production costs. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers benefits by minimizing waste and emissions, and potentially facilitating resource recycling.
