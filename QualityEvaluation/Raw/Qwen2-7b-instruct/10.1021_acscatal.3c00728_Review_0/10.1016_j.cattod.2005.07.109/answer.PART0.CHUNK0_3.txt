[1] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand."
[2] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."
[3] "It is well known that increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. Likewise, propylene production may be increased by using olefins selective catalysts or by incorporating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system. Yet another emerging option to increase propylene yield is by reprocessing FCC naphtha."
[4] "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading."
[5] "Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units."
[6] "The simplest option for naphtha processing in the FCCU is to add it directly to gas oil feed."
[7] "Experimental results, however, showed that under this scheme and even with a catalyst system containing ZSM-5 zeolite, naphtha conversion was low."
[8] "This may be due to the higher adsorption ability of the gas oil molecules and polynuclear aromatic products."
[9] "Thus, in order to effectively crack naphtha, it must be fed at a different location than gas oil in order to avoid competing effects."
[10] "The amount of coke deposited in the catalyst is typical of an industrial operation."
[11] "Conversion is defined as the sum of dry gas, LPG and coke when cracking naphtha."
[12] "The balance between mono- and bimolecular mechanism will depend on the surface coverage by carbenium ion."
[13] "Notice that site density may be decreased either by dealumination (irreversible) or coking (reversible) of the catalyst."
[14] "On the other hand, a small pore size will favour the monomolecular mechanism since the bimolecular reaction intermediary cannot be formed in narrow pores."
[15] "This second step can lead to a paraffin together with a more dehydrogenated carbenium ion (hydrogen transfer) or form a C10C14 carbenium ion that can then cycle and lead after cracking and dehydrogenation to a C7C11 aromatic and a corresponding amount of hydrogen or paraffins (dimerization-cracking)."
[16] "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
[17] "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
[18] "Then, the balance between hydrogen-transfer reactions and cracking reactions will be critical in orienting the selectivity of olefins and naphthenes conversion towards either propylene or gasoline-range aromatics and paraffins."

1. Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, with demand increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, global production stood at approximately 52 million tonnes, and projections indicate that by 2010, demand will surge to 84 million tonnes, driven by the rising demand for polypropylene. Currently, 70% of global propylene production comes from steam crackers, 28% from FCC units, and 2% from specific on-purpose processes like propane dehydrogenation.

2. Increasing process severity enhances propylene production in FCC units. Additionally, propylene yield can be augmented by employing olefins-selective catalysts or integrating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system. Another innovative approach is reprocessing FCC naphtha, which transforms naphtha-range olefins into LPG olefins, simultaneously reducing olefin content in FCC naphtha, thus facilitating downstream processing.

3. Propane dehydrogenation emerges as a preferred production method due to its economic and environmental advantages. This process meets the growing demand for versatile olefin across various applications more efficiently than traditional methods. 

Answer: Propylene's demand in the chemical industry has escalated significantly, with a 5.7% annual growth rate since 1990. By 2000, global production reached 52 million tonnes, projected to soar to 84 million tonnes by 2010, fueled by polypropylene demand. Currently, 70% of propylene production stems from steam crackers, 28% from FCC units, and 2% from on-purpose processes including propane dehydrogenation. Increasing process severity boosts propylene production in FCC units, and olefins-selective catalysts or ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives enhance yield. Reprocessing FCC naphtha transforms olefins into LPG olefins, reducing olefin content in FCC naphtha, facilitating downstream processing. Propane dehydrogenation stands out as an advantageous production method due to its economic and environmental benefits, efficiently catering to growing olefin demand across diverse applications.

1. 自1990年以来，丙烯在化工行业的地位显著提升，年均增长率为5.7%。到2000年，全球产量约为5200万吨，预计到2010年需求将激增至8400万吨，这主要得益于聚丙烯需求的增长。目前，全球约有70%的丙烯生产来自蒸汽裂解装置，28%来自流化催化裂化（FCC）单元，另有2%来自特定的专用过程，如丙烷脱氢、互变异构等。

2. 提高工艺严重程度可以显著增加FCC单元中的丙烯产量。同样地，通过使用烯烃选择性催化剂或在催化系统中加入ZSM-5沸石基添加剂，丙烯产量也可以增加。另一种新兴的方法是再处理FCC焦油，该方法可将焦油范围内的烯烃转化为液化石油气（LPG）烯烃，同时减少FCC焦油中的烯烃含量，从而有利于下游升级。

3. 由于经济和环境优势明显，丙烷脱氢成为首选的生产方法。这一过程能够更有效地满足各种应用领域对这种多用途烯烃日益增长的需求，相比传统方法更为高效。
