1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown steadily, with its demand increasing at an average rate of 5.7% annually since 1990. By 2000, global production reached approximately 52 million tonnes, and projections estimate a demand of 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by the increasing need for polypropylene. However, on-purpose propene production capacity is only set to quadruple over the next five years, which will still not meet the entire demand. Therefore, other production methods need to be developed.

2. Increasing the severity of the process in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) units can significantly boost propylene production. Similarly, enhancing propylene output can be achieved by using olefin-selective catalysts or integrating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system.

3. The traditional approach for processing naphtha in the FCC unit involves adding it directly to the gas oil feed. However, experimental outcomes revealed that under this method, even with a catalyst system containing ZSM-5 zeolite, the conversion rate was low.

4. To explore the potential of increasing propylene yield through recycling FCC naphtha, several options were tested using a transported bed MicroDowner (MD) reactor and a fixed bed (MAT) reactor.

5. Light FCC naphtha was favored over whole FCC naphtha for processing because it contains a higher concentration of olefins, which are the most reactive and selective components for propylene production, making this alternative more cost-effective.

6. The different proposed cracking schemes offer refiners a variety of choices for enhancing propylene production based on their available capital and market economics.

7. The average propylene yield from the proposed cracking schemes was approximately 70 wt.%, and for propylene specifically, it was 35 wt.%

1. 自1990年以来，丙烯的市场需求每年平均增长率为5.7%，到2000年全球产量约为5200万吨，并预测到2010年需求将增长至8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。然而，专用于生产丙烯的产能仅在接下来的五年内翻四倍，这仍然不足以满足整个需求。因此，需要开发其他生产方法。

2. 提高流化催化裂化（FCC）单元的工艺强度可以显著增加丙烯产量。同样，通过使用选择性烯烃催化剂或整合ZSM-5沸石基添加剂到催化剂系统中，也可以提高丙烯产量。

3. 将传统上在FCC单元中处理轻质裂化油的方法直接添加到汽油油中。然而，实验结果表明，在这种方法下，即使在含有ZSM-5沸石的催化剂系统中，转化率也较低。

4. 为了评估循环再利用FCC裂化油以提高丙烯产量的潜力，使用运输床微动器（MD）反应器和固定床（MAT）反应器进行了几种选项的测试。

5. 由于轻质裂化油中富含的烯烃是产生丙烯的最活跃和选择性最高的成分，因此，与处理全裂化油相比，从成本效益的角度来看，处理轻质裂化油更为有利。

6. 不同提出的裂解方案为炼油商提供了根据可用资本和现货市场经济选择增加丙烯产量的多种选择。

7. 提议的裂解方案的平均丙烯产率约为70 wt.%，对于丙烯而言，则为35 wt.%。
