1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown steadily, with its demand increasing at an average rate of 5.7% annually since 1990. By 2000, global production reached approximately 52 million tonnes, and projections estimate a demand of 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by the increasing need for polypropylene. However, on-purpose propene production capacity is only set to quadruple over the next five years, which will still not meet the entire demand. Therefore, other production methods need to be developed.

2. Increasing the severity of the process in Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) units can significantly boost propylene production. Similarly, enhancing propylene output can be achieved by using olefin-selective catalysts or integrating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system.

3. The traditional approach for processing naphtha in the FCC unit involves adding it directly to the gas oil feed. However, experimental outcomes revealed that under this method, even with a catalyst system containing ZSM-5 zeolite, the conversion rate was low.

4. To explore the potential of increasing propylene yield through recycling FCC naphtha, several options were tested using a transported bed MicroDowner (MD) reactor and a fixed bed (MAT) reactor.

5. Light FCC naphtha was favored over whole FCC naphtha for processing because it contains a higher concentration of olefins, which are the most reactive and selective components for propylene production, making this alternative more cost-effective.

6. The different proposed cracking schemes offer refiners a variety of choices for enhancing propylene production based on their available capital and market economics.

7. The average propylene yield from the proposed cracking schemes was approximately 70 wt.%, and for propylene specifically, it was 35 wt.%

1. 自1990年以来，丙烯的市场需求每年平均增长率为5.7%，到2000年全球产量约为5200万吨，并预测到2010年需求将增长至8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。然而，专用于生产丙烯的产能仅在接下来的五年内翻四倍，这仍然不足以满足整个需求。因此，需要开发其他生产方法。

2. 提高流化催化裂化（FCC）单元的工艺强度可以显著增加丙烯产量。同样，通过使用选择性烯烃催化剂或整合ZSM-5沸石基添加剂到催化剂系统中，也可以提高丙烯产量。

3. 将传统上在FCC单元中处理轻质裂化油的方法直接添加到汽油油中。然而，实验结果表明，在这种方法下，即使在含有ZSM-5沸石的催化剂系统中，转化率也较低。

4. 为了评估循环再利用FCC裂化油以提高丙烯产量的潜力，使用运输床微动器（MD）反应器和固定床（MAT）反应器进行了几种选项的测试。

5. 由于轻质裂化油中富含的烯烃是产生丙烯的最活跃和选择性最高的成分，因此，与处理全裂化油相比，从成本效益的角度来看，处理轻质裂化油更为有利。

6. 不同提出的裂解方案为炼油商提供了根据可用资本和现货市场经济选择增加丙烯产量的多种选择。

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown steadily over time, reflecting the increasing demand for its versatile use in the production of polymers, resins, solvents, and various other chemicals. Its demand has escalated at an annual average rate of 5.7% since 1990, with projections indicating that by 2010, the demand for propene will reach 84 million tonnes, primarily driven by the growing demand for polypropylene. Traditionally, propene is predominantly produced through steam cracking methods, accounting for about 70% of global production. However, due to the projected growth in demand and the limitations of on-purpose processes like propane dehydrogenation, which can only meet a small portion of the demand, there is a need to explore alternative production methods. Considering the vast installed capacity of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units globally, particularly their flexibility to shift operations towards the production of LPG olefins, recycling FCC naphtha has emerged as a promising alternative to meet the growing demand for propene. This method not only increases propene production but also reduces the olefin content in the FCC naphtha, thereby facilitating downstream upgrading processes. To effectively utilize naphtha, it must be processed at distinct locations from gas oil to prevent competition and enhance its conversion efficiency. Various options for naphtha recycling, including processing at the bottom of the riser, in a parallel riser, in the stripper, or in a separate process with a shape-selective catalyst, have been evaluated for their potential to boost propene yield. These options offer refiners a range of strategies to increase propene production based on their financial resources and market conditions.

丙烯在化工行业的地位逐年提升，反映了其在聚合物、树脂、溶剂等各类化学品生产中的广泛应用。自1990年以来，其需求以每年平均5.7%的速度增长，预计到2010年，全球对丙烯的需求将增加至8400万吨，主要驱动力是聚丙烯需求的增长。传统上，丙烯主要通过蒸汽裂解方法生产，占全球产量的约70%。然而，鉴于未来需求的增长和特定于目的过程（如丙烷脱氢）仅能满足一小部分需求的限制，探索替代生产方法变得必要。考虑到全球流化床催化裂化（FCC）装置的巨大安装容量，尤其是它们转向生产液化石油气（LPG）烯烃的能力，回收FCC石脑油已作为满足丙烯日益增长需求的有前景选择。这种方法不仅增加了丙烯产量，而且降低了FCC石脑油中的烯烃含量，从而有利于下游升级过程。为了有效地利用石脑油，必须在与汽油油料不同位置进行处理，以防止竞争并提高其转化效率。通过在运输床微达纳（MD）反应器或固定床（MAT）反应器中评估底座裂化、平行裂化、在蒸馏塔中裂化或使用形状选择性催化剂的单独过程等多种石脑油回收选项，以提升丙烯产量。这些选项为炼油商提供了基于其财务资源和市场条件的不同策略来增加丙烯生产量。

[4] "It is expected that in order to cover the future demand, the propylene market share from other processes than steam cracking will importantly grow, since it is forecast that propylene market will grow faster than ethylene market."
[5] "Yet another emerging option to increase propylene yield is by reprocessing FCC naphtha."
[6] "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading."

[9] "Results of light FCC naphtha cracking have shown that selectivity towards propylene is governed by hydrogen-transfer reactions."
[10] "Thus, the selectivity to propylene may be increased by minimizing these reactions."
[11] "This can be achieved by cracking the naphtha at high temperature, by using shape-selective catalysts or by working with coked catalysts."
[12] "Recycling light naphtha in the FCC process is an interesting alternative, which may increase the yield of propylene by 50% if proper processing is carried out."
[13] "Furthermore, olefins content of FCC gasoline may be significantly reduced."
[14] "It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry."
[15] "The balance between mono- and bimolecular mechanism will depend on the surface coverage by carbenium ion."
[16] "Notice that site density may be decreased either by dealumination (irreversible) or coking (reversible) of the catalyst."
[17] "On the other hand, a small pore size will favour the monomolecular mechanism since the bimolecular reaction intermediary cannot be formed in narrow pores, which was observed with the conversion of C5C9 olefins on ZSM5 zeolite."
[18] "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
[19] "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
[20] "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
[21] "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
[22] "Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins."
[23] "Then, the balance between hydrogen-transfer reactions and cracking reactions will be critical in orienting the selectivity of olefins and naphthenes conversion towards either propylene or gasoline-range aromatics and paraffins."
[24] "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
[25] "In this case, the operating conditions may be varied in a wide range, as they do not depend on FCC process constraints due to simultaneous cracking of gas oil."
[26] "Despite the high content of olefins in the feedstock, coke yield is extremely low."
[27] "An additional benefit would be the reduction of more than 50% olefins in the resulting FCC naphtha, whose content would be of only 12 wt.%."
[28] "The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking, which was about 80% higher than the base case, making necessary to increase the gas compressor capacity."
[29] "Although LCN conversion to gas and coke resulted smaller because of the lower reaction severity, gasoline-range olefins conversion is only a little bit smaller than in the previous option, resulting in the same interesting reduction of olefins in the gasoline."
[30] "Thus, this would be the preferred option if the main goal were to upgrade FCC naphtha quality with an appreciable propylene and butylenes production as a collateral benefit."
[31] "This option offers the highest selectivity to propylene and butenes with a slightly lower dry gas generation than the best former option for propylene production (bottom of the riser cracking option)."
[32] "Nevertheless, this option is subjected to a carefully economic evaluation because of the huge inversion and the fact that most of the heat required by the process should be generated independently, since the coke make is very low and an autothermal operation like FCC operation would not be possible."
[33] "In all the processing options considered, the aromatic content of total gasoline is significantly increased, because of the concentration of the heavy gasoline-range aromatics in the total gasoline, resulting in an octane increase of the gasoline."
[34] "The highest octane gain will be with the most severe process, as the concentration effect is the highest due to the highest LCN conversion."
[35] "In contrast, LCN processing in the stripper also significantly increases propylene production without requiring major modifications on the unit, having the advantage of producing only small quantities of additional dry gas and significantly lowering olefin content of cracked naphtha."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, with its demand increasing annually at a rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production reached approximately 52 million tonnes, and projections indicate that by 2010, the demand will soar to 84 million tonnes, largely driven by the rising demand for polypropylene. To meet this growing demand, the market share of propylene produced through methods other than steam cracking is expected to increase notably, given that the propylene market is anticipated to expand faster than the ethylene market. Propane dehydrogenation emerges as a preferred production method, offering economic and environmental advantages in meeting the needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

2. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propene. This process offers several economic and environmental benefits. Economically, propane dehydrogenation provides a competitive alternative to traditional steam cracking methods, offering potentially lower costs and improved efficiency. Environmentally, this method reduces the carbon footprint associated with propene production, as propane is a cleaner feedstock compared to naphtha or other conventional crude oil fractions. Additionally, propane dehydrogenation can help reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, promoting sustainability and energy security. The process also facilitates the production of high-purity propene, which is crucial for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, and various chemical intermediates, further enhancing its utility in the chemical industry.

3. Propane dehydrogenation offers several advantages over traditional steam cracking methods in producing propene. Firstly, it utilizes a cleaner feedstock, propane, which emits fewer pollutants during the cracking process compared to naphtha or other crude oil fractions. Secondly, propane dehydrogenation typically results in a higher purity of propene, reducing the need for post-processing purification steps. Thirdly, the process often consumes less energy, as propane is generally more energy-efficient to transport and process compared to heavier hydrocarbons like naphtha. Lastly, propane dehydrogenation can be integrated into existing infrastructure, leveraging existing pipelines and storage facilities, thereby reducing the capital investment required for new plants. These factors collectively contribute to the economic viability and environmental sustainability of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for propene production.

[11] "The highest octane gain will be with the most severe process, as the concentration effect is the highest due to the highest LCN conversion."
[12] "It is worth to mention that in all cases LCN naphtha is converted with higher selectivity to LPG olefins than could do a steam cracking operation, being the average value around 70 wt.%, and it is 35 wt.% for propylene."
