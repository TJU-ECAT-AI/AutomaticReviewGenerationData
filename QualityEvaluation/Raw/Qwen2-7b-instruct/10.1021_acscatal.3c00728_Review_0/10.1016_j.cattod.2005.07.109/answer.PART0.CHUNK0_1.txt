[1] "Propylene is the key building block for the production of important petrochemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropylic alcohol and many others."
[2] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand."
[3] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."
[4] "Although capacity of propylene on-purpose processes is going to be quadrupled in the next 5 years, it will still cover only a small part of the propylene demand, and other sources have to be developed."
[5] "Thus, considering the worldwide FCC installed capacity (14 million barrels/day) and the already proven flexibility of the process to shift operation mode towards LPG olefins production, this process appears to be a sensible alternative that may contribute to satisfy the growing demand of this petrochemical."
[6] "Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units. Likewise, propylene production may be increased by using olefins selective catalysts or by incorporating ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives into the catalytic system."
[7] "Another emerging option to increase propylene yield is by reprocessing FCC naphtha. With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading."
[8] "The simplest option for naphtha processing in the FCCU is to add it directly to gas oil feed."
[9] "Experimental results, however, showed that under this scheme and even with a catalyst system containing ZSM-5 zeolite, naphtha conversion was low."
[10] "This may be due to the higher adsorption ability of the gas oil molecules and polynuclear aromatic products."
[11] "Thus, in order to effectively crack naphtha, it must be fed at a different location than gas oil in order to avoid competing effects."
[12] "With the purpose to evaluate the potential of recycling FCC naphtha for increasing propylene yield, the following options (Fig. 2) were experimentally simulated in a transported bed MicroDowner (MD) reactor and a fixed bed (MAT) reactor:"

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown steadily over time, reflecting the increasing demand for its versatile use in the production of polymers, resins, solvents, and various other chemicals. Its demand has escalated at an annual average rate of 5.7% since 1990, with projections indicating that by 2010, the demand for propene will reach 84 million tonnes, primarily driven by the growing demand for polypropylene. Traditionally, propene is predominantly produced through steam cracking methods, accounting for about 70% of global production. However, due to the projected growth in demand and the limitations of on-purpose processes like propane dehydrogenation, which can only meet a small portion of the demand, there is a need to explore alternative production methods. Considering the vast installed capacity of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units globally, particularly their flexibility to shift operations towards the production of LPG olefins, recycling FCC naphtha has emerged as a promising alternative to meet the growing demand for propene. This method not only increases propene production but also reduces the olefin content in the FCC naphtha, thereby facilitating downstream upgrading processes. To effectively utilize naphtha, it must be processed at distinct locations from gas oil to prevent competition and enhance its conversion efficiency. Various options for naphtha recycling, including processing at the bottom of the riser, in a parallel riser, in the stripper, or in a separate process with a shape-selective catalyst, have been evaluated for their potential to boost propene yield. These options offer refiners a range of strategies to increase propene production based on their financial resources and market conditions.

丙烯在化工行业的地位逐年提升，反映了其在聚合物、树脂、溶剂等各类化学品生产中的广泛应用。自1990年以来，其需求以每年平均5.7%的速度增长，预计到2010年，全球对丙烯的需求将增加至8400万吨，主要驱动力是聚丙烯需求的增长。传统上，丙烯主要通过蒸汽裂解方法生产，占全球产量的约70%。然而，鉴于未来需求的增长和特定于目的过程（如丙烷脱氢）仅能满足一小部分需求的限制，探索替代生产方法变得必要。考虑到全球流化床催化裂化（FCC）装置的巨大安装容量，尤其是它们转向生产液化石油气（LPG）烯烃的能力，回收FCC石脑油已作为满足丙烯日益增长需求的有前景选择。这种方法不仅增加了丙烯产量，而且降低了FCC石脑油中的烯烃含量，从而有利于下游升级过程。为了有效地利用石脑油，必须在与汽油油料不同位置进行处理，以防止竞争并提高其转化效率。通过在运输床微达纳（MD）反应器或固定床（MAT）反应器中评估底座裂化、平行裂化、在蒸馏塔中裂化或使用形状选择性催化剂的单独过程等多种石脑油回收选项，以提升丙烯产量。这些选项为炼油商提供了基于其财务资源和市场条件的不同策略来增加丙烯生产量。
