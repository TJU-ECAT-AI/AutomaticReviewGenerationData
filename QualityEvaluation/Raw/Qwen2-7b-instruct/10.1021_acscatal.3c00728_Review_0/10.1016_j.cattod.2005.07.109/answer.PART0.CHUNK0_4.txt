[1] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand."
[2] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."
[3] "Increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units."
[4] "Yet another emerging option to increase propylene yield is by reprocessing FCC naphtha."
[5] "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading."
[6] "Although capacity of propylene on-purpose processes is going to be quadrupled in the next 5 years, it will still cover only a small part of the propylene demand, and other sources have to be developed."
[7] "Considering the worldwide FCC installed capacity (14 million barrels/day) and the already proven flexibility of the process to shift operation mode towards LPG olefins production, this process appears to be a sensible alternative that may contribute to satisfy the growing demand of this petrochemical."
[8] "In order to effectively crack naphtha, it must be fed at a different location than gas oil in order to avoid competing effects."
[9] "With the purpose to evaluate the potential of recycling FCC naphtha for increasing propylene yield, the following options (Fig. 2) were experimentally simulated in a transported bed MicroDowner (MD) reactor and a fixed bed (MAT) reactor:"
[10] "Processing LCN was preferred over whole FCC naphtha, since the former fraction is richer in olefins, which are the most reactive and selective components to produce propylene."
[11] "The highest octane gain will be with the most severe process, as the concentration effect is the highest due to the highest LCN conversion."
[12] "It is worth to mention that in all cases LCN naphtha is converted with higher selectivity to LPG olefins than could do a steam cracking operation, being the average value around 70 wt.%, and it is 35 wt.% for propylene."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, reflecting the growing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, offering both economic and environmental advantages. This approach enables a more efficient use of resources and minimizes waste, making it particularly advantageous in meeting the growing needs for propene. Propane dehydrogenation is chosen over traditional methods due to its ability to produce propene with higher selectivity, efficiency, and lower environmental impact. The process allows for a more sustainable and cost-effective production of propene, catering to the escalating demand in sectors such as plastics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and automotive industries. By leveraging the inherent properties of propane, this method ensures a reliable supply of propene while reducing the overall carbon footprint associated with its production.
