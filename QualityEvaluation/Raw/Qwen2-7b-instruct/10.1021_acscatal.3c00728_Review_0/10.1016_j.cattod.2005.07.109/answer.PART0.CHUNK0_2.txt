[1] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand."
[2] "It is well known that increasing process severity can significantly increase propylene production in FCC units."
[3] "Although capacity of propylene on-purpose processes is going to be quadrupled in the next 5 years, it will still cover only a small part of the propylene demand, and other sources have to be developed."
[4] "It is expected that in order to cover the future demand, the propylene market share from other processes than steam cracking will importantly grow, since it is forecast that propylene market will grow faster than ethylene market."
[5] "Yet another emerging option to increase propylene yield is by reprocessing FCC naphtha."
[6] "With this option, naphtha-range olefins may be transformed into LPG olefins, while at the same time, olefins content of FCC naphtha may be reduced, which would facilitate downstream upgrading."
[7] "With the purpose to evaluate the potential of recycling FCC naphtha for increasing propylene yield, the following options (Fig. 2) were experimentally simulated in a transported bed MicroDowner (MD) reactor and a fixed bed (MAT) reactor."
[8] "Processing LCN was preferred over whole FCC naphtha, since the former fraction is richer in olefins, which are the most reactive and selective components to produce propylene, thus, making this alternative more cost-effective than processing the whole naphtha."
[9] "Results of light FCC naphtha cracking have shown that selectivity towards propylene is governed by hydrogen-transfer reactions."
[10] "Thus, the selectivity to propylene may be increased by minimizing these reactions."
[11] "This can be achieved by cracking the naphtha at high temperature, by using shape-selective catalysts or by working with coked catalysts."
[12] "Recycling light naphtha in the FCC process is an interesting alternative, which may increase the yield of propylene by 50% if proper processing is carried out."
[13] "Furthermore, olefins content of FCC gasoline may be significantly reduced."
[14] "It has been well established that the conversion of light hydrocarbons occurs via carbenium ion chemistry."
[15] "The balance between mono- and bimolecular mechanism will depend on the surface coverage by carbenium ion."
[16] "Notice that site density may be decreased either by dealumination (irreversible) or coking (reversible) of the catalyst."
[17] "On the other hand, a small pore size will favour the monomolecular mechanism since the bimolecular reaction intermediary cannot be formed in narrow pores, which was observed with the conversion of C5C9 olefins on ZSM5 zeolite."
[18] "As an illustration, we can consider the conversion of naphtha range olefins."
[19] "Following the chain mechanism paths, a single olefin can either generate a carbenium ion and crack into LPG-range olefins (monomolecular) or react with an existing carbenium ion (bimolecular)."
[20] "Moreover, it was observed that the reactivity of olefins with six or less carbon atoms was considerably lower than the reactivity of longer chain olefins."
[21] "Respect to naphthenes, it has been shown that methylcyclohexane preferentially crack towards smaller olefins, while methylcyclohexene, which can readily form the corresponding carbenium ion, preferably evolves towards aromatic products through hydrogen-transfer reactions or direct dehydrogenation."
[22] "Thus, a bimolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to the formation of aromatics from the naphthenes, since the carbenium may be directly formed from the feed molecule through a hydride transfer, while a monomolecular cracking mechanism will preferentially lead to short olefins."
[23] "Then, the balance between hydrogen-transfer reactions and cracking reactions will be critical in orienting the selectivity of olefins and naphthenes conversion towards either propylene or gasoline-range aromatics and paraffins."
[24] "The very high reactivity of olefins with respect to the corresponding paraffins under realistic FCC cracking conditions has been demonstrated."
[25] "In this case, the operating conditions may be varied in a wide range, as they do not depend on FCC process constraints due to simultaneous cracking of gas oil."
[26] "Despite the high content of olefins in the feedstock, coke yield is extremely low."
[27] "An additional benefit would be the reduction of more than 50% olefins in the resulting FCC naphtha, whose content would be of only 12 wt.%."
[28] "The major operational drawback of this operation would be the substantial increase in dry gas yield resulting from thermal cracking, which was about 80% higher than the base case, making necessary to increase the gas compressor capacity."
[29] "Although LCN conversion to gas and coke resulted smaller because of the lower reaction severity, gasoline-range olefins conversion is only a little bit smaller than in the previous option, resulting in the same interesting reduction of olefins in the gasoline."
[30] "Thus, this would be the preferred option if the main goal were to upgrade FCC naphtha quality with an appreciable propylene and butylenes production as a collateral benefit."
[31] "This option offers the highest selectivity to propylene and butenes with a slightly lower dry gas generation than the best former option for propylene production (bottom of the riser cracking option)."
[32] "Nevertheless, this option is subjected to a carefully economic evaluation because of the huge inversion and the fact that most of the heat required by the process should be generated independently, since the coke make is very low and an autothermal operation like FCC operation would not be possible."
[33] "In all the processing options considered, the aromatic content of total gasoline is significantly increased, because of the concentration of the heavy gasoline-range aromatics in the total gasoline, resulting in an octane increase of the gasoline."
[34] "The highest octane gain will be with the most severe process, as the concentration effect is the highest due to the highest LCN conversion."
[35] "In contrast, LCN processing in the stripper also significantly increases propylene production without requiring major modifications on the unit, having the advantage of producing only small quantities of additional dry gas and significantly lowering olefin content of cracked naphtha."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, with its demand increasing annually at a rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production reached approximately 52 million tonnes, and projections indicate that by 2010, the demand will soar to 84 million tonnes, largely driven by the rising demand for polypropylene. To meet this growing demand, the market share of propylene produced through methods other than steam cracking is expected to increase notably, given that the propylene market is anticipated to expand faster than the ethylene market. Propane dehydrogenation emerges as a preferred production method, offering economic and environmental advantages in meeting the needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

2. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its ability to efficiently convert propane into propene. This process offers several economic and environmental benefits. Economically, propane dehydrogenation provides a competitive alternative to traditional steam cracking methods, offering potentially lower costs and improved efficiency. Environmentally, this method reduces the carbon footprint associated with propene production, as propane is a cleaner feedstock compared to naphtha or other conventional crude oil fractions. Additionally, propane dehydrogenation can help reduce the dependency on fossil fuels, promoting sustainability and energy security. The process also facilitates the production of high-purity propene, which is crucial for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, and various chemical intermediates, further enhancing its utility in the chemical industry.

3. Propane dehydrogenation offers several advantages over traditional steam cracking methods in producing propene. Firstly, it utilizes a cleaner feedstock, propane, which emits fewer pollutants during the cracking process compared to naphtha or other crude oil fractions. Secondly, propane dehydrogenation typically results in a higher purity of propene, reducing the need for post-processing purification steps. Thirdly, the process often consumes less energy, as propane is generally more energy-efficient to transport and process compared to heavier hydrocarbons like naphtha. Lastly, propane dehydrogenation can be integrated into existing infrastructure, leveraging existing pipelines and storage facilities, thereby reducing the capital investment required for new plants. These factors collectively contribute to the economic viability and environmental sustainability of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for propene production.
