1. The coordination environment significantly influences the catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained prominence as a preferred method for propene production because it offers lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emissions compared to conventional techniques such as steam cracking. This approach provides economic benefits through minimized capital costs and operational expenses. Additionally, PDH presents environmental advantages by potentially lowering greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing air quality.
