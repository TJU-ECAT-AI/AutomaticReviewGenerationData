<quotes>
[1] "The coordination environment plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and stability of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered an attractive alternative to steam cracking for propene production due to its lower energy consumption and less CO2 emissions."
[3] "Economic advantages of PDH include reduced capital costs and operating expenses compared to traditional methods."
[4] "Environmental benefits of PDH stem from its potential to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The coordination environment significantly influences the catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained prominence as a preferred method for propene production because it offers lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emissions compared to conventional techniques such as steam cracking. This approach provides economic benefits through minimized capital costs and operational expenses. Additionally, PDH presents environmental advantages by potentially lowering greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing air quality.
