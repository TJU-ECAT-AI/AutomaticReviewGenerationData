[1] "The influence of vanadium content on the performance of VMgO catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane was investigated."
[2] "The rate of ODH per V atom increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a maximum value at 3.5 VOx/nm2."
[3] "The propane ODH selectivity of the catalysts increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2."

The study investigates how varying vanadium content affects the performance of vanadia-magnesia catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It finds that the rate of oxidative dehydrogenation per vanadium atom increases with the surface density of vanadia, reaching a peak at around 3.5 vanadium oxide/nanometer squared. Additionally, the selectivity of the process towards propane increases with the vanadia surface density, stabilizing at approximately 80% for a surface density of about 4 vanadium oxide/nanometer squared.

研究探讨了不同钒含量对氧化镁-钒催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的性能影响。发现每钒原子的氧化脱氢速率随着钒氧化物表面积密度的增加而增加，在大约3.5钒氧化物/纳米平方时达到峰值。此外，随着钒氧化物表面积密度的增加，过程对丙烷的选择性也增加，并稳定在约80%，对应大约4钒氧化物/纳米平方的表面积密度。
