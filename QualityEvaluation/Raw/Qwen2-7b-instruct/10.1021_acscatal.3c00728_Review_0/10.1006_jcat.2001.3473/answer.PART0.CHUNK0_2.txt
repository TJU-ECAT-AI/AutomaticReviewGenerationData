[1] "The environment of the V atoms depends strongly on the apparent surface density of vanadia."
[2] "Isolated VO42 units are present at very low apparent surface densities (1 VOx/nm2)."
[3] "As the vanadia density increases, magnesium vanadate structures are formed."
[4] "Above a surface density of 3.5 VOx/nm2 well-dispersed magnesium orthovanadate domains become evident."
[5] "The rate of ODH per V atom increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a maximum value at 3.5 VOx/nm2."
[6] "Consistent with this interpretation, the ODH activity per unit surface area reaches a plateau at a VOx surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2."
[7] "The propane ODH selectivity of the catalysts increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2."

The performance of vanadia-magnesia catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane was investigated based on the vanadium content. As the vanadium density increases, magnesium vanadate structures are formed, leading to an increase in the rate of ODH per V atom until it reaches a maximum at 3.5 VOx/nm2. The ODH activity per unit surface area reaches a plateau at a VOx surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2, and the propane ODH selectivity also increases with increasing VOx surface density, reaching a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2.

在对含钒量的范德瓦尔斯镁氧化铝催化剂进行的研究中，随着钒密度的增加，形成了镁范德华结构，导致每V原子的ODH速率增加，直到达到3.5 VOx/nm2的最大值。单位表面面积的ODH活性在约4 VOx/nm2的钒表面密度时达到平台期，丙烷ODH选择性也随钒表面密度的增加而增加，达到80%的平台期，对应于约4 VOx/nm2的表面密度。
