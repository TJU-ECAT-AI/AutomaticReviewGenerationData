The performance of vanadia-magnesia catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane was investigated based on the vanadium content. As the vanadium density increases, magnesium vanadate structures are formed, leading to an increase in the rate of ODH per V atom until it reaches a maximum at 3.5 VOx/nm2. The ODH activity per unit surface area reaches a plateau at a VOx surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2, and the propane ODH selectivity also increases with increasing VOx surface density, reaching a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2.

1. The performance of vanadium-containing catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is significantly influenced by the vanadium content. Specifically, the rate of ODH per vanadium atom increases with increasing vanadium oxide (VOx) surface density, reaching a peak at around 3.5 VOx/nm². This suggests that the catalyst efficiency peaks at this surface density. Furthermore, the activity per unit surface area stabilizes around 4 VOx/nm², and the selectivity for propane ODH reaches a plateau at 80% under similar conditions. The rate coefficients for ODH, combustion of propane, and combustion of propene also show distinct behaviors, with the rate coefficient for ODH (k1) peaking at approximately 4 VOx/nm², while the ratios of k2/k1 and k3/k1 decrease monotonically with increasing vanadium content.

2. The trends in these rate coefficients and activities point towards the importance of surface structure and composition in determining the catalytic performance for propane ODH. The optimization of vanadium content and distribution on the catalyst surface appears crucial for maximizing the efficiency and selectivity of the process. This study highlights the potential of fine-tuning catalyst properties to meet the demands for more efficient and selective propane dehydrogenation, which is vital for the chemical industry's ability to produce propene and other valuable products in a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable manner.

1. 研究表明，氧化脱氢（ODH）催化剂中钒含量对丙烷的性能影响显著。随着钒氧化物（VOx）表面密度的增加，每钒原子的ODH速率上升，并在约3.5 VOx/nm²时达到峰值。这表明催化剂效率在这一表面密度下达到最高点。此外，单位表面积的活性在约4 VOx/nm²时稳定，丙烷ODH选择性也达到80%的峰值。对于ODH、丙烷燃烧和丙烯燃烧的速率系数也显示出不同的行为，其中ODH的速率系数（k1）在约4 VOx/nm²时达到峰值，而k2/k1和k3/k1的比率随钒含量的增加而单调下降。

2. 这些速率系数和活动的趋势表明，表面结构和组成对于确定ODH过程的催化性能至关重要。优化钒含量及其在催化剂表面的分布可能对提高效率和选择性具有关键作用。这项研究强调了通过精细调整催化剂特性来满足更高效和选择性的丙烷脱氢需求的重要性，这对于化学行业生产重要产品如丙烯和其他有价值化合物的能力至关重要。

The rate of ODH per V atom increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a maximum value at 3.5 VOx/nm2. Above this surface density, the rate of ODH per V atom decreases because an increasing fraction of the V atoms lie below the catalyst surface and, hence, are inaccessible.
The propane ODH selectivity of the catalysts increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2.
Rate coefficients for propane ODH (k1), propane combustion (k2), and propene combustion (k3) were calculated for each catalyst. The value of k1 increases with increasing VOx surface density, reaching a maximum at about 4 VOx/nm2. By contrast, the ratios (k2/k1) and (k3/k1) decrease monotonically with increasing VOx surface density.

The study investigates how the performance of vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is influenced by vanadium content. It is found that as the surface density of vanadium pentoxide (VOx) increases, the rate of ODH per V atom initially rises and reaches a peak at around 3.5 VOx/nm2. Beyond this point, the rate decreases due to an increasing number of V atoms being inaccessible beneath the catalyst surface. The selectivity for ODH also improves with higher VOx surface density, stabilizing at approximately 80% for a surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2. The rate constants for different reactions show that while the rate of ODH (k1) increases with VOx surface density and peaks at about 4 VOx/nm2, the ratios of the rates for propane combustion (k2) and propene combustion (k3) to ODH (k1) decrease monotonically with increased VOx surface density.

研究探讨了用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的范德镁氧（VMgO）催化剂中钒含量的影响。发现随着五氧化二钒（VOx）表面积密度的增加，每V原子的ODH速率起初上升并在约3.5 VOx/nm2时达到峰值。超过这个密度，由于越来越多的V原子位于催化剂表面之下而变得不可接触，速率开始下降。ODH的选择性也随着更高的VOx表面积密度提高，在大约4 VOx/nm2的表面积密度下稳定在约80%。不同反应的速率常数显示，虽然ODH（k1）的速率常数随VOx表面积密度的增加并达到约4 VOx/nm2的峰值，但丙烷燃烧（k2）和丙烯燃烧（k3）相对于ODH（k1）的比率却随着VOx表面积密度的增加而单调递减。
