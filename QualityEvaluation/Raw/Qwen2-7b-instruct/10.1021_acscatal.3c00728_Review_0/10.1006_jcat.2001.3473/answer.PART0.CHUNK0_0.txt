[1] "The influence of vanadium content on the performance of VMgO catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane was investigated."
[2] "The rate of ODH per V atom increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a maximum value at 3.5 VOx/nm2."
[3] "The propane ODH selectivity of the catalysts increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2."

The study investigated how the amount of vanadium affects the performance of vanadia-magnesia catalysts in oxidatively dehydrogenating propane. It was found that as the vanadium concentration increases, the rate of the reaction per vanadium atom rises, peaking at a density of 3.5 VOx/nm². This catalyst also showed improved selectivity for propane, achieving a maximum of 80% at around 4 VOx/nm².

[1] "The environment of the V atoms depends strongly on the apparent surface density of vanadia."
[2] "As the vanadia density increases, magnesium vanadate structures are formed and above a surface density of 3.5 VOx/nm2 well-dispersed magnesium orthovanadate domains become evident."
[3] "The observed trends in k1, (k2/k1), and (k3/k1) are discussed in terms of the surface structure of the catalyst."

The surroundings of the vanadium atoms are significantly influenced by the apparent surface density of vanadia. As the vanadia density grows, magnesium vanadate structures emerge and at a density of 3.5 VOx/nm², well-distributed magnesium orthovanadate regions become visible. The changes in k1, (k2/k1), and (k3/k1) are analyzed based on the catalyst's surface structure.
