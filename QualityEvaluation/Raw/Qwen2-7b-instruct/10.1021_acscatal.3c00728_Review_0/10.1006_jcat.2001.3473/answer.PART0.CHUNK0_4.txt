The rate of ODH per V atom increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a maximum value at 3.5 VOx/nm2. Above this surface density, the rate of ODH per V atom decreases because an increasing fraction of the V atoms lie below the catalyst surface and, hence, are inaccessible.
The propane ODH selectivity of the catalysts increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2.
Rate coefficients for propane ODH (k1), propane combustion (k2), and propene combustion (k3) were calculated for each catalyst. The value of k1 increases with increasing VOx surface density, reaching a maximum at about 4 VOx/nm2. By contrast, the ratios (k2/k1) and (k3/k1) decrease monotonically with increasing VOx surface density.

The study investigates how the performance of vanadium magnesium oxide (VMgO) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is influenced by vanadium content. It is found that as the surface density of vanadium pentoxide (VOx) increases, the rate of ODH per V atom initially rises and reaches a peak at around 3.5 VOx/nm2. Beyond this point, the rate decreases due to an increasing number of V atoms being inaccessible beneath the catalyst surface. The selectivity for ODH also improves with higher VOx surface density, stabilizing at approximately 80% for a surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2. The rate constants for different reactions show that while the rate of ODH (k1) increases with VOx surface density and peaks at about 4 VOx/nm2, the ratios of the rates for propane combustion (k2) and propene combustion (k3) to ODH (k1) decrease monotonically with increased VOx surface density.

研究探讨了用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的范德镁氧（VMgO）催化剂中钒含量的影响。发现随着五氧化二钒（VOx）表面积密度的增加，每V原子的ODH速率起初上升并在约3.5 VOx/nm2时达到峰值。超过这个密度，由于越来越多的V原子位于催化剂表面之下而变得不可接触，速率开始下降。ODH的选择性也随着更高的VOx表面积密度提高，在大约4 VOx/nm2的表面积密度下稳定在约80%。不同反应的速率常数显示，虽然ODH（k1）的速率常数随VOx表面积密度的增加并达到约4 VOx/nm2的峰值，但丙烷燃烧（k2）和丙烯燃烧（k3）相对于ODH（k1）的比率却随着VOx表面积密度的增加而单调递减。
