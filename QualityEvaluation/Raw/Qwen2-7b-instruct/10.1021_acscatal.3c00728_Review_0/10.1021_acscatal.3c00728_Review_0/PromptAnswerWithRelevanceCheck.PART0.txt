Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand driven by the growth in consumption of high-value-added products. Propane dehydrogenation is preferred over direct dehydrogenation due to its economic viability and environmental friendliness. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) offers a lower reaction temperature because of the exothermic nature of the oxidation process. However, the reactivity of lattice-activated oxygen poses a challenge in preventing side reactions. Several comprehensive reviews have detailed the catalytic properties, kinetics, and mechanisms of boron-based catalysts in propene production.

[4] "This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene."
[5] "Currently, conventional catalysts used in the ODHP process are mainly transition metal oxide catalysts, such as VOx, MgOx, WOx, CrOx, and silica-supported catalysts."
[6] "The reaction generally follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism; that is, the lattice oxygen activates the CH bond of the alkane, and then O2 replenishes the lattice oxygen to regenerate the active site, thus completing the catalytic cycle."
[7] "However, the strong interaction between the d orbital of the transition metal and the π orbital of olefin results in the easy CC bond cleavage of olefin and subsequent peroxidation of hydrocarbons."
[8] "On one hand, the weakest CH bond in propene is weaker than that of propane (360.7 versus 401.3 kJ·mol1), which makes propene thermodynamically more vulnerable to oxygen attack compared to propane."
[9] "On the other hand, the weakest CC bond in propene is 413.8 kJ·mol1, only a little higher than that of the weakest CH bond of propane."
[10] "This phenomenon can be explained based on the bond energy of the reactants and products."
[11] "Recently, since Hermans et al. and Lu et al. reported hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-based materials as metal-free catalysts for the ODHP reaction that exhibited excellent catalytic performance,"
[12] "investigations of the active site of B catalysts reveals that an oxygen functionalization process occurs under reaction conditions, generating the three-coordinated oxygen/hydroxyl modified B(OH)xO3x species as the real active species in nearly every B-based ODHP catalyst."
[13] "Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the active sites is a crucial factor that influences the catalyst performance."
[14] "Moreover, the conversion pathways and mechanism of ODHP on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase mediated by radicals are also analyzed."
[15] "On the basis of these discussions of active sites and mechanism, the prospects of future research on the B-based catalyst system in ODHP are discussed and some useful suggestions are provided."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for high-value-added products, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic viability and environmental friendliness compared to direct dehydrogenation. The lower reaction temperature required for oxidative dehydrogenation enhances efficiency and enables continuous conversion of propane to propene. Traditional catalysts used in this process are primarily transition metal oxides, but they exhibit limitations, particularly in inhibiting the overoxidation of propene to COx products. Recent advancements in boron-based catalysts, especially those utilizing h-BN-based materials, have demonstrated improved catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering better control over the reaction pathways and product selectivity. The spatial distribution of active sites on these catalysts plays a critical role in influencing their performance and efficiency. Future research aims to further optimize boron-based catalyst systems and understand the underlying mechanisms of their enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
