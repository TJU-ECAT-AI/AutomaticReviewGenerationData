Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its widespread use in preparing value-added chemicals and polymer products, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. Its increasing demand is driven by the growth in the consumption of high-value-added products. Propane dehydrogenation offers economic and environmental benefits over other propene production methods, as it is more cost-effective and eco-friendly. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents advantages and prospects for efficiently converting propane to propene at lower temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction.
