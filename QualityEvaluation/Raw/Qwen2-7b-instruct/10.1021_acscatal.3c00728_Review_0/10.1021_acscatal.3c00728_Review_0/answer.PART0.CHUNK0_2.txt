[1] "With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing."
[2] "Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly."
[3] "Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of propane, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) requires a lower reaction temperature owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction."
[4] "This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene."
[5] "Currently, conventional catalysts used in the ODHP process are mainly transition metal oxide catalysts, such as VOx, MgOx, WOx, CrOx, and silica-supported catalysts."
[6] "The reaction generally follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism; that is, the lattice oxygen activates the CH bond of the alkane, and then O2 replenishes the lattice oxygen to regenerate the active site, thus completing the catalytic cycle."
[7] "However, the strong interaction between the d orbital of the transition metal and the π orbital of olefin results in the easy CC bond cleavage of olefin and subsequent peroxidation of hydrocarbons."
[8] "On one hand, the weakest CH bond in propene is weaker than that of propane (360.7 versus 401.3 kJ·mol1), which makes propene thermodynamically more vulnerable to oxygen attack compared to propane."
[9] "On the other hand, the weakest CC bond in propene is 413.8 kJ·mol1, only a little higher than that of the weakest CH bond of propane."
[10] "This phenomenon can be explained based on the bond energy of the reactants and products."
[11] "Recently, since Hermans et al. and Lu et al. reported hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-based materials as metal-free catalysts for the ODHP reaction that exhibited excellent catalytic performance,"
[12] "investigations of the active site of B catalysts reveals that an oxygen functionalization process occurs under reaction conditions, generating the three-coordinated oxygen/hydroxyl modified B(OH)xO3x species as the real active species in nearly every B-based ODHP catalyst."
[13] "Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the active sites is a crucial factor that influences the catalyst performance."
[14] "Moreover, the conversion pathways and mechanism of ODHP on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase mediated by radicals are also analyzed."
[15] "On the basis of these discussions of active sites and mechanism, the prospects of future research on the B-based catalyst system in ODHP are discussed and some useful suggestions are provided."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for high-value-added products, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic viability and environmental friendliness compared to direct dehydrogenation. The lower reaction temperature required for oxidative dehydrogenation enhances efficiency and enables continuous conversion of propane to propene. Traditional catalysts used in this process are primarily transition metal oxides, but they exhibit limitations, particularly in inhibiting the overoxidation of propene to COx products. Recent advancements in boron-based catalysts, especially those utilizing h-BN-based materials, have demonstrated improved catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering better control over the reaction pathways and product selectivity. The spatial distribution of active sites on these catalysts plays a critical role in influencing their performance and efficiency. Future research aims to further optimize boron-based catalyst systems and understand the underlying mechanisms of their enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着对高附加值产品的日益需求而发展，这促使人们采用丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法，因为它在经济性和环境友好性上优于直接脱氢。氧化脱氢过程所需的较低反应温度提高了效率，并使丙烷连续转化为丙烯成为可能。传统催化剂主要用于此过程，但它们在抑制丙烯过度氧化至COx产物方面存在局限性。最近，硼基催化剂的进展，特别是那些使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）为基础材料的催化剂，已经显示出在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中出色的催化性能，提供了更好地控制反应途径和产物选择性的能力。这些催化剂上的活性位点的空间分布对其性能和效率至关重要。未来的研究旨在进一步优化硼基催化剂系统并深入了解其在氧化脱氢过程中增强性能的机制。
