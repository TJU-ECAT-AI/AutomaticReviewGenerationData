[1] "With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing."
[2] "Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly."
[3] "Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of propane, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) requires a lower reaction temperature owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its growing demand driven by the increasing consumption of high-value-added products. Its adoption as a preferred production method stems from the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation being more economically viable and environmentally friendly. Compared to direct dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation offers lower reaction temperatures due to the exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction, providing significant advantages for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene.
