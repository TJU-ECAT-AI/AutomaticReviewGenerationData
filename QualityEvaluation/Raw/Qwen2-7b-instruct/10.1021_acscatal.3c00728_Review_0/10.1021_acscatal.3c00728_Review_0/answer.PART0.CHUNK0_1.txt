Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand driven by the growth in consumption of high-value-added products. Propane dehydrogenation is preferred over direct dehydrogenation due to its economic viability and environmental friendliness. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) offers a lower reaction temperature because of the exothermic nature of the oxidation process. However, the reactivity of lattice-activated oxygen poses a challenge in preventing side reactions. Several comprehensive reviews have detailed the catalytic properties, kinetics, and mechanisms of boron-based catalysts in propene production.
