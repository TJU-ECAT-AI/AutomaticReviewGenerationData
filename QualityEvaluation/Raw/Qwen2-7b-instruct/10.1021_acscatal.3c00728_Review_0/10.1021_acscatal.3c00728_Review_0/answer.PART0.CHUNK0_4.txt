[1] "With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing."
[2] "Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly."
[3] "Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of propane, (1,2,1020) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) requires a lower reaction temperature owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved significantly due to its widespread use in producing valuable chemical intermediates and polymers. As the demand for high-value-added products increases, so does the annual demand for propene. Propane dehydrogenation, especially oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODHP), offers economic and environmental advantages over other propene production methods. It is more economical and environmentally friendly, and it benefits from the exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction, allowing for efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene with lower reaction temperatures.
