The chemical industry has seen propene's demand grow significantly over the years due to its versatility in various applications. As propene is crucial for producing polymers, solvents, and other chemical intermediates, the increasing demand has driven industries to adopt more efficient and cost-effective methods of propene production. Propane dehydrogenation stands as a preferred production method due to its ability to directly convert propane into propene, bypassing the need for additional processing steps. Economically, this approach reduces production costs and time, enhancing profitability. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers benefits such as lower emissions compared to alternative methods, contributing positively to sustainability efforts. The use of catalysts like chromium-loaded hydroxyapatite further optimizes the process, improving efficiency and selectivity, particularly in the activation step and alkene selectivity.

Cr6+ species play a significant role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, enhancing catalytic activity. Similarly, in the context of propane dehydrogenation, Cr6+ sites initially present on the catalysts may be considered active but their role is limited to the beginning of the reaction as they are reduced by the reaction mixture. Cr3+ species, on the other hand, are believed to be responsible for propene formation. The presence of Cr3+ in entities like Cr3+OCa2+ helps in releasing neighboring lattice oxygen, either forming an oxygen vacancy or a Cr2+ species, which facilitates propene production. The mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane and oxygen lability, favored by the basicity of the hydroxyapatite and the presence of Cr3+, respectively. However, the decrease in basicity induced by the fixation of Cr3+ counterbalances the positive effect of chromium on oxygen reactivity, thus limiting the performance of the catalyst.

化学工业对丙烯的需求在过去几十年里显著增长，这主要是由于丙烯在各种应用中的灵活性。随着对丙烯需求的增长，工业界已采用更高效、成本效益更高的方法生产丙烯。丙烷脱氢化作为首选生产方法的原因在于它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需额外的处理步骤。从经济角度来看，这种方法降低了生产成本和时间，提高了盈利能力。从环境角度看，丙烷脱氢化提供了相比其他方法更低排放的好处，对可持续发展做出了积极贡献。催化剂如铬负载羟基磷灰石的使用进一步优化了过程，提高了效率和选择性，特别是在激活步骤和烯烃选择性方面。

Cr6+物种在异丁烷的氧化脱氢化中扮演重要角色，增强催化活性。同样，在丙烷脱氢化的情况下，Cr6+位点最初存在于催化剂上可能被认为是活性位点，但在反应开始时，这些位点由反应混合物还原。Cr3+物种被认为负责丙烯形成。Cr3+的存在于如Cr3+OCa2+实体中有助于释放相邻晶格氧，形成一个空位或Cr2+物种，从而促进丙烯产生。机制涉及丙烷的氢解离和氧气可变性，分别由羟基磷灰石的碱性和Cr3+的特性支持。然而，由Cr3+固定引起的碱性的降低抵消了铬对氧活性的正效应，限制了催化剂的性能。
