[1] "Processes manufacturing alkenes by alkanes dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen have been developed and commercialized for over 60 years."
[2] "However, the process consumes a lot of energy. It also limits the alkenes selectivity and favours carbon deposition on the active sites."
[3] "The addition of O2 (or N2O) to the reaction mixture allows performing exothermic oxidative dehydrogenations (ODHs)."
[4] "The catalytic performance of Cr/TiO2 and Co/TiO2 catalysts in ethane ODH was shown to be enhanced by the addition of phosphorus."
[5] "The observed improvements were attributed to the modification of the acidbase properties of the catalysts and to the increase of their stability."
[6] "In ethane ODH, cobalt exchanged (Co2+/Ca2+) hydroxyapatite showed an ethylene yield of 22% at 550 C."
[7] "This good performance was attributed to isolated Co2+ sites on the apatite surface and to lattice oxygen mobility induced by cobalt incorporation in the phosphate network."
[8] "It must be noted that the performance of CaHAp as a carrier is essentially due to its ion-exchange and adjustable acidbase properties."
[9] "The present work focuses on samples synthesized by the cation-exchange method, expected (i) to favour the formation of isolated chromium species and to prevent the formation of bulk chromium oxide."
[10] "In the case of propane ODH, the active centres are Cr3+ clusters, generally resulting from the reduction of higher oxidation states (Cr5+ and Cr6+)."
[11] "After calcination in air, chromium ions are fixed on apatite as isolated species (monochromate), excluding the presence of chromium oxides (Cr2O3, CrO3)."
[12] "At low Cr concentrations (x < 0.5 wt.%) the chromium is mainly in the Cr6+ oxidation state and before the reduction, the samples are yellow."
[13] "In addition, TPR experiments performed on samples calcined under oxygen-free N2 do not lead to any H2 consumption, confirming that Cr is exclusively in the Cr3+ (and Cr2+) oxidation states."
[14] "On the other hand, a series of TPO experiments showed that the reduced samples surprisingly do not consume any oxygen up to 600 C."
[15] "In opposition, the impregnation procedure, often used for preparing chromia-alumina catalysts, should favour the formation of Cr2O3."
[16] "As previously proposed [24] the oxidative dehydrogenation abilities of transition metal ions (TMI) supported on calcium-hydroxyapatite are related to the basic features of CaHAp which promotes hydrogen abstraction, the TMI favouring the reactivity of bridging oxygens."
[17] "It is well accepted that, in ODH of light alkanes, the selectivity decreases when the conversion increases."
[18] "Concerning the drop of propylene selectivity with temperature on high Cr loadings (Fig. 12), it may be associated with the marked decrease of basicity induced by the substitution of Ca2+ by numerous Cr3+, generating [Cr3+OCr3+] sites."
[19] "As Cr3+ is more acid than Ca2+, the decrease of basicity overcompensate the positive effect of chromium on oxygen reactivity for the chromium-richest samples."

The chemical industry's demand for propene has significantly increased over time due to its wide usage in various applications. This growing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, as it efficiently converts propane into propene, a key component in the production of petrochemicals, plastics, and synthetic rubber. The economic advantages of this approach include higher yield and efficiency compared to traditional methods, leading to cost savings for manufacturers. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers potential benefits by potentially reducing emissions and waste compared to alternative processes. The use of calcium-hydroxyapatite catalysts, specifically chromium-loaded ones, enhances the dehydrogenation process by improving conversion rates and propene yields. The role of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species in the activation step and alkene selectivity is crucial, with Cr3+ entities being particularly active in propylene formation. The proposed mechanism suggests that the presence of Cr3+ in Cr3+OCa2+ entities facilitates the release of lattice oxygen, which is essential for propene production.

The chemical industry has seen propene's demand grow significantly over the years due to its versatility in various applications. As propene is crucial for producing polymers, solvents, and other chemical intermediates, the increasing demand has driven industries to adopt more efficient and cost-effective methods of propene production. Propane dehydrogenation stands as a preferred production method due to its ability to directly convert propane into propene, bypassing the need for additional processing steps. Economically, this approach reduces production costs and time, enhancing profitability. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers benefits such as lower emissions compared to alternative methods, contributing positively to sustainability efforts. The use of catalysts like chromium-loaded hydroxyapatite further optimizes the process, improving efficiency and selectivity, particularly in the activation step and alkene selectivity.

Cr6+ species play a significant role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, enhancing catalytic activity. Similarly, in the context of propane dehydrogenation, Cr6+ sites initially present on the catalysts may be considered active but their role is limited to the beginning of the reaction as they are reduced by the reaction mixture. Cr3+ species, on the other hand, are believed to be responsible for propene formation. The presence of Cr3+ in entities like Cr3+OCa2+ helps in releasing neighboring lattice oxygen, either forming an oxygen vacancy or a Cr2+ species, which facilitates propene production. The mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction from propane and oxygen lability, favored by the basicity of the hydroxyapatite and the presence of Cr3+, respectively. However, the decrease in basicity induced by the fixation of Cr3+ counterbalances the positive effect of chromium on oxygen reactivity, thus limiting the performance of the catalyst.

化学工业对丙烯的需求在过去几十年里显著增长，这主要是由于丙烯在各种应用中的灵活性。随着对丙烯需求的增长，工业界已采用更高效、成本效益更高的方法生产丙烯。丙烷脱氢化作为首选生产方法的原因在于它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需额外的处理步骤。从经济角度来看，这种方法降低了生产成本和时间，提高了盈利能力。从环境角度看，丙烷脱氢化提供了相比其他方法更低排放的好处，对可持续发展做出了积极贡献。催化剂如铬负载羟基磷灰石的使用进一步优化了过程，提高了效率和选择性，特别是在激活步骤和烯烃选择性方面。

Cr6+物种在异丁烷的氧化脱氢化中扮演重要角色，增强催化活性。同样，在丙烷脱氢化的情况下，Cr6+位点最初存在于催化剂上可能被认为是活性位点，但在反应开始时，这些位点由反应混合物还原。Cr3+物种被认为负责丙烯形成。Cr3+的存在于如Cr3+OCa2+实体中有助于释放相邻晶格氧，形成一个空位或Cr2+物种，从而促进丙烯产生。机制涉及丙烷的氢解离和氧气可变性，分别由羟基磷灰石的碱性和Cr3+的特性支持。然而，由Cr3+固定引起的碱性的降低抵消了铬对氧活性的正效应，限制了催化剂的性能。

Moreover, the use of chromium-loaded hydroxyapatite catalysts enhances the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation, leading to higher propene yields and improved selectivity. The economic advantage lies in the ability to produce propene at a lower cost while minimizing environmental impact. The environmental benefit comes from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and waste produced during the production process. 

The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include:
1. Cost-effectiveness: The process uses fewer resources and energy, leading to lower production costs.
2. Cleaner production: By being exothermic, the process generates heat rather than requiring additional energy input, reducing the overall carbon footprint.
3. Improved selectivity: The use of specific catalysts, such as chromium-loaded hydroxyapatite, ensures a higher yield of propene with minimal side reactions, enhancing the efficiency of the process.
4. Reduced waste: The method minimizes the generation of hazardous byproducts, promoting sustainable industrial practices.
