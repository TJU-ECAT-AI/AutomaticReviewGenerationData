[1] "Processes manufacturing alkenes by alkanes dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen have been developed and commercialized for over 60 years."
[2] "However, in the case of propane ODH, there are still unanswered questions concerning the activation step and the factors governing the alkene selectivity."
[3] "The catalytic performance of Cr/TiO2 and Co/TiO2 catalysts in ethane ODH was shown to be enhanced by the addition of phosphorus."
[4] "The catalytic performance of Cr(x)/CaHAp in propane ODH was measured in the 300550 C range."
[5] "The Cr6+ centres initially present on the catalysts may initiate the cracking of propane because of their acidity and improve the conversion."
[6] "Cr3+ species are believed to be responsible for the propylene formation (propylene yield around 7% at 550 C)."
[7] "It is proposed that in Cr3+OCa2+ entities, the presence of Cr3+ favours the release of the neighbour lattice oxygen."

The chemical industry's demand for propene has significantly increased over time due to its wide usage in various applications. This growing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, as it efficiently converts propane into propene, a key component in the production of petrochemicals, plastics, and synthetic rubber. The economic advantages of this approach include higher yield and efficiency compared to traditional methods, leading to cost savings for manufacturers. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers potential benefits by potentially reducing emissions and waste compared to alternative processes. The use of calcium-hydroxyapatite catalysts, specifically chromium-loaded ones, enhances the dehydrogenation process by improving conversion rates and propene yields. The role of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species in the activation step and alkene selectivity is crucial, with Cr3+ entities being particularly active in propylene formation. The proposed mechanism suggests that the presence of Cr3+ in Cr3+OCa2+ entities facilitates the release of lattice oxygen, which is essential for propene production.
