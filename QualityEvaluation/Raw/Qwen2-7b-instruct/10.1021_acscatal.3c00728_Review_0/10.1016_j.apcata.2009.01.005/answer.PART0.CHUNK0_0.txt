[1] "Processes manufacturing alkenes by alkanes dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen have been developed and commercialized for over 60 years."
[2] "However, in the case of propane ODH, there are still unanswered questions concerning the activation step and the factors governing the alkene selectivity."
[3] "Chromium oxide based catalysts have been extensively investigated, especially the well known Philips catalyst (Cr/SiO2) which was first designed for polymerisation."
[4] "It involves the contribution of oxygen vacancies or Cr2+ species."
[5] "In ethane ODH, cobalt exchanged (Co2+/Ca2+) hydroxyapatite showed an ethylene yield of 22% at 550 C."
[6] "This prompted us to study the catalytic behaviour of chromium-loaded calcium-hydroxyapatite (Cr(x)/CaHAp) in propane ODH, which has not been investigated up to now."
