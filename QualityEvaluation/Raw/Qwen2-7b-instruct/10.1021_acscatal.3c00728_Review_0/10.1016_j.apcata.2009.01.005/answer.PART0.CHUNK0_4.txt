[1] "Processes manufacturing alkenes by alkanes dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen have been developed and commercialized for over 60 years."
[2] "However, the process consumes a lot of energy. It also limits the alkenes selectivity and favours carbon deposition on the active sites."
[3] "The addition of O2 (or N2O) to the reaction mixture allows performing exothermic oxidative dehydrogenations (ODHs)."
[4] "The catalytic performance of Cr/TiO2 and Co/TiO2 catalysts in ethane ODH was shown to be enhanced by the addition of phosphorus."
[5] "It is often accepted that, in the case of propane ODH, the active centres are Cr3+ clusters, generally resulting from the reduction of higher oxidation states (Cr5+ and Cr6+)."
[6] "The majority of Cr3+ ions are located on the apatite surface; they do not form Cr2O3 crystallites but isolated Cr3+OCa2+ or Cr3+OCr3+ entities at the highest Cr amounts."
[7] "The proposed mechanism involves the contribution of oxygen vacancies or Cr2+ species."
[8] "The Cr(x)/CaHAp catalysts were tested in propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the 300550 C temperature range."
[9] "The Cr6+ centres initially present on the catalysts may initiate the cracking of propane because of their acidity and improve the conversion; however, as they are reduced by the reaction mixture, the propane conversion decreases upon running at 550 C."
[10] "Cr2+ ions are also formed upon running."
[11] "Isolated Cr3+ species are believed to be responsible for the propylene formation (propylene yield around 7% at 550 C)."
[12] "The performance of the catalysts depends on the Cr content mainly at low conversion."
[13] "For conversion > 16%, the performance is less different but the best one is recorded for x  2.9 wt.% (selectivity near 40%, propylene yield 7%)."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown over time due to its versatile applications across various industries, including plastics, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Its demand is driven by the increasing needs for these applications, leading to the development of more efficient and cost-effective methods of propene production. Propane dehydrogenation offers a preferred production method compared to traditional methods because it provides a more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternative. By adding oxygen to the reaction mixture, the process becomes exothermic, which reduces energy consumption and results in a cleaner production process. Moreover, the use of chromium-loaded hydroxyapatite catalysts enhances the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation, leading to higher propene yields and improved selectivity. The economic advantage lies in the ability to produce propene at a lower cost while minimizing environmental impact. The environmental benefit comes from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and waste produced during the production process. 

The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include:
1. Cost-effectiveness: The process uses fewer resources and energy, leading to lower production costs.
2. Cleaner production: By being exothermic, the process generates heat rather than requiring additional energy input, reducing the overall carbon footprint.
3. Improved selectivity: The use of specific catalysts, such as chromium-loaded hydroxyapatite, ensures a higher yield of propene with minimal side reactions, enhancing the efficiency of the process.
4. Reduced waste: The method minimizes the generation of hazardous byproducts, promoting sustainable industrial practices.

These advantages make propane dehydrogenation an attractive option for propene production, especially as demand for propene continues to grow in various sectors.
