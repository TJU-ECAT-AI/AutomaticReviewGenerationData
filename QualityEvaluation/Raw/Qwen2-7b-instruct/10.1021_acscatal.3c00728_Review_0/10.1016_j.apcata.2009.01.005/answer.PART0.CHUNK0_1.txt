[1] "Processes manufacturing alkenes by alkanes dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen have been developed and commercialized for over 60 years."
[2] "However, the process consumes a lot of energy. It also limits the alkenes selectivity and favours carbon deposition on the active sites."
[3] "The addition of O2 (or N2O) to the reaction mixture allows performing exothermic oxidative dehydrogenations (ODHs)."
[4] "The catalytic performance of Cr/TiO2 and Co/TiO2 catalysts in ethane ODH was shown to be enhanced by the addition of phosphorus."
[5] "The observed improvements were attributed to the modification of the acidbase properties of the catalysts and to the increase of their stability."
[6] "In ethane ODH, cobalt exchanged (Co2+/Ca2+) hydroxyapatite showed an ethylene yield of 22% at 550 C."
[7] "This good performance was attributed to isolated Co2+ sites on the apatite surface and to lattice oxygen mobility induced by cobalt incorporation in the phosphate network."
[8] "It must be noted that the performance of CaHAp as a carrier is essentially due to its ion-exchange and adjustable acidbase properties."
[9] "The present work focuses on samples synthesized by the cation-exchange method, expected (i) to favour the formation of isolated chromium species and to prevent the formation of bulk chromium oxide."
[10] "In the case of propane ODH, the active centres are Cr3+ clusters, generally resulting from the reduction of higher oxidation states (Cr5+ and Cr6+)."
[11] "After calcination in air, chromium ions are fixed on apatite as isolated species (monochromate), excluding the presence of chromium oxides (Cr2O3, CrO3)."
[12] "At low Cr concentrations (x < 0.5 wt.%) the chromium is mainly in the Cr6+ oxidation state and before the reduction, the samples are yellow."
[13] "In addition, TPR experiments performed on samples calcined under oxygen-free N2 do not lead to any H2 consumption, confirming that Cr is exclusively in the Cr3+ (and Cr2+) oxidation states."
[14] "On the other hand, a series of TPO experiments showed that the reduced samples surprisingly do not consume any oxygen up to 600 C."
[15] "In opposition, the impregnation procedure, often used for preparing chromia-alumina catalysts, should favour the formation of Cr2O3."
[16] "As previously proposed [24] the oxidative dehydrogenation abilities of transition metal ions (TMI) supported on calcium-hydroxyapatite are related to the basic features of CaHAp which promotes hydrogen abstraction, the TMI favouring the reactivity of bridging oxygens."
[17] "It is well accepted that, in ODH of light alkanes, the selectivity decreases when the conversion increases."
[18] "Concerning the drop of propylene selectivity with temperature on high Cr loadings (Fig. 12), it may be associated with the marked decrease of basicity induced by the substitution of Ca2+ by numerous Cr3+, generating [Cr3+OCr3+] sites."
[19] "As Cr3+ is more acid than Ca2+, the decrease of basicity overcompensate the positive effect of chromium on oxygen reactivity for the chromium-richest samples."
