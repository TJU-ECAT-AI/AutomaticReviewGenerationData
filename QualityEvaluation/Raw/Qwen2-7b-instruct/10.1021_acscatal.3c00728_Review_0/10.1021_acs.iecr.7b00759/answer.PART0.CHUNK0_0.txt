[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."
[2] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."
[3] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."
[4] "In addition, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas/refinery gases makes propylene production less expensive via the ODH route."
[5] "The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity."
[6] "Keeping this in mind, a mixed γAl2O3/CaO support is synthesized to achieve the appropriate balance between metal and support functionality."
[7] "In the literature, several models have been studied to describe the oxidative dehydrogenation of lighter hydrocarbons to olefins."
[8] "The developed model satisfactorily predicted product compositions under various operating conditions."
[9] "For propylene formation, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 requires lower activation energy (120.3 kJ/mol) than that of VOx/CaO (126.7 kJ/mol)."
[10] "On the contrary, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 needs higher activation energies (55.2 kJ/mol) for undesired CO2 formation as compared to the activation energies for CO2 formation using VOx/CaO catalyst (32.8 kJ/mol)."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications. Its demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation because this method offers lower energy demands, reduced environmental impact, and competitive costs. It allows for efficient conversion of abundant propane resources into propene, a key building block in petrochemical industries.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene via lattice oxygen of VOx/CaO and VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts is a preferred production method. The mixed γAl2O3/CaO support in VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts enhances active site-support interactions, influencing the formation of propene more selectively. This results in higher propene selectivity (94.1%) and lower CO2 selectivity compared to VOx/CaO catalysts. 

3. The developed kinetic model accurately predicts product compositions under varying operational conditions, showing that VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts require less activation energy (120.3 kJ/mol) for propene formation than VOx/CaO (126.7 kJ/mol). However, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts necessitate higher activation energies (55.2 kJ/mol) for CO2 formation compared to the 32.8 kJ/mol required by VOx/CaO catalysts. This aligns with the observed higher propene selectivity and lower CO2 selectivity with the former.

1. 丙烯在化工行业中的重要性与日俱增，因其广泛的用途。其需求推动了丙烷脱氢化方法的应用，因为这种方法具有较低的能量需求、较小的环境影响和竞争力的价格。它允许高效地将丰富的丙烷资源转化为丙烯，这是石油化学工业的关键构建块。

2. 在没有气体相氧的情况下，通过VOx/CaO和VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂的氧化脱氢化（ODH）方法是生产丙烯的首选方法。在混合γAl2O3/CaO支持的VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂中，增强的活性位点-支持相互作用影响了丙烯的更选择性形成。这导致了94.1%的更高丙烯选择性和较低的二氧化碳选择性与VOx/CaO催化剂相比。

3. 开发的热力学模型准确预测了在不同操作条件下产品的组成，显示了与VOx/CaO相比，VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂在丙烯形成时需要更低的激活能（120.3 kJ/mol），而CO2形成则需要更高的激活能（55.2 kJ/mol）。与使用VOx/CaO催化剂的32.8 kJ/mol相比。这与前者观察到的较高丙烯选择性和较低CO2选择性一致。
