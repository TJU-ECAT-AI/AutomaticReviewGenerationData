[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."
[2] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."
[3] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."
[4] "Another important advantage of ODH of propane is the availability of water as a product, which helps to avoid thermodynamics limitations as observed during catalytic cracking reactions."
[5] "Keeping this in mind, a mixed γAl2O3/CaO support is synthesized to achieve the appropriate balance between metal and support functionality."
[6] "It is observed that VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 displays higher propylene selectivity (94.1%) and lower selectivity of CO2 due to it is moderate active sitesupport interactions."
[7] "On the other hand, the performance of the VOx based catalysts can be improved by controlling their surface morphology and acid-base properties."
[8] "These values are consistent with the product selectivity as observed in the catalyst evaluation experiments."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved as its demand for a versatile olefin across various applications increases. Its importance lies in its use as a building block in the petrochemical industry. Traditional methods such as catalytic cracking face challenges including high energy requirements, coke formation, high operating costs, and low efficiency. In contrast, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers an attractive alternative. This process benefits from exothermic reactions requiring minimal energy, and the availability of water as a product avoids thermodynamic limitations. To enhance propene selectivity and reduce CO2 formation, researchers synthesize catalysts with optimized balance between metal and support functionalities. VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts, for instance, exhibit higher propene selectivity (94.1%) and lower CO2 selectivity due to moderate active sitesupport interactions. Controlling catalyst surface morphology and acid-base properties can further improve their performance.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着其在各种应用领域需求的增加而演变。它作为石油化工行业的基础材料具有重要意义。传统的催化裂解方法面临高能效要求、焦炭生成、高运行成本和低效率等挑战。相比之下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了一种有吸引力的替代方法。这一过程得益于放热反应所需的低能量需求，并且水产品有助于避免催化裂解反应中观察到的热力学限制。为了提高丙烯选择性和降低二氧化碳形成，研究人员合成具有金属和支撑功能适当平衡的催化剂。例如，VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂显示出更高的丙烯选择性（94.1%）和较低的二氧化碳选择性，这是由于它们之间适度的活性位点与支持交互作用。通过控制催化剂表面形态和酸碱性质，可以进一步改善其性能。
