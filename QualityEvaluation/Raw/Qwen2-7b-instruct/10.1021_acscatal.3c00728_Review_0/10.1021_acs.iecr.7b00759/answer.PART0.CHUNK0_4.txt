[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."
[2] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."
[3] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."
[4] "In addition, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas/refinery gases makes propylene production less expensive via the ODH route."
[5] "The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity."
[6] "Another important advantage of ODH of propane is the availability of water as a product, which helps to avoid thermodynamics limitations as observed during catalytic cracking reactions."
[7] "For propylene formation, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 requires lower activation energy (120.3 kJ/mol) than that of VOx/CaO (126.7 kJ/mol)."
[8] "On the contrary, VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 needs higher activation energies (55.2 kJ/mol) for undesired CO2 formation as compared to the activation energies for CO2 formation using VOx/CaO catalyst (32.8 kJ/mol)."
[9] "These values are consistent with the product selectivity as observed in the catalyst evaluation experiments."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved as it serves as a crucial building block for a wide range of applications. Its demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to the high energy efficiency and minimal environmental impact of this approach. Economically, the ODH route is more cost-effective because of the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery gases. Environmentally, it produces fewer emissions compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking. The use of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalysts offers lower activation energy for propene formation (120.3 kJ/mol) and higher activation energy for undesired CO2 formation (55.2 kJ/mol) compared to VOx/CaO catalysts (126.7 kJ/mol for propene and 32.8 kJ/mol for CO2). This results in superior propene selectivity and lower CO2 selectivity, aligning with the observed product selectivity in the catalyst evaluation experiments.

丙烯在化工行业的地位已经随着它作为广泛应用的基础材料而不断演变。其需求推动了丙烷脱氢作为一种首选生产方法的采用，这归功于这种方法的高度能源效率和对环境影响的最小化。从经济角度来看，ODH路线更为成本效益，因为丙烷在天然气和炼油厂气体中具有丰富的可用性。环境方面，与传统的催化裂解方法相比，它的排放量更少。使用VOx/CaO-γAl2O3催化剂可以实现更低的丙烯形成激活能（120.3 kJ/mol）和更高的CO2形成激活能（55.2 kJ/mol），与VOx/CaO催化剂相比（丙烯为126.7 kJ/mol，CO2为32.8 kJ/mol）。这导致了更高的丙烯选择性和更低的CO2选择性，并与催化剂评估实验观察到的产品选择性相一致。
