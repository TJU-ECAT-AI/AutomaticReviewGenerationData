[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."
[2] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."
[3] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."
[4] "Another important advantage of ODH of propane is the availability of water as a product, which helps to avoid thermodynamics limitations as observed during catalytic cracking reactions."
[5] "Appropriate reactor selection is an important aspect for developing commercial scale ODH of propane technology."
[6] "The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation because of its advantages over conventional catalytic cracking methods. These advantages include lower energy requirements, reduced coke formation, lower operating costs, and higher efficiency. The exothermic nature of the ODH process enables minimal energy consumption, making it an attractive alternative. Additionally, the availability of water as a product in the ODH process helps mitigate thermodynamic limitations observed in catalytic cracking. Appropriate reactor design is crucial for commercial-scale implementation. Moreover, the ODH process produces propene with minimal environmental impact, owing to its low energy demand and high product selectivity.
