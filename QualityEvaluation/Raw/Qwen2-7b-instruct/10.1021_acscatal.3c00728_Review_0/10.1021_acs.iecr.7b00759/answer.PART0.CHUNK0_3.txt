### How has propene's significance in the chemical industry evolved, and in what ways does its increasing demand drive the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method? Additionally, what are the economic and environmental advantages of this approach in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications?

**Answer:** Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications and its role as a key building block in the petrochemical sector. As demand for propene increases, industries seek more efficient and cost-effective methods to produce it. Propane dehydrogenation offers an attractive alternative because it involves exothermic reactions that require minimal energy input, making it economically viable. Additionally, this process avoids thermodynamic limitations often encountered in catalytic cracking reactions, providing a more sustainable solution. Economically, this method can lead to substantial cost savings due to reduced energy requirements and potential for higher yield. Environmentally, it promotes cleaner production processes since it generates less pollution compared to traditional methods. The availability of water as a byproduct further aids in maintaining thermodynamic stability, enhancing the overall environmental benefits of this approach.

### What are the economic and environmental advantages of this approach in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications?

**Answer:** The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower energy consumption, potentially leading to cost savings and increased profitability for producers. It also enables more efficient use of raw materials, such as propane, which can be sourced from abundant natural gas reserves. Environmentally, this process is more sustainable due to its reduced energy demands and lower emissions compared to conventional methods. The availability of water as a byproduct helps in avoiding thermodynamic limitations, contributing to a more environmentally friendly production process. Furthermore, the ability to produce propene in a cleaner manner aligns with growing global concerns over reducing industrial carbon footprints and promoting green chemistry practices.

### How does the use of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst compare to VOx/CaO in terms of propylene selectivity and undesired CO2 formation?

**Answer:** VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst demonstrates higher propylene selectivity and lower selectivity for CO2 formation compared to VOx/CaO. This is attributed to the moderate level of acidity and moderate metal-support interaction of the VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 catalyst, as evidenced by temperature-programmed reduction analysis. The mixed CaO-γAl2O3 support in VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 provides a better influence on the propylene formation reaction, leading to superior propylene selectivity. In contrast, VOx/CaO requires higher activation energies for CO2 formation via direct oxidation of propane, resulting in a higher CO2 selectivity. These differences highlight the improved performance of VOx/CaO-γAl2O3 in producing propylene with reduced CO2 formation, making it a preferred catalyst for propane dehydrogenation processes.
