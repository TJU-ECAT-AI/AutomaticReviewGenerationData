[1] "Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene form the foundation of the modern chemical industry, with yearly production volumes well into the hundreds of millions of metric tons."
[2] "Currently, these light olefins are mainly produced via energy-intensive steam cracking."
[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to produce olefins allows for lower operation temperatures and extended catalyst lifetimes, potentially leading to valuable process efficiencies."
[4] "The potential benefits of this route have led to significant research interest due to the wide availability of natural gas from shale deposits."
[5] "Advances in this area have still not yielded catalysts that are sufficiently selective to olefins for industrial implementation, and ODH still remains a holy grail of selective alkane oxidation research."
[6] "The main challenge in selective oxidation lies in preventing the overoxidation of the desired product, such as propylene during propane oxidation, to CO and CO2."
[7] "Research into selective heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has led to the extensive use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, and studies on the surface mechanism involved have been used to improve the catalytic activity of the material."
[8] "Despite decades of research, however, selectivity toward propylene has not proven satisfactory at industrially relevant conversions."
[9] "It is imperative for new catalytic systems that minimize product overoxidation to be developed for future applications of oxidative dehydrogenation processes."

The chemical industry's reliance on light olefins like ethylene and propylene is significant, with production volumes reaching hundreds of millions of metric tons annually. Traditionally, these olefins are produced through steam cracking, a process that is energy-intensive. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes offers a more energy-efficient alternative with lower operating temperatures and longer catalyst lifetimes. However, despite extensive research, catalysts for ODH that can selectively produce olefins without overoxidation have not been developed. The main challenge is to prevent the overoxidation of products like propylene to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been used extensively in this process, but their selectivity towards propylene has not been satisfactory at industrial scales. The development of new catalyst systems that can minimize product overoxidation is crucial for the future applications of ODH processes.

现代化学工业对轻烯烃如乙烯和丙烯的依赖性是巨大的，每年的生产量达到数亿公吨。传统上，这些烯烃通过蒸汽裂解生产，这是一个能源密集型过程。氧化脱氢（ODH）通过轻烷烃产生烯烃，提供了更节能的选择，具有较低的操作温度和更长的催化剂寿命。然而，尽管进行了大量研究，但尚未开发出能够在工业规模下选择性地生产烯烃而不发生过氧化的催化剂。主要挑战在于防止产品如丙烯氧化为二氧化碳和一氧化碳。已经广泛使用了以二氧化钒为基础的催化剂，并且对其表面机制的研究已被用于提高材料的催化活性。然而，尽管如此，在工业相关转化率下，向丙烯的选则性仍未得到满足。对于未来ODH过程的应用而言，开发能够最小化产品过氧化的新催化剂系统至关重要。
