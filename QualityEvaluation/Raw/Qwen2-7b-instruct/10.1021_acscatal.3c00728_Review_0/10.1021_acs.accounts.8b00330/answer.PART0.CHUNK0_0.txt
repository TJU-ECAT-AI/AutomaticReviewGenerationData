[1] "Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene form the foundation of the modern chemical industry, with yearly production volumes well into the hundreds of millions of metric tons."
[2] "Currently, these light olefins are mainly produced via energy-intensive steam cracking."
[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to produce olefins allows for lower operation temperatures and extended catalyst lifetimes, potentially leading to valuable process efficiencies."
[4] "The potential benefits of this route have led to significant research interest due to the wide availability of natural gas from shale deposits."
[5] "Advances in this area have still not yielded catalysts that are sufficiently selective to olefins for industrial implementation, and ODH still remains a holy grail of selective alkane oxidation research."
[6] "It is imperative for new catalytic systems that minimize product overoxidation to be developed for future applications of oxidative dehydrogenation processes."
