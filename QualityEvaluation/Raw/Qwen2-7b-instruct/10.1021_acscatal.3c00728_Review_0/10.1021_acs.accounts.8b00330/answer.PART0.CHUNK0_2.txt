1. Propene plays a crucial role in the chemical industry as one of the most vital organic feedstocks, with substantial global production capacities of 110 Mt. The potential advantages of the propane dehydrogenation route, given the ample supply of natural gas from shale, have sparked significant research interest. Despite extensive studies over decades, achieving adequate selectivity towards propylene at industrially applicable conversion levels remains a challenge. Our findings suggest that boron-containing compounds, including hexagonal boron nitride (BN), exhibit unique reactivity during the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, offering a promising avenue for propylene production.

2. Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methodologies, particularly two-dimensional correlation experiments, are essential for comprehensively interpreting the spectral data obtained from our boron-based catalysts. These techniques provide insights into the complex surface species present on the catalysts after the oxidative dehydrogenation process, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved.

1. 丙烯在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色，作为最重要的有机基础原料之一，其全球生产能力达到110亿吨。由于页岩气供应充足，丙烷脱氢路线潜在的优势引发了显著的研究兴趣。尽管在过去几十年里进行了大量研究，但在工业相关转化水平下实现丙烯选择性仍然存在挑战。我们的发现表明，包括六方氮化硼（BN）在内的硼基化合物在轻烷烃氧化脱氢过程中表现出独特的活性，为丙烯生产提供了有前景的途径。

2. 固态核磁共振（NMR）方法，尤其是二维相关实验，对于全面解释我们催化剂上获得的谱图数据至关重要。这些技术为我们提供了关于氧化脱氢过程后催化剂表面复杂物种的见解，有助于深入理解催化机制。
