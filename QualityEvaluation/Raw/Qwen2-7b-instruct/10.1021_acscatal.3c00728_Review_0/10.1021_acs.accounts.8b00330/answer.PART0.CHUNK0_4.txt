[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively."
[2] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels."
[3] "Despite these benefits, a selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to their respective olefins has been sought after for many decades to no avail, due to the delicate balance between the conversion of the alkane to the olefin and its subsequent overoxidation to CO and CO2."
[4] "We observed a higher selectivity to propylene than what was reported for metal oxides."
[5] "Furthermore, hBN is selective in the transformation of C2C4 alkanes, while metal oxide catalyst systems need to be tailored to the particular substrate in order to optimize olefin selectivity."
[6] "We monitored the influence of reactant partial pressures on the rate of alkane consumption and found a second order rate dependence on alkane partial pressure and only a minor dependence on oxygen partial pressure."
[7] "These observations highlight the need for research focused on determining (a) a reaction mechanism explaining the product distribution and kinetics and (b) the active site structures under reaction conditions."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its widespread use across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it allows for lower operation temperatures and extended catalyst lifetimes, potentially leading to valuable process efficiencies. Economically, this approach reduces energy consumption and extends the operational lifespan of catalysts. Environmentally, it minimizes emissions and waste production compared to traditional steam cracking methods, contributing to a more sustainable chemical industry.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional dehydrogenation (DH) processes. The endothermic nature of ODH requires less energy input compared to DH, which is exothermic and equilibrium-limited. Lower temperatures and pressures are sufficient to achieve desired alkane conversions, reducing the need for high-energy inputs and decreasing the risk of catalyst deactivation. The absence of coke deposition in ODH processes also simplifies maintenance and reduces operational costs. Additionally, ODH processes emit fewer pollutants and waste products, making them more environmentally friendly.

3. The selectivity of hBN towards propylene was notably higher than that of metal oxides, indicating a superior performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. hBN is selective in transforming C2C4 alkanes, offering a more consistent performance across different substrates compared to metal oxide catalyst systems. The second-order dependence on alkane partial pressure suggests a strong affinity for the reactant, while the minor dependence on oxygen partial pressure highlights the role of hBN in oxygen activation, which is critical for selective alkane oxidation.

4. The reactivity of hBN decreased rapidly after removing oxygen from the reactor feedstream, providing evidence that oxygen activation occurs in situ. The formation of BOH vibrations on the hBN surface after ODH treatments confirmed the interaction between boron and oxygen, which is essential for the observed catalytic activity.

5. The common conversion-selectivity trends observed with various borides suggest a shared active site responsible for the high olefin selectivity of these materials. This finding points towards a fundamental understanding of the surface chemistry involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

6. To elucidate the reaction mechanism and active site structures, researchers need to investigate the in situ formation of BOx species on the catalyst surface. By understanding the nature of these species, they can develop a comprehensive mechanistic framework for boron-based ODH catalysts, which will aid in optimizing catalyst performance and advancing the field of selective alkane oxidation.

1. 丙烯在化学工业中的重要性与日俱增，其需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。这一过程的优势在于它可以使用较低的操作温度和延长催化剂寿命，从而提高过程效率。经济上，这种方法降低了能量消耗并延长了催化剂的使用寿命，减少了与传统蒸汽裂解方法相比的运营成本。环境方面，脱氢过程排放的污染物和废物较少，使其更加环保。

2. 脱氢（DH）过程是吸热的且处于平衡限制下，需要较高的温度和较低的压力来推动物料转化为所需的烯烃。相反，氧化脱氢（ODH）过程是放热的，并且没有DH过程的平衡限制。因此，ODH过程需要的能量更少，更低的温度和压力就足以实现所需的烷烃转化。ODH过程中不存在焦炭沉积，简化了维护并降低了运营成本。此外，ODH过程排放的污染物和废物更少，使它们对环境更为友好。

3. 我们观察到hBN的丙烯选择性高于金属氧化物，这表明其在丙烷氧化脱氢中表现出优越性能。hBN在C2C4烷烃的转换上具有选择性，与金属氧化物催化剂系统相比，在不同基质上提供了更一致的性能。烷烃分压的二次依赖性表明了hBN对反应物的强烈亲和力，而氧气分压的微弱依赖性强调了hBN在氧激活中的作用，这是选择性烷烃氧化的关键。

4. 在移除氧气后，hBN的活性迅速下降，这为原位发生氧气激活提供了证据。在进行ODH处理后，hBN表面形成BOH振动，证实了硼与氧之间的相互作用，这是观察到催化活性所必需的。

5. 各种硼化物共同的转化-选择性趋势表明了一个共享的活性位点负责这些材料的高烯烃选择性。这一发现指出了表面化学在氧化脱氢过程中涉及的基本理解，有助于优化催化剂性能并推进选择性烷烃氧化领域的发展。

6. 为了阐明反应机制和活性位点结构，研究人员需要研究催化剂表面的原位形成BOx物种。通过理解这些物种的性质，他们可以为硼基ODH催化剂建立一个全面的机制框架，这将有助于优化催化剂性能并推动该领域的进步。
