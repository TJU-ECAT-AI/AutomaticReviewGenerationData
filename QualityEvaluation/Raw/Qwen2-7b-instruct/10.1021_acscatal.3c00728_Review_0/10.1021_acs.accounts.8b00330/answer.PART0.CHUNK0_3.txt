[1] "Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene form the foundation of the modern chemical industry, with yearly production volumes well into the hundreds of millions of metric tons."
[2] "Currently, these light olefins are mainly produced via energy-intensive steam cracking."
[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to produce olefins allows for lower operation temperatures and extended catalyst lifetimes, potentially leading to valuable process efficiencies."
[4] "The potential benefits of this route have led to significant research interest due to the wide availability of natural gas from shale deposits."
[5] "Advances in this area have still not yielded catalysts that are sufficiently selective to olefins for industrial implementation, and ODH still remains a holy grail of selective alkane oxidation research."
[6] "Research into selective heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has led to the extensive use of vanadium oxide-based catalysts, and studies on the surface mechanism involved have been used to improve the catalytic activity of the material."
[7] "Despite decades of research, however, selectivity toward propylene has not proven satisfactory at industrially relevant conversions."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers lower operation temperatures and extended catalyst lifetimes compared to traditional steam cracking. This approach is more energy-efficient and potentially leads to valuable process efficiencies. However, advances in this area have yet to yield catalysts that can selectively produce propene at industrially relevant conversions. Research into selective heterogeneous catalysts for propane dehydrogenation has utilized vanadium oxide-based catalysts, but these have not proven satisfactory in terms of selectivity toward propene.
