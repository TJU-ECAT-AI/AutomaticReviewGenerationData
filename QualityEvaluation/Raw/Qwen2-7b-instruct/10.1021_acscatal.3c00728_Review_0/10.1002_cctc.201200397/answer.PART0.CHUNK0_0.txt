[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "Of the processes used in the synthesis of propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."
[3] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."
[4] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."
[5] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction."
[7] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[8] "Mebel et al. reported that the activation energy for the dissociation of CO2 on Ni atoms is significantly lowered than that for CO2 in the absence of Ni atoms through abinitio calculations."
[9] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[10] "To verify the effect of Ni, three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and exsitu XPS experiments were performed."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications in the production of essential products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach is economically advantageous as it efficiently converts propane into propene, which is crucial for various industries. Environmentally, using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction minimizes the emission of greenhouse gases while ensuring the reoxidation of the reduced active phase, enhancing sustainability. CrOx/silica catalysts, known for their high activity in ODHP reactions, are employed in this process. The key active sites in these reactions are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species. However, these catalysts face challenges due to rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and CrOx reduction. Ni-based catalysts, which are widely used in CO2 reforming and RWGS reactions, are particularly effective in reducing the activation energy for CO2 dissociation. The generation of O*ads on Ni facilitates the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species, contributing to the stability and efficiency of the ODHP reaction. To assess the impact of Ni, researchers conducted three-step H2-TPR and exsitu XPS experiments.
