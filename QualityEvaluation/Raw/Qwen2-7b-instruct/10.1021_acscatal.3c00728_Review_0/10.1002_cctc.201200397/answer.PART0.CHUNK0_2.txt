Propylene is crucial in the petrochemical industry due to its versatility in producing valuable derivatives like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. CO2 is often utilized as an alternative C1 building block and soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This method avoids coke deposition and facilitates the reoxidation of the reduced active phase. CrOx/silica is recognized as an efficient catalyst for ODHP reactions due to its high activity. However, the primary cause of deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is attributed to the reduction of CrOx. Nickel (Ni) plays a key role in enhancing the ODHP reaction by promoting CO2 dissociation into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which in turn regenerates the reduced CrOx. This leads to improved stability in propylene production when using Ni-promoted CrOx/silica catalysts.

丙烯在石油化工行业中的重要性在于，它可以用作生产如苯基、丙烯腈、丙二醇和聚丙烯等高价值产品的前体。二氧化碳经常作为替代的C1构建块和软氧化剂用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）。这种方法可以避免焦炭沉积，并促进活性位点的重新氧化。CrOx/silica被认为是ODHP反应中高效的催化剂，由于其高活性。然而，CrOx/silica催化剂失活的主要原因归咎于CrOx的还原。镍（Ni）在提高ODHP反应性能方面起着关键作用，通过促进二氧化碳分解成CO和激活氧（O*ads），进而再生还原的CrOx。这导致使用Ni增强的CrOx/silica催化剂时，丙烯生产的稳定性得到改善。
