[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility as a precursor for the production of valuable products including cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. The increasing demand for propene drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach meets the growing needs for propene across various applications economically and environmentally. The use of CO2 in the ODHP process not only utilizes a greenhouse gas but also eliminates coke deposition, maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene production.
