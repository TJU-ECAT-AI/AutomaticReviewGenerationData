[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "This is supported by evidence that higher valence Cr states reduce immediately after coming into contact with alkanes at high temperature."
[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."
[4] "CO2 can also be used as an oxygen transfer agent or as a soft oxidant. By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."
[5] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[6] "Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions. Mebel etal. reported that the activation energy for the dissociation of CO2 on Ni atoms is significantly lowered than that for CO2 in the absence of Ni atoms through abinitio calculations."
[7] "Choe etal. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 by using a molecular orbital method on Ni(111) within a 25-atom cluster. The strong chemisorption of CO2 on Ni leads to the bending of the molecule because the d orbital is mixed with 2πμ in the CO2 orbital to form 6a1."
[8] "Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."
[9] "To verify the effect of Ni, three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and exsitu XPS experiments were performed."
[10] "In the case of 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalysts, no peak assigned to NiO was observed because the amount of NiO was too small to be detectable or was highly dispersed on the Cr/Si catalyst."

Propylene plays a crucial role in the petrochemical industry as it serves as a key precursor for producing valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. High-valence chromium states quickly reduce upon contact with alkanes at high temperatures. Chromium oxide (CrOx) catalysts, while highly active, suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction, converting the active Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can function as an oxygen transfer agent or a soft oxidant. Utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) helps eliminate coke deposition and reoxidizes the reduced active phase. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing capability, particularly in reoxidizing reduced CrOx, due to its thermodynamic stability. Nickel-based catalysts, widely used in CO2 reforming reactions, effectively activate CO2, even under harsh conditions. The dissociation energy of CO2 on nickel atoms is notably lower compared to when CO2 exists without nickel. CO2 adsorption and dissociation on nickel surfaces, as studied by Choe et al., involve strong chemisorption that bends the molecule, leading to the formation of 6a1 orbitals through mixing of the d orbital with the CO2 orbital's 2πμ. The generated oxygen adsorbates (O*ads) on nickel could facilitate the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction. To assess the impact of nickel, researchers conducted three-step hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and ex situ XPS experiments. In the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalysts, no peak attributed to nickel oxide (NiO) was detected, indicating that the amount of NiO was too small or dispersed to be identified.

丙烯在石油化工行业具有重要作用，因为它可以作为生产重要产品的前体，如苯甲醚、丙烯腈、丙二醇和聚丙烯。高电荷铬状态在高温下与烷烃接触时会迅速减少。铬氧化物（CrOx）催化剂虽然活性很高，但因焦炭沉积和还原而迅速失活，将活性的Cr3+状态转化为无活性的Cr2+状态。二氧化碳（CO2）可以作为氧传输剂或软氧化剂使用。在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中使用CO2作为软氧化剂有助于消除焦炭沉积并重新氧化还原后的活性相。然而，CO2的氧化能力有限，尤其是在重新氧化还原后的CrOx方面，由于其热力学稳定性。基于镍的催化剂广泛应用于CO2重整反应，能够有效地激活CO2，即使在苛刻条件下也是如此。与没有镍时相比，CO2在镍原子上的分解能明显降低。通过Choe等人的研究，CO2在镍表面的吸附和分解涉及强化学吸附，导致分子弯曲，形成6a1轨道，通过混合镍的d轨道与CO2轨道的2πμ。生成的氧吸附物（O*ads）在镍表面上可以促进ODHP反应中还原的CrOx物种的重新氧化。为了评估镍的影响，研究人员进行了三步氢温度程序化减少（TPR）和离线XPS实验。在0.5Ni-Cr/Si催化剂中，未检测到归因于镍氧化物（NiO）的峰，表明NiO的量太小或分散，无法识别。
