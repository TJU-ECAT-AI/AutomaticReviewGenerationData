[1] "For the industrially relevant oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), activated carbon, carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanotubes as catalysts have been intensively studied for numerous hydrocarbon substrates, including ethylbenzene,3n-butane,2 propane4 and ethane."
[2] "Compared to traditional metal catalysts, nanocarbon materials have significant advantages owing to their unique controllability of physical and chemical properties through structural modification and surface functionalization."
[3] "Modification with phosphate or borate has been found to efficiently inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 to improve catalyst stability, and simultaneously sustain the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface with enhanced selectivity."
[4] "In the ODH reaction, we focused on revealing the nature of the borate modification effect on the catalysis process, providing insights into its interaction with the carbon surface."
[5] "An increasing resistance to oxidation with increasing boron content can be found, in which the oxidation temperatures were improved by 20220 C (T50%) as compared to the unmodified one."
[6] "The propene selectivity decreased when the conversion increased, which was due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane."
[7] "However, when the borate loading was higher than 15 wt%, the selectivity of dehydrogenation declined accompanied by an increase of COx."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased due to its wide range of applications, making it a crucial component in the production of various chemicals, plastics, and solvents. As a result, the use of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method has gained prominence. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, it allows for the efficient conversion of abundant propane resources into valuable propene, enhancing the profitability of petrochemical processes. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation can be more sustainable compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing emissions and waste. Moreover, by utilizing non-metallic catalysts like nanocarbon materials, this process can avoid the complexities and potential hazards associated with polyvalent metal sites, offering a safer and cleaner alternative for large-scale industrial applications.
