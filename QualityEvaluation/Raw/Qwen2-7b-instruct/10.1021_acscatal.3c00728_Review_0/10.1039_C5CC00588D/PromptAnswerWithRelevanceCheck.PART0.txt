[1] "For the industrially relevant oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), activated carbon, carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanotubes as catalysts have been intensively studied for numerous hydrocarbon substrates, including ethylbenzene,3n-butane,2 propane4 and ethane."
[2] "Compared to traditional metal catalysts, nanocarbon materials have significant advantages owing to their unique controllability of physical and chemical properties through structural modification and surface functionalization."
[3] "This is consistent with the reported work which demonstrated that borate modification could efficiently enhance the thermal stability of carbon materials."
[4] "An increasing resistance to oxidation with increasing boron content can be found, in which the oxidation temperatures were improved by 20220 C (T50%) as compared to the unmodified one."
[5] "The propene selectivity gradually increased from 47% to 65%; concomitantly, the formation of carbon oxide (COx) was efficiently inhibited."
[6] "However, when the borate loading was higher than 15 wt%, the selectivity of dehydrogenation declined accompanied by an increase of COx."
[7] "This demonstrates that borate mainly occupied the combustion sites at the low amount, while an excess of borate (>15 wt%) resulted in the moderate inhibition effect on the reaction rate and reactant conversions."
[8] "Therefore, a significant aspect herein that needs our further exploration is to reveal the interaction between boron and the carbon surface, thus providing an insight into this modification effect for ODH reaction."
[9] "This means that the boron oxide, underwent a strong interaction with certain different preferred sites on the AND surface."
[10] "They can be linked together by forming the OH bond and efficiently suppress the generation of electrophilic oxygen species, as demonstrated by TGA analysis in Fig. 4a, which should account for the increased selectivity during reaction."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased due to its wide usage across various applications, including plastics, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The growing demand has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for propene production. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation reduces dependency on traditional oil sources, providing a more cost-effective and sustainable supply chain. Environmentally, this method often results in lower emissions compared to conventional production processes, contributing to a cleaner manufacturing process.

Borate modification on nanodiamonds can enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, improving the selectivity towards propene. This modification also increases the thermal stability of the catalysts, allowing for more efficient and safer reactions. The key to optimizing this process lies in understanding how boron interacts with the carbon surface, which can influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Through careful control of boron loading, the catalytic performance can be regulated, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly propene production.

The mechanism behind borate modification involves boron interacting with the carbon surface to suppress the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, thereby enhancing propene selectivity. Specifically, boron forms OH bonds with defect sites on the carbon surface, effectively blocking the generation of harmful oxygen species. This interaction leads to an increased selectivity for propene production, as demonstrated by the observed changes in product distribution with varying boron loading.

[1] "Due to undesirable, consecutive and parallel combustion reactions in ODH, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbons are not sufficient to satisfy economic feasibility."
[2] "Modification with phosphate or borate has been found to efficiently inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 to improve catalyst stability, and simultaneously sustain the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface with enhanced selectivity."
[3] "This is consistent with the reported work which demonstrated that borate modification could efficiently enhance the thermal stability of carbon materials."
[4] "The propene selectivity decreased when the conversion increased, which was due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane."
[5] "This incontrovertibly indicates that the further interaction occurred between BO3 configurations with the active carbonyl groups on the AND surface, thus resulting in decreased catalytic activity at the high loading amount."

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbon materials are insufficient to meet economic demands due to undesirable combustion reactions. To improve catalyst stability and enhance selectivity, modifications with phosphate or borate have been found effective. Borate modification specifically enhances the thermal stability of carbon materials, which is crucial for industrial applications.

2. The propene selectivity in the ODH reaction decreases with increased conversion, primarily because propene is more reactive than propane. This highlights the trade-off between conversion efficiency and product selectivity in the ODH process.

3. The interaction between boron oxide and the carbon surface, particularly at lower boron loading amounts, leads to the formation of OH bonds. These bonds suppress the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, thereby increasing propene selectivity during the ODH reaction.

4. At high loading amounts of boron, the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated boron blocks active carbonyl groups, significantly reducing the propene formation rate. This demonstrates that the optimal borate modification can be precisely controlled for enhanced catalytic performance.

5. The further interaction between BO3 configurations and the active carbonyl groups on the AND surface results in a decrease in catalytic activity at higher boron loading levels. This finding is critical for understanding the mechanism of borate-modified nanocarbon catalysts in ODH processes.

1. 在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，纳米碳材料催化下的烯烃产率不足以满足经济可行性，这是由于不希望的连续和并行燃烧反应。为了提高催化剂稳定性并增强选择性，磷酸或硼酸的修饰被发现是有效的。硼酸修饰可以有效提高碳材料的热稳定性，这对于工业应用至关重要。

2. 在ODH反应中，当转化率增加时，丙烯的选择性降低，主要是因为丙烯比丙烷更活泼。这强调了在ODH过程中转化效率与产物选择性之间的权衡。

3. 在较低的硼含量下，硼氧化物与碳表面的相互作用导致OH键的形成。这些键抑制了电负性氧物种的生成，从而在ODH反应中增加了丙烯的选择性。

4. 在高硼含量下，四面体协调的硼形成，阻塞了活性羰基基团，显著降低了丙烯的生成速率。这表明最优的硼酸修饰可以精确控制以增强催化性能。

5. 在更高的硼负载水平下，BO3配置与AND表面上的活性羰基团之间的进一步相互作用导致催化活性下降。这一发现对于理解硼酸修饰纳米碳催化剂在ODH过程中的机制至关重要。

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it provides a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce propene compared to traditional methods. Economically, propane dehydrogenation allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources to yield propene, which is widely used in the production of plastics, rubbers, and solvents. Environmentally, this approach reduces emissions and waste compared to alternative production routes, making it a sustainable choice for industries seeking to meet the growing needs for propene.

2. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include the efficient use of abundant propane resources, the production of high-quality propene with reduced emissions, and the ability to operate with lower energy consumption compared to other processes. This makes it a viable option for industries looking to reduce costs and environmental impact while meeting the demand for propene.

3. Borate modification has proven to be an effective method to enhance the alkene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane. It improves catalyst stability by inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of oxygen, allowing for selective oxygen species to remain on the catalyst surface, which increases the yield of desired alkene products.

4. At a borate loading amount of less than 15 wt%, borate modification significantly enhances the alkene selectivity in the ODH reaction of propane. However, when the loading exceeds this amount, it leads to a decline in the dehydrogenation selectivity, accompanied by an increase in the formation of unwanted carbon oxides (COx). This suggests that there is an optimal loading amount of borate that maximizes alkene selectivity without negatively impacting the dehydrogenation process.
