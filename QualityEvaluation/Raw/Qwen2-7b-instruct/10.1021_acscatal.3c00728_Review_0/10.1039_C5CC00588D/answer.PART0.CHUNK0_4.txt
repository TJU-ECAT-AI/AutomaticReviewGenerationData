[1] "For the industrially relevant oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), activated carbon, carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanotubes as catalysts have been intensively studied for numerous hydrocarbon substrates, including ethylbenzene,3n-butane,2 propane4 and ethane."
[2] "Compared to traditional metal catalysts, nanocarbon materials have significant advantages owing to their unique controllability of physical and chemical properties through structural modification and surface functionalization."
[3] "Due to undesirable, consecutive and parallel combustion reactions in ODH, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbons are not sufficient to satisfy economic feasibility."
[4] "Modification with phosphate or borate has been found to efficiently inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 to improve catalyst stability, and simultaneously sustain the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface with enhanced selectivity."
[5] "The adsorption sites of borate at different loading amounts are thoroughly considered."
[6] "However, when the borate loading was higher than 15 wt%, the selectivity of dehydrogenation declined accompanied by an increase of COx."
[7] "In order to gain further insight into the role of borate in ODH reaction, Fig. 1b gives the propene and COx formation rates, as well as the conversion of propane and oxygen over different samples, which were normalized on the same mass of AND."
[8] "It has been well established by previous studies that the borate modification can provide increased selectivity for ODH reaction,10,12 which should originate from the interaction between boron and the carbon surface."
[9] "The existing state of borate on the AND surface during reaction can be confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)."
[10] "This incontrovertibly indicates that the further interaction occurred between BO3 configurations with the active carbonyl groups on the AND surface, thus resulting in decreased catalytic activity at the high loading amount."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased due to its versatility in various applications. Its growing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it allows for efficient conversion of propane into propene, a critical feedstock for the synthesis of other valuable chemicals. This process is economically advantageous as it meets the rising needs for propene, which is widely used in the production of plastics, solvents, and other chemical intermediates. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation offers benefits over traditional metal-catalyzed processes due to the use of nanocarbon materials, which have unique properties allowing for precise control and modification. However, the economic feasibility of this process is often challenged by the undesired combustion reactions, necessitating modifications with substances like phosphate or borate to enhance catalyst stability and selectivity. The effectiveness of borate modification in improving propene selectivity has been demonstrated, but its optimal loading is crucial to avoid hindering the dehydrogenation process and causing side reactions that produce unwanted byproducts such as carbon oxides (COx).

在化学工业中，丙烯的需求显著增加，这归因于其在各种应用中的多功能性。对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为它允许高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，这是一种合成其他重要化学品的关键原料。这一过程在经济上是有利的，因为它满足了对丙烯日益增长的需求，后者广泛用于塑料、溶剂和其他化学中间体的生产。与传统的金属催化剂过程相比，丙烷脱氢在环境方面提供了优势，因为使用纳米碳材料具有独特的特性，可以实现精确控制和修改。然而，这一过程的经济可行性经常受到不希望发生的燃烧反应的挑战，需要通过添加磷酸或硼酸等物质来增强催化剂的稳定性和选择性以改进这一点。已证明硼酸改性能提高丙烯的选择性，但其最佳负载量对于避免阻碍脱氢过程和产生不期望的副产品如碳氧化物（COx）至关重要。
