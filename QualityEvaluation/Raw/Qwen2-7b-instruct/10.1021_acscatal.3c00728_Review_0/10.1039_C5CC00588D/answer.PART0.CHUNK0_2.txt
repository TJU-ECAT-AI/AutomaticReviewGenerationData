[1] "Due to undesirable, consecutive and parallel combustion reactions in ODH, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbons are not sufficient to satisfy economic feasibility."
[2] "Modification with phosphate or borate has been found to efficiently inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 to improve catalyst stability, and simultaneously sustain the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface with enhanced selectivity."
[3] "This result verifies that borate modification is an effective way to enhance the alkene selectivity for ODH reaction."
[4] "However, when the borate loading was higher than 15 wt%, the selectivity of dehydrogenation declined accompanied by an increase of COx."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it provides a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce propene compared to traditional methods. Economically, propane dehydrogenation allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources to yield propene, which is widely used in the production of plastics, rubbers, and solvents. Environmentally, this approach reduces emissions and waste compared to alternative production routes, making it a sustainable choice for industries seeking to meet the growing needs for propene.

2. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation include the efficient use of abundant propane resources, the production of high-quality propene with reduced emissions, and the ability to operate with lower energy consumption compared to other processes. This makes it a viable option for industries looking to reduce costs and environmental impact while meeting the demand for propene.

3. Borate modification has proven to be an effective method to enhance the alkene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane. It improves catalyst stability by inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of oxygen, allowing for selective oxygen species to remain on the catalyst surface, which increases the yield of desired alkene products.

4. At a borate loading amount of less than 15 wt%, borate modification significantly enhances the alkene selectivity in the ODH reaction of propane. However, when the loading exceeds this amount, it leads to a decline in the dehydrogenation selectivity, accompanied by an increase in the formation of unwanted carbon oxides (COx). This suggests that there is an optimal loading amount of borate that maximizes alkene selectivity without negatively impacting the dehydrogenation process.

1. 丙烯在化工行业的地位随着其在各种应用中的灵活性而提升，对其需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。经济上，丙烷脱氢利用丰富的丙烷资源以更有效、成本效益高的方式生产丙烯，满足了对丙烯日益增长的需求。环境方面，这种方法减少了排放和废物，与替代生产途径相比更为可持续，对于寻求满足丙烯需求的行业而言是一个环保的选择。

2. 丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势包括高效利用丰富丙烷资源、生产高质量丙烯并减少排放、以及与传统过程相比降低能源消耗的能力。这使其成为希望降低成本和环境影响，同时满足丙烯需求的行业的一个可行选择。

3. 硼酸改性已被证明是提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中烯烃选择性的有效方法。它通过抑制氧的离散吸附来增强催化剂稳定性，允许选择性氧物种保留在催化剂表面，从而增加所需烯烃产物的产率。

4. 在小于15 wt%的硼酸负载量下，硼酸改性显著提高了丙烷脱氢反应中的烯烃选择性。然而，当负载超过这一数量时，导致脱氢选择性下降，并伴随着碳氧化物（COx）形成增加。这表明存在一个优化的硼酸负载量，可以最大化烯烃选择性，而不对脱氢过程产生负面影响。
