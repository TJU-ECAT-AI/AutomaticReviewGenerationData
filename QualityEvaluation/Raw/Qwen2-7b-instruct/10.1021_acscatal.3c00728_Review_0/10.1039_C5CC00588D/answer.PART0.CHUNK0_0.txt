[1] "For the industrially relevant oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (ODH), activated carbon, carbon nanofibers, and carbon nanotubes as catalysts have been intensively studied for numerous hydrocarbon substrates, including ethylbenzene,3n-butane,2 propane4 and ethane."
[2] "Compared to traditional metal catalysts, nanocarbon materials have significant advantages owing to their unique controllability of physical and chemical properties through structural modification and surface functionalization."
[3] "This is consistent with the reported work which demonstrated that borate modification could efficiently enhance the thermal stability of carbon materials."
[4] "An increasing resistance to oxidation with increasing boron content can be found, in which the oxidation temperatures were improved by 20220 C (T50%) as compared to the unmodified one."
[5] "The propene selectivity gradually increased from 47% to 65%; concomitantly, the formation of carbon oxide (COx) was efficiently inhibited."
[6] "However, when the borate loading was higher than 15 wt%, the selectivity of dehydrogenation declined accompanied by an increase of COx."
[7] "This demonstrates that borate mainly occupied the combustion sites at the low amount, while an excess of borate (>15 wt%) resulted in the moderate inhibition effect on the reaction rate and reactant conversions."
[8] "Therefore, a significant aspect herein that needs our further exploration is to reveal the interaction between boron and the carbon surface, thus providing an insight into this modification effect for ODH reaction."
[9] "This means that the boron oxide, underwent a strong interaction with certain different preferred sites on the AND surface."
[10] "They can be linked together by forming the OH bond and efficiently suppress the generation of electrophilic oxygen species, as demonstrated by TGA analysis in Fig. 4a, which should account for the increased selectivity during reaction."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased due to its wide usage across various applications, including plastics, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The growing demand has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for propene production. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation reduces dependency on traditional oil sources, providing a more cost-effective and sustainable supply chain. Environmentally, this method often results in lower emissions compared to conventional production processes, contributing to a cleaner manufacturing process.

Borate modification on nanodiamonds can enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, improving the selectivity towards propene. This modification also increases the thermal stability of the catalysts, allowing for more efficient and safer reactions. The key to optimizing this process lies in understanding how boron interacts with the carbon surface, which can influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Through careful control of boron loading, the catalytic performance can be regulated, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly propene production.

The mechanism behind borate modification involves boron interacting with the carbon surface to suppress the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, thereby enhancing propene selectivity. Specifically, boron forms OH bonds with defect sites on the carbon surface, effectively blocking the generation of harmful oxygen species. This interaction leads to an increased selectivity for propene production, as demonstrated by the observed changes in product distribution with varying boron loading.
