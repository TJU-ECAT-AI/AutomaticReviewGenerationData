[1] "Due to undesirable, consecutive and parallel combustion reactions in ODH, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbons are not sufficient to satisfy economic feasibility."
[2] "Modification with phosphate or borate has been found to efficiently inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 to improve catalyst stability, and simultaneously sustain the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface with enhanced selectivity."
[3] "This is consistent with the reported work which demonstrated that borate modification could efficiently enhance the thermal stability of carbon materials."
[4] "The propene selectivity decreased when the conversion increased, which was due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane."
[5] "This incontrovertibly indicates that the further interaction occurred between BO3 configurations with the active carbonyl groups on the AND surface, thus resulting in decreased catalytic activity at the high loading amount."

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process, the alkene yields catalyzed by nanocarbon materials are insufficient to meet economic demands due to undesirable combustion reactions. To improve catalyst stability and enhance selectivity, modifications with phosphate or borate have been found effective. Borate modification specifically enhances the thermal stability of carbon materials, which is crucial for industrial applications.

2. The propene selectivity in the ODH reaction decreases with increased conversion, primarily because propene is more reactive than propane. This highlights the trade-off between conversion efficiency and product selectivity in the ODH process.

3. The interaction between boron oxide and the carbon surface, particularly at lower boron loading amounts, leads to the formation of OH bonds. These bonds suppress the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, thereby increasing propene selectivity during the ODH reaction.

4. At high loading amounts of boron, the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated boron blocks active carbonyl groups, significantly reducing the propene formation rate. This demonstrates that the optimal borate modification can be precisely controlled for enhanced catalytic performance.

5. The further interaction between BO3 configurations and the active carbonyl groups on the AND surface results in a decrease in catalytic activity at higher boron loading levels. This finding is critical for understanding the mechanism of borate-modified nanocarbon catalysts in ODH processes.

1. 在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，纳米碳材料催化下的烯烃产率不足以满足经济可行性，这是由于不希望的连续和并行燃烧反应。为了提高催化剂稳定性并增强选择性，磷酸或硼酸的修饰被发现是有效的。硼酸修饰可以有效提高碳材料的热稳定性，这对于工业应用至关重要。

2. 在ODH反应中，当转化率增加时，丙烯的选择性降低，主要是因为丙烯比丙烷更活泼。这强调了在ODH过程中转化效率与产物选择性之间的权衡。

3. 在较低的硼含量下，硼氧化物与碳表面的相互作用导致OH键的形成。这些键抑制了电负性氧物种的生成，从而在ODH反应中增加了丙烯的选择性。

4. 在高硼含量下，四面体协调的硼形成，阻塞了活性羰基基团，显著降低了丙烯的生成速率。这表明最优的硼酸修饰可以精确控制以增强催化性能。

5. 在更高的硼负载水平下，BO3配置与AND表面上的活性羰基团之间的进一步相互作用导致催化活性下降。这一发现对于理解硼酸修饰纳米碳催化剂在ODH过程中的机制至关重要。
