[1] "Metal-free boron-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and excellent olefin selectivity, and some of them are even higher than most metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "In contrast, boron-based catalysts by their nature disfavor the oxidation of olefins as demonstrated in a control experiment that no measurable conversion of propylene was detected when the catalysts were fed with C3H6/O2/He under the ODH conditions, and exhibited low COx selectivity with negligible CO2 emission in the ODH of light alkanes."
[3] "The total COx selectivity is less than 10% with that of CO2 lower than 1% at ca. 20% propane conversion."
[4] "Metal-free boron-based catalysts represent promising alternatives for the industrialization of the ODH of light alkanes with superior selectivity toward light olefins and atom economy for valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission."

1. Metal-free boron-based catalysts demonstrate high catalytic efficiency and exceptional selectivity for olefins, surpassing many metal oxide catalysts. They are considered promising for industrializing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, offering superior selectivity towards light olefins and minimizing CO2 emissions.

2. Boron-based catalysts inherently resist the oxidation of olefins. Under the ODH conditions, no measurable conversion of propylene was observed when tested with C3H6/O2/He. Furthermore, they exhibit low COx selectivity, with negligible CO2 emission during the ODH of light alkanes.

3. At a propane conversion level of around 20%, the total COx selectivity remains below 10%, and the CO2 selectivity is less than 1%.

4. Metal-free boron-based catalysts hold significant promise for industrial ODH processes, offering the benefits of high activity, excellent olefin selectivity, and reduced CO2 emissions, thus promoting atom economy in the production of valuable carbon-based products.

1. 无金属的硼基催化剂显示出高催化活性和优异的烯烃选择性，甚至超过了许多氧化物催化剂。它们被认为是轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）工业化的有前景的选择，具有向轻烯烃提供优越选择性和通过减少CO2排放实现原子经济性的优点。

2. 硼基催化剂自然地避免了烯烃的氧化。在ODH条件下测试时，在使用C3H6/O2/He的情况下，没有观察到丙烯的可测量转化。此外，它们在轻烷烃的ODH过程中表现出较低的COx选择性，CO2排放量极低。

3. 在大约20%的丙烷转化率下，总COx选择性低于10%，CO2选择性低于1%。

4. 无金属的硼基催化剂对于轻烷烃的工业化ODH过程具有巨大的潜力，提供了高活性、优异的烯烃选择性和减少CO2排放的益处，从而促进有价值的碳基产品的原子经济性生产。
