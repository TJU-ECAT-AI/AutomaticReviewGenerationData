[1] "The chemical industry has been making a great contribution to the agriculture, transportation and construction industries."
[2] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively."
[3] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."
[4] "Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, two popularly used processes are the Catofin process and Oleflex process where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst."
[5] "Direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."
[6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."
[7] "The discovery of boron-based metal-free catalysts showed that this was well circumvented owing to the nucleophilicity of the metal-free catalysts that repelled the approach of olefins."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, particularly in the production of polymers, which are key components. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred method due to its economic and environmental advantages. PDH offers a more sustainable route for producing propylene compared to traditional methods like steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, methanol to olefins, and Fischer-Tropsch to olefins, which are energy-intensive and generate significant carbon emissions. This approach meets the growing needs for propylene across various applications more efficiently and with less impact on the environment.

The economic advantage of PDH lies in its lower energy consumption and higher atom economy, making it a cost-effective solution for propylene production. Moreover, the PDH process avoids the formation of CO2, which is a major environmental concern. The environmental benefits come from reduced carbon emissions, contributing to a cleaner production process and aligning with sustainability goals. This makes PDH an attractive choice for the chemical industry in addressing the increasing demand for propylene while minimizing environmental impact.
