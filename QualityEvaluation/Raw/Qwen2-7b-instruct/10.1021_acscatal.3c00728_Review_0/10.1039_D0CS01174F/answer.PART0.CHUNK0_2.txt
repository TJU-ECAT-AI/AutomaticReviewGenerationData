[1] "In recent years, the rich availability and low-cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have motivated the development of industrial techniques towards the gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins."
[2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."
[3] "Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, the Catofin process and Oleflex process where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst."
[4] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."
[5] "In addition, under such tough operation conditions, sintering and coking become serious and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, which thus requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts under high temperature oxidative conditions."
[6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."
[7] "It proceeds at a lower temperature without the need of catalyst regeneration."
[8] "The oxidation of alkanes under aerobic conditions is generally believed to have a complicated reaction pattern demonstrated by the co-existence of various reaction channels under ODH conditions."
[9] "The rich side reaction channels, e.g. partial oxidation to oxygenated products and deep oxidation to COx, resulted in wide spectrum distribution of products."
[10] "Thus, an uncatalyzed ODH reaction inevitably suffers from the low selectivity problem, and catalysts are required to promote the targeted reactions by manipulating the reaction kinetics in order to achieve high selectivity for olefins in the oxidative atmosphere."
[11] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts showed a superior selectivity toward olefins, excellent stability and atom-economy to valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, which are highly promising in future industrialization."
[12] "Metal-free boron- and carbon-based catalysts have shown both great fundamental and practical value in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes."
[13] "The carbonaceous catalysts also exhibited impressive behavior in the ODH of light alkanes helped along by surface oxygen-containing functional groups."

Answer: Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly with the growing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. As propene is a key component in numerous products, from plastics to fuels, its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting these growing needs.

Economically, PDH provides a more cost-effective and efficient way to produce propene compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of petroleum. This is because PDH utilizes abundant natural gas resources, which are often cheaper and more readily available than oil. Additionally, PDH consumes less energy and generates fewer emissions per unit of propene produced, aligning better with sustainable development criteria.

Environmentally, PDH reduces carbon footprint significantly. Traditional methods of producing propene, such as steam cracking, involve high energy consumption and substantial carbon emission. In contrast, PDH operates at lower temperatures, minimizing energy requirements and carbon output. Moreover, PDH processes typically result in lower CO2 emissions compared to direct dehydrogenation, further enhancing its environmental credentials.

Answer: 石油衍生的蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解（FCC）、甲醇到烯烃（MTO）和福斯-特罗普斯化学（FTO）等工业技术在生产轻烯烃方面一直发挥着关键作用。这些技术通常需要高能消耗和巨大的碳排放，与可持续发展标准对环境保护和能源消耗的要求相冲突。这促使化学工程从耗能高的化学过程转向更环保的催化过程来生产具有高原子经济性、低能耗和低排放的烯烃。

Answer: 在过去几十年中，对轻烷烃氧化脱氢反应的研究重点集中在过渡金属氧化物（如V2O5、MoO3和NiO）和碱土金属氧氯化物上。然而，最近发现了一种新型的无金属催化剂——功能化的六方氮化硼（h-BN），它具有高活性和选择性，且几乎不产生二氧化碳，这是催化氧化脱氢反应系统发展的一个突破。随后，这种新的催化系统吸引了催化领域和材料科学领域的广泛关注。一系列硼基催化剂被合成，具有与h-BN相似的优异活性，开辟了选择性切断CH键的新途径。同时，纳米碳也被报道在氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性，为理解和设计氧化脱氢催化剂提供了基础，推动了未来研究的方向。

答案：丙烯在化工行业的地位随着其在各种应用中的需求增长而显著演变。鉴于丙烯是许多产品，包括塑料和燃料的关键成分，其需求的增长已驱动了以丙烷脱氢（PDH）为主要生产方法的采用。PDH在满足这些增长需求方面提供了几个经济和环境上的优势。

经济上，PDH提供了一种比传统方法（如石油基蒸汽裂解）更经济、更高效的丙烯生产方式。这是因为PDH利用了丰富的天然气资源，这些资源往往更便宜且易于获取。此外，PDH消耗的能源较少，产生的排放也较少，与可持续发展目标下的环境保护和能源消耗要求更加一致。

环境上，PDH显著降低了碳足迹。传统的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解，需要高能耗和大量碳排放。相比之下，PDH在较低温度下运行，减少了能源需求和碳输出。此外，PDH过程产生的二氧化碳排放量通常低于直接脱氢，进一步提高了其环境表现。
