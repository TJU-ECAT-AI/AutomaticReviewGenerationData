[1] "The worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."
[2] "In 2018, the proved reserves of natural gas reached 197 trillion cubic meters. These gas resources are composed of considerable amounts of light alkanes, e.g. methane, ethane, and propane, which can be separated from the natural gas."
[3] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."
[4] "Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation, two popularly used processes are the Catofin process and Oleflex process where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst."
[5] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."
[6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."
[7] "Boron-based catalysts show a superior selectivity toward olefins, excellent stability and atom-economy to valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, which are highly promising in future industrialization."
[8] "The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation lie in its lower energy consumption, reduced carbon emissions, and efficient use of natural gas resources. This approach allows for the production of propene with minimal environmental impact, making it a preferred method for fulfilling the growing demand for this versatile olefin."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown alongside the increasing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. Its widespread use in sectors such as plastics, pharmaceuticals, and fuels necessitates reliable and efficient production methods. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a preferred technique due to its economic and environmental advantages over direct dehydrogenation methods. The economic benefits stem from lower energy consumption, which reduces operational costs. Environmentally, PDH minimizes carbon emissions, aligning with sustainability goals. Moreover, PDH efficiently utilizes natural gas resources, providing a cleaner source of propene production. The combination of lower energy costs, reduced environmental impact, and optimized resource usage makes propane dehydrogenation a preferred choice for fulfilling the growing demand for propene.
