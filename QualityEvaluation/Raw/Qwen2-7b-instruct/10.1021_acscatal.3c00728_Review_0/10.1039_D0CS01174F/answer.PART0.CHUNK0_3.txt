Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially due to its increasing demand across various applications. The economic and environmental advantages of adopting propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method are significant. PDH allows for the efficient production of propene, a key olefin used in numerous sectors such as plastics, paints, and pharmaceuticals. The process is considered economically advantageous because it operates at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation methods, requiring less energy input and thus reducing operational costs. Moreover, PDH is environmentally friendly due to its minimal CO2 emission, aligning with sustainable development criteria. 

Direct dehydrogenation processes typically involve endothermic reactions that necessitate high temperatures and substantial energy inputs, which limit their overall energy efficiency. Additionally, these processes often require frequent catalyst regeneration under high temperature oxidative conditions, leading to additional costs and operational complexities. In contrast, ODH offers an alternative by being exothermic and free of coke formation, allowing for reactions at lower temperatures without the need for catalyst regeneration. This feature makes ODH a promising technique for the production of olefins.

The advent of metal-free catalysts, particularly those based on boron and carbon, has revolutionized the field of ODH. These catalysts demonstrate superior selectivity for olefins, excellent stability, and atom-economy, producing fewer CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods. This advancement not only reduces environmental impact but also opens new avenues for utilizing light alkanes as clean energy resources. The discovery of these novel catalysts has attracted considerable research interest, driving advancements in the understanding of catalytic systems, including the identification of active sites and the exploration of underlying mechanisms. These insights facilitate the rational design of more efficient and environmentally friendly ODH catalytic systems, paving the way for their industrialization and broader application in the chemical industry.

The quote "[11] This new catalytic system attracted considerable research interest in the field of catalysis and material science." highlights the impact of these discoveries on the scientific community. The quote "[12] Meanwhile, there is a quick advance in the understanding of the mechanistic issues, including active site, and the catalytic mechanism, to facilitate rational design of the ODH catalytic systems." underscores the ongoing progress in unraveling the complex mechanisms behind these catalytic processes, which is essential for optimizing their performance and efficiency.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着其需求的增长而显著增加，尤其是在多个应用领域。采用丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选生产方法的经济和环境优势是显而易见的。PDH允许高效生产丙烯，这是一种广泛用于塑料、油漆和制药等行业的关键烯烃。该过程被认为是经济上的有利因素，因为它在较低温度下运行，需要较少的能量输入，从而降低了运营成本。此外，PDH因其低CO2排放量而具有环境友好性，这与可持续发展标准相一致。

直接脱氢过程通常涉及放热反应，需要高温和大量能量输入，这限制了它们的整体能效。此外，这些过程往往需要在高温氧化条件下频繁催化剂再生，导致额外的成本和操作复杂性。相比之下，ODH通过其放热性和无焦炭形成特性，允许在较低温度下进行反应，无需催化剂再生。这一特征使ODH成为生产烯烃的有前景的技术。

金属自由催化剂的发现，特别是基于硼和碳的催化剂，彻底改变了催化领域。这些催化剂显示出对烯烃的优越选择性、出色的稳定性以及原子经济性，并产生较少的CO2排放，与传统方法相比。这一进步不仅减少了环境影响，还为利用轻烷烃作为清洁能源资源开辟了新途径。这些发现吸引了科学界的极大关注，推动了催化系统理解的迅速进展，包括活性位点的识别和催化机制的探索。这些洞察对于优化催化系统的性能和效率至关重要，为它们的工业化和更广泛的化学工业应用铺平了道路。

引述“[11] 这种新的催化系统引起了催化领域和材料科学领域的广泛关注。”强调了这些发现对科学界的影响。引述“[12] 同时，在活性位点和催化机制方面的机制问题有了快速的进步，这有助于理性设计ODH催化系统。”强调了解开这些催化过程复杂机制的持续进展，这对于优化其性能和效率至关重要。
