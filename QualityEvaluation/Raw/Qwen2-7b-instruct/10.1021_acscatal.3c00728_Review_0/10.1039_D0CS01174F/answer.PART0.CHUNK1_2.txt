[1] "Metal-free boron-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and excellent olefin selectivity, and some of them are even higher than most metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "In the ODH of propane, boron nitride and silicon boride exhibited approximately 80% selectivity to propylene (90% total selectivity to propylene and ethylene) at 20% propane conversion level with propylene productivity far larger than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 over most boron-based catalysts, showing high potential for industrial implementation."
[3] "In contrast, boron-based catalysts by their nature disfavor the oxidation of olefins as demonstrated in a control experiment that no measurable conversion of propylene was detected when the catalysts were fed with C3H6/O2/He under the ODH conditions, and exhibited low COx selectivity with negligible CO2 emission in the ODH of light alkanes."

1. The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications, from plastics to fuels and solvents. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation because this method efficiently converts propane into propene with high selectivity and yields. Economically, this approach offers a cost-effective way to produce propene, which is essential for various industries. Environmentally, it helps reduce CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods, aligning with sustainable practices.

2. Boron-based catalysts, particularly those derived from boron nitride and silicon boride, demonstrate high activity and excellent selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. They can achieve 80% selectivity to propylene at 20% propane conversion, with propylene productivity exceeding 1 golefin gcat1 h1, showcasing their potential for industrial implementation.

3. Boron-based catalysts inherently resist the oxidation of olefins. Experiments confirm that these catalysts do not convert propylene upon exposure to propane, oxygen, and hydrogen gases under oxidative conditions. They also exhibit low COx selectivity, emitting minimal CO2, making them an environmentally friendly option for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1. 丙烯在化工行业的地位日益重要，因其广泛的应用范围，从塑料到燃料和溶剂。其需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢化方法的采用，因为这种方法能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，并且具有高选择性和产率。经济上，这种方法提供了生产丙烯的成本效益解决方案，这对于各个行业至关重要。环境上，与传统方法相比，它有助于减少二氧化碳排放，符合可持续发展的实践。

2. 硼基催化剂，尤其是源自硼氮化物和硅硼化物的催化剂，在轻烷烃氧化脱氢中显示出高活性和优异的选择性。它们能够在20%丙烷转化率下实现80%的丙烯选择性，丙烯产物产率超过每克催化剂每小时1克，这表明它们在工业实施方面具有潜力。

3. 硼基催化剂本质上不促进烯烃的氧化。实验结果证明，在暴露于丙烷、氧气和氢气气体的氧化条件下，这些催化剂不会将丙烯转化为其他产物。它们还表现出较低的COx选择性，排放的二氧化碳量很少，使其成为轻烷烃氧化脱氢的环保选择。
