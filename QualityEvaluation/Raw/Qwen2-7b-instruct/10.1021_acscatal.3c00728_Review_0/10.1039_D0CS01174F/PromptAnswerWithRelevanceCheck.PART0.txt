Answer: Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly with the growing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. As propene is a key component in numerous products, from plastics to fuels, its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting these growing needs.

Economically, PDH provides a more cost-effective and efficient way to produce propene compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of petroleum. This is because PDH utilizes abundant natural gas resources, which are often cheaper and more readily available than oil. Additionally, PDH consumes less energy and generates fewer emissions per unit of propene produced, aligning better with sustainable development criteria.

Environmentally, PDH reduces carbon footprint significantly. Traditional methods of producing propene, such as steam cracking, involve high energy consumption and substantial carbon emission. In contrast, PDH operates at lower temperatures, minimizing energy requirements and carbon output. Moreover, PDH processes typically result in lower CO2 emissions compared to direct dehydrogenation, further enhancing its environmental credentials.

Answer: 石油衍生的蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解（FCC）、甲醇到烯烃（MTO）和福斯-特罗普斯化学（FTO）等工业技术在生产轻烯烃方面一直发挥着关键作用。这些技术通常需要高能消耗和巨大的碳排放，与可持续发展标准对环境保护和能源消耗的要求相冲突。这促使化学工程从耗能高的化学过程转向更环保的催化过程来生产具有高原子经济性、低能耗和低排放的烯烃。

Answer: 在过去几十年中，对轻烷烃氧化脱氢反应的研究重点集中在过渡金属氧化物（如V2O5、MoO3和NiO）和碱土金属氧氯化物上。然而，最近发现了一种新型的无金属催化剂——功能化的六方氮化硼（h-BN），它具有高活性和选择性，且几乎不产生二氧化碳，这是催化氧化脱氢反应系统发展的一个突破。随后，这种新的催化系统吸引了催化领域和材料科学领域的广泛关注。一系列硼基催化剂被合成，具有与h-BN相似的优异活性，开辟了选择性切断CH键的新途径。同时，纳米碳也被报道在氧化脱氢反应中表现出活性，为理解和设计氧化脱氢催化剂提供了基础，推动了未来研究的方向。

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially due to its increasing demand across various applications. The economic and environmental advantages of adopting propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method are significant. PDH allows for the efficient production of propene, a key olefin used in numerous sectors such as plastics, paints, and pharmaceuticals. The process is considered economically advantageous because it operates at lower temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation methods, requiring less energy input and thus reducing operational costs. Moreover, PDH is environmentally friendly due to its minimal CO2 emission, aligning with sustainable development criteria. 

Direct dehydrogenation processes typically involve endothermic reactions that necessitate high temperatures and substantial energy inputs, which limit their overall energy efficiency. Additionally, these processes often require frequent catalyst regeneration under high temperature oxidative conditions, leading to additional costs and operational complexities. In contrast, ODH offers an alternative by being exothermic and free of coke formation, allowing for reactions at lower temperatures without the need for catalyst regeneration. This feature makes ODH a promising technique for the production of olefins.

The advent of metal-free catalysts, particularly those based on boron and carbon, has revolutionized the field of ODH. These catalysts demonstrate superior selectivity for olefins, excellent stability, and atom-economy, producing fewer CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods. This advancement not only reduces environmental impact but also opens new avenues for utilizing light alkanes as clean energy resources. The discovery of these novel catalysts has attracted considerable research interest, driving advancements in the understanding of catalytic systems, including the identification of active sites and the exploration of underlying mechanisms. These insights facilitate the rational design of more efficient and environmentally friendly ODH catalytic systems, paving the way for their industrialization and broader application in the chemical industry.

The quote "[11] This new catalytic system attracted considerable research interest in the field of catalysis and material science." highlights the impact of these discoveries on the scientific community. The quote "[12] Meanwhile, there is a quick advance in the understanding of the mechanistic issues, including active site, and the catalytic mechanism, to facilitate rational design of the ODH catalytic systems." underscores the ongoing progress in unraveling the complex mechanisms behind these catalytic processes, which is essential for optimizing their performance and efficiency.

[5] "Direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."
[6] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."
[7] "The discovery of boron-based metal-free catalysts showed that this was well circumvented owing to the nucleophilicity of the metal-free catalysts that repelled the approach of olefins."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, particularly in the production of polymers, which are key components. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred method due to its economic and environmental advantages. PDH offers a more sustainable route for producing propylene compared to traditional methods like steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, methanol to olefins, and Fischer-Tropsch to olefins, which are energy-intensive and generate significant carbon emissions. This approach meets the growing needs for propylene across various applications more efficiently and with less impact on the environment.

The economic advantage of PDH lies in its lower energy consumption and higher atom economy, making it a cost-effective solution for propylene production. Moreover, the PDH process avoids the formation of CO2, which is a major environmental concern. The environmental benefits come from reduced carbon emissions, contributing to a cleaner production process and aligning with sustainability goals. This makes PDH an attractive choice for the chemical industry in addressing the increasing demand for propylene while minimizing environmental impact.
