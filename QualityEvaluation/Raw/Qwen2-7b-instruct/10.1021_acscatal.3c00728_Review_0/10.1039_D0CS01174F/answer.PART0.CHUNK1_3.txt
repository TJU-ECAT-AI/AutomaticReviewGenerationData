[1] "Metal-free boron-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and excellent olefin selectivity, and some of them are even higher than most metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "This is in contrast to the relatively low propylene selectivity of less than 50% and low propylene productivity of less than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 in the ODH of propane using metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level."
[3] "In the ODH of propane, boron nitride and silicon boride exhibited approximately 80% selectivity to propylene (90% total selectivity to propylene and ethylene) at 20% propane conversion level with propylene productivity far larger than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 over most boron-based catalysts, showing high potential for industrial implementation."

Propene, also known as propene or propylene, is a versatile olefin widely used in the chemical industry. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation because it offers a more efficient and environmentally friendly method for producing propene. This approach is economically advantageous as it minimizes the energy required and reduces CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, it helps in mitigating climate change impacts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The high catalytic activity and olefin selectivity of boron-based catalysts, particularly boron nitride and silicon boride, enable the production of propene with high yields and productivity, making it a preferred method for industrial implementation.
