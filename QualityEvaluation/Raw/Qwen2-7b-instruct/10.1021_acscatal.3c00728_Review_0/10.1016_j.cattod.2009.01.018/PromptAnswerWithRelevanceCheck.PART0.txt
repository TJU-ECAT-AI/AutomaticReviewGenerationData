[3] "The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."
[4] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[5] "A considerable amount of work has been devoted to the development of catalysts with good selectivity to olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."

1. The demand for propene has grown significantly, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its ability to convert lower alkenes efficiently at lower reaction temperatures, thereby enhancing catalyst lifetime and preventing coke deposition. This alternative process offers energy efficiency benefits over established methods, as it is exothermal rather than endothermal, making it particularly advantageous for olefin production where the cost of the feedstock is not a significant incentive.

2. The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation lie in its ability to produce propene with higher energy efficiency compared to traditional processes. The process is less dependent on equilibrium limitations and endothermic reactions, leading to simpler and more cost-effective production. Moreover, the use of iodine as a co-catalyst enhances both the selectivity and activity of the catalysts, potentially enabling a more sustainable and profitable production of propene.

Answer: The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its energy efficiency and enhanced catalyst lifetime. This process offers environmental benefits through simpler and more cost-effective production compared to traditional methods. The addition of iodine as a co-catalyst further improves the performance of the catalysts, potentially leading to more sustainable and profitable propene production.

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers economic advantages such as lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst longevity, which prevents the formation of coke deposits. Additionally, it is energetically favorable as it is exothermal, unlike endothermal processes such as cracking or dehydrogenation. This makes it a more efficient and simple alternative compared to established processes.

2. Propane dehydrogenation is driven by the need to meet the growing demands for propene, a key intermediate in the chemical industry. Economic advantages include the ability to use lower-cost feedstocks and improved energy efficiency. Environmental benefits stem from the fact that it reduces the need for fossil fuel consumption and potentially leads to lower emissions compared to traditional processes like steam cracking.

Despite good activity for the ODH of alkanes to their corresponding alkenes, non-selective combustion pathways limit the alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions. Particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, it has been well established that limited propene selectivity at higher propane conversions is related to propene adsorption on acid sites and their subsequent combustion to carbon oxides.
