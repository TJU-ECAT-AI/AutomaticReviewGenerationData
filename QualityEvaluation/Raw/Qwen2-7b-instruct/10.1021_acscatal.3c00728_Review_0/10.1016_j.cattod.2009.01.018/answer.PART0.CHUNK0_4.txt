A considerable amount of work has been devoted to the development of catalysts with good selectivity to olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins. V/MgO was found to be one of the best catalytic systems in terms of activity and performance stability. Despite good activity for the ODH of alkanes to their corresponding alkenes, non-selective combustion pathways limit the alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions. Particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, it has been well established that limited propene selectivity at higher propane conversions is related to propene adsorption on acid sites and their subsequent combustion to carbon oxides.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become a versatile olefin with numerous applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to several economic and environmental advantages. This approach offers enhanced energy efficiency as the reaction is exothermal, unlike endothermal processes like steam cracking or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation. It simplifies the process and prevents the formation of coke deposits, leading to longer catalyst lifetimes. Moreover, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is not equilibrium-limited, providing a competitive alternative to traditional methods.
