A considerable amount of work has been devoted to the development of catalysts with good selectivity to olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins. V/MgO was found to be one of the best catalytic systems in terms of activity and performance stability. Despite good activity for the ODH of alkanes to their corresponding alkenes, non-selective combustion pathways limit the alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions.

The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic and environmental advantages. Economically, the process is energetically favorable due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime, thanks to the prevention of coke deposition. Environmentally, it is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic, offering a more sustainable alternative compared to established processes like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation. The economic attractiveness of propane dehydrogenation is further enhanced by its ability to produce propene with high selectivity, despite the challenges posed by non-selective combustion pathways, especially at high conversions.

对丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷裂解作为首选生产方法的采用，这在经济和环境方面具有优势。从经济角度来看，该过程因其较低的反应温度和催化剂寿命的提高而更具成本效益，尤其是由于防止了焦炭沉积。从环境角度看，它既不是平衡限制也不是吸热反应，与蒸汽裂解石脑油或催化裂解/裂解等现有过程相比，提供了更可持续的选择。在经济上，丙烷裂解能够以高选择性生产丙烯，尽管在高转化率时存在非选择性燃烧路径的挑战。
