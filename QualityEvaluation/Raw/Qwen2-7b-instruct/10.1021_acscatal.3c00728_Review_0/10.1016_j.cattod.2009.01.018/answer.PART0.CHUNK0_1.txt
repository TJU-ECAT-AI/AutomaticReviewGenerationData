[1] "Despite good activity for the ODH of alkanes to their corresponding alkenes, non-selective combustion pathways limit the alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions."
[2] "In the current publication we report a new method for synthesis of VOx/MgO mixed aerogels by hydrolysis of a mixture of vanadium and magnesium alkoxides followed by co-gelation and supercritical drying."
[3] "The highest surface area was obtained for the mixed aerogel sample [VO/MgO]-AP prepared by hydrolysis of a mixed Mg(OCH3)2 and VO(OiC3H7)3 solution in a toluene-methanol mixture followed by co-gelation and supercritical drying."
[4] "The addition of iodine vapor to the feed in 0.10.25 vol.% concentrations was found to increase to propylene yield by 4070%."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatility across various applications. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers economic advantages such as lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst longevity, which prevents the formation of coke deposits. Additionally, it is energetically favorable as it is exothermal, unlike endothermal processes such as cracking or dehydrogenation. This makes it a more efficient and simple alternative compared to established processes.

2. Propane dehydrogenation is driven by the need to meet the growing demands for propene, a key intermediate in the chemical industry. Economic advantages include the ability to use lower-cost feedstocks and improved energy efficiency. Environmental benefits stem from the fact that it reduces the need for fossil fuel consumption and potentially leads to lower emissions compared to traditional processes like steam cracking.

1. 丙烯在化工行业的意义越来越大，因为它在各种应用中都具有灵活性。由于需求的增长，丙烷脱氢作为一种首选的生产方法被采用，因为它提供了经济上的优势，如较低的反应温度和催化剂的更长寿命，这可以防止焦炭沉积。此外，它在能源效率上是可取的，因为它是一个放热过程，不像裂解或脱氢这样的热力学受限或吸热过程。这使得它比现有的过程更有效、更简单。

2. 丙烷脱氢驱动着满足对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烯是化学工业中的关键中间体。经济优势包括使用低成本原料的能力以及提高能源效率。环境益处在于它可以减少对化石燃料的消耗，并可能降低与传统过程（如蒸汽裂解）相关的排放量。
