1. "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable."
2. "This alternative process is energetically favorable due to lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst lifetime thanks to prevention of the coke deposition."
3. "Furthermore, it is neither equilibrium-limited nor endothermic. Therefore, it has important advantages compared to the established processes."
4. "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
5. "A considerable amount of work has been devoted to the development of catalysts with good selectivity to olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
6. "V/MgO was found to be one of the best catalytic systems in terms of activity and performance stability."
7. "Propene's increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method."
8. "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
9. "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
10. "Thus, new efficient catalytic systems that would allow for effective propene production with high selectivity at higher propane conversions are highly desirable."
11. "Earlier we showed that iodine addition significantly improves the activity and selectivity of VOx/MgO catalyst in oxidative dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene."
12. "The addition of iodine vapor to the feed in 0.10.25 vol.% concentrations was found to increase to propylene yield by 4070%."
