Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become a crucial feedstock for a wide range of applications, including polymers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The rising demand for propene has led to the increased adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. This shift is economically advantageous because PDH offers lower capital costs and higher efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, PDH provides environmental benefits by reducing emissions and enabling the use of more sustainable feedstocks. These factors collectively contribute to meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications due to its high versatility and efficiency.
