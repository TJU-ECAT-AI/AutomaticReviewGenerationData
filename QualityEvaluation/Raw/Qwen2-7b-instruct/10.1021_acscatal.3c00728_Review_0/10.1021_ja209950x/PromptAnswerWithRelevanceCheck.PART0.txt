Answer: Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly due to its versatile nature and wide range of applications. As the demand for propene continues to grow across various sectors, such as plastics, solvents, and fuels, the traditional methods of producing propene have been challenged. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a preferred method for propene production because of its efficiency and the ability to meet the increasing demand more economically and sustainably compared to other methods. This process involves converting propane directly into propene without the intermediate step of cracking heavier hydrocarbons, which makes it more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The economic advantage of PDH lies in its lower operational costs, reduced carbon footprint, and the potential for higher yields of propene. Moreover, the environmental benefits include decreased emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants, making it an attractive option for industries aiming to adopt greener production processes.
