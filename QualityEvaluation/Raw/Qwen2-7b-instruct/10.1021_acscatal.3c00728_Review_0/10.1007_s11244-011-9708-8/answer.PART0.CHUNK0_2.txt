1. The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly grown, leading to the development of new production methods. Propane dehydrogenation has become a preferred technique due to its ability to efficiently produce propylene, which is a key ingredient in the manufacturing of plastics, synthetic fibers, and solvents. This technique has made substantial contributions to the global supply of propylene in recent years.

2. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers economic and environmental advantages. Economically, it allows for cost-effective and scalable production, meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications. Environmentally, it provides a cleaner alternative compared to traditional production methods, potentially reducing emissions and waste generation.
