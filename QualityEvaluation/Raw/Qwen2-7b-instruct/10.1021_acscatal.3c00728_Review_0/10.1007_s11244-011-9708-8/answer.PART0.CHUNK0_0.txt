1. The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved to meet the increasing demand for this versatile olefin, leading to the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This technique is preferred because it directly converts propane into propylene, which is widely used in various applications. The economic advantage lies in its efficiency and direct production of propylene, reducing costs compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation might offer benefits such as lower emissions or cleaner processes depending on the specifics of the technology employed.

2. The demand for propylene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This is because propane dehydrogenation directly converts propane into propylene, a key component in numerous industries including petrochemicals, plastics, and solvents. The economic advantages include higher yield and efficiency, which can lead to cost savings. Environmental benefits could include reduced energy consumption, minimized waste, or lower emissions, though specifics depend on the process and its implementation.
