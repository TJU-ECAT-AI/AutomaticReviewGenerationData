The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to surge in the near future, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for olefin production. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Firstly, it utilizes lower reaction temperatures, which reduces energy consumption. Secondly, it effectively inhibits the formation of coke, minimizing maintenance costs and downtime associated with coke removal. Moreover, propane dehydrogenation is more efficient in terms of propylene yield compared to traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This enhanced efficiency is crucial for meeting the growing needs for propylene across diverse applications, including the petrochemical industry and manufacturing sectors. The use of a specific WOxVOx catalyst, particularly with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M, maximizes propylene production, showcasing the potential for commercialization of this catalyst. Additionally, the similar apparent activation energy across different W/V ratios suggests that the catalyst performs consistently under varying conditions, further supporting its practical application and scalability in industrial settings.

3. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and is involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This indicates CO2's role in the chemical transformation of propane into propylene through an oxidative pathway.

4. Catalysts with varying W/V ratios showed different performances in terms of propylene yield and selectivity. Catalysts with a W/V ratio of 0.1 had the highest average turnover frequency for propene, while catalysts with a W/V ratio of 0.6 demonstrated higher selectivities.

5. During the initial stages of the experiments, the amount of hydrogen produced was less than the amount of propylene produced. This observation implies that the catalyst promoted the formation of propylene more efficiently than hydrogen.

6. CO2 plays a crucial role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon on the catalyst, contributing to improved efficiency and product quality in the dehydrogenation process.
