[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
[3] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[5] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[6] "In agreement with the value predicted from DFT, the experimental apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is similar and varies from 127  11 kJ/mol to 147  12 kJ/mol with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6."

The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to surge in the near future, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for olefin production. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Firstly, it utilizes lower reaction temperatures, which reduces energy consumption. Secondly, it effectively inhibits the formation of coke, minimizing maintenance costs and downtime associated with coke removal. Moreover, propane dehydrogenation is more efficient in terms of propylene yield compared to traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This enhanced efficiency is crucial for meeting the growing needs for propylene across diverse applications, including the petrochemical industry and manufacturing sectors. The use of a specific WOxVOx catalyst, particularly with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M, maximizes propylene production, showcasing the potential for commercialization of this catalyst. Additionally, the similar apparent activation energy across different W/V ratios suggests that the catalyst performs consistently under varying conditions, further supporting its practical application and scalability in industrial settings.
