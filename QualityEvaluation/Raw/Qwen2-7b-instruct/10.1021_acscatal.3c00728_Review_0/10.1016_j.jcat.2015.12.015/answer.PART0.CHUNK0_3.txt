The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to rise significantly in the near future. Traditional methods such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are commonly used to produce alkenes, but these processes come with drawbacks, including being endothermic and leading to the formation of coke. An attractive alternative is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen. This method allows for lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation, making it a preferred choice for propene production. This process is economically and environmentally advantageous for meeting the increasing demands for propene in diverse applications.

预计未来几年，烯烃特别是丙烯的需求将显著增加。传统的裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）等方法广泛用于生产烯烃，但这些过程存在耗热和生成焦炭的问题。一种有吸引力的替代方案是使用分子氧对丙烷进行氧化脱氢（ODP），这种方法能够实现较低的反应温度并有效防止表面焦炭形成，使其成为优选的丙烯生产方法。该过程在满足各种应用领域不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有经济和环境优势。
