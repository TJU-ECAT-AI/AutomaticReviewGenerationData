[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
[3] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[5] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
[6] "In agreement with the value predicted from DFT, the experimental apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is similar and varies from 127  11 kJ/mol to 147  12 kJ/mol with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6."
[7] "Carbon dioxide has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[8] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."
[9] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[10] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."

1. The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to significantly increase in the near future, driving the need for more efficient production methods.
2. Propane dehydrogenation offers lower reaction temperatures and better coke inhibition compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and FCC, addressing their endothermic nature and coke production issues.
3. CO2 plays a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4 and facilitating the conversion to propylene, thus reducing the formation of surface coke.
4. The addition of tungsten to the vanadium oxide catalyst enhances its dispersion and promotes the reduction of VOx, improving the catalyst's performance and selectivity towards propylene.
5. The W/V = 0.1 M ratio catalyst shows the highest efficiency in converting propane to propene, while higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V = 0.6 ratio.

1. 随着未来几年对烯烃，尤其是丙烯需求的大幅增加，对更高效生产方法的需求也随之增长。
2. 丙烷脱氢提供了比蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂化等传统方法更低的反应温度和更好的焦炭抑制，解决了它们的吸热性和焦炭生成问题。
3. 二氧化碳在氧化脱氢过程中通过将V2O3氧化为V2O4并促进丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少表面焦炭的形成，发挥了关键作用。
4. 在钨氧化物催化剂中添加钨提高了其分散性，促进了VOx的还原，从而改善了催化剂的性能和丙烯选择性。
5. W/V = 0.1摩尔比例的催化剂显示出最高的丙烷转化为丙烯效率，而W/V = 0.6摩尔比例的催化剂则能获得更高的选择性。
