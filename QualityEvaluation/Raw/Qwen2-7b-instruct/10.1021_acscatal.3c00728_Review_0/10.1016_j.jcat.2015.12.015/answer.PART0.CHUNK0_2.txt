1. The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to grow significantly in the upcoming years. Traditional methods such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are currently employed for olefin production, but they have limitations including being endothermic and leading to coke production. An appealing alternative is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen, which offers benefits such as lower reaction temperatures and enhanced prevention of surface coke formation.

2. Propane dehydrogenation is an attractive alternative due to its potential to produce olefins with lower energy requirements and reduced coke formation compared to conventional methods.

3. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and is involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This indicates CO2's role in the chemical transformation of propane into propylene through an oxidative pathway.

4. Catalysts with varying W/V ratios showed different performances in terms of propylene yield and selectivity. Catalysts with a W/V ratio of 0.1 had the highest average turnover frequency for propene, while catalysts with a W/V ratio of 0.6 demonstrated higher selectivities.

5. During the initial stages of the experiments, the amount of hydrogen produced was less than the amount of propylene produced. This observation implies that the catalyst promoted the formation of propylene more efficiently than hydrogen.

6. CO2 plays a crucial role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon on the catalyst, contributing to improved efficiency and product quality in the dehydrogenation process.

1. 预计未来几年，特别是丙烯的需求将显著增长。传统的裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）方法目前用于生产烯烃，但它们存在一些缺点，包括吸热反应和焦炭生成。氧化脱氢（ODP）是通过分子氧对丙烷进行的一种有吸引力的替代方法，它能够提供较低的反应温度和更有效的表面焦炭抑制。

2. 由于其较低的能量需求和减少焦炭形成的优势，氧化脱氢（ODP）作为生产烯烃的替代方法具有吸引力。

3. CO2有能力将V2O3氧化为V2O4，并参与丙烷转化为丙烯的氧化脱氢过程。这表明CO2在丙烷转化为丙烯的化学转化过程中扮演着氧化路径的角色。

4. 不同的W/V比例催化剂表现出不同的性能，以0.1为W/V比的催化剂具有最高的丙烯平均周转频率，而0.6的W/V比催化剂则显示出更高的选择性。

5. 在实验初期阶段，氢的产生量少于丙烯的产生量。这一观察结果表明，催化剂在促进丙烯形成方面更为高效。

6. CO2在抑制催化剂表面上碳的形成中起着关键作用，有助于提高脱氢过程的效率和产品质量。
