[1] "Worldwide, more than 30 commercial Pt-catalyzed dehydrogenation units in operation for the manufacture of detergent alkylate."
[2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[3] "Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, particularly in the production of polymers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method."
[4] "Economic advantages include higher propene yields, lower capital costs, and the ability to use a wider range of feedstocks. Environmental benefits stem from reduced emissions and the potential for cleaner production processes."

1. More than 30 commercial units using platinum-catalyzed dehydrogenation are in operation worldwide for detergent alkylate production.
2. Ethylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation over platinum catalysts is highly selective, but extending this technology to ethane faces challenges requiring higher temperatures and pressures.
3. Propene's importance in the chemical industry has grown, especially in polymer, solvent, and pharmaceutical manufacturing sectors. Its demand boosts the preference for propane dehydrogenation.
4. Economically, propane dehydrogenation allows for higher propene yields, lower capital expenditures, and broader feedstock utilization. Environmentally, it reduces emissions and promotes cleaner production methods.
