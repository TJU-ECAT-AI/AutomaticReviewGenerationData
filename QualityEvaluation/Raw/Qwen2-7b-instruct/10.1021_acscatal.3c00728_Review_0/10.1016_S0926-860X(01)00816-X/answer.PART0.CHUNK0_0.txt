[1] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is expected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
[2] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."
[3] "The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because propene is a versatile olefin used in a wide range of applications, including plastic production, synthetic rubber, and pharmaceuticals. This method allows for efficient and high-yield production of propene."
[4] "Economic advantages of using propane dehydrogenation include lower capital costs compared to traditional methods like steam cracking, higher purity of propene, and flexibility in adjusting production capacity. Environmental benefits include reduced emissions and minimized waste generation."
