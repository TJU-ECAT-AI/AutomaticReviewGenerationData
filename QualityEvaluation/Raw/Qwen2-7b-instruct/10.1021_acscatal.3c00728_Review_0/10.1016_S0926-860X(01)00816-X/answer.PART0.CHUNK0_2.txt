[1] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."
[2] "The world propylene production capacity, based on the use of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has increased steadily over the past 10 years [13] and is expected to grow even further under the right economic conditions relative to the availability of propane; on the other hand, environmental concerns on the use of MTBE are expected to adversely impact the future expansion of isobutane dehydrogenation applications."
[3] "Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown significantly, driven by its versatility and wide range of applications. Its demand has been on the rise, leading to increased investment in propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic advantages by providing a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce propene compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, it reduces the reliance on fossil fuels and minimizes the use of solvents and additives, contributing to a cleaner production process."
