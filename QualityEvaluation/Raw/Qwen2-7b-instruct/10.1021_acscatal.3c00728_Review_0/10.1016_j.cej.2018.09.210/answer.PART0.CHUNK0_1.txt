[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts [1] ,[2] ."
[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."
[3] "However, under such an operating condition, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, oligomerization, cylclization, and aromatization, are promoted even more dramatically, thus lowering the catalyst selectivity [4] ."
[4] "Therefore, the catalyst selectivity in PDH dictates not only the yield of propylene, but also plays a key role in determining the stability of the catalyst, and the development of Pt-based catalysts with improved selectivity and increased resistance to coke formation is highly desired."
[5] "Near-surface alloys (NSAs), in which a solute metal is present as the overlayer or in the subsurface of a host metal, exhibit unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from the properties of their constituent metals."
[6] "Core-shell alloy catalysts are NSAs that have a few layers of atoms of one metal enriching the shell of their nanoparticles and have another metal staying in the inner core."
[7] "Because of the size mismatch and electronegativity difference, the electronic structures of the shell atoms are modified by the core atoms through the combined strain and ligand effects [25] , making it possible to tailor the adsorption and catalytic properties of the core-shell alloys to a particular application."
[8] "In propane dehydrogenation, propylene is obviously the most important chemisorbed species on the catalyst surface."
[9] "Our calculated results indicate that among the 12 transition metals Pt binds propylene most strongly."
[10] "By comparison, the heat of propylene adsorption on the Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) surfaces are only less than 0.1eV."
[11] "Therefore, under realist experimental conditions, the surface free energy of Pt would be lowered to the largest extent by the adsorption of carbonaceous species, which in turn drives Pt atoms to the surface to form M@Pt core-shell nanoparticles."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has enabled mass production of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane. This has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propylene. This process is economically advantageous as it uses inexpensive feedstock, offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and demands lower energy compared to traditional methods such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking. However, the side reactions during propane dehydrogenation can negatively impact catalyst selectivity and stability. Therefore, developing Pt-based catalysts with enhanced selectivity and coke resistance is crucial. Core-shell alloy catalysts, being near-surface alloys with a solute metal enriching the shell, have unique properties that can be tailored for specific applications. The electronic structures of the shell atoms are modified by the core atoms through strain and ligand effects, allowing for customization of adsorption and catalytic properties. Propene is the primary chemisorbed species on the catalyst surface, and among the 12 transition metals, platinum binds propylene most strongly. Under realistic conditions, the surface free energy of platinum can be significantly reduced by adsorption of carbonaceous species, driving platinum atoms to the surface to form core-shell nanoparticles.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着北美页岩气革命的增长而增长，这使得大规模生产天然气液体（如乙烷和丙烷）成为可能。这推动了丙烷脱氢作为生产丙烯的首选方法。与传统的裂解炉、催化裂化等方法相比，该过程经济上具有优势，因为它使用廉价原料、提供相对较高的丙烯选择性和更低的能量需求。然而，在丙烷脱氢过程中，副反应可能会对催化剂的选择性和稳定性产生负面影响。因此，开发铂基催化剂以提高选择性和抗结焦性能至关重要。核心壳合金催化剂是表面合金，其中一种金属以过层或次表层的形式富集在其纳米颗粒的壳层中，另一种金属则位于内核。由于尺寸不匹配和电负性差异，核心原子通过应变和配位效应改变了壳层原子的电子结构，从而有可能根据特定应用定制核心壳合金的吸附和催化性质。壳层原子的电子结构被核心原子通过应变和配位效应修改，允许为特定应用定制吸附和催化性质。丙烯是催化剂表面的主要吸附物种，12种过渡金属中，铂对丙烯的结合强度最强。在实际条件下，铂表面的自由能可以通过吸附碳质物种显著降低，进而驱动铂原子到表面形成核心壳纳米粒子。
