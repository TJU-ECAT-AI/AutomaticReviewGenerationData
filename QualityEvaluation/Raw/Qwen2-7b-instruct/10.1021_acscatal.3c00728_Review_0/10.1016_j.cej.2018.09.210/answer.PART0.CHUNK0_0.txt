[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts."
[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."
[3] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH [3], but they suffer from the unsatisfactory selectivity towards propylene and poor catalyst stability due to coke formation."
[4] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometric and electronic structures of the Pt-based catalysts."
[5] "Near-surface alloys (NSAs), in which a solute metal is present as the overlayer or in the subsurface of a host metal, exhibit unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from the properties of their constituent metals."
[6] "Core-shell alloy catalysts can be synthesized in controlled environment in the atomic layer deposition and dendrimer encapsulation techniques."
[7] "Despite some experimental work has been devoted to studying dehydrogenation reactions over core-shell alloy catalysts, a quantitative structure-activity relationship has not yet been established by correlating data on the activity of core-shell alloys with their electronic structures."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained prominence in the chemical industry due to its economical feedstock, higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand compared to traditional olefin production processes. The demand for propene, a versatile olefin, has driven the adoption of PDH as a preferred production method. The process involves converting propane into propene by breaking its hydrocarbon bonds at high temperatures. The economic advantage lies in the efficient use of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane and propane, as feedstocks. Environmental benefits include reduced energy consumption and potential for cleaner production processes compared to conventional methods. The development of catalysts with improved selectivity and coke resistance, such as core-shell alloy catalysts, aims to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of PDH.

由于经济的原料、更高的丙烯选择性以及较低的能量需求，丙烷脱氢（PDH）已成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产过程之一，并已被成功商业化。PDH过程通过在高温下分解丙烷的碳氢键来将丙烷转化为丙烯。对丙烯的需求推动了PDH作为首选生产方法的采用。该过程利用天然气液体，尤其是乙烷和丙烷作为原料，具有经济效益。环境优势包括能源消耗的减少和潜在的清洁生产过程与传统方法相比。为了提高效率和可持续性，开发具有更好选择性和抗焦化能力的催化剂，如核壳合金催化剂，是PDH发展的目标。
