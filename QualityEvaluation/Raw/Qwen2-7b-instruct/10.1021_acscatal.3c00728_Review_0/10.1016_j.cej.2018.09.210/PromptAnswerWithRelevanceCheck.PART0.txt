Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained prominence in the chemical industry due to its economical feedstock, higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand compared to traditional olefin production processes. The demand for propene, a versatile olefin, has driven the adoption of PDH as a preferred production method. The process involves converting propane into propene by breaking its hydrocarbon bonds at high temperatures. The economic advantage lies in the efficient use of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane and propane, as feedstocks. Environmental benefits include reduced energy consumption and potential for cleaner production processes compared to conventional methods. The development of catalysts with improved selectivity and coke resistance, such as core-shell alloy catalysts, aims to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of PDH.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has enabled mass production of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane. This has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propylene. This process is economically advantageous as it uses inexpensive feedstock, offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and demands lower energy compared to traditional methods such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking. However, the side reactions during propane dehydrogenation can negatively impact catalyst selectivity and stability. Therefore, developing Pt-based catalysts with enhanced selectivity and coke resistance is crucial. Core-shell alloy catalysts, being near-surface alloys with a solute metal enriching the shell, have unique properties that can be tailored for specific applications. The electronic structures of the shell atoms are modified by the core atoms through strain and ligand effects, allowing for customization of adsorption and catalytic properties. Propene is the primary chemisorbed species on the catalyst surface, and among the 12 transition metals, platinum binds propylene most strongly. Under realistic conditions, the surface free energy of platinum can be significantly reduced by adsorption of carbonaceous species, driving platinum atoms to the surface to form core-shell nanoparticles.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly with the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to a surge in the production of ethane and propane. This has made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) a more attractive method for olefin production compared to traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. PDH offers economic benefits, notably due to its use of inexpensive feedstock and its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity and lower energy demand. This makes PDH a competitive process for propylene production, with successful commercial implementations by companies such as Honeywell UOP, CB&I Lummus, and Uhde.

However, PDH faces challenges, primarily the occurrence of side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, which can reduce catalyst selectivity. Coke formation, a byproduct of these reactions, can block catalyst sites, decrease activity, and ultimately deactivate the catalysts. Thus, the selectivity in PDH not only affects propylene yield but also impacts catalyst stability. To address this, there is a strong desire for the development of Pt-based catalysts with enhanced selectivity and resistance to coke formation.

Core-shell alloy catalysts, a subset of near-surface alloys (NSAs), offer a promising solution. These catalysts feature a core-metal and a shell-metal, with the latter having several layers of atoms enriched in the shell of the nanoparticles. The synthesis of core-shell alloy catalysts can be carried out in a controlled environment using techniques such as atomic layer deposition and dendrimer encapsulation. The size mismatch and electronegativity difference between the core and shell metals lead to modifications in the electronic structures of the shell atoms, influenced by both strain and ligand effects.

These modifications allow for tailoring of the adsorption and catalytic properties of the core-shell alloys to specific applications. For instance, Pt clusters with small sizes that predominantly contain coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms on their surface exhibit a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, resulting in higher catalytic activity. Conversely, large Pt clusters with a dominant Pt(111) structure show weakened binding strength for propylene, leading to improved selectivity by reducing the possibility of deep dehydrogenation. Additionally, doping Pt with Sn can suppress hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions by selectively covering under-coordinated platinum sites, responsible for side reactions.

Xia et al.'s work demonstrates the potential of using magnesium to dope aluminum oxide support materials, resulting in the formation of a spinel phase that promotes the reduction of Pt species and inhibits coke formation. This showcases the effectiveness of core-shell alloy catalysts in enhancing propylene selectivity and improving catalyst stability during PDH.

丙烯在化工行业的地位随着美国页岩气革命的兴起而显著演变，页岩气革命促进了乙烷和丙烷的大规模生产，这使得从烷烃裂解制备烯烃，尤其是丙烯，成为与传统蒸汽裂解、轻柴油和其它油品的催化裂化等方法相比更具吸引力的选择。PDH利用了经济实惠的原料，并能以较低的能量需求和较高的丙烯选择性生产丙烯，使其成为一个竞争激烈的丙烯生产过程，已由霍尼韦尔UOP（Oleflex）、CB&I Lummus（Catofin）和Uhde（STAR）等公司成功商业化。

然而，在PDH过程中，氢解、裂解、异构化、环化和芳构化等副反应的加剧会降低催化剂的选择性。焦炭的形成不仅能够堵塞催化剂活性位点，还会影响催化活性并最终导致催化剂失效。因此，PDH的选择性不仅影响丙烯产量，也决定了催化剂的稳定性，开发具有改进选择性和增强抗焦炭生成能力的Pt基催化剂是迫切需要的。

核心壳合金催化剂作为近表面合金（NSA）的一个子集，提供了有前景的解决方案。这些催化剂包括核心金属和壳层金属，其中壳层金属在其纳米颗粒中富集了几层原子。核心壳合金催化剂可以通过原子层沉积和树状体封装技术等控制环境下的方法进行合成。核心与壳层之间的尺寸不匹配和电负性差异导致壳层原子的电子结构通过结合应力和配体效应得到修改。

这些修改允许对核心壳合金的吸附和催化性质进行定制，以适应特定应用。例如，主要由表面上协调不足的金属原子组成的Pt簇具有较低的脱氢能量壁垒，从而表现出更高的催化活性。相比之下，主要含有Pt(111)结构的大Pt簇显示出丙烯较弱的结合强度，通过减少深脱氢的可能性来提高选择性。此外，向Pt中掺杂Sn可以抑制氢解和异构化反应，因为掺杂物可以选择性地覆盖负责副反应的不饱和铂位。

夏等人的一项工作展示了通过向氧化铝支撑材料中添加镁，形成六方晶系相，促进Pt物种的还原并抑制焦炭生成的可能性。这表明核心壳合金催化剂在提高丙烯选择性并改善PDH过程中催化剂稳定性方面具有潜力。
