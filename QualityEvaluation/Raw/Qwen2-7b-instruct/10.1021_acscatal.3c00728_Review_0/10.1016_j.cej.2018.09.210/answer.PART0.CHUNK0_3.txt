[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts [1], [2]."
[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."
[3] "However, under such an operating condition, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, oligomerization, cylclization, and aromatization, are promoted even more dramatically, thus lowering the catalyst selectivity [4]."
[4] "Therefore, the catalyst selectivity in PDH dictates not only the yield of propylene, but also plays a key role in determining the stability of the catalyst, and the development of Pt-based catalysts with improved selectivity and increased resistance to coke formation is highly desired."
[5] "Core-shell alloy catalysts are NSAs that have a few layers of atoms of one metal enriching the shell of their nanoparticles and have another metal staying in the inner core. Experimentally, core-shell alloy catalysts can be synthesized in controlled environment in the atomic layer deposition and dendrimer encapsulation techniques [23], [24]."
[6] "The substitution of less expensive or non-precious metals for Pt in the core region can significantly increase the Pt dispersion and therefore reduce the catalyst cost."
[7] "The heat of propylene adsorption on the Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) surfaces are only less than 0.1eV. Therefore, under realistic experimental conditions, the surface free energy of Pt would be lowered to the largest extent by the adsorption of carbonaceous species, which in turn drives Pt atoms to the surface to form M@Pt core-shell nanoparticles."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its increasing demand driven by the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to the mass production of natural gas liquids including propane. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a preferred production method for propylene because of its economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand compared to traditional processes. This approach meets the growing needs for propylene across various applications efficiently. The economic advantage lies in the use of inexpensive feedstock, while the environmental benefits come from potentially reduced emissions and energy consumption compared to conventional methods. The development of core-shell alloy catalysts aims to improve the selectivity and resistance to coke formation, addressing a key challenge in PDH to enhance propylene yield and catalyst stability.

核心壳合金催化剂是表面具有几种金属层，这些金属层丰富了纳米粒子的外壳，而另一种金属则留在内核的近表面合金（NSA）。实验上，可以在原子层沉积和树状分子封装技术中在受控环境中合成核心壳合金催化剂。通过替换贵金属铂在核心区域的较便宜或非贵金属，可以显著增加铂的分散度，从而降低催化剂成本。在现实的实验条件下，碳化物物种的吸附会最大程度地降低铂表面的表面自由能，进而驱动铂原子向表面移动形成M@Pt核心壳纳米粒子。

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着其需求的增长而增长，这是由于北美页岩气革命导致天然气液体的大规模生产，特别是乙烷和丙烷。丙烷脱氢（PDH）已成为最具有竞争力的丙烯生产过程之一，并已成功商业化，由霍尼韦尔UOP（Oleflex）、CB&I Lummus（Catofin）和Uhde（STAR）提供支持。与传统的蒸汽裂解、石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品的催化裂解相比，PDH具有经济的原料、相对较高的丙烯选择性和较低的能量需求。这一方法通过有效地满足各种应用领域对丙烯的需求，来高效地满足对丙烯的需求。经济优势在于使用低成本原料，而环境优势可能来自于与传统方法相比可能减少的排放和能量消耗。核心壳合金催化剂的发展旨在提高选择性和抗结焦性能，以解决PDH的关键挑战，从而提高丙烯产量和催化剂稳定性。
