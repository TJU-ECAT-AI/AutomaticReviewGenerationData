[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts."
[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."
[3] "The strongly exothermic nature of PDH [ ,=+123.8kJ/mol] requires high reaction temperature (around 600C) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."
[4] "However, under such an operating condition, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, oligomerization, cylclization, and aromatization, are promoted even more dramatically, thus lowering the catalyst selectivity."
[5] "In the side reactions, propylene or other C3 species would be deeply dehydrogenated to give C1 and C2 species that may subsequently desorb to form ethane, ethylene, and methane or server as coke precursors."
[6] "The formation of coke could block the active sites of catalysts, impede the catalytic activity, and eventually deactivate the catalysts completely."
[7] "Therefore, the catalyst selectivity in PDH dictates not only the yield of propylene, but also plays a key role in determining the stability of the catalyst, and the development of Pt-based catalysts with improved selectivity and increased resistance to coke formation is highly desired."
[8] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometric and electronic structures of the Pt-based catalysts."
[9] "Near-surface alloys (NSAs), in which a solute metal is present as the overlayer or in the subsurface of a host metal, exhibit unique chemical and physical properties that are distinct from the properties of their constituent metals."
[10] "Core-shell alloy catalysts are NSAs that have a few layers of atoms of one metal enriching the shell of their nanoparticles and have another metal staying in the inner core."
[11] "Experimentally, core-shell alloy catalysts can be synthesized in controlled environment in the atomic layer deposition and dendrimer encapsulation techniques."
[12] "Because of the size mismatch and electronegativity difference, the electronic structures of the shell atoms are modified by the core atoms through the combined strain and ligand effects."
[13] "Hwu et al. reported that the Ni@Pt core-shell catalyst can catalyze the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction while the monometallic Pt and Ni do not have any catalytic activity."
[14] "In addition, the core-shell nanostructure provides an effective way of increasing the utilization efficiency of precious metals."
[15] "The substitution of less expensive or non-precious metals for Pt in the core region can significantly increase the Pt dispersion and therefore reduce the catalyst cost."
[16] "Despite some experimental work has been devoted to studying dehydrogenation reactions over core-shell alloy catalysts, a quantitative structure-activity relationship has not yet been established by correlating data on the activity of core-shell alloys with their electronic structures."
[17] "In the current work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic analysis have been carried to identify Pt-based core-shell alloy catalysts with improved catalyst selectivity and coke resistance for propane dehydrogenation."

1. The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its increasing demand driven by the shale gas revolution in North America. This has led to mass production of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane and propane. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become a preferred method for propylene production due to its economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand. This process is economically advantageous as it meets the growing needs for propylene across various applications. Environmentally, PDH offers a cleaner alternative to traditional olefin production methods like steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking, potentially reducing emissions.

2. The development of core-shell alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation aims to improve selectivity and resistance to coke formation. These catalysts are designed to enhance propylene yield while maintaining high catalytic activity. The introduction of less expensive or non-precious metals in the core region increases the dispersion of precious metals like Pt, reducing catalyst costs. The electronic structures of the shell atoms are modified through the combined strain and ligand effects, tailoring the adsorption and catalytic properties of the core-shell alloys for specific applications. The study establishes a quantitative structure-activity relationship, identifying the best core-shell alloy catalyst for propane dehydrogenation based on improved propylene selectivity and comparable catalytic activity.

1. 在化学工业中，丙烯的重要性随着其需求的增长而演变，特别是由于北美页岩气革命带来的大规模生产天然气液体，尤其是乙烷和丙烷。丙烷脱氢（PDH）已成为首选的丙烯生产方法，因为它具有经济的原料、相对较高的丙烯选择性以及较低的能量需求。这在满足丙烯在各种应用中的增长需求方面具有经济优势。从环境角度来看，PDH可能提供比传统裂解油、石脑油和其它石油副产品的催化裂化等传统方法更清洁的选择，潜在地减少排放。

2. 用于丙烷脱氢的核心壳合金催化剂的发展旨在提高选择性和抗结焦性能。这些催化剂旨在增强丙烯产量的同时保持高催化活性。通过将较便宜或非贵金属引入核心区域，可以增加贵金属如铂的分散性，从而降低催化剂成本。通过结合应力和配位效应修改壳层原子的电子结构，为特定应用定制核心壳合金的吸附和催化性质。研究建立了定量结构-活性关系，根据核心壳合金的电子结构来识别最佳丙烷脱氢催化剂，以实现改进的丙烯选择性和相当的催化活性。
