[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."
[3] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."
[4] "The use of smaller Pt particles can effectively inhibit coke formation."
[5] "Alternatively, increasing the electron density on the Pt atoms can also effectively weaken the adsorption of alkene molecules and coke precursors, thus reducing coke deposition."
[6] "Its exceptional ability to maintain the high activity and stability at ultrahigh space velocities further showed that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitated the kinetic transfer process."
[7] "The economic advantage of propane dehydrogenation lies in its ability to produce propylene with high efficiency and low environmental impact."
[8] "Environmental benefits include reduced energy consumption and minimized CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods."

Propene, a key chemical building block, is essential for producing a wide range of products including polymers, solvents, and fuels. Its growing demand in industries such as plastics manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture has driven the search for more efficient and sustainable production methods. Propane dehydrogenation offers an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional processes like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil-derived naphtha. This method requires less energy and produces fewer CO2 emissions, making it a preferred choice for meeting the increasing needs for propene across various applications. The economic advantage is seen in the high efficiency and low cost of propylene production, while environmental benefits come from the reduced energy usage and minimized carbon footprint compared to conventional techniques.
