[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."
[3] "Further addition of a Sn promoter has proved necessary to obtain the optimum catalyst."
[4] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."
[5] "In the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and did not suffer from coke formation or sintering processes."

Propene, or propylene, holds significant importance in the chemical industry due to its wide range of applications, including plastics, rubbers, and solvents. Its demand has grown steadily over the years, driven by advancements in technology and the development of new products. Propane dehydrogenation offers an efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional methods of propene production, such as thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil-derived naphtha. These conventional methods require substantial energy inputs and result in significant CO2 emissions, impacting the environment negatively. In contrast, propane dehydrogenation is considered an economical and environmentally friendly process. 

Key advantages of using propane dehydrogenation for propene production include:
1. **Energy Efficiency**: Propane dehydrogenation consumes less energy compared to traditional cracking methods.
2. **Reduced Environmental Impact**: It minimizes CO2 emissions, contributing to a lower carbon footprint.
3. **Versatile Feedstock**: It allows for the utilization of propane, a widely available and abundant feedstock, which may be sourced from natural gas or other petrochemical sources.

These factors have led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for propene production, particularly in meeting the growing demand for propene in various industries.

丙烯，在化学工业中具有重要意义，因为它在塑料、橡胶和溶剂等众多领域的广泛应用。其需求的增长是由于技术进步和新产品开发的推动。丙烷脱氢提供了一种比传统方法（如从原油衍生的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解）更高效且环境友好的丙烯生产替代方案。这些传统的裂解方法需要大量的能量输入，并导致大量二氧化碳排放，对环境产生负面影响。相比之下，丙烷脱氢被认为是一种经济且环保的过程。

丙烷脱氢用于丙烯生产的几个关键优势包括：
1. **能源效率**：与传统裂解方法相比，丙烷脱氢消耗的能量较少。
2. **减少环境影响**：它减少了二氧化碳排放，从而降低了碳足迹。
3. **灵活的原料**：它允许使用广泛可用且丰富的原料丙烷，这些原料可能源自天然气或其他石油化工来源。

这些因素导致采用丙烷脱氢作为首选的丙烯生产方法，特别是在满足对丙烯日益增长的需求方面。
