[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "Propane conversion dramatically dropped from an initial 43.8% to 28.3% after 24h. The propylene selectivity was also lower than for the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst."
[3] "Overall, these geometric and electronic features are very attractive for a dehydrogenation catalyst with excellent catalytic reactivity and stability."
[4] "The amount (3.7%) of coke deposited on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet was much lower than on the PtSn/Al2O3ref. (7.6%) catalyst."
[5] "Our work has also demonstrated that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitates mass-transfer and kinetically controlled diffusion processes during propane dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications, particularly in the production of plastics, rubbers, and solvents. The increasing demand for propene across various industries drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic advantages by providing a cost-effective way to produce propene from propane, which is often cheaper than competing methods. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation reduces energy consumption and CO2 emissions compared to traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil-derived naphtha. This makes it a more sustainable option for meeting the growing needs for propene in various applications.

The PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst significantly improves the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation, achieving high propylene yields with minimal coke formation and sintering. The catalyst's sheet construction facilitates mass transfer and diffusion, enhancing its reactivity and stability under high space velocities. The low coke deposition on the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst ensures better stability and longer operational life compared to the reference catalyst.

The sheet structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in mass-transfer and diffusion processes, allowing for efficient transport of reactants and products during propane dehydrogenation. This not only boosts the catalyst's performance but also contributes to its long-term stability under reaction conditions.
