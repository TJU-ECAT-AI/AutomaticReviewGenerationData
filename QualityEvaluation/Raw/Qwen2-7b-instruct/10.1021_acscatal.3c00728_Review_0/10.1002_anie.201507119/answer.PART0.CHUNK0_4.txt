[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a feed consisting of C3H8/H2/N2 (1:1.25:4) under atmospheric pressure at 590C."
[3] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."
[4] "The increasing demand for propene in the chemical industry drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its economic and environmental advantages."
[5] "This catalyst's exceptional ability to maintain the high activity and stability at ultrahigh space velocities further showed that the sheet construction of the catalyst facilitated the kinetic transfer process."
[6] "Overall, these geometric and electronic features are very attractive for a dehydrogenation catalyst with excellent catalytic reactivity and stability."
