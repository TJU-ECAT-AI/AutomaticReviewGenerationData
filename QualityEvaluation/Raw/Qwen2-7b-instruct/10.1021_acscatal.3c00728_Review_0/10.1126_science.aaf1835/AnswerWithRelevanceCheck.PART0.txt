          [1] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
          [2] "We present a process that reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%."
          [3] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1) (9)."
          [4] "Selectivities varied in the range from 67 to 80% for C2=C4= and 81 to 94% for C2C4 in the studied H2/CO (0.5 to 3.0) and space velocity ranges (1285 to 7714 ml/h·gcat) and different ratios of ZnCrOx/MSAPO."
          [5] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
          [6] "In contrast, the C1 and C5+ products were difficult to suppress simultaneously in FTTO; causing one to decline caused the other to increase (1, 7)."
          [7] "The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat."
          [8] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
          [9] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
          [10] "Furthermore, CO conversion could be tuned by varying the relative mass ratio of oxide/zeolite (fig. S4) (9), which lends further support to the above hypothesis that the composite catalyst is bifunctional and that the reaction involves intermediate transport in gas phase."

          The development of a bifunctional catalyst system for converting syngas to light olefins, specifically targeting high selectivity for C2=C4= olefins (up to 80%) and C2C4 hydrocarbons (94% at 17% CO conversion), surpasses conventional catalyst limitations. The catalyst comprises a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) with a hierarchical pore structure. This system allows for the separation of CO activation and CC coupling onto distinct active sites with complementary properties, enhancing the selectivity for desired products. The process achieves high yields of light olefins with minimal formation of unwanted methane and C5+ products, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTTO) methods. The bifunctional nature of the catalyst, characterized by the ability to adjust CO conversion through the mass ratio of oxide to zeolite, contributes to its superior performance in producing light olefins with high purity and selectivity.

          本文讨论了一种用于将合成气转化为轻质烯烃的双功能催化剂系统的开发。该系统专门针对C2=C4=烯烃（高达80%）和C2C4烃类（17%CO转化率下为94%）的高选择性，超越了常规催化剂的局限。该催化剂由一种部分还原氧化物（ZnCrOx）和具有分级孔结构的多孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）组成。该系统允许将CO激活和CC耦合分别放置在具有互补性质的不同活性位点上，从而增强所需产品的选择性。该过程实现了高产率的轻质烯烃，同时最大限度地减少了不希望的甲烷和C5+产物的形成，提供了一个比传统费歇尔-特罗普希合成（FTTO）方法更高效的替代方案。催化剂的双功能特性，表现为通过氧化物与沸石质量比调整CO转化的能力，对其性能的优越性做出了贡献，生产出高纯度和高选择性的轻质烯烃。

          [2] "Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong)."
          [3] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
          [4] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite."
          [5] "Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."

          The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propene is driven by its ability to efficiently convert propane to propene, thereby meeting the growing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications. Economically, this process is advantageous due to its high conversion rates and lower dependency on fossil fuels compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, it promotes sustainability by potentially utilizing alternative feedstocks like coal and biomass-derived syngas with a lower H2/CO ratio, reducing the carbon footprint and promoting the circular economy. The process is not only economically viable but also environmentally sustainable, making it a preferred choice for propene production.
