1. The conventional catalysts for producing light olefins are limited to a 60% conversion rate and deactivate due to carbon buildup. However, the OX-ZEO process achieves a high C2=C4= selectivity of up to 80% and a C2C4 selectivity of 94% at a CO conversion of 17%.

2. The key challenge in forming light olefins from syngas lies in precisely controlling the CC coupling while minimizing overhydrogenation and methane formation.

3. The OX-ZEO process enables selective formation of light olefins by controlling CC coupling within the confined acidic pores of zeolites, thus avoiding deactivation through carbon buildup.

4. The OX-ZEO process uses a bifunctional catalyst with a partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) for CO and H2 activation, and zeolites for CC coupling, achieving high selectivity for light olefins.

5. The catalysts that contain metal oxides and zeolites, like Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β, have been attempted previously for syngas conversion, but they primarily produce dimethyl ether, liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o), or gasoline. The OX-ZEO process is more efficient due to the bifunctionality of the catalyst.

6. The OX-ZEO process involves reaction intermediates generated over the oxides transporting in the gas phase towards the active sites of MSAPO, where they are converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, rather than being hydrogenated to CH4 over the oxide or in gas phase.

7. Mode 3, which combines the oxides and MSAPO in an alternating sequence, reduces the transport distance, leading to enhanced C2=C4= selectivity of 65% at 7714 ml/h·gcat.

8. The precursor of hydrocarbons, CHx species formed over ZnCrOx, are considered the intermediates in the OX-ZEO process.

9. Ketene, synthesized via pyrolysis of acetic anhydride, can be directly converted to light olefins by MSAPO catalyst, as demonstrated by the comparison of the results in the blank reactor and in the presence of the catalyst.

1. 常规催化剂用于生产轻质烯烃时，转化率受限于60%，并因碳积累而失效。然而，OX-ZEO过程能够达到高达80%的C2=C4=选择性和94%的C2C4选择性，CO转化率为17%。

2. 形成轻质烯烃的关键挑战在于精确控制CC耦合，同时减少过氢化和甲烷形成。

3. OX-ZEO过程通过在酸性孔隙限定的环境中控制CC耦合，避免氧化物表面的碳积累，从而实现轻质烯烃的高选择性形成。

4. OX-ZEO过程使用部分还原氧化物表面（ZnCrOx）作为CO和H2的激活点，以及沸石作为CC耦合点的双功能催化剂，实现高轻质烯烃选择性。

5. 包含金属氧化物和沸石的催化剂，如Cr2O3-ZnO和CuO-ZnO，以及ZSM-5、Y和β等沸石，之前尝试用于合成气转换，主要产生二甲醚、液化石油气（C3oC4o）或汽油。与之相比，OX-ZEO过程更高效，得益于其双功能催化剂。

6. 在OX-ZEO过程中，生成于氧化物上的反应中间体在气体中运输至沸石活性位点进行转化，形成C2C4烃类，而不是在氧化物表面或气体中被氢化为CH4。

7. 模式3，即氧化物和MSAPO以交替顺序组合，减少了运输距离，导致C2=C4=选择性提高至65%。

8. 预先形成的烃类前体，CHx物种在ZnCrOx上形成，被认为是OX-ZEO过程中的中间体。

9. 直接由乙酸酐热解产生的酮烯，可以通过MSAPO催化剂转化为轻质烯烃，这一结果通过空白反应器和存在催化剂的情况下的比较得到证实。
