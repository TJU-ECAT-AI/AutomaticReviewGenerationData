[1] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
[2] "We present a process that reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%."
[3] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1) (9)."
[4] "Selectivities varied in the range from 67 to 80% for C2=C4= and 81 to 94% for C2C4 in the studied H2/CO (0.5 to 3.0) and space velocity ranges (1285 to 7714 ml/h·gcat) and different ratios of ZnCrOx/MSAPO."
[5] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
[6] "In contrast, the C1 and C5+ products were difficult to suppress simultaneously in FTTO; causing one to decline caused the other to increase (1, 7)."
[7] "The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat."
[8] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
[9] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
[10] "Furthermore, CO conversion could be tuned by varying the relative mass ratio of oxide/zeolite (fig. S4) (9), which lends further support to the above hypothesis that the composite catalyst is bifunctional and that the reaction involves intermediate transport in gas phase."

The document discusses the development of a bifunctional catalyst for converting syngas into light olefins. The catalyst, composed of a zinc-chromium oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO), achieves high conversion rates and selectivity, with a C2=C4= selectivity reaching up to 80% and a C2C4 selectivity reaching up to 94%. This surpasses the limitations of conventional catalysts, which are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate due to carbon buildup. The catalyst operates by creating ketene intermediates through the zinc-chromium oxide surface, which are then coupled within the confined acidic pores of the zeolite. This process allows for the selective formation of light olefins with minimal methane formation, making it suitable for the production of chemical and polymer synthesis materials. The catalyst's ability to tune CO conversion and selectivity through adjusting the mass ratio of oxide to zeolite further enhances its effectiveness. The document also highlights that the catalyst maintains high performance for extended periods, demonstrating its potential for industrial application.

本文讨论了一种用于将合成气转化为轻质烯烃的双功能催化剂的发展。该催化剂由锌铬氧化物（ZnCrOx）和多孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）组成，实现了高转化率和选择性，C2=C4=的选择性达到80%，C2C4的选择性达到94%。这超过了传统催化剂的限制，传统催化剂在机制上仅限于<60%的转化率，并且由于碳沉积而失效。该催化剂通过锌铬氧化物表面产生酮基中间体工作，这些中间体随后在沸石的受限酸性孔内进行耦合。这一过程允许选择性地形成轻质烯烃，同时最大限度地减少甲烷的生成，使其适用于化学和聚合物合成材料的生产。催化剂能够通过调整氧化物与沸石的质量比来调节CO转化率和选择性，进一步提高了其有效性。文献还表明，催化剂能够在长时间内保持高性能，展示了其工业应用的潜力。
