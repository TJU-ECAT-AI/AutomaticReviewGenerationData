The document describes a bifunctional catalyst system for converting syngas to light olefins. This system, named OX-ZEO, achieves a high selectivity of 80% for C2=C4= olefins and a total selectivity of 94% for C2C4 hydrocarbons. The catalyst consists of a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO). The OX-ZEO process allows for the separation of CO activation and CC coupling onto two complementary active sites. This system uses ZnCrOx to activate CO and H2, while the zeolite controls CC coupling within its confined acidic pores. The process results in a significant reduction in methane and C5+ selectivities, with less than 5% of these compounds being formed. The catalyst maintains stable performance over a long period, with a total C2C4 selectivity remaining above 90% and a C2=C4= selectivity of 78% over 110 hours of testing.

The OX-ZEO process relies on the transport of reaction intermediates in the gas phase from the oxide to the zeolite, where they are converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons. Ketene is identified as a key intermediate, which blocks the surface polymerization pathway of CHx, thereby avoiding the limitations of traditional Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The product selectivity can be modulated by adjusting the medium strength acidity of the MSAPO, with higher acidity favoring the formation of olefins. The composite catalyst offers the potential for utilizing coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio, expanding the feedstock options for syngas-to-olefin technologies.

文档描述了一种用于将合成气转化为轻质烯烃的双功能催化剂系统。该系统，命名为OX-ZEO，实现了高达80%的C2=C4=烯烃选择性和94%的C2C4烃总选择性。催化剂由一种部分还原氧化物（ZnCrOx）和一种具有CHA结构的微孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）组成。OX-ZEO过程允许将CO激活和CC耦合分别放置在两个互补活性位点上。使用ZnCrOx激活CO和H2，而沸石则在其受限的酸性孔内控制CC耦合。此过程导致甲烷和C5+产物的选择性显著降低，这些化合物的生成量少于5%。催化剂保持稳定的性能，总C2C4选择性在长达110小时的测试期间维持在90%以上，C2=C4=选择性为78%。

OX-ZEO过程依赖于从氧化物到沸石的反应中间体在气体中的传输，其中它们被转换为C2C4烃类。确定酮烯作为关键中间体，它阻止了CHx表面聚合途径，从而避免了传统费歇尔-特罗普希合成的限制。通过调整MSAPO的中等强度酸性，可以调节产品选择性，更高的酸性有利于烯烃的形成。复合催化剂提供了利用煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气低H2/CO比例的可能性，扩大了syngas-to-olefin技术的原料选项。
