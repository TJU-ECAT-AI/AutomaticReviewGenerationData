[1] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
[2] "Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong)."
[3] "This is enabled by a bifunctional catalyst affording two types of active sites with complementary properties."
[4] "The partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) creates ketene intermediates that are then coupled over a zeolite."
[5] "Furthermore, this composite catalyst and the process may allow use of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propene is driven by its ability to meet the growing demands for this olefin across various applications. This process is economically advantageous due to its efficiency in converting propane to propene, and environmentally friendly because it reduces the dependency on fossil fuels. It also allows for the utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio, broadening the sources of raw materials for propene production.
