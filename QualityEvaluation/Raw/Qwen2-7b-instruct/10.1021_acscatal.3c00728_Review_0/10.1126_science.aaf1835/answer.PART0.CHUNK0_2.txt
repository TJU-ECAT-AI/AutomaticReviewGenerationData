[1] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
[2] "We present a process that reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%."
[3] "This C2=C4= selectivity is higher than the best value reported for FTTO (61%) (4) and exceeds the maximum predicted for C2C4 hydrocarbons according to the ASF distribution in typical FTS, as depicted in Fig. 1B."
[4] "The reactivity of this composite catalyst showed good reproducibility, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5%, respectively, among 11 tests (fig. S3)."
[5] "Furthermore, it delivered rather stable performance (Fig. 1C). The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat."
[6] "In the absence of MSAPO (corresponding to Mode 1 of Fig. 2A), syngas was converted mainly to CH4 (selectivity 53%), and selectivity to C2C4 hydrocarbons was only 38% over ZnCrOx."
[7] "This result shows that reaction intermediates generated over the oxides must have transported in the gas phase toward the active sites of MSAPO, where they were converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, rather than being hydrogenated to CH4 over the oxide or in gas phase."
[8] "By forming ketene, the reaction pathway of surface polymerization of CHx is blocked, hence circumventing the ASF limits of FTS. Subsequently, in the presence of confined acidic environment of zeolite pores, CH2CO can be converted to olefins (Fig. 2A)."
[9] "In contrast, a composite catalyst with almost no medium strength acidic sites had a similar product distribution, as the catalyst contained no zeolite (fig. S17 and table S3) (9)."
[10] "These findings open up a new avenue for development of syngas-to-olefin technologies, which may allow utilization of coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio."

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. achieves higher conversions of syngas to light olefins, reaching up to 80% for C2=C4= olefins and 94% for C2C4 hydrocarbons at a CO conversion of 17%. This exceeds the maximum predicted by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model for typical FTS processes, which predicts a maximum of 58% for C2C4 hydrocarbons. The catalyst maintains a high selectivity for olefins, with only 2% methane formation. The catalyst's performance is stable over 110 hours, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5% respectively, among 11 tests. The catalyst's selectivity for C2=C4= olefins is higher than the best reported for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTTO) and exceeds the ASF model predictions for C2C4 hydrocarbons. The catalyst operates efficiently under a wide range of H2/CO ratios and space velocities. The process uses a composite catalyst containing a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) with a CHA structure, which allows CO activation and CC coupling to occur on different types of active sites with complementary properties. The catalyst shows good reproducibility and stable performance, with a total C2C4 selectivity greater than 90% and a C2=C4= selectivity of 78% during a 110-hour test. The catalyst utilizes the gas phase for the transport of reaction intermediates towards the active sites of the zeolite, facilitating selective formation of olefins. The catalyst's activity is attributed to the bifunctionality of the composite, which combines the properties of the oxide and zeolite to enable precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation. The catalyst's stability and selectivity make it suitable for utilizing coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.

由焦等人开发的双功能催化剂实现了更高的合成气向轻烯烃的转化，达到80%的C2=C4=烯烃和94%的C2C4烃类在17%的二氧化碳转化率下。这超过了典型的Fischer-Tropsch合成（FTS）过程根据安德森-舒尔茨-弗洛里（ASF）模型预测的C2C4烃类最大58%的预测值。催化剂保持高烯烃选择性，仅产生2%的甲烷。催化剂在110小时内稳定运行，CO转化率和选择性分别波动在4%和5%之间，在11次测试中。C2=C4=烯烃的选择性高于已报道的Fischer-Tropsch到烯烃（FTTO）的最佳值，并超过典型的FTS过程中ASF模型预测的C2C4烃类的最大值。催化剂在广泛的H2/CO比例和空间速度范围内有效运行。该过程使用包含部分还原氧化物（ZnCrOx）和具有CHA结构的微孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）的复合催化剂，允许CO激活和CC耦合发生在不同类型的活性位点上，具有互补的性质。催化剂表现出良好的可重复性和稳定性，在110小时的测试中，总C2C4选择性大于90%，C2=C4=选择性为78%。催化剂利用气体相来运输反应中间体到沸石的活性位点，促进选择性形成烯烃。催化剂的活性归因于复合材料的双功能性，结合氧化物和沸石的特性，能够精确控制CC耦合，同时抑制过氢化和甲烷形成。催化剂的稳定性和选择性使其适合利用煤和生物质衍生的合成气以低H2/CO比率。
