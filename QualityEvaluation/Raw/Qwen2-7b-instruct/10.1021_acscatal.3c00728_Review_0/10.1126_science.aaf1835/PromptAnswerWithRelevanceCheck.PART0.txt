[1] "For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup."
[2] "We present a process that reaches C2=C4= selectivity as high as 80% and C2C4 94% at carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of 17%."
[3] "The composite catalyst contained an oxide (ZnCrOx) that exhibits a typical spinel structure (fig. S1) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) exhibiting CHA structure with a hierarchical pore texture (figs. S1 and S2 and table S1) (9)."
[4] "Selectivities varied in the range from 67 to 80% for C2=C4= and 81 to 94% for C2C4 in the studied H2/CO (0.5 to 3.0) and space velocity ranges (1285 to 7714 ml/h·gcat) and different ratios of ZnCrOx/MSAPO."
[5] "Both CH4 and C5+ selectivities were <5% (Fig. 1A), prominently lower than those in FTTO (in a range of 10 to 40% for CH4 and >10% for C5+) (4)."
[6] "In contrast, the C1 and C5+ products were difficult to suppress simultaneously in FTTO; causing one to decline caused the other to increase (1, 7)."
[7] "The total C2C4 selectivity remained >90%, and that of C2=C4= 78% during a 110-hour test at 400C, 2.5 MPa, and a space velocity of 6828 ml/h·gcat."
[8] "Although composite catalysts containing metal oxides such as Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β have been attempted previously for syngas conversion (1015), the products were mainly dimethylether (10), liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o) (1113), or gasoline (14, 15)."
[9] "We observed an even higher selectivity of C2=C4= (80%), with overall C2C4 selectivity reaching 94% and only 2% CH4 over the well-mixed composite catalyst (Mode 4)."
[10] "Furthermore, CO conversion could be tuned by varying the relative mass ratio of oxide/zeolite (fig. S4) (9), which lends further support to the above hypothesis that the composite catalyst is bifunctional and that the reaction involves intermediate transport in gas phase."

The document discusses the development of a bifunctional catalyst for converting syngas into light olefins. The catalyst, composed of a zinc-chromium oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO), achieves high conversion rates and selectivity, with a C2=C4= selectivity reaching up to 80% and a C2C4 selectivity reaching up to 94%. This surpasses the limitations of conventional catalysts, which are mechanistically limited to <60% conversion and deactivate due to carbon buildup. The catalyst operates by creating ketene intermediates through the zinc-chromium oxide surface, which are then coupled within the confined acidic pores of the zeolite. This process allows for the selective formation of light olefins with minimal methane formation, making it suitable for the production of chemical and polymer synthesis materials. The catalyst's ability to tune CO conversion and selectivity through adjusting the mass ratio of oxide to zeolite further enhances its effectiveness. The document also highlights that the catalyst maintains high performance for extended periods, demonstrating its potential for industrial application.

本文讨论了一种用于将合成气转化为轻质烯烃的双功能催化剂的发展。该催化剂由锌铬氧化物（ZnCrOx）和多孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）组成，实现了高转化率和选择性，C2=C4=的选择性达到80%，C2C4的选择性达到94%。这超过了传统催化剂的限制，传统催化剂在机制上仅限于<60%的转化率，并且由于碳沉积而失效。该催化剂通过锌铬氧化物表面产生酮基中间体工作，这些中间体随后在沸石的受限酸性孔内进行耦合。这一过程允许选择性地形成轻质烯烃，同时最大限度地减少甲烷的生成，使其适用于化学和聚合物合成材料的生产。催化剂能够通过调整氧化物与沸石的质量比来调节CO转化率和选择性，进一步提高了其有效性。文献还表明，催化剂能够在长时间内保持高性能，展示了其工业应用的潜力。

The document describes a bifunctional catalyst system for converting syngas to light olefins. This system, named OX-ZEO, achieves a high selectivity of 80% for C2=C4= olefins and a total selectivity of 94% for C2C4 hydrocarbons. The catalyst consists of a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO). The OX-ZEO process allows for the separation of CO activation and CC coupling onto two complementary active sites. This system uses ZnCrOx to activate CO and H2, while the zeolite controls CC coupling within its confined acidic pores. The process results in a significant reduction in methane and C5+ selectivities, with less than 5% of these compounds being formed. The catalyst maintains stable performance over a long period, with a total C2C4 selectivity remaining above 90% and a C2=C4= selectivity of 78% over 110 hours of testing.

The OX-ZEO process relies on the transport of reaction intermediates in the gas phase from the oxide to the zeolite, where they are converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons. Ketene is identified as a key intermediate, which blocks the surface polymerization pathway of CHx, thereby avoiding the limitations of traditional Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The product selectivity can be modulated by adjusting the medium strength acidity of the MSAPO, with higher acidity favoring the formation of olefins. The composite catalyst offers the potential for utilizing coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio, expanding the feedstock options for syngas-to-olefin technologies.

文档描述了一种用于将合成气转化为轻质烯烃的双功能催化剂系统。该系统，命名为OX-ZEO，实现了高达80%的C2=C4=烯烃选择性和94%的C2C4烃总选择性。催化剂由一种部分还原氧化物（ZnCrOx）和一种具有CHA结构的微孔SAPO沸石（MSAPO）组成。OX-ZEO过程允许将CO激活和CC耦合分别放置在两个互补活性位点上。使用ZnCrOx激活CO和H2，而沸石则在其受限的酸性孔内控制CC耦合。此过程导致甲烷和C5+产物的选择性显著降低，这些化合物的生成量少于5%。催化剂保持稳定的性能，总C2C4选择性在长达110小时的测试期间维持在90%以上，C2=C4=选择性为78%。

OX-ZEO过程依赖于从氧化物到沸石的反应中间体在气体中的传输，其中它们被转换为C2C4烃类。确定酮烯作为关键中间体，它阻止了CHx表面聚合途径，从而避免了传统费歇尔-特罗普希合成的限制。通过调整MSAPO的中等强度酸性，可以调节产品选择性，更高的酸性有利于烯烃的形成。复合催化剂提供了利用煤炭和生物质衍生的合成气低H2/CO比例的可能性，扩大了syngas-to-olefin技术的原料选项。

The bifunctional catalyst developed by Jiao et al. achieves higher conversions of syngas to light olefins, reaching up to 80% for C2=C4= olefins and 94% for C2C4 hydrocarbons at a CO conversion of 17%. This exceeds the maximum predicted by the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model for typical FTS processes, which predicts a maximum of 58% for C2C4 hydrocarbons. The catalyst maintains a high selectivity for olefins, with only 2% methane formation. The catalyst's performance is stable over 110 hours, with CO conversion and selectivity fluctuating within 4 and 5% respectively, among 11 tests. The catalyst's selectivity for C2=C4= olefins is higher than the best reported for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTTO) and exceeds the ASF model predictions for C2C4 hydrocarbons. The catalyst operates efficiently under a wide range of H2/CO ratios and space velocities. The process uses a composite catalyst containing a partially reduced oxide (ZnCrOx) and a mesoporous SAPO zeolite (MSAPO) with a CHA structure, which allows CO activation and CC coupling to occur on different types of active sites with complementary properties. The catalyst shows good reproducibility and stable performance, with a total C2C4 selectivity greater than 90% and a C2=C4= selectivity of 78% during a 110-hour test. The catalyst utilizes the gas phase for the transport of reaction intermediates towards the active sites of the zeolite, facilitating selective formation of olefins. The catalyst's activity is attributed to the bifunctionality of the composite, which combines the properties of the oxide and zeolite to enable precise control of CC coupling while suppressing overhydrogenation and methane formation. The catalyst's stability and selectivity make it suitable for utilizing coal- and biomass-derived syngas with a low H2/CO ratio.

1. The conventional catalysts for producing light olefins are limited to a 60% conversion rate and deactivate due to carbon buildup. However, the OX-ZEO process achieves a high C2=C4= selectivity of up to 80% and a C2C4 selectivity of 94% at a CO conversion of 17%.

2. The key challenge in forming light olefins from syngas lies in precisely controlling the CC coupling while minimizing overhydrogenation and methane formation.

3. The OX-ZEO process enables selective formation of light olefins by controlling CC coupling within the confined acidic pores of zeolites, thus avoiding deactivation through carbon buildup.

4. The OX-ZEO process uses a bifunctional catalyst with a partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) for CO and H2 activation, and zeolites for CC coupling, achieving high selectivity for light olefins.

5. The catalysts that contain metal oxides and zeolites, like Cr2O3-ZnO and CuO-ZnO, and zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and β, have been attempted previously for syngas conversion, but they primarily produce dimethyl ether, liquefied petroleum gas (C3oC4o), or gasoline. The OX-ZEO process is more efficient due to the bifunctionality of the catalyst.

6. The OX-ZEO process involves reaction intermediates generated over the oxides transporting in the gas phase towards the active sites of MSAPO, where they are converted to C2C4 hydrocarbons, rather than being hydrogenated to CH4 over the oxide or in gas phase.

7. Mode 3, which combines the oxides and MSAPO in an alternating sequence, reduces the transport distance, leading to enhanced C2=C4= selectivity of 65% at 7714 ml/h·gcat.

8. The precursor of hydrocarbons, CHx species formed over ZnCrOx, are considered the intermediates in the OX-ZEO process.

9. Ketene, synthesized via pyrolysis of acetic anhydride, can be directly converted to light olefins by MSAPO catalyst, as demonstrated by the comparison of the results in the blank reactor and in the presence of the catalyst.
