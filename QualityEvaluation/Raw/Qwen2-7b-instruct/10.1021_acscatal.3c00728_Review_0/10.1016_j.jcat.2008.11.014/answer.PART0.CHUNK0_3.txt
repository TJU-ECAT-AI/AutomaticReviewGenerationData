<p>The nature of active chromium species in Cr-catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane: New insights by a comprehensive spectroscopic study Abstract Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) was studied over a series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, to gain a better understanding of the nature and distribution of Cr species and their catalytic function.</p>
<p>Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC).</p>
<p>As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation.</p>
<p>It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains 13 wt% Cr at which level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoidable.</p>
<p>A series of xCrSBA-15 and xCrAl2O3 catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species.</p>
<p>The nature and distribution of Cr species in the catalysts was thoroughly investigated by various characterization techniques that are complementary to each other.</p>
<p>The correlation of steady-state activity data and characterization results derived from ex situ and in situ spectroscopic studies enabled us to gain new insights into the nature of active Cr species involved in DHP.</p>

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its versatile applications across various sectors. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers economic and environmental advantages. Economically, dehydrogenation allows for efficient conversion of inexpensive propane feedstocks into valuable propylene, which is crucial for industries requiring propylene. Environmentally, this process reduces the dependency on fossil fuels, potentially leading to lower emissions. The adoption of this method meets the growing needs for propene by providing a sustainable and cost-effective means of production.

In the context of the literature, the study aimed to understand the nature and distribution of chromium species in catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It highlighted the impact of support type, chromium content, and activation methods on the distribution of chromium species. The study also emphasized the importance of creating a well-defined chromium site distribution in catalysts to understand the function of each specific chromium species. Through a comprehensive spectroscopic study, the researchers gained insights into the nature of active chromium species involved in propane dehydrogenation. The results suggested that the activity and stability of chromium species in the catalysts are influenced by the nature of the support material, which has implications for the design of more effective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
