[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to its potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers."
[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene."
[3] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K."
[4] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."
[5] "Therefore, considerable research has been done to gain a deep fundamental knowledge on the structurereactivity relationships of Cr catalysts in dehydrogenation of alkanes by various characterization techniques."
[6] "As evidenced from various studies, the distribution of Cr species is strongly dependent on the nature of the support, Cr content and method of activation."
[7] "A variety of Cr species (isolated, dimers, trimers, polymeric species with different nuclearity and large Cr2O3 clusters) with different oxidation and coordination states and with different redox properties coexist in the same catalyst."
[8] "It is known that DHP activity increases with Cr loading and a typical industrial Cr catalyst contains 13 wt% Cr at which level heterogeneous distribution of Cr species is virtually unavoidable."
[9] "Thus, it has been a major challenge to gain definitive information on the nature of active Cr sites."
[10] "In the present work, a series of Cr catalysts with varying Cr content (0.510 wt%) was prepared aiming to create a well defined Cr site distribution in the catalysts and thereby to derive the catalytic function of each specific Cr species."
