[1] "Boria-alumina catalysts are active in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "For undoped Al2O3, carbon oxides were the main products while the addition of 30 wt% B2O3 led to a significant increase in propene selectivity; propene yields of 18 % were achieved at 823 K."
[3] "It was assumed that higher propene selectivity can be achieved by secondary reactions of propyl radicals formed on the surface after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation."
