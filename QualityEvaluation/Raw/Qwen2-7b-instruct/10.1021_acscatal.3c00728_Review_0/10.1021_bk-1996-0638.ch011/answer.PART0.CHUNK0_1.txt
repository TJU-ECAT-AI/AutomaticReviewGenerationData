[1] "Boria-alumina catalysts are active in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "For undoped Al2O3, carbon oxides were the main products while the addition of 30 wt% B2O3 led to a significant increase in propene selectivity; propene yields of 18 % were achieved at 823 K."
[3] "Only for high boria loading no oxygen exchange products were detected."
[4] "It was assumed that higher propene selectivity can be achieved by secondary reactions of propyl radicals formed on the surface after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its versatile applications across various sectors, such as plastics, synthetic fibers, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce propene compared to traditional methods. This approach is economically advantageous as it allows for the direct conversion of propane to propene without the need for additional processing steps. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation reduces the carbon footprint associated with propene production, as it minimizes the energy required for the conversion process. Moreover, this method can potentially lead to higher yields and better selectivity in propene production, which is crucial for meeting the growing needs for propene across different industries.
