[1] "Boria-alumina catalysts are active in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "For undoped Al2O3, carbon oxides were the main products while the addition of 30 wt% B2O3 led to a significant increase in propene selectivity; propene yields of 18 % were achieved at 823 K."
[3] "The suppression of both, dissociative adsorption of propane and oxygen, was found to be necessary for the improvement of propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over boria-alumina catalysts."
[4] "It was assumed that higher propene selectivity can be achieved by secondary reactions of propyl radicals formed on the surface after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation."

The increasing demand for propene in the chemical industry has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to its versatility across various applications. This process allows for the efficient conversion of propane into propene, which is crucial for the production of numerous chemicals and materials. Economically, propane dehydrogenation offers several advantages, including reduced costs associated with refining processes and increased efficiency compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, this approach contributes positively by minimizing waste and optimizing resource utilization in the production of valuable olefins.

In terms of propene's significance, it is a key intermediate in the synthesis of numerous downstream products, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and other polymers. Its increasing demand reflects its critical role in sectors like packaging, automotive, construction, and healthcare, where its properties make it indispensable.

Propene's production through propane dehydrogenation provides a sustainable solution to meet the growing needs, offering both economic and environmental benefits. By optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions, the industry can achieve higher propene selectivity, leading to enhanced yield and reduced byproduct formation. This not only boosts productivity but also ensures environmental compliance by minimizing emissions and waste generation.
