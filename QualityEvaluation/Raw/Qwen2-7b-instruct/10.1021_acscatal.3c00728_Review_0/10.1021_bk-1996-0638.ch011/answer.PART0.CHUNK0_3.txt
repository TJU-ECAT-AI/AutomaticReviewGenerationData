[1] "Boria-alumina catalysts are active in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "For undoped Al2O3, carbon oxides were the main products while the addition of 30 wt% B2O3 led to a significant increase in propene selectivity; propene yields of 18 % were achieved at 823 K."
[3] "Only for high boria loading no oxygen exchange products were detected."
[4] "It was assumed that higher propene selectivity can be achieved by secondary reactions of propyl radicals formed on the surface after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by its increasing demand and versatility across various applications. Its economic and environmental advantages in meeting growing needs are substantial. The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method is fueled by several key factors:

1. **Increased Demand**: Propene's demand has surged due to its critical role in the production of numerous chemical intermediates and final products, such as polymers, solvents, and specialty chemicals.

2. **Versatility**: Propene's ability to be converted into a wide range of downstream products makes it highly valuable in the petrochemical industry.

3. **Economic Benefits**: Propane dehydrogenation offers cost-effective production methods compared to alternative routes, particularly for regions with abundant propane resources.

4. **Environmental Considerations**: Efficient use of propane through dehydrogenation minimizes waste and environmental impact, aligning with sustainable chemical manufacturing practices.

5. **High Selectivity**: Boria-alumina catalysts play a crucial role in enhancing propene selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation, leading to higher yields and better product purity.

6. **Secondary Reactions**: Formation of propyl radicals on the catalyst surface, facilitated by reduced surface oxidation, contributes to higher propene selectivity through secondary reactions in the gas phase.

By optimizing the use of boria-alumina catalysts and understanding the mechanisms behind propene formation, the chemical industry can efficiently produce propene while minimizing side reactions and improving overall sustainability.
