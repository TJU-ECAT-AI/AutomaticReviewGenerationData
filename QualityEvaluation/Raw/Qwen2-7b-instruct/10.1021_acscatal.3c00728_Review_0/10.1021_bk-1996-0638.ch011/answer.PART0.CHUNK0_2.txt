[1] "Boria-alumina catalysts are active in the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "For undoped Al2O3, carbon oxides were the main products while the addition of 30 wt% B2O3 led to a significant increase in propene selectivity; propene yields of 18 % were achieved at 823 K."
[3] "The suppression of both, dissociative adsorption of propane and oxygen, was found to be necessary for the improvement of propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over boria-alumina catalysts."
[4] "It was assumed that higher propene selectivity can be achieved by secondary reactions of propyl radicals formed on the surface after their release into the gas phase due to diminished surface oxidation."

1. The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved significantly, driven by its increasing demand. Propene is a versatile olefin widely used in the production of polymers, solvents, and other chemicals. Its demand has grown due to advancements in technology, increased industrialization, and the development of new applications. This growth in demand has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The process offers several economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional methods. Economically, it provides a more efficient way to produce propene, reducing costs associated with raw material handling and energy consumption. Environmentally, it minimizes waste and emissions, contributing to a cleaner production process. These factors make propane dehydrogenation an attractive solution for meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications.
