[1] "Light olefins (especially C = 2
C
= 4 ) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."
[2] "Traditionally, C2C4 olefins are produced through either the cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or a multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins process, both involving extensive energy consumption and enormous carbon emission."
[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on.5 However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."
[5] "Recently, Hermans's group,1012 Lu's group1316 and Su's group17,18 independently disclosed that boron nitride (BN) could efficiently catalyze the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to corresponding olefins with impressive selectivity, and with only negligible CO2 formation."
[6] "Such a novel catalyst system addresses the difficulty of selectivity control for olefins that has long existed in the ODH process because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of undesired carbon oxides."
[7] "Boron nitride is also highly promising for industrial implementation because of its high productivity of light olefins, remarkable catalyst stability, superior anti-oxidation ability, and excellent thermal conductivity."
[8] "The oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of boron nitride are the active sites to trigger the ODH reaction of light alkanes."
[9] "Although there are different understandings of the catalytic nature of boron nitride, it is universally acknowledged that oxygen-containing boron sites, gas-phase oxygen, and alkane molecules synergistically participate in the catalytic cycle."
[10] "A newly proposed redox reaction cycle based on BOH sites that initially react with molecular oxygen, leading to BOOB intermediates (oxidation step), and the BOOB species further abstracting the hydrogen atoms from alkane, forming olefin and water (reduction step), and then recovering to BOH sites with the assistance of water, can meet most experimental facts reported by different research groups."

Propene, also known as propene, plays a crucial role in the chemical industry due to its wide range of applications in producing polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method over traditional processes. The key advantages of propane dehydrogenation over conventional methods are its efficiency, lower energy consumption, and reduced carbon emissions. Unlike direct dehydrogenation, which faces challenges such as thermodynamic restrictions, endothermic reactions, and the formation of coke, oxidative dehydrogenation introduces oxygen to overcome these limitations. It facilitates a more efficient, exothermic process at lower temperatures, reducing the need for high-temperature heating and minimizing the risk of coke formation. Boron nitride (BN) catalysts have emerged as a game-changer in this field, offering high selectivity and minimal CO2 formation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These catalysts are highly promising for industrial implementation due to their exceptional productivity, stability, anti-oxidation capability, and thermal conductivity. The active sites responsible for the ODH reaction reside on the surface of boron nitride, featuring oxygen-containing boron species that synergistically interact with gas-phase oxygen and alkane molecules. A recently proposed redox reaction cycle based on BOH sites further elucidates the catalytic mechanism, involving the initial reaction of molecular oxygen, followed by hydrogen abstraction from the alkane, forming olefin and water, and finally recovering the active site with the assistance of water.

丙烯（propene）在化工行业中的重要性在于其广泛应用于生产聚合物、氧化剂和其他衍生物。其需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选的生产方法。与传统的工艺相比，丙烷脱氢的优势在于其效率高、能耗低和碳排放少。与直接脱氢面临热力学限制、强吸热反应和焦炭形成等挑战不同，氧化脱氢通过引入氧气克服了这些难题。它实现了更高效的、放热过程，在较低温度下进行，减少了对高温加热的需求，并降低了焦炭形成的可能性。硼氮化物（BN）催化剂在这一领域崭露头角，能够在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯的过程中提供高选择性和极低的二氧化碳生成。这些催化剂因其出色的生产力、稳定性、抗氧化能力和热导率而成为工业应用的前景。负责催化反应的活性位点位于硼氮化物的表面，包含氧原子的硼物种协同作用于气体相氧和烷烃分子。最近提出的一个基于BOH位点的还原反应循环进一步阐明了催化机制，涉及分子氧的初始反应，随后从烷烃中抽象氢原子，形成烯烃和水，最后通过水的帮助恢复活性位点。
