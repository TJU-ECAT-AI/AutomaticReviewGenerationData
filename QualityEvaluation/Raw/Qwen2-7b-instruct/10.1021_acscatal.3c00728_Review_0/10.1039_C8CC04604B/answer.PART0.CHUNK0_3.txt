[1] "Light olefins (especially C = 2
C
= 4 ) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."
[2] "Traditionally, C2C4 olefins are produced through either the cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or a multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins process, both involving extensive energy consumption and enormous carbon emission."
[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on.5 However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."
[5] "Recently, Hermans's group,1012 Lu's group1316 and Su's group17,18 independently disclosed that boron nitride (BN) could efficiently catalyze the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to corresponding olefins with impressive selectivity, and with only negligible CO2 formation."
[6] "Such a novel catalyst system addresses the difficulty of selectivity control for olefins that has long existed in the ODH process because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of undesired carbon oxides."
[7] "The control experiment with a feed gas of propylene and molecular oxygen further showed that a boron nitride catalyst did not oxidize propylene, and thus prevented its over-oxidation to CO2."
[8] "These results indicate that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalysed ODH of propane is a promising process for industrial implementation."
[9] "The high thermal conductivity of the h-BN catalyst could maintain isothermal operation in such a micro-tubular reactor at even up to 590 C with a higher propane conversion of 45%."
[10] "These performance data are comparable to that of the industrialized ethane steam cracking process in view of the 85% selectivity to ethylene at 60% conversion of ethane, but much superior considering the much lower reaction temperature and CO2 emission."
[11] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of ethane was evidenced by the operation for 200 hours at 590 C."
[12] "In our detailed study, the conversion of methane was retained at 20% at 690 C."
[13] "In addition, carbon-doped boron nitride nanosheets also showed high activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene as well as excellent oxidation resistance."

Propene, also known as propene, has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry due to its wide range of applications in producing polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives. Its growing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, offering several economic and environmental advantages. This process is more efficient than traditional cracking and methanol-to-olefins processes, as it avoids the formation of coke and requires less energy input. Moreover, it produces olefins at lower temperatures, making it more environmentally friendly. Boron nitride catalysts have been found to efficiently catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and other alkanes, providing high selectivity for olefins and minimal CO2 formation. This makes the use of boron nitride a promising process for industrial implementation. High thermal conductivity of boron nitride allows for better heat management, maintaining isothermal operation at high conversion levels, and improving the selectivity of olefins while minimizing CO2 emissions. The stability of boron nitride catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, especially at high temperatures, ensures reliable and long-term industrial applications. Furthermore, boron nitride has also shown promise in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, demonstrating its versatility in various chemical reactions.
