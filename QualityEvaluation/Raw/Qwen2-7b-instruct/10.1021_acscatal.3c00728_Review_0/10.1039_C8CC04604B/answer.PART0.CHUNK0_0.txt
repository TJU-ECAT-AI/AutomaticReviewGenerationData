[1] "Light olefins (especially C = 2
C = 4 ) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."
[2] "Traditionally, C2C4 olefins are produced through either the cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or a multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins process, both involving extensive energy consumption and enormous carbon emission."
[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."
[5] "Recently, Hermans's group,1012 Lu's group1316 and Su's group17,18 independently disclosed that boron nitride (BN) could efficiently catalyze the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to corresponding olefins with impressive selectivity, and with only negligible CO2 formation."
[6] "Such a novel catalyst system addresses the difficulty of selectivity control for olefins that has long existed in the ODH process because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of undesired carbon oxides."
[7] "The economic and environmental advantages of this approach in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications are substantial. It reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions, making it a sustainable choice for industries that rely heavily on olefinic feedstocks."
