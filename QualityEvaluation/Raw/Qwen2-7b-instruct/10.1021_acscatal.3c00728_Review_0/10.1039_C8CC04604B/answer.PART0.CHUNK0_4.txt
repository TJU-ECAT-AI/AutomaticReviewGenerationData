[1] "Light olefins (especially C = 2 C = 4) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."
[2] "Traditionally, C2C4 olefins are produced through either the cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or a multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins process, both involving extensive energy consumption and enormous carbon emission."
[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."
[5] "Recently, Hermans's group,1012 Lu's group1316 and Su's group17,18 independently disclosed that boron nitride (BN) could efficiently catalyze the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to corresponding olefins with impressive selectivity, and with only negligible CO2 formation."
[6] "Such a novel catalyst system addresses the difficulty of selectivity control for olefins that has long existed in the ODH process because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of undesired carbon oxides."
[7] "The industrialized process for ethylene production is steam cracking of petroleum- and/or natural-gas-derived hydrocarbons at high temperatures (8001000 C), typically with 85% selectivity at 60% conversion of ethane."
[8] "However, both chemical complexity and structural instability of polyvalent and multi-component metal oxides hinder the development of this catalyst system."
[9] "The MoVTeNbOx catalysts, prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, are extremely active and highly selective in the ODH of ethane. On the best catalyst, selectivity higher than 80% at ethane conversion levels greater than 80% is obtained at relatively low reaction temperatures (340400 C)."
[10] "Another system giving excellent performance is Li/Dy/Mg/Cl/O,32 but the operating temperature is usually higher than 600 C, and the corrosion of the pipeline and damage to the environment by halogen chloride are unavoidable."
[11] "That is the limit value below which the productivity is too low to be interesting for commercial applications."
[12] "Therefore, the development of novel catalyst systems with simple composition and outstanding performance is still highly desired to push forward the progress for ethane ODH."
[13] "In the case of ODH of propane, the h-BN with edge-hydroxylation treatment (BNOH) exhibited high conversion of propane (20.6%) and selectivity (80.2%) of propylene."
[14] "Ethylene as the main by-product indicated the presence of CC cleavage in the ODH reaction."
[15] "The formation of CO2 (0.5%) was considerably lower than that of the traditional ODH processes (1050% CO2)."
[16] "Hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) also exhibited an olefin productivity of 6.8 golefin gcat1 h1, which was far higher than those of metal oxide catalysts, and stability for at least 300 hours."
[17] "Furthermore, dominantly exposed zig-zag boron-terminated edges and the co-existence of BOB and BOH groups at these edges of the boron nitride with edge-hydroxylation treatment were identified using advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques."
[18] "In the combination of in situ spectroscopy, kinetic analysis and isotope tracer, our emphasis was placed to reveal the origin of catalytic activity of boron nitride materials."
[19] "The outcome suggested that the oxygen-containing edge boron species themselves had no catalytic activity for CH cleavage in propane."
[20] "In situ IR analysis indicated that the OH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction network."
[21] "Isotope-labelling measurements provided further insight into this process, where the hydrogen atoms in the BOH group were abstracted during the ODH reaction."
[22] "The kinetic analysis confirmed that the reaction order of oxygen was close to 0.5, indicating a dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen in the reaction process."
[23] "Based on the above observations, a relatively simple reaction pathway (Fig. 5) was proposed including a redox reaction cycle."
[24] "The BOH sites initially reacted with molecular oxygen, leading to the production of BOOB intermediates (oxidation step)."
[25] "The BOOB species further abstracted the hydrogen atoms from propane, forming C3H6 and H2O (reduction step), and then recovered to BOH sites with the assistance of water."
[26] "Later, Grant et al. reported that the boron-containing materials: boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), tungsten boride (WB), and elemental boron all catalysed the ODH of propane and showed the same product trends in their product distributions as boron nitride."
[27] "High selectivity to propylene was achieved using these B-containing catalysts, with the major byproduct being ethylene, rather than COx."
[28] "They therefore concluded that boron was the necessary element to achieve high olefin selectivity."
[29] "A recent work from Eswaramoorthy et al. shows that high-surface-area h-BN can enhance the ODH performance of propane."
[30] "The addition of ammonia could regenerate the catalytic activity and maintain stable activity for more than 100 hours."
[31] "Boron nitride materials have high thermal conductivity (33 W K1 m1), and thus facilitate the removal of the reaction heat in a highly exothermic ODH reaction of light alkanes, which is crucial to the commercial application of boron nitride."
[32] "These results reported here provide useful information for potentially industrial application of the h-BN catalyst in propane ODH to olefin production."
[33] "For example, the selectivity of propylene and ethylene was obtained as high as 53 and 18%, respectively, at a propane conversion of 52%."
[34] "The high thermal conductivity of the h-BN catalyst could maintain isothermal operation in such a micro-tubular reactor at even up to 590 C with a higher propane conversion of 45%."
[35] "However, a hotspot of >5 C temperature gradient was inevitable in the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed even at relatively low temperature of 520 C."
[36] "Even in an industrially relevant reactor with an inner diameter of 60 mm, a uniform temperature profile can be maintained using the h-BN catalyst bed (1.5 C) as opposed to a temperature gradient of 47 C in the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed."
[37] "These results reported here provide useful information for potentially industrial application of the h-BN catalyst in propane ODH to olefin production."
[38] "Typically, the combined selectivity of all formed olefins, i.e. ethylene, propylene, butylenes and isobutylene, was around 90% at 10% alkane conversion over the h-BN catalyst."
[39] "The calculation of apparent activation energies for n-butane and isobutane ODH were higher than those of reported metal oxide catalysts."
[40] "Spectroscopic characterization showed that BOH and BO species were generated on the surface of h-BN after 48 hours on-stream in both n-butane and isobutane ODH."
[41] "Based on the above results, the author proposed a plausible hypothesis for the formation of C4 olefins from a feed of oxygen and n-butane or isobutane."
[42] "The proposed redox reaction cycle in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over boron nitride."
[43] "The BOH sites initially reacted with molecular oxygen, leading to the production of BOOB intermediates (oxidation step)."
[44] "The BOOB species further abstracted the hydrogen atoms from propane, forming C3H6 and H2O (reduction step), and then recovered to BOH sites with the assistance of water."
[45] "In our studies, the BNOH catalyst afforded surprisingly high selectivity and yield toward ethylene."
[46] "At a very high conversion level of 63%, the ethylene selectivity remained at 80%, corresponding to an ethylene yield of 50%, and only a negligible amount of CO2 (Fig. 8A)."
[47] "The BNOH catalyst also can afford high ethylene productivity, 9.1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1, with >90% selectivity by mediating the reaction conditions (Fig. 8B)."
[48] "Such productivity far exceeds the critical value, 1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1, which would be commercially attractive."
[49] "The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of ethane was evidenced by the operation for 200 hours at 590 C (Fig. 8C), demonstrating its potential for industrial application."
[50] "The dynamic evolution of BOH groups under the ethane ODH reaction conditions was tracked using in situ FT-IR spectroscopy, identifying that the BOH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction system."
[51] "Kinetic analysis showed near half-order dependence on molecular oxygen and second-order dependence on ethane."
[52] "These kinetic behaviors are intrinsically different from traditional metal oxide catalysts which typically follow the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism."
[53] "Altogether, the authors draw two possible catalytic pathways: at a kinetic measuring region, the ethane promoted the formation of BOH active sites, thereby facilitating a nearly direct dehydrogenation of ethane with the aid of O2 adsorption to produce ethylene and hydrogen."
[54] "At a non-kinetic measuring region, it cannot be ruled out that BO active sites are formed from the adsorbed O2, which were capable of abstracting hydrogen from ethane to C2H4 and H2O."
[55] "The follow-up study from Zhou et al. exhibited that there was an induction period for the activity evolution on commercial h-BN for the ODH of ethane to ethylene."
[56] "Various characterization methods such as infrared spectroscopy, O2 adsorption microcalorimetry, and transient analysis of products by mass spectroscopy demonstrated the formation of hydroxyl species on BN, i.e., BOH species, in the induction period during the ODH process."
[57] "The presence of larger amounts of these species on the activated BN can linearly increase the reaction rate of ethane conversion."
[58] "In addition, carbon-doped boron nitride nanosheets also showed high activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene as well as excellent oxidation resistance."
[59] "Meanwhile, Ding and Lv reported that a BCN nanosheet could catalyse ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in a CO2 atmosphere, with 8% conversion and >95% selectivity towards styrene at 550 C."
[60] "Their study further confirmed that the BO species of the BCN nanosheet play a dominant role compared with surface carbon species in a CO2 atmosphere."
[61] "The ethylbenzene could be attached onto the surface of the BCN nanosheets via the BOC bond, and the surface BO groups that were regenerated by CO2 could act as the active sites."

1. Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its versatility in producing polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method for olefin production, offering economic and environmental advantages. Specifically, propane dehydrogenation consumes less energy, emits fewer carbon emissions, and is more efficient in terms of olefin productivity compared to traditional methods. This approach allows for the sustainable production of propene, meeting the growing needs across various applications.

2. Boron nitride catalysts offer several advantages in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, including high selectivity toward olefins, minimal formation of CO2, high productivity, remarkable stability, superior anti-oxidation ability, and excellent thermal conductivity. These properties make boron nitride a promising catalyst for industrial applications, particularly in the production of light olefins from propane and butane. The development of new structure-tuning methods to optimize the ODH performance of boron nitride materials is crucial for further enhancing its catalytic efficiency.

3. The detailed ODH reaction mechanism of boron nitride materials involves a redox reaction cycle. Initially, molecular oxygen reacts with the boron nitride surface to form BOOH or BOOH intermediates (oxidation step). Subsequently, these intermediates abstract hydrogen atoms from the alkane molecules, forming olefin and water (reduction step). The process then regenerates the boron nitride surface with the assistance of water. Understanding this mechanism is essential for developing more effective boron nitride catalysts for ODH reactions and other applications in heterogeneous catalysis.
