[1] "Light olefins (especially C = 2 C = 4) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."
[2] "Traditionally, C2C4 olefins are produced through either the cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or a multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins process, both involving extensive energy consumption and enormous carbon emission."
[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."
[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."
[5] "Recently, Hermans's group,1012 Lu's group1316 and Su's group17,18 independently disclosed that boron nitride (BN) could efficiently catalyze the ODH of C2C4 alkanes to corresponding olefins with impressive selectivity, and with only negligible CO2 formation."
[6] "Such a novel catalyst system addresses the difficulty of selectivity control for olefins that has long existed in the ODH process because of the over-oxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of undesired carbon oxides."
[7] "In the case of ODH of propane, the h-BN with edge-hydroxylation treatment (BNOH) exhibited high conversion of propane (20.6%) and selectivity (80.2%) of propylene. Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins was up to 90.9%. Ethylene as the main by-product indicated the presence of CC cleavage in the ODH reaction."
[8] "These results indicate that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalysed ODH of propane is a promising process for industrial implementation."
[9] "A recent work from Eswaramoorthy et al. shows that high-surface-area h-BN can enhance the ODH performance of propane. For example, the selectivity of propylene and ethylene was obtained as high as 53 and 18%, respectively, at a propane conversion of 52%."
[10] "The significantly improved temperature control in the h-BN catalyst bed can lead to high selectivity towards olefin while minimizing COx formation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its wide range of applications in producing polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives. Its increasing demand drives the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because it offers several economic and environmental advantages. This approach allows for the efficient production of olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, which are essential raw materials in various industries. Unlike direct dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) produces olefins with high selectivity and lower energy consumption, making it more economically viable. Moreover, it avoids the formation of coke and reduces carbon emissions, making it environmentally friendly. Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) has proven to be an efficient catalyst in the ODH of propane, offering high selectivity and stability, making it a promising process for industrial implementation. High-surface-area h-BN can further enhance the performance of propane ODH, leading to better control of temperature and selectivity towards olefins while minimizing COx formation.
