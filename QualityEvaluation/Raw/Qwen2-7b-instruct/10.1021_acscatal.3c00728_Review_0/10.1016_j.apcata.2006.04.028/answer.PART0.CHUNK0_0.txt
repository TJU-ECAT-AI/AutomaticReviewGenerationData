[1] "The additives modify both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins, the modifying effect (its sign and extent) depending on the type of the catalyst and on the alkane nature."
[2] "In contrast to the propane ODH the additives exert only very small effect on the selectivities to ethene in the ODH of ethane."
[3] "For VMgA catalysts (a) all the additives decrease the area-specific activity in the propane ODH. For the ODH of ethane Cr and Nb lead to the increase in the activity, whereas Ni, Mo, P and K decrease it."
[4] "The differences in the effect of additives on the selectivity to olefins in ODH of ethane and propane have been observed previously for K-doped VOx/Al2O3 catalysts [3] ,[14] and for VPO catalysts with Bi, La, Mo and Zr additives [45] ."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its versatility and wide range of applications. Propane dehydrogenation has become a preferred production method because it offers several economic and environmental advantages. It allows for the direct conversion of propane into propene, bypassing the need for additional processing steps that are typically required in classical dehydrogenation processes. This not only reduces the overall cost of production but also minimizes the environmental impact by avoiding the formation of coke, a common byproduct in classical dehydrogenation processes. Moreover, propane dehydrogenation can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, which reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional methods.

The additives used in vanadia-based catalysts have distinct impacts on the specific activity and selectivity to olefins during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. Their effectiveness varies depending on the type of catalyst and the alkane being processed. For instance, the additives can enhance the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, particularly when the additives possess lower electronegativity than vanadium. However, the effect on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation is less pronounced, with some additives slightly increasing the selectivity to ethane. This suggests that propane and ethane have different requirements for the catalyst active center, complicating the search for a universal catalyst for both alkanes' oxidative dehydrogenation. Understanding these differences in reactivity can guide the development of catalysts tailored specifically for each alkane, optimizing efficiency and selectivity for the desired product.

化学工业对丙烯的需求持续增长，这主要得益于其广泛的应用范围和多功能性。丙烷脱氢作为一种首选的生产方法，因其经济和环保优势而受到青睐。它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了传统脱氢过程中额外的加工步骤，从而降低了总体生产成本并减少了环境影响，避免了常规方法中常见的焦炭副产品的形成。此外，与传统方法相比，丙烷脱氢可以在较低的温度和压力下运行，这不仅降低了能源消耗，也减少了温室气体排放。

用于氧化脱氢的钒基催化剂中的添加剂对其特定活性和烯烃选择性有着不同的影响。这些效果取决于催化剂的类型和所处理的烷烃。例如，某些低电负性添加剂可以增强丙烷氧化脱氢过程中丙烯的选择性，尤其是当添加剂的电负性低于钒时。然而，在乙烷氧化脱氢中，添加剂的影响相对较小，一些添加剂甚至会略微增加乙烷的选择性。这表明，丙烷和乙烷在催化剂活性中心方面有不同的需求，这使得找到适用于两种烷烃氧化脱氢的通用催化剂变得复杂。理解这两种烷烃的不同反应性可以指导催化剂的开发，针对每种烷烃优化效率和选择性以获得所需的产品。
