[1] "Catalytic properties of oxide catalysts can be improved by introduction of additives."
[2] "For the ODH reactions of lower alkanes alkali metal additives have been found to improve the selectivity to propene in the ODH of propane on V2O5/TiO2, MoO3/TiO2 [8] ,[9] , V2O5/Al2O3 [3] and MoO3/MgOγ-Al2O3 [10] catalysts, the effect being explained by modification of acid-base properties of the catalysts by alkalis."
[3] "The additives modify both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins, the modifying effect (its sign and extent) depending on the type of the catalyst and on the alkane nature."
[4] "On the other hand, the K additive was found to decrease the selectivity to olefins in ODH of propane and butane on catalysts based on VMgO system [11] ,[12] ,[13] : no explanation has been given for this fact."
[5] "For VMgA series the sequence of the activities ( Table 2 ) is: VMgK  VMgMo = VMgNb = VMgP < VMgNi = VMgCr < VMg and no correlation with the χ values has been observed."
[6] "For VMgA catalysts the Cr and Nb ions increase the activity, while for the reaction of propane they decrease it."
[7] "For both alkanes and for both series of the catalysts, however, potassium decreases the activity, though to the smaller extent for the ethane reaction."
[8] "For VMgA catalysts the K additive leads to the decrease in the selectivity to propene, whereas other additives (Ni, Cr, Nb, and Mo) increase it or have no effect (P)."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased, driven by its essential role in the production of a wide array of products, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Its growing demand has led to a preference for propane dehydrogenation as a more efficient and cost-effective method compared to traditional dehydrogenation processes. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation can produce propene at lower costs due to the abundance and relative cheapness of propane. Environmentally, it reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, decreases carbon emissions, and potentially minimizes the use of non-renewable resources, making it a more sustainable option for propene production.
