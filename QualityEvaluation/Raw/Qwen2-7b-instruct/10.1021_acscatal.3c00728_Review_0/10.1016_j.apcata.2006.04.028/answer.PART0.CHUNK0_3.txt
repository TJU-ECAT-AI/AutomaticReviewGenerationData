[1] "The additives modify both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins, the modifying effect (its sign and extent) depending on the type of the catalyst and on the alkane nature."
[2] "The additives represent both main group elements (K and P) and transition metals of different valency (Ni, Cr, Nb, and Mo)."
[3] "All the additives except potassium do not affect, or increase the total activity of the VSiA catalysts."
[4] "For VMgA series the sequence of the activities is: VMgK < VMgMo = VMgNb = VMgP < VMgNi = VMgCr < VMg and no correlation with the χ values has been observed."
[5] "The differences in the effect of additives on the selectivity to olefins in ODH of ethane and propane have been observed previously for K-doped VOx/Al2O3 catalysts [3],[14] and for VPO catalysts with Bi, La, Mo and Zr additives [45]."
[6] "It cannot be forgotten either, that, out of all the olefins, the ethene molecule has CH bonds stronger (less easily activated) than the parent alkane."

1. The additives affect both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The impact varies depending on the catalyst type and the alkane being processed.

2. The additives considered include main group elements (potassium and phosphorus) and transition metals (nickel, chromium, niobium, and molybdenum).

3. Potassium has a negative effect on the total activity of catalysts in both propane and ethane dehydrogenation processes.

4. For vanadia-based catalysts on magnesium oxide, all additives decrease the activity in propane dehydrogenation, except for chromium and niobium which increase it, and phosphorus, nickel, potassium, and molybdenum which decrease it.

5. Previous studies have shown differences in the effect of additives on the selectivity to olefins in ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation processes. These differences were observed in catalysts with potassium doping.

6. Ethene has stronger CH bonds than the parent alkane, making it less easily activated. This factor influences the oxidative dehydrogenation process differently compared to other olefins.

1. 添加剂会影响氧化脱氢过程中的特定活性和烯烃选择性。影响取决于催化剂类型和所处理的烷烃。

2. 考虑到的添加剂包括主族元素（钾和磷）和过渡金属（镍、铬、铌和钼）。

3. 钾对催化剂在丙烷和乙烷脱氢化过程中的总活性有负面影响。

4. 对于氧化镁上的范德瓦催化剂，所有添加剂都会降低丙烷脱氢化过程中的活性，除了铬和铌，它们会增加活性，而磷、镍、钾和钼会降低活性。

5. 在先前的研究中，观察到了添加剂在乙烯和丙烷氧化脱氢过程中对烯烃选择性的不同影响。这些差异在钾掺杂的催化剂中被观察到。

6. 乙烯的CH键比母烷更强大（更容易激活），这使得它在氧化脱氢过程中与其他烯烃有所不同。
