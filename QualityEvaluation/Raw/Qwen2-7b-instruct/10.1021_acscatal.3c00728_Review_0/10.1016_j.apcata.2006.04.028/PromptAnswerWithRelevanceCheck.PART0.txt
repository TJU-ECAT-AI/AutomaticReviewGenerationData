[1] "The additives modify both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins, the modifying effect (its sign and extent) depending on the type of the catalyst and on the alkane nature."
[2] "In contrast to the propane ODH the additives exert only very small effect on the selectivities to ethene in the ODH of ethane."
[3] "For VMgA catalysts (a) all the additives decrease the area-specific activity in the propane ODH. For the ODH of ethane Cr and Nb lead to the increase in the activity, whereas Ni, Mo, P and K decrease it."
[4] "The differences in the effect of additives on the selectivity to olefins in ODH of ethane and propane have been observed previously for K-doped VOx/Al2O3 catalysts [3] ,[14] and for VPO catalysts with Bi, La, Mo and Zr additives [45] ."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has grown significantly due to its versatility and wide range of applications. Propane dehydrogenation has become a preferred production method because it offers several economic and environmental advantages. It allows for the direct conversion of propane into propene, bypassing the need for additional processing steps that are typically required in classical dehydrogenation processes. This not only reduces the overall cost of production but also minimizes the environmental impact by avoiding the formation of coke, a common byproduct in classical dehydrogenation processes. Moreover, propane dehydrogenation can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, which reduces energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional methods.

The additives used in vanadia-based catalysts have distinct impacts on the specific activity and selectivity to olefins during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane. Their effectiveness varies depending on the type of catalyst and the alkane being processed. For instance, the additives can enhance the selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, particularly when the additives possess lower electronegativity than vanadium. However, the effect on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation is less pronounced, with some additives slightly increasing the selectivity to ethane. This suggests that propane and ethane have different requirements for the catalyst active center, complicating the search for a universal catalyst for both alkanes' oxidative dehydrogenation. Understanding these differences in reactivity can guide the development of catalysts tailored specifically for each alkane, optimizing efficiency and selectivity for the desired product.

化学工业对丙烯的需求持续增长，这主要得益于其广泛的应用范围和多功能性。丙烷脱氢作为一种首选的生产方法，因其经济和环保优势而受到青睐。它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了传统脱氢过程中额外的加工步骤，从而降低了总体生产成本并减少了环境影响，避免了常规方法中常见的焦炭副产品的形成。此外，与传统方法相比，丙烷脱氢可以在较低的温度和压力下运行，这不仅降低了能源消耗，也减少了温室气体排放。

用于氧化脱氢的钒基催化剂中的添加剂对其特定活性和烯烃选择性有着不同的影响。这些效果取决于催化剂的类型和所处理的烷烃。例如，某些低电负性添加剂可以增强丙烷氧化脱氢过程中丙烯的选择性，尤其是当添加剂的电负性低于钒时。然而，在乙烷氧化脱氢中，添加剂的影响相对较小，一些添加剂甚至会略微增加乙烷的选择性。这表明，丙烷和乙烷在催化剂活性中心方面有不同的需求，这使得找到适用于两种烷烃氧化脱氢的通用催化剂变得复杂。理解这两种烷烃的不同反应性可以指导催化剂的开发，针对每种烷烃优化效率和选择性以获得所需的产品。

<p>The additives modify both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins, the modifying effect (its sign and extent) depending on the type of the catalyst and on the alkane nature.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two series of the catalysts consist in: (a) increase in the specific activity in the ODH reactions on introduction of the additives (except K) for VSi and decrease for VMg catalysts, (b) considerable increase in the selectivity to propene in ODH of propane for K-doped VSi catalyst and decrease for K-doped VMg catalyst (Ni, Cr, and Mo increasing and P decreasing the selectivity for the both series), and (c) higher selectivities to ethene as compared with those to propene for VSi and lower to ethene than to propene for VMg catalysts.</p>
<p>In contrast to the propane ODH the additives exert only very small effect on the selectivities to ethene in the ODH of ethane.</p>

The additives' impact on propene's production through propane dehydrogenation varies depending on the catalyst type and alkane being processed. The additives generally increase the activity of the catalysts, except for potassium, which decreases activity. The selectivity to propene is notably increased by potassium in vanadia-silica catalysts (VSi) and decreased in vanadia-magnesia catalysts (VMg). The selectivity to ethene is less affected by the additives in ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly increased, driven by its essential role in the production of a wide array of products, including plastics, solvents, and fuels. Its growing demand has led to a preference for propane dehydrogenation as a more efficient and cost-effective method compared to traditional dehydrogenation processes. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages. Economically, propane dehydrogenation can produce propene at lower costs due to the abundance and relative cheapness of propane. Environmentally, it reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, decreases carbon emissions, and potentially minimizes the use of non-renewable resources, making it a more sustainable option for propene production.

As propene is a crucial feedstock for the production of polymers, solvents, and various other chemical intermediates, the increasing demand necessitates efficient and cost-effective methods to produce propene on a large scale. Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred method because it offers several economic and environmental advantages.

One of the key economic benefits of propane dehydrogenation is its ability to produce propene selectively and efficiently, without the need for complex post-processing steps typically required in conventional dehydrogenation processes. This results in reduced energy consumption and lower operational costs.

From an environmental perspective, propane dehydrogenation allows for the production of propene without the formation of significant amounts of unwanted by-products. This is particularly advantageous when compared to other dehydrogenation processes, which often generate substantial amounts of carbon oxides as by-products. By minimizing waste generation, propane dehydrogenation contributes to a more sustainable chemical manufacturing process.

Moreover, propane is widely available as a petrochemical feedstock, making propane dehydrogenation a practical and scalable solution for propene production. The use of this method helps in optimizing the utilization of existing infrastructure and resources, further enhancing its economic viability.

In summary, the adoption of propane dehydrogenation is driven by the growing demand for propene, which requires efficient and environmentally friendly production methods. This approach offers significant economic and environmental benefits, making it an attractive option for the chemical industry to meet the escalating needs for this versatile olefin.
