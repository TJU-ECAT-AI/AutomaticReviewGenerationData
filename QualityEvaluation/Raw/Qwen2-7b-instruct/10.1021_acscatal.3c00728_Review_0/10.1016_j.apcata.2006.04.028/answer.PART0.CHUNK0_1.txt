<p>The additives modify both the specific activity and selectivity to olefins, the modifying effect (its sign and extent) depending on the type of the catalyst and on the alkane nature.</p>
<p>The main difference between the two series of the catalysts consist in: (a) increase in the specific activity in the ODH reactions on introduction of the additives (except K) for VSi and decrease for VMg catalysts, (b) considerable increase in the selectivity to propene in ODH of propane for K-doped VSi catalyst and decrease for K-doped VMg catalyst (Ni, Cr, and Mo increasing and P decreasing the selectivity for the both series), and (c) higher selectivities to ethene as compared with those to propene for VSi and lower to ethene than to propene for VMg catalysts.</p>
<p>In contrast to the propane ODH the additives exert only very small effect on the selectivities to ethene in the ODH of ethane.</p>

The additives' impact on propene's production through propane dehydrogenation varies depending on the catalyst type and alkane being processed. The additives generally increase the activity of the catalysts, except for potassium, which decreases activity. The selectivity to propene is notably increased by potassium in vanadia-silica catalysts (VSi) and decreased in vanadia-magnesia catalysts (VMg). The selectivity to ethene is less affected by the additives in ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

添加剂对通过脱氢生产丙烯的影响取决于催化剂类型和正在处理的烷烃。除了钾，添加剂通常会增加催化剂的活性。在硅酸盐基催化剂（VSi）中，钾增加了丙烯的选择性，而在镁酸盐基催化剂（VMg）中则降低了丙烯的选择性。在乙烷脱氢过程中，添加剂对乙烯选择性的影响不如丙烷脱氢明显。
