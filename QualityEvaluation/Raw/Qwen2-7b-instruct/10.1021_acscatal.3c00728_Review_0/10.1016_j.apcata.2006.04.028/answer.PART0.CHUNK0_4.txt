[1] "For the ODH reactions of lower alkanes alkali metal additives have been found to improve the selectivity to propene in the ODH of propane on catalysts based on V2O5/TiO2, MoO3/TiO2 [8] ,[9] , V2O5/Al2O3 [3] and MoO3/MgOγ-Al2O3 [10] catalysts, the effect being explained by modification of acid-base properties of the catalysts by alkalis."
[2] "The K additive was found to decrease the selectivity to olefins in ODH of propane and butane on catalysts based on VMgO system [11] ,[12] ,[13] : no explanation has been given for this fact."
[3] "In the present work (part I) these two series have been examined in ODH of propane and ethane. In part II [23] , we will describe the effect of the additives on the structure and physicochemical properties of the two series of the catalysts and will attempt to correlate them with the catalytic performance."

The demand for propene in the chemical industry has significantly grown due to its versatility in various applications. As propene is a crucial feedstock for the production of polymers, solvents, and various other chemical intermediates, the increasing demand necessitates efficient and cost-effective methods to produce propene on a large scale. Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred method because it offers several economic and environmental advantages.

One of the key economic benefits of propane dehydrogenation is its ability to produce propene selectively and efficiently, without the need for complex post-processing steps typically required in conventional dehydrogenation processes. This results in reduced energy consumption and lower operational costs.

From an environmental perspective, propane dehydrogenation allows for the production of propene without the formation of significant amounts of unwanted by-products. This is particularly advantageous when compared to other dehydrogenation processes, which often generate substantial amounts of carbon oxides as by-products. By minimizing waste generation, propane dehydrogenation contributes to a more sustainable chemical manufacturing process.

Moreover, propane is widely available as a petrochemical feedstock, making propane dehydrogenation a practical and scalable solution for propene production. The use of this method helps in optimizing the utilization of existing infrastructure and resources, further enhancing its economic viability.

In summary, the adoption of propane dehydrogenation is driven by the growing demand for propene, which requires efficient and environmentally friendly production methods. This approach offers significant economic and environmental benefits, making it an attractive option for the chemical industry to meet the escalating needs for this versatile olefin.
