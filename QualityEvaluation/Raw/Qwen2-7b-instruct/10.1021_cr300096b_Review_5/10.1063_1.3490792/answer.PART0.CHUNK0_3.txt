The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the distribution of metals on the surface and the electronic structure of the segregated Pt on the (111) surface of the Pt 3 Ti crystal. The consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications include enhanced reactivity, selectivity, and durability, depending on how effectively the metals segregate and interact on the surface.
