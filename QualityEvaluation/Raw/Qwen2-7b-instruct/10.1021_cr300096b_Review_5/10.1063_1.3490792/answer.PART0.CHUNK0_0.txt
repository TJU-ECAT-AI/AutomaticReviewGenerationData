The scientific literature focuses on modeling surface segregation phenomena in the (111) surface of an ordered Pt 3 Ti crystal. It delves into computational methods, specifically density functional theory calculations and the Monte Carlo method, to study surface segregation in the Pt 3 Ti (111) system. Furthermore, it examines the electronic structure of Pt-segregated Pt 3 Ti (111). The conclusions derived from these studies highlight the influence of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These findings have significant implications for understanding and optimizing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.
