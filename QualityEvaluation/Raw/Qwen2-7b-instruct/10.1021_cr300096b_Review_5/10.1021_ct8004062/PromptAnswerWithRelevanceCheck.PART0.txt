The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The presence of surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials. In the context of Pt-based alloys, Au shows a strong surface segregation trend to the clean Pt(111) surface, enhancing its catalytic activity. Conversely, Co segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable, affecting its catalytic efficiency. The structural configuration, including the formation of a pure Pt-skin layer due to surface segregation of Pt atoms, contributes to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. The kinetic model developed in this study elucidates the energy barriers involved in the surface segregation process, providing insights into the driving forces and mechanisms behind this phenomenon. The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts are thus influenced by the thermodynamic stability of the alloy components, kinetic barriers associated with surface migration, and the formation of specific surface structures, which collectively impact their catalytic performance in various applications.

在铂基合金（如铂-3d合金）中，二元催化剂的稳定性、表面富集和结构配置受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。表面富集在决定这些材料的催化性质和性能方面起着关键作用。在铂基合金的背景下，金表现出对清洁铂(111)表面的强大表面富集趋势，从而增强其催化活性。相比之下，钴在表面上的富集既不是热力学也不是动力学上有利的，这影响了其催化效率。由于表面铂原子的富集形成的纯铂层结构有助于增强铂基催化剂的稳定性。开发的亲核模型揭示了表面富集过程中的能量壁垒，提供了推动这一现象的动力和机制的见解。稳定性、表面富集和结构配置的二元催化剂受合金成分的热力学稳定性、表面迁移相关的动力学壁垒以及特定表面结构的形成的影响，这共同影响它们在各种应用中的催化性能。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the energy barriers for metal atoms to move between different layers. For instance, gold (Au) shows a strong surface segregation trend towards the clean Pt(111) surface, indicating that it is thermodynamically favorable for Au to segregate onto the surface. Moreover, Au exhibits a low activation energy for this process, suggesting that it is also kinetically feasible. In contrast, cobalt (Co) does not show a significant surface segregation trend towards the Pt(111) surface, as both its thermodynamic and kinetic preferences are unfavorable. The segregation process for Au is exothermic, meaning it releases energy, while for Co, it is endothermic, requiring energy input. These differences in thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors lead to distinct structural configurations and consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响金属原子在不同层之间移动的能量壁垒，从而影响二元催化剂的稳定性、表面分离、和结构配置。例如，金(Au)表现出强烈的表面分离趋势，倾向于向清洁的Pt(111)表面聚集，这表明Au在表面上的富集是热力学上有利的。此外，Au在这一过程中具有较低的活化能，说明其表面分离过程也是动力学上可行的。相比之下，钴(Co)并未显示出显著地向Pt(111)表面聚集的趋势，因为其热力学和动力学偏好都是不利的。Au的分离过程是放热的，意味着它释放能量，而Co的过程则是吸热的，需要输入能量。这些不同的热力学和动力学行为导致了不同的结构配置，并进而对它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能产生不同的影响。

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面同质化和结构配置产生了重大影响。Au表现出强烈的表面同质化趋势至清洁的Pt(111)表面，而Co在表面的同质化既非热力学有利也非动力学可行。Au的表面同质化过程是放热的，而Co则是吸热的。对于Co的同质化速率，所有步骤的能量壁垒共同决定，表明它受到多个阶段能量壁垒的影响。这一动力学模型成功解释了观察到的现象，强调了考虑动力学特性在理解双金属催化剂行为中的重要性。

1. Gold shows a strong tendency to segregate onto the Pt(111) surface, whereas cobalt does not exhibit this behavior. Cobalt segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable compared to gold.

2. Gold demonstrates a significant advantage in surface segregation on the Pt(111) surface, with a total energy change of 1.15 eV and a barrier of 0.07 eV during migration from the second layer to the surface. This indicates that gold's surface segregation is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.

3. Cobalt's migration to the Pt(111) surface faces substantial energetic barriers, both thermodynamically and kinetically, compared to gold. This means that cobalt's segregation to the surface is hindered.

4. Gold's surface segregation process is exothermic, whereas cobalt's is endothermic. This difference suggests that gold's surface enrichment is thermodynamically advantageous.

5. The kinetic feasibility of gold's surface segregation is confirmed by the lower energy barrier for the competitive step from the second layer to the surface compared to the step from the surface to the second layer.

6. The calculation of the concentration of vacancies required for cobalt's migration through the Pt(111) surface provides insights into the diffusion dynamics of the impurity, which can be estimated using a formula that incorporates the activation energy for migration and experimental diffusion coefficients.

2. 金在从第二层迁移到Pt(111)表面时显示出显著的优势，总能量变化为1.15 eV，迁移壁垒为0.07 eV。这表明金的表面富集在热力学和动力学上都是有利的。

3. 钴向Pt(111)表面的迁移面临巨大的能障，无论是热力学上还是动力学上，都远高于金。这意味着钴的表面富集受到阻碍。

4. 金的表面富集过程是放热的，而钴的是吸热的。这种差异表明金的表面富集在热力学上有优势。

5. 金的表面富集的可行性通过比较从第二层到表面的竞争力步骤与从表面到第二层的步骤的能量壁垒来确认，前者的能量壁垒低于后者。

6. 对于钴通过Pt(111)表面的迁移所需的空位浓度的计算提供了关于杂质扩散动态的见解，可以通过结合迁移激活能和实验扩散系数的公式进行估算。
