<p>Surface segregation has been found to play a key role in the process.</p>
<p>They noted that the ORR is uniquely active on Pt-skin surfaces and the reaction rate is four times that of the pure Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outmost layer of the alloys due to surface segregation of Pt atoms.</p>
<p>In this work, we study the segregation mechanism using a vacancy model, on the basis of first principles calculations.</p>
<p>The segregation process thus includes interlayer migration of the impurity atom, vacancy movement at the second layer, and vacancy regeneration at the surface layer.</p>
<p>Our calculations show that Au is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for this migration, with a total energy change of 1.15 eV and a barrier of 0.07 eV, indicating a strong surface segregation tendency.</p>
<p>For the PtCo system, steps 5-6, 6-7, and 7-8 possess comparable barriers, which are 0.78 eV, 0.84 eV, and 0.75 eV, respectively.</p>

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The presence of surface segregation plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials. In the context of Pt-based alloys, Au shows a strong surface segregation trend to the clean Pt(111) surface, enhancing its catalytic activity. Conversely, Co segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable, affecting its catalytic efficiency. The structural configuration, including the formation of a pure Pt-skin layer due to surface segregation of Pt atoms, contributes to the enhanced stability of Pt-based catalysts. The kinetic model developed in this study elucidates the energy barriers involved in the surface segregation process, providing insights into the driving forces and mechanisms behind this phenomenon. The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts are thus influenced by the thermodynamic stability of the alloy components, kinetic barriers associated with surface migration, and the formation of specific surface structures, which collectively impact their catalytic performance in various applications.

在铂基合金（如铂-3d合金）中，二元催化剂的稳定性、表面富集和结构配置受到热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。表面富集在决定这些材料的催化性质和性能方面起着关键作用。在铂基合金的背景下，金表现出对清洁铂(111)表面的强大表面富集趋势，从而增强其催化活性。相比之下，钴在表面上的富集既不是热力学也不是动力学上有利的，这影响了其催化效率。由于表面铂原子的富集形成的纯铂层结构有助于增强铂基催化剂的稳定性。开发的亲核模型揭示了表面富集过程中的能量壁垒，提供了推动这一现象的动力和机制的见解。稳定性、表面富集和结构配置的二元催化剂受合金成分的热力学稳定性、表面迁移相关的动力学壁垒以及特定表面结构的形成的影响，这共同影响它们在各种应用中的催化性能。
