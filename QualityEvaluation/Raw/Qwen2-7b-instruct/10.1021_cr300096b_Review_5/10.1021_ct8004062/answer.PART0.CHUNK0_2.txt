[1] "Au shows strong surface segregation trend to the clean Pt(111) surface, while Co segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable."
[2] "Au is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for migration to the surface, with a total energy change of 1.15 eV and a barrier of 0.07 eV."
[3] "Co, on the other hand, shows a much higher barrier for this process, with values of 0.15 eV and 0.48 eV, respectively."
[4] "The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."
[5] "Au enrichment on the surface of Pt-based alloys is thermodynamically favorable, consistent with previous studies."
[6] "Au segregating to the Pt(111) surface is kinetically feasible."
[7] "Co segregating to the clean Pt(111) surface is both thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically prohibitive according to our model."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the energy barriers for metal atoms to move between different layers. For instance, gold (Au) shows a strong surface segregation trend towards the clean Pt(111) surface, indicating that it is thermodynamically favorable for Au to segregate onto the surface. Moreover, Au exhibits a low activation energy for this process, suggesting that it is also kinetically feasible. In contrast, cobalt (Co) does not show a significant surface segregation trend towards the Pt(111) surface, as both its thermodynamic and kinetic preferences are unfavorable. The segregation process for Au is exothermic, meaning it releases energy, while for Co, it is endothermic, requiring energy input. These differences in thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors lead to distinct structural configurations and consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响金属原子在不同层之间移动的能量壁垒，从而影响二元催化剂的稳定性、表面分离、和结构配置。例如，金(Au)表现出强烈的表面分离趋势，倾向于向清洁的Pt(111)表面聚集，这表明Au在表面上的富集是热力学上有利的。此外，Au在这一过程中具有较低的活化能，说明其表面分离过程也是动力学上可行的。相比之下，钴(Co)并未显示出显著地向Pt(111)表面聚集的趋势，因为其热力学和动力学偏好都是不利的。Au的分离过程是放热的，意味着它释放能量，而Co的过程则是吸热的，需要输入能量。这些不同的热力学和动力学行为导致了不同的结构配置，并进而对它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能产生不同的影响。
