[1] "Au shows strong surface segregation trend to the clean Pt(111) surface, while Co segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable."
[2] "Au is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable for migration, with a total energy change of 1.15 eV and a barrier of 0.07 eV."
[3] "Co, on the other hand, has a much higher energy barrier (0.48 eV) for the migration, indicating a less favorable process."
[4] "Our segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly, from a kinetics viewpoint."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts in Pt-based systems. In the context of Pt-based alloys, Au shows a strong surface segregation trend due to its thermodynamic and kinetic favorability, while Co does not exhibit similar tendencies. The kinetic model elucidates the driving forces behind this behavior, providing insights into the mechanisms of surface segregation in Pt-based catalysts. These findings have implications for understanding the catalytic properties and performance of such materials in various applications.
