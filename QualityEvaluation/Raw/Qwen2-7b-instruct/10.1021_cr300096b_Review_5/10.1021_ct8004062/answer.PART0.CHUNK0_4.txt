1. Gold shows a strong tendency to segregate onto the Pt(111) surface, whereas cobalt does not exhibit this behavior. Cobalt segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable compared to gold.

2. Gold demonstrates a significant advantage in surface segregation on the Pt(111) surface, with a total energy change of 1.15 eV and a barrier of 0.07 eV during migration from the second layer to the surface. This indicates that gold's surface segregation is thermodynamically and kinetically favorable.

3. Cobalt's migration to the Pt(111) surface faces substantial energetic barriers, both thermodynamically and kinetically, compared to gold. This means that cobalt's segregation to the surface is hindered.

4. Gold's surface segregation process is exothermic, whereas cobalt's is endothermic. This difference suggests that gold's surface enrichment is thermodynamically advantageous.

5. The kinetic feasibility of gold's surface segregation is confirmed by the lower energy barrier for the competitive step from the second layer to the surface compared to the step from the surface to the second layer.

6. The calculation of the concentration of vacancies required for cobalt's migration through the Pt(111) surface provides insights into the diffusion dynamics of the impurity, which can be estimated using a formula that incorporates the activation energy for migration and experimental diffusion coefficients.

1. 金在Pt(111)表面上表现出强烈的富集趋势，而钴则不具备这种行为。与金相比，钴在表面的富集既不是热力学上的也不是动力学上的有利。

2. 金在从第二层迁移到Pt(111)表面时显示出显著的优势，总能量变化为1.15 eV，迁移壁垒为0.07 eV。这表明金的表面富集在热力学和动力学上都是有利的。

3. 钴向Pt(111)表面的迁移面临巨大的能障，无论是热力学上还是动力学上，都远高于金。这意味着钴的表面富集受到阻碍。

4. 金的表面富集过程是放热的，而钴的是吸热的。这种差异表明金的表面富集在热力学上有优势。

5. 金的表面富集的可行性通过比较从第二层到表面的竞争力步骤与从表面到第二层的步骤的能量壁垒来确认，前者的能量壁垒低于后者。

6. 对于钴通过Pt(111)表面的迁移所需的空位浓度的计算提供了关于杂质扩散动态的见解，可以通过结合迁移激活能和实验扩散系数的公式进行估算。
