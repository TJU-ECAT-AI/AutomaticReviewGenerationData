[1] "Au shows a strong surface segregation trend to the clean Pt(111) surface, while Co segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable."
[2] "The pathway from 1 to 4 describes a complete cycle in which an impurity atom in the second layer segregates to the Pt(111) surface. The process is exothermic (0.57 eV) for the PtAu system, whereas it is endothermic (0.45 eV) for the PtCo system."
[3] "For the PtCo system, steps 5-6, 6-7, and 7-8 possess comparable barriers, which are 0.78 eV, 0.84 eV, and 0.75 eV, respectively. Since there is no RDS in the process, the segregation rate of Co is determined by all three steps."
[4] "Our segregation model can successfully interpret these phenomena, particularly, from a kinetics viewpoint."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Au shows a strong surface segregation trend to the clean Pt(111) surface, while Co segregating to the surface is neither thermodynamically nor kinetically favorable. The process of surface segregation for Au is exothermic, while it is endothermic for Co. The segregation rate of Co is determined by all steps in the process, indicating that it is influenced by the energy barriers across multiple stages. This kinetic model successfully interprets the observed phenomena, highlighting the importance of considering kinetic properties in understanding the behavior of bimetallic catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面同质化和结构配置产生了重大影响。Au表现出强烈的表面同质化趋势至清洁的Pt(111)表面，而Co在表面的同质化既非热力学有利也非动力学可行。Au的表面同质化过程是放热的，而Co则是吸热的。对于Co的同质化速率，所有步骤的能量壁垒共同决定，表明它受到多个阶段能量壁垒的影响。这一动力学模型成功解释了观察到的现象，强调了考虑动力学特性在理解双金属催化剂行为中的重要性。
