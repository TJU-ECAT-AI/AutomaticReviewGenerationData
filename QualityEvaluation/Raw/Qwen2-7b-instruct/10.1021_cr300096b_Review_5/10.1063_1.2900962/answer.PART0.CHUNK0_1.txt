The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the energy required for metal segregation and the formation of specific structures on the catalyst surface. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) structures is also affected by these conditions, impacting the catalyst's overall performance and activity. The crystal plane plays a crucial role in determining the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface structures exposed to oxygen.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面聚集状态有重大影响，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。这些因素决定了金属聚集所需的能量以及在催化剂表面上形成特定结构的需求。在Pt(111)和Pt(100)结构中的亚表面3d金属的稳定性也受到这些条件的影响，从而影响催化剂的整体性能和活性。晶面在决定氧还原反应（ORR）活性和暴露于氧气的亚表面结构稳定性方面起着关键作用。
