The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This study focuses on the segregation of 3 d metals in Pt structures, specifically Pt(111) and Pt(100) bimetallic configurations, influenced by oxygen. The density functional theory method was employed to calculate key parameters, including the oxygen dissociative binding energy and the predicted stability of subsurface 3 d metal placements within these structures. The crystal plane has a notable effect on both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface regions exposed to oxygen. These findings have direct implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based materials in various applications.
