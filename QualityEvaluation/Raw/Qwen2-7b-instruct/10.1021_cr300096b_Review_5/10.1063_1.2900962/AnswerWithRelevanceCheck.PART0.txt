          The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications. Specifically, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

          The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the energy required for metal segregation and the formation of specific structures on the catalyst surface. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) structures is also affected by these conditions, impacting the catalyst's overall performance and activity. The crystal plane plays a crucial role in determining the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface structures exposed to oxygen.
