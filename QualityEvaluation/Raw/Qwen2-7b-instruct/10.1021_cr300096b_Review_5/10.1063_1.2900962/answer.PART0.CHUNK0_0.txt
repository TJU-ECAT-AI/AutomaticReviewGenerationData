<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications. Specifically, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts. Understanding these relationships allows for the optimization of catalyst design and selection for specific applications.
