The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The stability of the subsurface structure is influenced by the crystal plane, which also affects the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The crystal plane plays a crucial role in determining the ORR activity and the stability of the subsurface structure.
