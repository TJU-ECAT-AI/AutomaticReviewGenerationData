[1] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
[2] "The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by facilitating electron transfer between the surfaces when they are in close proximity. This electron transfer creates a reactive environment that enhances reactivity, making it useful not only for controlled polymerization but also for promoting specific chemical reactions with lower barriers compared to reactions on single catalytic surfaces.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分离配置，通过在表面之间促进电子传输。当表面靠近时，这种电子传输创建了一个反应环境，增强了活性，使其不仅适用于受控聚合，也适用于促进具有较低壁垒的特定化学反应，与单催化表面的反应相比。
