[1] "Our density functional theory studies have shown that the confinement effect produced by the proximity of two metal surfaces induces a reactive environment which converts ethylene in an anion radical that adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain and is ready to react, initiating the polymerization chain."
[2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
[3] "These modifications in the surface DOS are due to the surfaceethylene electronic interaction; thus, they are expected to be unique for a specific surfacemolecule interaction, suggesting that this phenomenon may be suited for sensor applications."

The confinement effect, as demonstrated by the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into an anionic radical. This radical adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain, making it ready to react and initiate the polymerization chain. This process is influenced by the presence of an electron donor surface, which enhances the reactivity of the ethylene molecule in various applications, including controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. Moreover, the unique electronic interactions between the surfaces and the molecule offer potential for sensor applications.
