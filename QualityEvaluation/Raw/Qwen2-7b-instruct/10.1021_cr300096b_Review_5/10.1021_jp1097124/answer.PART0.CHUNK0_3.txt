[1] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
[2] "The reduced HOMOLUMO gap suggests the enhanced reactivity of the confined molecule."
[3] "The main effects at a given surfacesurface separation are the reduction of the DOS at the prominent peaks in the majority and minority d states and that of the exchange splitting."
[4] "Two ethylene molecules with the geometry obtained after confined relaxation were located as shown in Figure 8 at H = 5.43, 5.77, and 6.08 Å between Ti/Pt surfaces. After relaxation, the dimer chain is formed indicating the feasibility of polymerization under confinement (Figure 8)."

1. The electron donor surface enhances the reactivity of confined molecules, which is beneficial for controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions.
2. The reduction in the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) increases the reactivity of the confined ethylene molecule.
3. The interaction between the surfaces and ethylene leads to a decrease in the density of states at the prominent peaks of the majority and minority d states and a reduction in the exchange splitting.
4. Under confinement, ethylene molecules form dimers, demonstrating the feasibility of polymerization processes.
