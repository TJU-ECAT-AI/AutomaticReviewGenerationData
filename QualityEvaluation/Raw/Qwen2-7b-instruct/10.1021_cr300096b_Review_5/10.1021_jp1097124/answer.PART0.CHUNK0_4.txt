[1] "Our density functional theory studies have shown that the confinement effect produced by the proximity of two metal surfaces induces a reactive environment which converts ethylene in an anion radical that adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain and is ready to react, initiating the polymerization chain."
[2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
