[1] "Our density functional theory studies have shown that the confinement effect produced by the proximity of two metal surfaces induces a reactive environment which converts ethylene in an anion radical that adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain and is ready to react, initiating the polymerization chain."
[2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
[3] "These modifications in the surface DOS are due to the surfaceethylene electronic interaction; thus, they are expected to be unique for a specific surfacemolecule interaction, suggesting that this phenomenon may be suited for sensor applications."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The confinement effect, as demonstrated by the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into an anionic radical. This radical adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain, making it ready to react and initiate the polymerization chain. This process is influenced by the presence of an electron donor surface, which enhances the reactivity of the ethylene molecule in various applications, including controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. Moreover, the unique electronic interactions between the surfaces and the molecule offer potential for sensor applications.

[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain."
[2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
[3] "Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator."
[4] "The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study demonstrates that ethylene, when confined between two metal surfaces, undergoes a transformation into a radical anion. This conversion is facilitated by the electron transfer between the metal surfaces and the ethylene molecule, which occurs when the surfaces are separated by a short distance. This process enables the ethylene molecule to adopt a geometry similar to the monomer in a polyethylene chain and initiates the polymerization chain without the need for an initiator. The electron donor surfaces play a crucial role in enhancing the reactivity of the ethylene molecule under confinement, making it suitable for various applications requiring controlled polymerization or specific chemical reactions.

研究证明，当乙烯分子被两个金属表面所限制时，它会转化为一个自由基阴离子。这一转化是通过金属表面和乙烯分子之间的电子转移实现的，当两表面之间的距离足够短时（大约在0.6到0.4纳米范围内）。这一过程使乙烯分子能够采用聚乙烯链中单体的几何形状，并且可以在无需引发剂的情况下启动聚合链反应。电子供体表面在增强受限制乙烯分子的活性方面起着关键作用，使得它适用于需要精确控制聚合或特定化学反应的各种应用。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by facilitating electron transfer between the surfaces when they are in close proximity. This electron transfer creates a reactive environment that enhances reactivity, making it useful not only for controlled polymerization but also for promoting specific chemical reactions with lower barriers compared to reactions on single catalytic surfaces.

1. The electron donor surface enhances the reactivity of confined molecules, which is beneficial for controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions.
2. The reduction in the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) increases the reactivity of the confined ethylene molecule.
3. The interaction between the surfaces and ethylene leads to a decrease in the density of states at the prominent peaks of the majority and minority d states and a reduction in the exchange splitting.
4. Under confinement, ethylene molecules form dimers, demonstrating the feasibility of polymerization processes.
