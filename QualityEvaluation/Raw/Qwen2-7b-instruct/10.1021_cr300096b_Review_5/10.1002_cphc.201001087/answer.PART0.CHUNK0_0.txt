[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."
[2] "These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely."
[3] "The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion."
[4] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys."
[5] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[6] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals."
[7] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
[8] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously."
[9] "Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02."
[10] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to stay in the outermost layer, facilitated by lower barriers for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of the surface alloys.

2. The investigation of the stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys was conducted through STM imaging and AES measurements. By overgrowing the equilibrated surface alloys with a Ru film and subsequent annealing, it was confirmed that the outermost surface layer transforms back to the original PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloys, indicating stability and surface segregation.

3. The floating effect of buried, subsurface Pt (Pd) atoms to the outermost layer upon annealing suggests a distinct driving force for surface segregation in these bimetallic systems. The stability and surface segregation behavior of these surface alloys are representative of a wide range of compositions and can be applied to various catalyst applications.

4. The mechanism for the floating of buried metals involves exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms, combined with preferential overgrowth of Ru areas due to stronger bonding between Pt, Pd, and Ru compared to bonding with each other. This mechanism explains the recovery of the surface alloy structure after overgrowth.

5. The slight differences in stability between PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys can be attributed to the lower Pd content (44%) compared to Pt (70%). Higher Pd content may lead to more pronounced subsurface/bulk diffusion or the start of diffusion at higher Pd content levels, affecting stability.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置有着显著影响。稳定性由组件之间的相互作用能量和分离能决定。被限制在表面层的表面合金与客体金属如Pt和Pd倾向于停留在最外层相关联，促进顶层两个层之间较低的扩散壁垒相比，这有助于保持表面合金结构的稳定性。

2. 对于PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金的稳定性与分离行为的研究，通过STM成像和AES测量进行了。通过在已平衡的表面合金上沉积Ru薄膜并随后退火，证实了外表面层转变为原始的PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金，表明了稳定性与表面分离。

3. 埋藏在深处的Pt（Pd）原子在退火后浮到最外层的现象，表明了这些双金属系统中存在明显的表面分离驱动力。这些表面合金的稳定性和表面分离行为适用于各种组成范围，并可以应用于各种催化剂应用。

4. 浮动效应的机制涉及吸附态与底层表面原子之间的交换过程，结合了优先生长Ru区域，由于Pt、Pd和Ru与彼此的较强结合力相比与彼此的较弱结合力。这一机制解释了在过生长后表面合金结构的恢复。

5. PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金的小差异稳定性可归因于Pd含量（44％）低于Pt（70％）。较高的Pd含量可能导致更显著的亚表面/扩散或仅在较高Pd含量水平开始扩散，影响稳定性。
