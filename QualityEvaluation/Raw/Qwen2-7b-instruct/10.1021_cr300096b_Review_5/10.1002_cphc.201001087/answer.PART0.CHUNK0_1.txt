[1] "Surface alloys, with a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer on a monometallic substrate, have attracted increasing interest as model systems for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-de- fined structure."
[2] "Vertically, the surface layer rests on a homo- geneous substrate, at least in the ideal case of negligible bulk diffusion, while the lateral distribution of the surface compo- nents is accessible by high-resolution scanning tunneling mi- croscopy (STM) with chemical contrast."
[3] "Phenomena such as 2D intermixing,[714] adsorption,[6,1532] or the catalytic/electroca- talytic reactivity[3335] have been investigated and linked to the atomic scale structure of the respective bimetallic surfaces."
[4] "Experimentally, this can be decided, for example, by variation of the preparation procedure. If significant variation of this procedure or their pa- rameters results in the same configuration, this is clear evi- dence for a stable surface configuration, which is metastable only with respect to bulk dissolution."
[5] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segrega- tion were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[6] "Floating of buried metal species had been ob- served, for example, during sur- factant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/ Ag(111)[4042] or during deposition of various metals on Ag,[4350] Au,[5153] and Cu[49,5457] single crystals."
[7] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above."
[8] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported pre- viously.[6,14,29,36,60]"
[9] "Quantitative evaluation of atomically re- solved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001),respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02."
[10] "Hence, the AES results confirm the findings of the STM mea- surements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the origi- nal surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subse- quent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."
[11] "Previous studies had provided clear evidence that during the initial stages of PtRu/Ru(0001)[36] and PdRu/Ru(0001)[14] monolayer surface alloy formation, growth of mixed islands occurs on Pt (Pd) free areas only."
[12] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."
[13] "Based on these data, considering only exchange between the surface layer and the subsurface region consisting of the second (bulk dissolution inhibited) and using the annealing temperatures of 1350 K and 1150 K, respectively, the probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann ap- proach given by Equation (1):pbury  exp  DEseg kBT"

Answer: Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is determined by factors such as the interaction energies between the two components and the segregation energies, which can be assessed through experimental methods like STM and AES measurements. The tendency for surface segregation is influenced by the differences in surface energies of the two components and the size mismatch between the host metal and the guest metal. The stability of surface alloys is confirmed when the configuration remains unchanged despite variations in preparation procedures or parameters. The process of surface alloy formation involves exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms, which is facilitated by the stronger bonding of the guest metals (Pt, Pd) with the host metal (Ru) compared to each other. The presence of a cover layer of the host metal and subsequent annealing allows for the restoration of the original surface alloy composition, indicating the complete segregation of the buried guest metals to the surface layer. The stability and tendency for surface segregation in Pt-3d alloys are generic properties applicable to a wide range of compositions and are crucial for understanding the catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Answer: 在铂基系统中，特别是铂-3d 合金中，热力学偏好和反应条件对催化剂的稳定性和表面同质化以及结构配置有着显著的影响。这些催化剂的稳定性由两个组件之间的相互作用能量和分离能量决定，可以通过STM和AES测量等实验方法来评估。表面同质化的倾向受到两种成分表面能差异和宿主金属与客体金属之间大小不匹配的影响。表面合金的稳定性通过在不同准备程序或参数下保持不变的配置得到确认。表面合金形成过程涉及原子间的交换过程，这种过程由宿主金属（钌）与客体金属（铂、钯）之间更强的结合力所促进。在覆盖层金属后进行退火允许恢复原始表面合金组成，表明埋藏的客体金属完全转移到表面层。
