[1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."
[2] "These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely."
[3] "The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion."
[4] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys."
[5] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[6] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals."
[7] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
[8] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously."
[9] "Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02."
[10] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to stay in the outermost layer, facilitated by lower barriers for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of the surface alloys.

2. The investigation of the stability and segregation behavior of monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys was conducted through STM imaging and AES measurements. By overgrowing the equilibrated surface alloys with a Ru film and subsequent annealing, it was confirmed that the outermost surface layer transforms back to the original PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloys, indicating stability and surface segregation.

3. The floating effect of buried, subsurface Pt (Pd) atoms to the outermost layer upon annealing suggests a distinct driving force for surface segregation in these bimetallic systems. The stability and surface segregation behavior of these surface alloys are representative of a wide range of compositions and can be applied to various catalyst applications.

4. The mechanism for the floating of buried metals involves exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms, combined with preferential overgrowth of Ru areas due to stronger bonding between Pt, Pd, and Ru compared to bonding with each other. This mechanism explains the recovery of the surface alloy structure after overgrowth.

5. The slight differences in stability between PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys can be attributed to the lower Pd content (44%) compared to Pt (70%). Higher Pd content may lead to more pronounced subsurface/bulk diffusion or the start of diffusion at higher Pd content levels, affecting stability.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置有着显著影响。稳定性由组件之间的相互作用能量和分离能决定。被限制在表面层的表面合金与客体金属如Pt和Pd倾向于停留在最外层相关联，促进顶层两个层之间较低的扩散壁垒相比，这有助于保持表面合金结构的稳定性。

2. 对于PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金的稳定性与分离行为的研究，通过STM成像和AES测量进行了。通过在已平衡的表面合金上沉积Ru薄膜并随后退火，证实了外表面层转变为原始的PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)单层表面合金，表明了稳定性与表面分离。

3. 埋藏在深处的Pt（Pd）原子在退火后浮到最外层的现象，表明了这些双金属系统中存在明显的表面分离驱动力。这些表面合金的稳定性和表面分离行为适用于各种组成范围，并可以应用于各种催化剂应用。

4. 浮动效应的机制涉及吸附态与底层表面原子之间的交换过程，结合了优先生长Ru区域，由于Pt、Pd和Ru与彼此的较强结合力相比与彼此的较弱结合力。这一机制解释了在过生长后表面合金结构的恢复。

5. PdRu/Ru(0001)和PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金的小差异稳定性可归因于Pd含量（44％）低于Pt（70％）。较高的Pd含量可能导致更显著的亚表面/扩散或仅在较高Pd含量水平开始扩散，影响稳定性。

Answer: Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is determined by factors such as the interaction energies between the two components and the segregation energies, which can be assessed through experimental methods like STM and AES measurements. The tendency for surface segregation is influenced by the differences in surface energies of the two components and the size mismatch between the host metal and the guest metal. The stability of surface alloys is confirmed when the configuration remains unchanged despite variations in preparation procedures or parameters. The process of surface alloy formation involves exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms, which is facilitated by the stronger bonding of the guest metals (Pt, Pd) with the host metal (Ru) compared to each other. The presence of a cover layer of the host metal and subsequent annealing allows for the restoration of the original surface alloy composition, indicating the complete segregation of the buried guest metals to the surface layer. The stability and tendency for surface segregation in Pt-3d alloys are generic properties applicable to a wide range of compositions and are crucial for understanding the catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

Answer: 

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability and tendency of these alloys to segregate depend on the interaction energies between the components and the segregation energies. These energies determine whether the alloys are thermodynamically stable or metastable. The presence of a negative segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the other species and the size mismatch between the host and impurity metals, drives the floating behavior of buried guest metals. This process is similar for both Pd and Pt in Ru-based systems, facilitating the recovery of the original alloy composition after overgrowth by a Ru film and subsequent annealing, indicating a distinct driving force for surface segregation of these guest species.

The stability and structural characteristics of Pt-3d alloys are influenced by factors such as the content of the guest metal, the 2D distribution of the alloy components, and the bonding strengths between the metals. The presence of a negative segregation energy ensures that the alloys represent stable surface configurations, metastable only with respect to bulk dissolution. The floating effect observed in Pt-3d alloys is attributed to the preferential overgrowth of Ru areas over Pt- or Pd-dominated regions, due to the stronger bonding between Pt, Pd, and Ru. This behavior is consistent with the initial formation and recovery of the surface alloys after overgrowth, suggesting that the surface alloy formation process and the floating effect are generic for many surface alloys stabilized by a sufficiently negative surface segregation energy.

The catalytic properties and performance of Pt-3d alloys are affected by their stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration. The stability ensures that the alloys maintain their structure under reaction conditions, while the surface segregation influences the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. The structural configuration affects the accessibility of the active sites, influencing the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. The presence of a distinct driving force for surface segregation and the ability to recover the original alloy composition after overgrowth imply that these alloys can maintain their catalytic activity over multiple cycles.

Answer: 

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置。这些合金的稳定性和倾向性取决于组分之间的相互作用能和分离能。这些能量决定了合金是否是热力学稳定的或亚稳态的。负分离能的存在，包括上浮材料与其它物种相比的较低表面能以及主客体金属之间尺寸差异，驱动埋藏客体金属的浮动行为。对于Ru基系统中的Pd和Pt，这个过程是相似的，允许在覆盖Ru薄膜并随后退火后恢复原始合金组成，表明客体物种在主表面层中的表面分离有明确的驱动力。

Pt-3d合金的稳定性及其结构特征受多种因素的影响，包括客体金属的含量、合金成分的二维分布和金属间的结合强度。负分离能的存在确保合金在反应条件下保持稳定结构，而表面分离则影响催化剂的活性和选择性。结构配置影响活性位点的可接近性，从而影响催化反应的效率。存在的表面分离的明确驱动力和恢复原始合金组成的可能性意味着这些合金能够在多个循环中维持其催化活性。

1. Surface alloys, featuring a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer on a monometallic substrate, have gained attention as models for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-defined structure. Understanding the thermodynamic stability of these alloys, particularly in relation to their interaction energies and segregation energies, is crucial for their use in catalytic applications.

2. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys.

Surface segregation, driven by a negative impurity segregation energy, plays a key role in determining the structure and stability of these alloys.

3. The tendency for surface segregation and the stability of Pt-based surface alloys can be assessed through the observation of their behavior upon deposition of a cover layer of a metal species, such as Ru, followed by annealing.

### How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The presence of a homogeneous substrate allows the surface layer to rest vertically, while the lateral distribution of components can be accessed through high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with chemical contrast. The tendency of surface alloys towards bulk dissolution is influenced by the vast reservoir of monometallic substrate beneath the 2D alloy layer, which favors bulk dissolution at high temperatures due to entropy effects. However, surface alloys can be prepared under conditions where bulk dissolution is effectively inhibited. The stability of surface alloys can be assessed by varying the preparation procedure, and if the configuration remains unchanged, it indicates a stable surface configuration.

The stability of surface alloys is also dependent on the lateral distribution of surface components and the segregation energies between the two components. The presence of a distinct driving force for surface segregation of guest metals, such as Pt and Pd, is crucial for maintaining the stability of the surface configuration. The tendency for surface segregation is related to the difference in surface energies and the size mismatch between the host metal and the guest metal.

In the context of Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration can be influenced by factors such as the content of the deposited metal, the 2D distribution of components in the surface alloy, and the difference in bonding strengths between the host metal and the guest metal. Lower content of the deposited metal, such as in Pd (44%) compared to Pt (70%), can affect the stability of the surface alloy. The 2D distribution of components in the surface alloy, with a higher fraction of Ru3 sites in PdRu/Ru(0001) compared to PtRu/Ru(0001), can also impact the stability and segregation behavior.

The structural configuration of Pt-based surface alloys can be influenced by factors such as the exchange processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms, preferential overgrowth of certain areas, and the involvement of defects in the Ru film. These processes can lead to distinct island growth behaviors, such as layer-by-layer growth or bilayer island growth, depending on the content of the deposited metal and the 2D distribution of components in the surface alloy.

The stability and segregation behavior of bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-based systems, have significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The stability of the surface configuration ensures consistent catalytic activity, while the segregation behavior affects the distribution of active sites, potentially influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic reactions.

### 怎么样的热力学偏好和反应条件影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的稳定、表面分层和结构配置，并且这些后续影响对它们在各种应用中的催化性质有何影响？

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的稳定、表面分层和结构配置有着显著的影响。当存在一个同质底物时，表面层可以垂直放置，而表面成分的横向分布可以通过高分辨率扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行化学对比访问。表面合金倾向于向基体溶解的趋势受到位于2D合金层下方的庞大单金属底物的影响，在足够高的温度下由于熵效应而有利于基体溶解。然而，表面合金可以在有效抑制基体溶解的条件下进行制备。通过改变制备过程来评估表面合金的稳定性，如果配置保持不变，则表明是稳定的表面配置。

表面合金的稳定性还取决于表面成分的横向分布以及两个组分之间的分离能。对于在表面上的客体金属（如Pt和Pd）而言，存在维持表面配置稳定的明确驱动力。表面分层倾向与两种材料的表面能差异和两种最邻近原子距离的最佳差异有关。

在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金的情况下，表面合金的稳定、表面分层和结构配置可能会受到沉积金属含量、表面合金中组件的2D分布以及主金属与客金属之间结合强度差异等因素的影响。沉积金属含量较低，如Pd（44%）与Pt（70%）相比，可能会影响表面合金的稳定性。表面合金中组件的2D分布，例如在PdRu/Ru(0001)中相对于PtRu/Ru(0001)中较高的Ru3表面站点比例，也会影响稳定性和分层行为。

基于Pt的表面合金的结构配置可能受到交换过程的影响，该过程涉及吸附态和底层表面原子之间的相互作用，某些区域的优选生长，以及Ru膜中缺陷的作用。这些过程可能导致不同的岛生长行为，如层状生长或双层岛生长，这取决于沉积金属的含量和表面合金中组件的2D分布。

基于Pt的双金属催化剂的稳定性和分层行为对它们在各种应用中的催化性质和效率有重大影响。表面配置的稳定性确保了催化活性的一致性，而分层行为则影响活性位点的分布，可能影响催化反应的选择性和效率。
