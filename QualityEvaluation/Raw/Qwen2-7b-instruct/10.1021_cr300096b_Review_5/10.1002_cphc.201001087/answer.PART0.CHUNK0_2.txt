[1] "Surface alloys, with a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer on a monometallic substrate, have attracted increasing interest as model systems for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-de- fined structure."
[2] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures,in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when ex- cluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metasta- ble and possibly ill-defined configuration."
[3] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated sur- face alloys."
[4] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segrega- tion were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[5] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
[6] "The floating behavior is driven by a negative impurity segregation energy,which in- cludes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material com- pared to the respective other species as well as the size mis- match between the host metal and the comparably larger im- purity metal."
[7] "For both systems, PtxRu1x/Ru(0001) and PdxRu1x/ Ru(0001) surface alloys, a similar mechanism for surface alloy for- mation has been predicted [PdRu/Ru(0001),[14] PtRu/ Ru(0001)[36,58]]."
[8] "The island growth of Pt and Pd on Ru(0001) at 300 K as well as the morphology and the atom distribution of the surface alloys formed after annealing are shown in Figures 1ac and Figures 2ac, respectively."
[9] "Whereas for Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), the islands exhibit a typ- ical layer-by-layer growth, with the first layer of Ru islands almost filled and the second layer beginning to be populated, Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) shows a distinct growth of bilayer is- lands."
[10] "Quantitative evaluation of atomically re- solved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001),respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02."
[11] "The AES results confirm the findings of the STM mea- surements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the origi- nal surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subse- quent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt during the re-alloying step."
[12] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."
[13] "Based on these data, considering only exchange between the surface layer and the subsurface region consisting of the second (bulk dissolution inhibited) and using the annealing temperatures of 1350 K and 1150 K, respectively, the probability that a small amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann ap- proach given by Equation (1):pbury  exp  DEseg kBT"
[14] "Previous studies had provided clear evidence that during the initial stages of PtRu/Ru(0001)[36] and PdRu/Ru(0001)[14] monolayer surface alloy formation, growth of mixed islands occurs on Pt (Pd) free areas only."
[15] "Lateral exchange at the interface between Pt step decorations and former Ru steps was excluded at this tempera- ture.[36]"
[16] "Though we have no direct evidence for that, these exchange processes may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctu- ating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed sub- surface layer, as predicted previously for vertical surfactant transport.[73,74]"
[17] "In an atomistic picture, the initial formation of the surface alloys and their re- covery after overgrowth by Ru can both be explained by ex- change processes between adatoms and underlying surface atoms in combination with a preferential overgrowth of Ru areas as opposed to Pt- or Pd-containing or dominated re- gions, due to the stronger bonding of both Pt and Pd as well as Ru to Ru than to Pt or Pd."

Answer: 

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability and tendency of these alloys to segregate depend on the interaction energies between the components and the segregation energies. These energies determine whether the alloys are thermodynamically stable or metastable. The presence of a negative segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the other species and the size mismatch between the host and impurity metals, drives the floating behavior of buried guest metals. This process is similar for both Pd and Pt in Ru-based systems, facilitating the recovery of the original alloy composition after overgrowth by a Ru film and subsequent annealing, indicating a distinct driving force for surface segregation of these guest species.

The stability and structural characteristics of Pt-3d alloys are influenced by factors such as the content of the guest metal, the 2D distribution of the alloy components, and the bonding strengths between the metals. The presence of a negative segregation energy ensures that the alloys represent stable surface configurations, metastable only with respect to bulk dissolution. The floating effect observed in Pt-3d alloys is attributed to the preferential overgrowth of Ru areas over Pt- or Pd-dominated regions, due to the stronger bonding between Pt, Pd, and Ru. This behavior is consistent with the initial formation and recovery of the surface alloys after overgrowth, suggesting that the surface alloy formation process and the floating effect are generic for many surface alloys stabilized by a sufficiently negative surface segregation energy.

The catalytic properties and performance of Pt-3d alloys are affected by their stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration. The stability ensures that the alloys maintain their structure under reaction conditions, while the surface segregation influences the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. The structural configuration affects the accessibility of the active sites, influencing the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. The presence of a distinct driving force for surface segregation and the ability to recover the original alloy composition after overgrowth imply that these alloys can maintain their catalytic activity over multiple cycles.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置。这些合金的稳定性和倾向性取决于组分之间的相互作用能和分离能。这些能量决定了合金是否是热力学稳定的或亚稳态的。负分离能的存在，包括上浮材料与其它物种相比的较低表面能以及主客体金属之间尺寸差异，驱动埋藏客体金属的浮动行为。对于Ru基系统中的Pd和Pt，这个过程是相似的，允许在覆盖Ru薄膜并随后退火后恢复原始合金组成，表明客体物种在主表面层中的表面分离有明确的驱动力。

Pt-3d合金的稳定性及其结构特征受多种因素的影响，包括客体金属的含量、合金成分的二维分布和金属间的结合强度。负分离能的存在确保合金在反应条件下保持稳定结构，而表面分离则影响催化剂的活性和选择性。结构配置影响活性位点的可接近性，从而影响催化反应的效率。存在的表面分离的明确驱动力和恢复原始合金组成的可能性意味着这些合金能够在多个循环中维持其催化活性。
