[1] "Surface alloys, with a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer on a monometallic substrate, have attracted increasing interest as model systems for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-defined structure."
[2] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."
[3] "These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely."
[4] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above."
[5] "This confirms that the surface alloys indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions."
[6] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
[7] "The floating behavior was driven by a negative impurity segregation energy, which includes the lower surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the respective other species as well as the size mismatch between the host metal and the comparably larger impurity metal."
[8] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
[9] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously."

1. Surface alloys, featuring a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer on a monometallic substrate, have gained attention as models for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-defined structure. Understanding the thermodynamic stability of these alloys, particularly in relation to their interaction energies and segregation energies, is crucial for their use in catalytic applications.

2. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these alloys is influenced by factors like the surface energy of the constituent elements, their size mismatch, and the nature of interactions between them. Surface segregation, driven by a negative impurity segregation energy, plays a key role in determining the structure and stability of these alloys.

3. The tendency for surface segregation and the stability of Pt-based surface alloys can be assessed through the observation of their behavior upon deposition of a cover layer of a metal species, such as Ru, followed by annealing. This process allows for the assessment of the alloys' stability and segregation characteristics.

4. The floating behavior of buried metal species in surface alloys is driven by a negative impurity segregation energy. This energy includes the reduced surface energy of the up-floating material compared to the host metal, as well as the size mismatch between the host and the impurity metal.

5. The stability and tendency for segregation of Pt-based surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) measurements. These methods revealed that the surface alloys represent stable configurations, metastable only with respect to bulk dissolution, and confirmed the presence of a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pt and Pd guest species.

6. The stability of surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a layer of another metal species, such as Ru, on the surface alloys and subsequently annealing them to the temperatures required for initial surface alloy formation.

7. The floating behavior of buried metal species in surface alloys is influenced by the size mismatch between the host metal and the impurity metal. This mismatch leads to a lower surface energy for the up-floating material, contributing to the observed negative impurity segregation energy.

8. Previous mechanistic predictions regarding surface alloy formation and floating behavior were discussed in relation to the observed phenomena in Pt-based surface alloys.

9. The initial deposition step of Pt on a substrate resembles previously reported behaviors, indicating the consistency of growth mechanisms across similar systems.

10. The growth behavior during the initial deposition step of both Pt and Pd on a substrate is similar, reflecting the common mechanisms governing their growth and segregation on surfaces.
