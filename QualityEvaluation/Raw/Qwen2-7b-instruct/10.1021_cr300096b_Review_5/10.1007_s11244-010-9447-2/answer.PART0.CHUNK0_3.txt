[1] "In the studies reviewed herein, the approach has been exclusively focused on bimetallic surfaces consisting of one monolayer of admetal present in the first few atomic layers of the host metal."
[2] "As determined from glancing incidence XRD, the Pt foil is comprised of nearly equal amount of the two main crystal facets for fcc (111) and (100)."
[3] "This example demonstrates that while a given bimetallic configuration, such as the subsurface Pt3dPt structure, may exhibit an enhanced activity, it is crucial to determine whether that particular configuration is stable in the reaction environment of a specific application."
[4] "In order to further correlate DFT calculations with experimental results, a BrnstedEvansPolanyi relationship is derived to correlate thermodynamic stability from DFT calculations with kinetic barriers from experimental measurements for the Pt3dPt systems."
[5] "The linear trends in Fig. 10 for all the systems show that the correlation of thermodynamic stability with the difference in d-band center can be used beyond the Pt3d alloys."
