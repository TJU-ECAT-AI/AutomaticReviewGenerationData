1. Bimetallic alloys display unique properties not merely as a simple sum of their parent metals' characteristics.

2. Adsorbate-induced restructuring near the surface is an added degradation mechanism for bimetallic alloys.

3. Stability considerations for bimetallic structures extend to various atomic species, adaptable to more complex adsorbates via scaling relationships.

4. In vacuum and with 0.5 ML hydrogen, the DFT predicts the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure to be favored, whereas with 0.5 ML oxygen, the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is favored.

5. The stability of bimetallic configurations depends on the reaction environment in specific applications.

6. Combining theory and experiments allows for estimating activation barriers of Pt3dPt systems using the BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relationship, linking activation barriers to the heat of reaction.

2. 吸附剂诱导的表面重构是双金属合金的额外降解机制。

3. 对双金属结构的稳定性考虑涉及多种原子物种，并能够通过缩放关系扩展到更复杂的吸附剂。

4. 在真空和0.5 ML氢气下，DFT预测亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构被偏好，而与0.5 ML氧气相比，表面MPtPt(111)配置被偏好。

5. 不同反应环境下的特定应用中，双金属配置的稳定性取决于此。

6. 结合理论和实验可以使用BrnstedEvansPolanyi（BEP）关系来估计Pt3dPt系统的活化势垒，该关系将活化势垒与热能反应相关联。
