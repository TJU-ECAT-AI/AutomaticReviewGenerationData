How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these systems can be predicted using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which consider factors like the binding energy of adsorbates, the difference in the d-band center, and the crystal facet. Experimentally, the trends predicted by DFT are verified on both single crystal Pt(111) and polycrystalline Pt foils. This allows for the quantification of the relative stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures, enabling the prediction of general trends. Additionally, the difference in the occupied d-band center (Δεd) can be utilized to screen potential bimetallic alloys with desirable stability in environments containing vacuum, hydrogen, and oxygen. These insights have implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, such as heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis.

如何影响热力学偏好和反应条件，从而影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面层分离和结构配置，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金，并且这些影响对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有何后果？

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面层分离和结构配置，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金。这些系统的稳定性可以通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算预测，考虑吸附剂的结合能、d轨道中心差值以及晶体面等因素。实验上，通过验证DFT预测的趋势，可以对单晶Pt(111)和多晶Pt箔进行。这使得表面和亚表面双金属结构相对稳定性的量化成为可能，并能够预测一般趋势。此外，使用占据的d轨道中心差值（Δεd）可以筛选出在真空、氢气和氧气环境中具有理想稳定性的潜在双金属合金。这些见解对于提高双金属催化剂在各种应用中的催化特性和性能具有重要影响，例如异相催化和电催化。
