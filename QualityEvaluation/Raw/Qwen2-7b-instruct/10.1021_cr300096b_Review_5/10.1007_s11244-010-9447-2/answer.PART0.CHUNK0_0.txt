The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability and configurations are influenced by the adsorption of common reactants like hydrogen and oxygen. The study uses density functional theory (DFT) to predict the thermodynamic driving potential for adsorbate-induced segregation, verifying these predictions experimentally on both single-crystal and polycrystalline Pt surfaces. Empirical equations have been developed to predict the thermodynamic stability of other bimetallic systems under different environments. By combining theoretical and experimental approaches, the relative stability of surface and subsurface configurations can be quantified and general trends can be established, providing insights into the catalytic properties and performance of these systems in various applications.
