[1] "In the current review, we will focus on our recent theoretical and experimental studies on the general stability of the Pt3dPt subsurface structures in vacuum, as well as with the adsorption of two of the most commonly adsorbed species in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis, atomic hydrogen and oxygen."
[2] "The effect of switching the bimetallic configuration, alloying component, and crystal facet on the dissociative binding energy of O2. As has been determined for many adsorbates, the binding energy of oxygen roughly follows the d-band center, with binding strength increasing as the d-band center moves closer to the Fermi level."
[3] "In addition, Eq. 2 shows that the \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value is related to the difference in d-band center, Δεd, in a non-linear fashion when considering the full d-band center, Fig. 2a, and linearly when only including the bands that have electron occupation, Fig. 2b."
[4] "As shown earlier in Fig. 2, DFT results predict that the surface 3dPtPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen."
[5] "The similar segregation behavior in Figs. 7 and 8 reveals that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrate, bridging the materials gap."
[6] "The results described in this review demonstrate the general trend in the stability of the Pt3dPt subsurface structures in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen."

1. The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors dictate whether the subsurface or surface configuration is preferred in various environments, impacting the catalytic properties and performance.

2. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions affect the stability of bimetallic catalysts by influencing the binding energies of adsorbates. Oxygen binding strength, for instance, closely correlates with the d-band center of the surface, with stronger binding occurring when the d-band center is closer to the Fermi level.

3. The difference in the occupied d-band center (Δεd) between the subsurface and surface configurations plays a key role in determining the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic systems. When considering the full d-band center, the relationship is non-linear, whereas when focusing only on occupied bands, the relationship becomes linear.

4. DFT calculations predict that in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the surface 3dPtPt configuration is thermodynamically preferred for Pt3d alloys.

5. DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrates, showing that the same trends observed on single crystals also apply to polycrystalline materials, bridging the materials gap.

6. The review outlines a general trend in the stability of the Pt3dPt subsurface structures across different environments, including vacuum and the presence of hydrogen and oxygen. This trend helps in understanding the behavior of these catalysts under various conditions.

1. 催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别是在Pt基体系如Pt-3d合金中的结构配置，受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。这些因素决定了不同环境下的子层或表面配置是否更优，影响催化剂的催化特性和性能。

2. 热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响吸附物种的结合能来影响催化剂的稳定性。例如，氧气的结合强度与表面的d带中心紧密相关，d带中心越接近费米能级，结合强度越高。

3. 占用d带中心（Δεd）在子层和表面配置之间的差异在确定双金属系统的一般稳定性中起关键作用。当考虑整个d带时，关系是非线性的，而仅关注占用的带时，关系变为线性。

4. 计算机辅助理论预测，在吸附氧存在的情况下，Pt3d合金的表面3dPtPt配置是热力学上更优选的。

5. 计算机辅助理论预测和单晶表面的实验测量适用于多晶材料，显示单晶上观察到的趋势同样适用于多晶材料，跨越了材料的差距。

6. 该综述概述了在不同环境（包括真空和氢氧存在）下Pt3dPt子层结构稳定性的普遍趋势，有助于理解这些催化剂在各种条件下的行为。
