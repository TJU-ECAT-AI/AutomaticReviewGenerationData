[1] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures."
[3] "The presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt3dPt(111)."
[4] "Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same."
[5] "Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For instance, the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation in Pt-3d alloys is influenced by the segregation energy (Eseg) and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. The presence of atomic oxygen can alter the thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures, making the surface structure more stable compared to the subsurface structure. Moreover, the crystal structure of the substrate affects the stability of surface and subsurface configurations, with similar trends observed in both Pt(111) and Pt(100) substrates. Experimental studies and computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are essential tools for understanding the complex interactions between bimetallic catalysts and adsorbates under various reaction conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离配置有显著影响，尤其是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。这些因素决定了它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能的后续影响。例如，Pt-3d合金中氢诱导分层的动力学驱动力受分层能（Eseg）和表面与亚表面结构上氢结合能的差异的影响。原子氧的存在可以改变表面和亚表面结构的热力学稳定性，使表面结构比亚表面结构更稳定。此外，晶格结构对表面和亚表面配置的稳定性有影响，在Pt(111)和Pt(100)基底上观察到相似的趋势。实验研究和计算方法，包括密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，是理解在各种反应条件下双金属催化剂与吸附剂之间复杂相互作用的重要工具。
