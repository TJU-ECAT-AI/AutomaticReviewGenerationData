[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."
[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures."
[4] "Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same."
[5] "The presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt3dPt(111)."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications. For instance, under specific reaction conditions, bimetallic surface structures may exhibit different thermodynamic stabilities compared to subsurface structures. The presence of adsorbates like hydrogen and oxygen can alter the stability of these structures by affecting the segregation energies (Eseg). In the case of Pt-based alloys, the thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces has been observed. Additionally, crystal structure also plays a role in determining the relative stability of surface and subsurface structures, even though the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg differ between different substrates. The presence of oxygen can make the surface structure more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface structure.

在铂基复合催化剂，尤其是铂-3d合金的情况下，热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了催化剂的稳定性和表面分层配置。这些因素决定了催化剂在各种应用中的催化特性和性能。例如，在特定的反应条件下，催化剂表面结构的稳定性可能与亚表面结构不同。吸附物的存在如氢和氧可以改变这些结构的稳定性，通过影响分离能（Eseg）。在铂基合金的情况下，已经观察到了铂终止的双金属表面的热力学偏好。此外，晶格结构也会影响表面和亚表面结构的相对稳定性，尽管不同基底上的d带中心和ΔEseg值有所不同。氧气的存在可以使表面结构比亚表面结构更具有热力学稳定性。
