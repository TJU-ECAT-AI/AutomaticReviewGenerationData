3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
"One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."
"Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin."
"Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum."
"Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components."
"Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures."
"Christensen et al. (43) have also utilized DFT to investigate surface alloy phases and their stability based on surface phase diagrams constructed from the surface energy as a function of the surface composition."
"Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors modify the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial in bimetallic catalysis. Investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often find that alloy films are covered by a Pt skin, indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, specifically focusing on segregation energy (Eseg), help determine the thermodynamic driving potential for the movement of subsurface admetals from the bulk to the surface of the host metal. Surface segregation energy in transition metal alloys is strongly dependent on the crystal structure and the difference in surface energies of the pure alloy components. Adsorbates play a significant role in affecting the stability of surface and subsurface structures. DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation for various bimetallic surfaces with different types of adsorbates further elucidate the impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on bimetallic catalysts.
