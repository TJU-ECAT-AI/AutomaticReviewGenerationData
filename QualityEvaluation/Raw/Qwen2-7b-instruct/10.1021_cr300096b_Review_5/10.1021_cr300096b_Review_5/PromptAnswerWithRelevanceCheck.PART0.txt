Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For instance, the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation in Pt-3d alloys is influenced by the segregation energy (Eseg) and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures. The presence of atomic oxygen can alter the thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures, making the surface structure more stable compared to the subsurface structure. Moreover, the crystal structure of the substrate affects the stability of surface and subsurface configurations, with similar trends observed in both Pt(111) and Pt(100) substrates. Experimental studies and computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are essential tools for understanding the complex interactions between bimetallic catalysts and adsorbates under various reaction conditions.

3.1 DFT Calculations of Thermodynamic Stability
"One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."
"Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin."
"Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum."
"Alden et al. (199) have shown that the surface segregation energy in transition metal alloy depends strongly on the crystal structure and is essentially given by the difference in the surface energies of the pure alloy components."
"Greeley and Mavrikakis (12) performed segregation energy calculations by examining the effects of adsorbates on the stability of the surface and subsurface structures."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors modify the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial in bimetallic catalysis. Investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications often find that alloy films are covered by a Pt skin, indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, specifically focusing on segregation energy (Eseg), help determine the thermodynamic driving potential for the movement of subsurface admetals from the bulk to the surface of the host metal. Surface segregation energy in transition metal alloys is strongly dependent on the crystal structure and the difference in surface energies of the pure alloy components. Adsorbates play a significant role in affecting the stability of surface and subsurface structures. DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation for various bimetallic surfaces with different types of adsorbates further elucidate the impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on bimetallic catalysts.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications. For instance, under specific reaction conditions, bimetallic surface structures may exhibit different thermodynamic stabilities compared to subsurface structures. The presence of adsorbates like hydrogen and oxygen can alter the stability of these structures by affecting the segregation energies (Eseg). In the case of Pt-based alloys, the thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces has been observed. Additionally, crystal structure also plays a role in determining the relative stability of surface and subsurface structures, even though the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg differ between different substrates. The presence of oxygen can make the surface structure more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface structure.
