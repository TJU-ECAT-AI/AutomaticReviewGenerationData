[1] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin."
[2] "It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures."
[3] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen."
[4] "However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."
[5] "The presence of atomic oxygen makes the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than Pt3dPt(111)."

1. Investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications suggest that the alloy films are often covered by a Pt skin. 
2. The thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen-induced segregation involves the value of Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies between the surface and subsurface structures.
3. DFT calculations predict that the subsurface configuration stays thermodynamically favored when hydrogen is present.
4. In the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, the subsurface structure loses its thermodynamic stability, indicating a driving force for the 3d metals to segregate to the surface.
5. Atomic oxygen makes the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more thermodynamically stable than the subsurface configuration.
