[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."
[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "Ruban et al. (198) have utilized DFT to calculate the segregation energy (Eseg) for transition metal alloys, which is the thermodynamic driving potential to move the subsurface admetal from the bulk to the surface of the host metal in vacuum."
[4] "It was found that the thermodynamic driving force of hydrogen-induced segregation was related to two terms: the value of Eseg and the difference between the hydrogen-binding energies on the surface and subsurface structures."
[5] "Menning and Chen have extended DFT calculations to the Pt(100) substrate to explore the effect of crystal structure on segregation. Although the values of the d-band center and ΔEseg are different for 3d metals on Pt(111) and Pt(100), the general trend in the relative stability of the surface and subsurface structures remains the same."
[6] "Table 2 provides a list of DFT calculations and experimental studies of surface segregation of various bimetallic surfaces with several types of atomic and molecular adsorbates."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors impact their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions modifies the catalytic properties. Studies of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications suggest that alloy films are often covered by a Pt skin, indicating the thermodynamic preference for Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces. The segregation energy (Eseg) calculated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) helps determine the thermodynamic driving potential for moving admetals from the bulk to the surface. Hydrogen-induced segregation is influenced by Eseg and the difference in hydrogen-binding energies between the surface and subsurface structures. Crystal structure variations, such as moving from Pt(111) to Pt(100), affect the d-band center and ΔEseg, yet the general trend in the relative stability of surface and subsurface structures remains consistent. Extensive studies and calculations have been conducted on surface segregation of bimetallic surfaces with different types of adsorbates, providing insights into their behavior under various conditions.

在铂基合金体系，尤其是Pt-3d合金中，热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层以及结构配置有显著影响。这些因素直接影响它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能。反应条件下的双金属表面结构稳定性会改变催化性质。在燃料电池应用研究中，对铂合金薄膜覆盖的铂皮的观察表明，倾向于以铂终止的双金属表面的热力学偏好。通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的分层能量（Eseg）有助于确定从基体到表面的分层驱动力。氢诱导分层受到Eseg和表面与亚表面结构之间氢结合能差异的影响。从Pt(111)到Pt(100)的晶格结构变化会影响d带中心和ΔEseg的值，但表面和亚表面结构相对稳定性的总体趋势保持不变。已经进行了广泛的实验研究和计算，以探讨不同吸附剂下双金属表面的分层行为，提供了在各种条件下其行为的见解。
