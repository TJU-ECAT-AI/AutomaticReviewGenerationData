The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions of CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures lead to a counterintuitive effect in bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, CO adsorption pulls the less reactive alloy component, Cu, to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, inducing surface segregation of Cu. This process generates a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. The reason behind this phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings open up new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The results are confirmed through extensive DFT calculations.

在升高的压力和温度下，CO吸附的热力学偏好和反应条件导致了对双金属催化剂的反直觉效应。具体而言，CO吸附将较不活泼的合金成分Cu推向CuPt近表面合金的表面，诱导Cu表面的聚积。这一过程产生了稳定的CO/CuPt表面合金结构。这种现象的原因归结为当Cu存在于Pt表面的第一层时形成的显著更强的PtCO键。这些发现为选择性和动态调整合金表面的催化性能提供了新的可能性，适用于铜族（铜，银）/铂族双金属表面合金的广泛范围。这些结果通过广泛的密度泛函理论计算得到了证实。
