The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. When CO adsorption occurs at elevated pressures and temperatures on a CuPt near-surface alloy, it drives the less reactive Cu component to the surface, inducing a novel CuPt surface alloy structure. This process is not only applicable to specific bimetallic systems but also opens new avenues for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalytic applications. The enhanced CO binding energy and the formation of a well-ordered surface with isolated Pt sites are key outcomes, which contribute to the improved catalytic properties and performance of these materials. Moreover, the results suggest that the onset of bulk migration of Cu can be explained by the conditions that favor the segregation of Cu on the surface, especially when the concentration exceeds 2/3 ML of Cu.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分层、结构配置产生了显著影响。当在CuPt近表面合金上以升高的压力和温度吸附CO时，会将不那么活泼的Cu成分推到表面，诱导出新型的CuPt表面合金结构。这一过程不仅适用于特定的双金属体系，而且还为选择性和动态调整合金表面的催化应用开辟了新途径。增强的CO结合能和形成具有孤立Pt位点的有序表面是关键结果，这些结果有助于提高这些材料的催化性能和表现。此外，结果表明，当Cu浓度超过2/3 ML时，可以解释Cu的开始迁移，这可以解释Cu的表面迁移现象。
