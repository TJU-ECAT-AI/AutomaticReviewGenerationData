[1] "Adsorption-Driven Surface Segregation of the Less Reactive Alloy Component"
[2] "we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."
[3] "The Cu surface segregation is driven by the formation of a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure."
[4] "The results, which are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys, open up new possibilities in selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis."
[5] "Crucial to the catalytic performance of an alloy surface is its composition and structure."
[6] "The bonding of adsorbates may induce changes in local atomic composition and surface structure, changing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."
[7] "Counterintuitive to this picture, we show that CO adsorption induces surface segregation of the less reactive alloy component, Cu, switching a CuPt near-surface alloy to a novel well-ordered CuPt surface alloy."

The study demonstrates how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, specifically high pressures and temperatures, can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like CuPt alloys. CO adsorption at these conditions leads to the segregation of the less reactive component, Cu, to the surface, creating a new surface alloy with enhanced CO-binding properties. This process opens up opportunities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces, potentially applicable to a wide range of Cu-Pt group bimetallic systems. The catalytic performance is significantly influenced by the composition and structure of the alloy surface, and the interaction of adsorbates can alter the local atomic composition, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The study's findings suggest a counterintuitive effect, where the less reactive component segregates to the surface under specific conditions, rather than the more reactive component as typically expected.

研究显示，热力学偏好和反应条件，特别是高压和高温，如何影响双金属催化剂如CuPt合金的稳定性和表面结构配置。在这些条件下，CO吸附导致活性较低的组分Cu向表面的分离，形成一个具有增强CO结合特性的新表面合金。这一过程为选择性和动态调整合金表面的工程提供了可能性，可能适用于各种Cu-Pt族双金属系统。催化剂性能受到合金表面组成和结构的影响，并且吸附剂的相互作用可以改变局部原子组成，影响催化剂的活性和选择性。研究发现了一个出乎意料的效果，即在特定条件下，活性较低的成分向表面分离，而不是通常预期的更活跃的成分。
