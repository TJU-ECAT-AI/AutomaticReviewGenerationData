The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions of CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures lead to a counterintuitive effect in bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, CO adsorption pulls the less reactive alloy component, Cu, to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy, inducing surface segregation of Cu. This process generates a stable self-organized CO/CuPt surface alloy structure. The reason behind this phenomenon is attributed to the formation of a radically stronger PtCO bond when Cu is present in the first surface layer of Pt. These findings open up new possibilities for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, applicable to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys. The results are confirmed through extensive DFT calculations.

在升高的压力和温度下，CO吸附的热力学偏好和反应条件导致了对双金属催化剂的反直觉效应。具体而言，CO吸附将较不活泼的合金成分Cu推向CuPt近表面合金的表面，诱导Cu表面的聚积。这一过程产生了稳定的CO/CuPt表面合金结构。这种现象的原因归结为当Cu存在于Pt表面的第一层时形成的显著更强的PtCO键。这些发现为选择性和动态调整合金表面的催化性能提供了新的可能性，适用于铜族（铜，银）/铂族双金属表面合金的广泛范围。这些结果通过广泛的密度泛函理论计算得到了证实。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The presence of CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures leads to the unexpected segregation of the less reactive component, Cu, in CuPt near-surface alloys, forming a novel stable surface alloy with enhanced CO binding properties. This process opens up new avenues for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic systems. The increased PtCO bonding observed when Cu is present in the first layer aligns with previous studies on coinage/Pt-group metal systems, providing a theoretical foundation for the observed catalytic behavior.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统的稳定、表面分离和结构配置产生了显著影响。在较高压力和温度下吸附CO导致反应性较弱的组分Cu在CuPt近表面合金中意外地向表面聚集，形成一种新型稳定的表面合金，其CO结合能力甚至强于纯Pt(111)。这一过程为选择性和动态调整合金表面的催化性能开辟了新途径，可能适用于各种铜（Cu）、银（Ag）/Pt族双金属表面合金系统。当Cu存在于第一层时，观察到的PtCO结合增强与之前的硬币族/Pt族金属系统研究结果一致，为所观察到的催化行为提供了理论依据。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by promoting specific compositions and structures. In the context of the CuPt near-surface alloy studied, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures induced a large surface segregation of Cu, leading to the formation of a novel CuPt surface alloy. This alloy exhibited a high affinity for CO adsorption, surpassing that of pure Pt(111). The Cu content required for saturation of the surface alloy was 2/3 ML of Cu, which resulted in a CO saturation coverage of 1/3 ML. DFT calculations supported these experimental findings, confirming that the enhanced PtCO binding energy with 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer of Pt explained the observed Cu surface segregation. These results suggest that molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes can be utilized as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces, potentially extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过促进特定的组成和结构，影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分层。在研究的CuPt近表面合金中，CO在较高压力和温度下吸附导致了大量Cu表面分层，生成了一种新型的CuPt表面合金。这种合金对CO吸附具有极高的亲和力，超过了纯Pt(111)。饱和表面合金所需的Cu含量为2/3 ML的Cu，导致了1/3 ML的CO饱和覆盖。第一层Pt中的2/3 ML Cu增强了PtCO结合能，这一发现解释了观察到的Cu表面分层现象。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持了这些实验结果，确认了在第一层Pt中存在2/3 ML Cu时，PtCO结合能显著增强，从而解释了观察到的Cu表面分层。这些结果表明，可以利用分子吸附剂诱导的表面变化作为调整合金表面的工具，可能扩展到各种铜族（Cu，Ag）/铂族双金属表面合金。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. When CO adsorption occurs at elevated pressures and temperatures on a CuPt near-surface alloy, it drives the less reactive Cu component to the surface, inducing a novel CuPt surface alloy structure. This process is not only applicable to specific bimetallic systems but also opens new avenues for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalytic applications. The enhanced CO binding energy and the formation of a well-ordered surface with isolated Pt sites are key outcomes, which contribute to the improved catalytic properties and performance of these materials. Moreover, the results suggest that the onset of bulk migration of Cu can be explained by the conditions that favor the segregation of Cu on the surface, especially when the concentration exceeds 2/3 ML of Cu.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分层、结构配置产生了显著影响。当在CuPt近表面合金上以升高的压力和温度吸附CO时，会将不那么活泼的Cu成分推到表面，诱导出新型的CuPt表面合金结构。这一过程不仅适用于特定的双金属体系，而且还为选择性和动态调整合金表面的催化应用开辟了新途径。增强的CO结合能和形成具有孤立Pt位点的有序表面是关键结果，这些结果有助于提高这些材料的催化性能和表现。此外，结果表明，当Cu浓度超过2/3 ML时，可以解释Cu的开始迁移，这可以解释Cu的表面迁移现象。

The study demonstrates how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, specifically high pressures and temperatures, can influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts like CuPt alloys. CO adsorption at these conditions leads to the segregation of the less reactive component, Cu, to the surface, creating a new surface alloy with enhanced CO-binding properties. This process opens up opportunities for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces, potentially applicable to a wide range of Cu-Pt group bimetallic systems. The catalytic performance is significantly influenced by the composition and structure of the alloy surface, and the interaction of adsorbates can alter the local atomic composition, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The study's findings suggest a counterintuitive effect, where the less reactive component segregates to the surface under specific conditions, rather than the more reactive component as typically expected.

研究显示，热力学偏好和反应条件，特别是高压和高温，如何影响双金属催化剂如CuPt合金的稳定性和表面结构配置。在这些条件下，CO吸附导致活性较低的组分Cu向表面的分离，形成一个具有增强CO结合特性的新表面合金。这一过程为选择性和动态调整合金表面的工程提供了可能性，可能适用于各种Cu-Pt族双金属系统。催化剂性能受到合金表面组成和结构的影响，并且吸附剂的相互作用可以改变局部原子组成，影响催化剂的活性和选择性。研究发现了一个出乎意料的效果，即在特定条件下，活性较低的成分向表面分离，而不是通常预期的更活跃的成分。
