[1] "Counterintuitive to expectations and all prior observations of adsorbate-induced surface segregation of the more reactive alloy component, we show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures pulls the less reactive Cu to the surface of a CuPt near-surface alloy."
[2] "The results, which are expected to apply to a range of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys, open up new possibilities in selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis."
[3] "The earlier density functional theory (DFT) study (15) indicated increased PtCO bonding when Cu is present in the first layer, similar to what is observed for other coinage/Pt-group metal systems."
[4] "The results, which are confirmed by extended DFT calculations, show that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures induces a large Cu surface segregation, generating a novel CuPt surface alloy to which CO binds very strongly, even compared with pure Pt(111)."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The presence of CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures leads to the unexpected segregation of the less reactive component, Cu, in CuPt near-surface alloys, forming a novel stable surface alloy with enhanced CO binding properties. This process opens up new avenues for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces for catalysis, potentially extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic systems. The increased PtCO bonding observed when Cu is present in the first layer aligns with previous studies on coinage/Pt-group metal systems, providing a theoretical foundation for the observed catalytic behavior.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统的稳定、表面分离和结构配置产生了显著影响。在较高压力和温度下吸附CO导致反应性较弱的组分Cu在CuPt近表面合金中意外地向表面聚集，形成一种新型稳定的表面合金，其CO结合能力甚至强于纯Pt(111)。这一过程为选择性和动态调整合金表面的催化性能开辟了新途径，可能适用于各种铜（Cu）、银（Ag）/Pt族双金属表面合金系统。当Cu存在于第一层时，观察到的PtCO结合增强与之前的硬币族/Pt族金属系统研究结果一致，为所观察到的催化行为提供了理论依据。
