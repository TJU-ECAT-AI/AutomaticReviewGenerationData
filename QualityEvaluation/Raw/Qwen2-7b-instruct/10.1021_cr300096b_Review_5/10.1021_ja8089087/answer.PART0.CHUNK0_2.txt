[1] "It is clear that CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures on a CuPt near-surface alloy induces a large Cu surface segregation, generating a novel CuPt surface alloy to which CO binds very strongly, even compared with pure Pt(111)."
[2] "The Cu content needed for saturation of the SA is 2/3 ML of Cu, leading to a CO saturation coverage of 1/3 ML."
[3] "DFT calculations reproduce the experimental observations and confirm that the vastly increased PtCO binding energy with 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer of Pt rationalizes the observed Cu surface segregation."
[4] "An important consequence of our results is that they add to the promise of using molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes as a tool for selective and dynamical engineering of alloy surfaces."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by promoting specific compositions and structures. In the context of the CuPt near-surface alloy studied, CO adsorption at elevated pressures and temperatures induced a large surface segregation of Cu, leading to the formation of a novel CuPt surface alloy. This alloy exhibited a high affinity for CO adsorption, surpassing that of pure Pt(111). The Cu content required for saturation of the surface alloy was 2/3 ML of Cu, which resulted in a CO saturation coverage of 1/3 ML. DFT calculations supported these experimental findings, confirming that the enhanced PtCO binding energy with 2/3 ML of Cu in the first layer of Pt explained the observed Cu surface segregation. These results suggest that molecular adsorbate-induced surface changes can be utilized as a tool for selective and dynamic engineering of alloy surfaces, potentially extending to a wide variety of coinage (Cu, Ag)/Pt-group bimetallic surface alloys.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过促进特定的组成和结构，影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分层。在研究的CuPt近表面合金中，CO在较高压力和温度下吸附导致了大量Cu表面分层，生成了一种新型的CuPt表面合金。这种合金对CO吸附具有极高的亲和力，超过了纯Pt(111)。饱和表面合金所需的Cu含量为2/3 ML的Cu，导致了1/3 ML的CO饱和覆盖。第一层Pt中的2/3 ML Cu增强了PtCO结合能，这一发现解释了观察到的Cu表面分层现象。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持了这些实验结果，确认了在第一层Pt中存在2/3 ML Cu时，PtCO结合能显著增强，从而解释了观察到的Cu表面分层。这些结果表明，可以利用分子吸附剂诱导的表面变化作为调整合金表面的工具，可能扩展到各种铜族（Cu，Ag）/铂族双金属表面合金。
