1. The formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets in a PtFe alloy for fuel cell applications is studied through in situ electrochemical STM in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. This layer is induced by the dissolution of Fe atoms, which leads to a surface layer with a modified electronic structure, exhibiting high CO tolerance towards H2 oxidation or O2 reduction.

2. Watanabe et al. have developed numerous Pt-based alloys via magnetron sputtering deposition and assessed their catalytic properties using cyclic voltammetry, EXAFS, XPS, among other techniques.

3. XPS analysis on a PtFe alloy film reveals that Fe atoms leach into the solution and form a surface layer with altered electronic properties, enhancing the CO tolerance in H2 oxidation or O2 reduction processes.

4. STM has been utilized to investigate the surface structure of single crystals, and recently, Watanabe et al. initiated an in situ STM study on a sputtered Pt film in solution to explore the interaction between electrodes and adsorbates.

5. The dissolution of Fe and Pt atoms on the surface occurs when the film is immersed in solution, as confirmed by in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN) experiments.

6. The cyclic voltammogram on the PtFe film in 0.1 M HClO4 solution after 10 potential cycles exhibits a characteristic pattern similar to that of a polycrystalline Pt electrode.

7. The surface morphology of the film changes significantly after immersion in the electrolyte solution, resulting in a rough surface with cauliflower-like features compared to the more ordered surface observed initially.

8. After ten potential cycles, holding the electrode potential at 0.5 V enables the acquisition of STM images revealing the evolving surface morphologies over time.

9. High-resolution STM images demonstrate a hexagonal structure in the wide terraces, with atomic rows aligned in three-fold symmetry parallel to the step directions.

10. The study offers insights into electrode material research for fuel cells, and ongoing investigations are exploring the Pt skin layer's properties, including CO adsorption and oxidation, using STM.
