[1] "Fuel cells are receiving much attention as a next-generation residential power source and as electric vehicle power sources."
[2] "The study of fuel cells has resulted in the rapid development of efficient catalytic electrode materials."
[3] "Watanabe et al. have prepared many Pt-based alloys using the magnetron sputtering deposition method and investigated the catalytic properties of such alloys using cyclic voltammetry, EXAFS, XPS and other methods."
[4] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."
[5] "While electrochemical and other surface analysis techniques such as XPS, AES and EXAFS have been extensively used in the study of thin solid films, the information obtained from these methods is essentially macroscopic and does not provide direct atomic-scale models for the film structures."
[6] "On the other hand, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique to obtain atomic resolution images in UHV and also electrolyte solutions."
[7] "STM has been extensively used to examine the surface structure of single crystals."
[8] "However, no such study on Pt alloyed with non-precious metals has been reported."
[9] "We thus have attempted to reveal the relationship between microstructure and electrocatalytic activity of films to hopefully develop more efficient electrode materials."
[10] "In this paper, we report an in situ STM study of a PtFe film in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[11] "To ensure general information, several different areas of the film were imaged."
[12] "The measurements were carried out in a nitrogen-filled chamber."
[13] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."
[14] "The small peak at 0.71 V indicated by an arrow is assigned to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process."
[15] "However, the peak decreased with each additional potential cycle and finally disappeared, resulting in a steady CV."
[16] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."
[17] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V."
[18] "A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B."
[19] "Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."
[20] "The characteristic image strongly indicates that the terrace surface has a close-packed structure, i.e. a Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure."
