[1] "Fuel cells are receiving much attention as a next-generation residential power source and as electric vehicle power sources."
[2] "The study of fuel cells has resulted in the rapid development of efficient catalytic electrode materials."
[3] "Watanabe et al. have prepared many Pt-based alloys using the magnetron sputtering deposition method and investigated the catalytic properties of such alloys using cyclic voltammetry, EXAFS, XPS and other methods."
[4] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."
[5] "However, no such study on Pt alloyed with non-precious metals has been reported."
[6] "In order to decrease the cost of catalytic materials, understanding the microstructure of a variety of Pt-based d-transition metal alloy films is an important issue for fuel cell applications."
[7] "We thus have attempted to reveal the relationship between microstructure and electrocatalytic activity of films to hopefully develop more efficient electrode materials."
[8] "Fig. 1 shows a steady-state CV on the PtFe film in 0.1 M HClO4 after 10 potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V."
[9] "The small peak at 0.71 V indicated by an arrow is assigned to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox process."
[10] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."
[11] "The surface morphology of the film (at the same magnification) was found to change dramatically as shown in Fig. 2B with a rough surface with cauliflower-like features being observed rather than the more ordered surface seen in Fig. 2A."
[12] "For example, the surface image shown in Fig. 2D is observed 40 min after that for Fig. 2C. It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps."
[13] "Atomic resolution STM images can be acquired in the wide terraces as shown in Fig. 2F in which hexagonal structure can be seen."
[14] "The characteristic image strongly indicates that the terrace surface has a close-packed structure, i.e. a Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure."
[15] "Further studies on the Pt skin layer formed on the PtFe alloy electrode, such as the adsorption and oxidation of CO, are now in progress by using STM from the viewpoint of electrocatalysis."
