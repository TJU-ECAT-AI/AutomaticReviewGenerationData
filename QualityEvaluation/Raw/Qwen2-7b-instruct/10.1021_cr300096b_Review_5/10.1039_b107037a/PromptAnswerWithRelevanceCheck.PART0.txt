[1] "The formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets induced by dissolution of Fe atoms in a PtFe alloy for fuel cell applications is investigated for the first time by using in situ electrochemical STM in 0.1 M HClO4 solution."
[2] "Watanabe et al. have prepared many Pt-based alloys using the magnetron sputtering deposition method and investigated the catalytic properties of such alloys using cyclic voltammetry, EXAFS, XPS and other methods."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. In the context of this research, the stability and surface segregation of the PtFe alloy were studied through in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The results showed that during potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, Fe atoms leached out into the solution, leading to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process protected the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion. The structural configuration of the surface changed over time, eventually forming a Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure. These findings suggest that the surface structure of the PtFe alloy is dynamically influenced by the reaction conditions, impacting its catalytic properties and performance in fuel cell applications.
