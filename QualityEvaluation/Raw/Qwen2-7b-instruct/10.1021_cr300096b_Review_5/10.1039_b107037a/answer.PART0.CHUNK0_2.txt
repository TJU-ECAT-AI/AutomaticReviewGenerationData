The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. In the context of this research, the stability and surface segregation of the PtFe alloy were studied through in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The results showed that during potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, Fe atoms leached out into the solution, leading to the formation of a Pt skin layer with predominantly (111)-oriented facets. This process protected the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion. The structural configuration of the surface changed over time, eventually forming a Pt(111)-(1 × 1) structure. These findings suggest that the surface structure of the PtFe alloy is dynamically influenced by the reaction conditions, impacting its catalytic properties and performance in fuel cell applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分层以及结构配置有着显著影响。在本文研究中，通过在0.1 M HClO4溶液中的原位电化学扫描隧道显微镜（STM）研究了PtFe合金的稳定性和表面分层。结果显示，在0.05至0.95 V的电位周期之间，Fe原子从溶液中逸出，形成了以（111）为主的Pt表皮层。这一过程保护了底层的PtFe合金不受腐蚀。随着时间的推移，表面结构发生了变化，最终形成了Pt(111)-(1 × 1)结构。这些发现表明，PtFe合金的表面结构受到反应条件的影响，影响其在燃料电池应用中的催化特性和性能。
