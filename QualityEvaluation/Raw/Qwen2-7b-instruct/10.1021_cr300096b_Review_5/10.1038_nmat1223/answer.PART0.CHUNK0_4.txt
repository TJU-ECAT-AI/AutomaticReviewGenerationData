<p>The stability of NSAs can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption.</p>
<p>In general, adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly.</p>
<p>We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host.</p>
<p>Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models.</p>
<p>Many NSAs, however, have BEs in this range, generating a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies.</p>
<p>To rationalize the variation in BEH shown in Fig. 2, we present two correlations between BEH and properties of the clean alloy surfaces.</p>
<p>Our results indicate, however, that the transition-state energies for H2 dissociation on Cu and Au are significantly higher than are the transition-state energies on NSAs with comparable BEHs.</p>
<p>For example, on the non-ideal W/Pt alloy described above, the transition-state energy is found to be 0.16 eV, compared with 0.18 eV on the ideal W/Pt(111) subsurface alloy.</p>

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the energy required for solute atoms to move from the bulk to the surface layer of the host metal (Eseg). This, in turn, determines whether the surface layer will be pure solute or pure host. For instance, if Eseg is positive, the solute will be found in the subsurface layers of the host. Moreover, the binding energies of hydrogen on the surface and subsurface layers of the host and solute metals determine the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models in terms of solute distribution and surface structure, but they generally exhibit a quasi-continuous spectrum of hydrogen binding energies. The stability and configuration of NSAs are crucial for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications, especially for hydrogen-related reactions, due to their ability to bind hydrogen weakly yet dissociate hydrogen molecules efficiently at low temperatures. This makes them promising candidates for applications such as hydrogen separation, storage, and the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响原子从基体向宿主金属表面层移动所需的能量（Eseg），进而影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分层配置，特别是在如Pt-3d这样的Pt基系统中。如果Eseg为正，则溶剂将存在于宿主的亚表面层。此外，表面和亚表面层的宿主和溶剂金属上的氢吸附能决定了氢诱导表面分层的趋势。实际的NSA可能在溶质分布和表面结构上与理想模型有所不同，但它们通常展现出氢吸附能的连续谱。NSA的稳定性和配置对于各种应用中的催化性能至关重要，特别是对于与氢相关的反应，因为它们能够以较弱的结合力吸附氢，并在低温下高效地使氢分子解离。这使得它们成为氢分离、存储以及生产手性药物化合物的有前景候选材料。
