How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. For instance, the segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in determining the surface composition. A negative segregation energy allows solute atoms to form an overlayer on the host metal surface, while a positive segregation energy leads to subsurface alloy formation. The interaction between hydrogen and the metal surfaces, characterized by hydrogen binding energies (BEH), affects the stability of these systems. When hydrogen binds more strongly to the host metal than to the solute, hydrogen-induced segregation is prevented, ensuring the stability of the NSA under hydrogen-rich environments. The selection of ideal NSAs for hydrogen-related reactions involves assessing their stability in hydrogen-rich environments, considering the composition of the near-surface region, and predicting their behavior in multi-adsorbate environments. The stability screening approach relies on the comparison of the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host surfaces. This method helps identify NSAs that are likely to maintain their structure under various reaction conditions.

The catalytic properties and performance of these NSAs in different applications depend on their ability to facilitate specific reactions efficiently. For instance, NSAs that bind hydrogen weakly and dissociate it easily at low temperatures are suitable for hydrogen separation and storage. The combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers enables these NSAs to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Moreover, the stability of NSAs under reaction conditions ensures their consistent performance in various applications, such as in the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and as anode catalysts for fuel cells. The implications of these findings extend to the development of new NSAs that bind CO weakly, enhancing their potential as robust fuel-cell anodes by facilitating facile hydrogen activation.

The structural configuration and composition of NSAs, influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, directly impact their catalytic properties and performance. The design of NSAs with optimized properties for specific applications requires a deep understanding of the interplay between these factors and the underlying mechanisms governing their behavior during catalytic reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分层配置。例如，分离能（Eseg）在确定表面组成方面起着关键作用。负分离能允许溶质原子在宿主金属表面上形成覆盖层，而正分离能导致亚表面合金形成。氢与金属表面之间的相互作用，通过氢吸附能（BEH）来衡量，影响这些系统的稳定性。当氢对宿主金属的吸附强度大于对溶质的吸附强度时，氢诱导的分层被阻止，从而确保了NSA在氢富集环境中的稳定性。选择用于氢相关反应的理想NSA涉及评估它们在氢富集环境下的稳定性，考虑近表面区域的组成，并预测它们在多吸附剂环境下的行为。稳定性筛选方法依赖于比较溶质的分离能与纯溶质和纯宿主表面之间氢吸附能大小差异。这种方法有助于识别在各种反应条件下保持结构稳定的NSA。

这些NSA的催化特性和性能在不同应用中的影响取决于它们促进特定反应的效率。例如，那些以低温度易于氢解离、吸附氢弱的NSA适合氢分离和储存。结合弱氢吸附和低H2解离势垒的特点，使这些NSA能够作为低温度、高度选择性的催化剂，用于制药生产，并作为燃料电池阳极提供强大支持。此外，NSA的稳定性在反应条件下确保了它们在各种应用中的一致性能，例如在制备手性药物化合物和作为燃料电池阳极催化剂方面的应用。

NSA的结构配置和组成直接决定了其催化特性和性能。理解这些因素之间的相互作用以及驱动其行为的基本机制对于设计具有优化属性以满足特定应用需求的新NSA至关重要。这些发现的含义扩展到开发新的NSA，这些NSA对CO吸附较弱，增强它们作为强大燃料电池阳极的潜力，通过促进氢的简便活化。
