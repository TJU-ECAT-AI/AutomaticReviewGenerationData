[1] "A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties."
[2] "For example, thin layers of platinum on Ru(0001) crystals greatly reduce the strength of CO binding compared with pure Pt(111) surfaces."
[3] "Similarly, a small amount of nickel dosed on Pt(111) significantly decreases the desorption temperature of hydrogen compared with the respective pure metal surfaces."
[4] "Some NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily."
[5] "These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species."
[6] "Weak binding of H, in turn, can make subsequent reaction steps easier, thereby allowing lower temperatures to be used for reactions on these NSAs."
[7] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis."
[8] "Using simple models, we evaluate the stability of a large class of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments, and we discuss the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting stable surfaces."
[9] "We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation."
[10] "In general, Fig. 1 suggests that hydrogen will not induce surface segregation for most solute/host transition metal pairs, at least at low temperatures and pressures."
[11] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models."
[12] "To benefit fully from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs, more precise control of metal catalyst surface structure will be needed."
[13] "Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and in nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals may not be far off."
[14] "The range of BEHs across all pure metals studied (1.1 eV) reflects a broad spectrum of catalytic activities for hydrogen-based processes."
[15] "Many NSAs, however, have BEHs in this range, generating a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies."
[16] "The lowering of the transition-state energy is observed even on non-ideal NSAs although the effect is less pronounced."
[17] "The above property is unique; according to similar correlations for a number of simple dissociation reactions, weaker H binding should always imply a higher H2 dissociation barrier."
[18] "The unusual combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 activation makes NSAs promising for hydrogen-related catalytic applications."
[19] "At such temperatures, there is generally insufficient thermal energy available to activate competitive reaction pathways that produce by-products, and so the overall reaction selectivity should be increased."
[20] "Our quantitative predictions will change for non-ideal NSAs, but test calculations, together with experimental studies on non-ideal NSAs, suggest that the qualitative trends established here will persist in those cases."
[21] "Finally, as techniques for nanoscale materials synthesis improve, we suggest that it will become feasible to prepare desired, quasi-ideal NSAs reproducibly."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the energy required for solute atoms to move from the bulk to the surface (segregation energy) and the binding energies of adsorbates on the surface. This leads to variations in the catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts in different applications.

2. In Pt-based systems, thin layers of platinum on Ru(0001) crystals can significantly reduce the strength of CO binding, while a small amount of nickel dosed on Pt(111) can decrease the desorption temperature of hydrogen. This indicates that surface modifications can alter the catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts.

3. NSAs can produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation, which can be beneficial for H2 dissociation and subsequent reactions involving hydrogen with other surface species. This allows for the use of lower temperatures in reactions on these NSAs.

4. Density functional theory calculations have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis, enabling the evaluation of the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting surfaces. These calculations can predict the formation of NSAs with unique catalytic properties.

5. Among the results, some NSAs exhibit a combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which can be advantageous for hydrogen dissociation and subsequent reactions. This unique combination of properties makes NSAs promising for hydrogen-related catalytic applications.

6. More precise control of metal catalyst surface structure is needed to fully benefit from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs. Innovations in atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies are being developed.

7. The stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments can be assessed using a two-step procedure, considering the segregation energy of the solute and the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. This helps in identifying NSAs that are likely to be stable under certain thermodynamic conditions.

8. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models in terms of surface structure and composition, but the qualitative trends established in the study are expected to persist. As nanoscale material synthesis techniques improve, it becomes feasible to prepare desired, quasi-ideal NSAs reproducibly for various applications.

9. The range of hydrogen binding energies (BEH) across pure metals reflects a broad spectrum of catalytic activities for hydrogen-based processes. Many NSAs have BEHs within this range, creating a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies that can be tailored for specific catalytic applications.

10. Non-ideal NSAs can still exhibit the unique combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, although the effect might be less pronounced compared to idealized models. Experimental studies on non-ideal NSAs have shown that the qualitative trends established in the theoretical analysis hold true.

11. The ability of NSAs to bind hydrogen weakly and dissociate H2 easily can be leveraged for hydrogen separation and storage applications. This property is particularly useful for hydrogen-related catalytic processes, such as those involved in the production of pharmaceutical compounds and anode catalysts for low-temperature fuel cells.

12. Lower temperatures can enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation reactions by reducing the availability of thermal energy for activating competitive pathways that produce by-products. This leads to increased reaction selectivity, which is crucial for applications requiring high purity products, such as the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds.

13. The quantitative predictions for NSAs can vary depending on their deviation from idealized models. However, test calculations and experimental studies on non-ideal NSAs confirm that the established qualitative trends remain applicable in these cases.

14. Advances in nanofabrication techniques, including atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication for metals, are facilitating the preparation of desired, quasi-ideal NSAs. These advancements are expected to enable the design and manufacture of a broader range of materials with enhanced catalytic properties for various technological applications.

15. The existence of weakly bound molecular hydrogen precursors on NSAs at top sites, as opposed to the noble metals, suggests a different interaction between H2 orbitals and metal d-states. This modified interaction might affect the transition-state energies and contribute to the unique catalytic properties of NSAs.

16. The combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers makes NSAs suitable for hydrogen dissociation reactions, which can be facilitated at lower temperatures. This feature enhances the efficiency of hydrogen-related catalytic processes, such as those used in pharmaceutical production and fuel cell technology.

17. The overall reaction selectivity is increased at lower temperatures due to the reduced activation energy for competitive pathways that produce by-products. This leads to higher product purity, which is essential for applications like the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds.

18. The unique catalytic properties of NSAs, including their ability to bind hydrogen weakly and dissociate H2 easily, make them promising for hydrogen-related catalytic applications. Their potential in hydrogen separation and storage, as well as their suitability for pharmaceutical production and anode catalysts for fuel cells, highlights their importance in various industrial processes.
