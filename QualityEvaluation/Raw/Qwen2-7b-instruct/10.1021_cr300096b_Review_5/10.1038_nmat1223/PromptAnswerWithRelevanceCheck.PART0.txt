1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the energy required for solute atoms to move from the bulk to the surface (segregation energy) and the binding energies of adsorbates on the surface. This leads to variations in the catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts in different applications.

2. In Pt-based systems, thin layers of platinum on Ru(0001) crystals can significantly reduce the strength of CO binding, while a small amount of nickel dosed on Pt(111) can decrease the desorption temperature of hydrogen. This indicates that surface modifications can alter the catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts.

3. NSAs can produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation, which can be beneficial for H2 dissociation and subsequent reactions involving hydrogen with other surface species. This allows for the use of lower temperatures in reactions on these NSAs.

4. Density functional theory calculations have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis, enabling the evaluation of the stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments and the reactivity of hydrogen on the resulting surfaces. These calculations can predict the formation of NSAs with unique catalytic properties.

5. Among the results, some NSAs exhibit a combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which can be advantageous for hydrogen dissociation and subsequent reactions. This unique combination of properties makes NSAs promising for hydrogen-related catalytic applications.

6. More precise control of metal catalyst surface structure is needed to fully benefit from the unique catalytic properties of NSAs. Innovations in atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies are being developed.

7. The stability of NSAs in hydrogen-rich environments can be assessed using a two-step procedure, considering the segregation energy of the solute and the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host. This helps in identifying NSAs that are likely to be stable under certain thermodynamic conditions.

8. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models in terms of surface structure and composition, but the qualitative trends established in the study are expected to persist. As nanoscale material synthesis techniques improve, it becomes feasible to prepare desired, quasi-ideal NSAs reproducibly for various applications.

9. The range of hydrogen binding energies (BEH) across pure metals reflects a broad spectrum of catalytic activities for hydrogen-based processes. Many NSAs have BEHs within this range, creating a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies that can be tailored for specific catalytic applications.

How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. For instance, the segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in determining the surface composition. A negative segregation energy allows solute atoms to form an overlayer on the host metal surface, while a positive segregation energy leads to subsurface alloy formation. The interaction between hydrogen and the metal surfaces, characterized by hydrogen binding energies (BEH), affects the stability of these systems. When hydrogen binds more strongly to the host metal than to the solute, hydrogen-induced segregation is prevented, ensuring the stability of the NSA under hydrogen-rich environments. The selection of ideal NSAs for hydrogen-related reactions involves assessing their stability in hydrogen-rich environments, considering the composition of the near-surface region, and predicting their behavior in multi-adsorbate environments. The stability screening approach relies on the comparison of the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host surfaces. This method helps identify NSAs that are likely to maintain their structure under various reaction conditions.

The catalytic properties and performance of these NSAs in different applications depend on their ability to facilitate specific reactions efficiently. For instance, NSAs that bind hydrogen weakly and dissociate it easily at low temperatures are suitable for hydrogen separation and storage. The combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers enables these NSAs to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. Moreover, the stability of NSAs under reaction conditions ensures their consistent performance in various applications, such as in the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and as anode catalysts for fuel cells. The implications of these findings extend to the development of new NSAs that bind CO weakly, enhancing their potential as robust fuel-cell anodes by facilitating facile hydrogen activation.

The structural configuration and composition of NSAs, influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, directly impact their catalytic properties and performance. The design of NSAs with optimized properties for specific applications requires a deep understanding of the interplay between these factors and the underlying mechanisms governing their behavior during catalytic reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分层配置。例如，分离能（Eseg）在确定表面组成方面起着关键作用。负分离能允许溶质原子在宿主金属表面上形成覆盖层，而正分离能导致亚表面合金形成。氢与金属表面之间的相互作用，通过氢吸附能（BEH）来衡量，影响这些系统的稳定性。当氢对宿主金属的吸附强度大于对溶质的吸附强度时，氢诱导的分层被阻止，从而确保了NSA在氢富集环境中的稳定性。选择用于氢相关反应的理想NSA涉及评估它们在氢富集环境下的稳定性，考虑近表面区域的组成，并预测它们在多吸附剂环境下的行为。稳定性筛选方法依赖于比较溶质的分离能与纯溶质和纯宿主表面之间氢吸附能大小差异。这种方法有助于识别在各种反应条件下保持结构稳定的NSA。

这些NSA的催化特性和性能在不同应用中的影响取决于它们促进特定反应的效率。例如，那些以低温度易于氢解离、吸附氢弱的NSA适合氢分离和储存。结合弱氢吸附和低H2解离势垒的特点，使这些NSA能够作为低温度、高度选择性的催化剂，用于制药生产，并作为燃料电池阳极提供强大支持。此外，NSA的稳定性在反应条件下确保了它们在各种应用中的一致性能，例如在制备手性药物化合物和作为燃料电池阳极催化剂方面的应用。

NSA的结构配置和组成直接决定了其催化特性和性能。理解这些因素之间的相互作用以及驱动其行为的基本机制对于设计具有优化属性以满足特定应用需求的新NSA至关重要。这些发现的含义扩展到开发新的NSA，这些NSA对CO吸附较弱，增强它们作为强大燃料电池阳极的潜力，通过促进氢的简便活化。

How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the alloy's ability to maintain its structure under various operational conditions. For instance, the segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in deciding whether a solute metal will form an overlayer or a subsurface alloy with the host metal. A negative Eseg suggests that the solute metal will form an overlayer, whereas a positive Eseg indicates a subsurface alloy formation. Adsorbates can also alter surface compositions, affecting the stability and reactivity of the catalyst.

The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) is influenced by the balance between the binding energy of hydrogen (θH) on the NSA and on the pure host metal. For NSAs with low hydrogen binding energy (similar to noble metals like Cu and Au) and low hydrogen activation energy barriers, they can serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceutical production and robust fuel-cell anodes. These NSAs enable efficient hydrogen activation and dissociation, leading to enhanced catalytic performance at lower temperatures.

The catalytic properties and performance of NSAs are further influenced by their structural configuration. Idealized NSA models predict the behavior of these alloys under different thermodynamic conditions. However, real NSAs may deviate from these models due to factors such as partial solute segregation, varying coverage, or unusual periodicity. These deviations can impact the catalytic activity but do not significantly alter the main trends in adsorbate behavior. As nanofabrication techniques advance, it becomes increasingly feasible to prepare desired, quasi-ideal NSAs for various applications.

The weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation on NSAs contribute to their exceptional catalytic properties. These unusual characteristics enable efficient hydrogen activation and dissociation, leading to enhanced catalytic performance at lower temperatures. This makes NSAs suitable for applications requiring high selectivity and efficiency, such as the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds and robust fuel-cell anodes. Additionally, the presence of weakly bound molecular hydrogen precursors on NSAs facilitates hydrogen activation, further enhancing their catalytic performance.

In summary, thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions dictate the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of NSAs, influencing their catalytic properties and performance. The weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation on NSAs enable efficient hydrogen activation and dissociation, leading to enhanced catalytic performance at lower temperatures, making NSAs suitable for applications requiring high selectivity and efficiency.

如何影响热力学偏好和反应条件的影响，特别是铂基系统如Pt-3d合金中的二元催化剂的稳定性和表面聚集，并且这种配置对它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能有何后果？

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响二元催化剂（尤其是基于铂的系统）的稳定性和表面聚集。这些因素决定了合金在不同操作条件下的结构保持能力。例如，分离能量（Eseg）在决定溶剂金属是否形成覆盖层或与宿主金属形成亚表面合金中起着关键作用。Eseg为负时，表明溶剂金属将形成覆盖层；Eseg为正时，则表示形成亚表面合金。吸附剂还可以改变表面组成，从而影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。

NSA的稳定性受到氢吸附能（θH）和纯宿主金属上的氢吸附能之间的差值的影响。对于具有低氢吸附能（类似于金和银等贵金属）和低氢活化能壁垒的NSA，它们可以作为低温、高度选择性的催化剂用于制药生产以及坚固的燃料电池阳极。这些NSA能够有效激活和分解氢气，从而在较低温度下实现增强的催化性能。

NSA的催化特性和性能还受到其结构配置的影响。理想化的NSA模型预测了这些合金在不同热力学条件下的行为。然而，实际的NSA可能会偏离这些模型，原因包括部分溶质分离、覆盖度变化或不寻常的周期性。这些偏差可能会影响催化活性，但不会显著改变吸附剂行为的主要趋势。随着纳米制造技术的发展，准备理想的、接近理想的NSA以用于各种应用变得越来越可行。

NSA的弱氢吸附和易于H2分解特性对其催化性能有重要影响。这些异常特性使氢激活和分解效率提高，从而在较低温度下实现增强的催化性能。这使得NSA适合需要高选择性和效率的应用，如生产手性药物化合物和坚固的燃料电池阳极。此外，NSA上存在弱结合的分子氢前体有助于氢激活，进一步提高了其催化性能。

综上所述，热力学偏好和反应条件决定了NSA的稳定性和表面聚集，影响了它们的催化特性和性能。NSA的弱氢吸附和易于H2分解特性使其能够高效激活和分解氢气，在较低温度下实现增强的催化性能，这使得NSA适用于需要高选择性和效率的应用领域。

Alloy catalysts designed from first principles The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity.
Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.
Hydrogen is also increasingly used in energy production and storage technologies15,16,17,18,19, including fuel cells.
We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation. These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species.
The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption.
In general, adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly.
We have found, for example, that the thermodynamics are favourable for hydrogen to pull substrate Pt atoms to the Au surface of the Au*/Pt overlayer NSA.
The low dissociation barrier of H2 on NSAs is the most promising property of these materials for hydrogen-related catalytic applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the energy required for solute atoms to move from the bulk to the surface layer of the host metal (Eseg). This, in turn, determines whether the surface layer will be pure solute or pure host. For instance, if Eseg is positive, the solute will be found in the subsurface layers of the host. Moreover, the binding energies of hydrogen on the surface and subsurface layers of the host and solute metals determine the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation. Real NSAs may differ from idealized models in terms of solute distribution and surface structure, but they generally exhibit a quasi-continuous spectrum of hydrogen binding energies. The stability and configuration of NSAs are crucial for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications, especially for hydrogen-related reactions, due to their ability to bind hydrogen weakly yet dissociate hydrogen molecules efficiently at low temperatures. This makes them promising candidates for applications such as hydrogen separation, storage, and the production of chiral pharmaceutical compounds.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响原子从基体向宿主金属表面层移动所需的能量（Eseg），进而影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分层配置，特别是在如Pt-3d这样的Pt基系统中。如果Eseg为正，则溶剂将存在于宿主的亚表面层。此外，表面和亚表面层的宿主和溶剂金属上的氢吸附能决定了氢诱导表面分层的趋势。实际的NSA可能在溶质分布和表面结构上与理想模型有所不同，但它们通常展现出氢吸附能的连续谱。NSA的稳定性和配置对于各种应用中的催化性能至关重要，特别是对于与氢相关的反应，因为它们能够以较弱的结合力吸附氢，并在低温下高效地使氢分子解离。这使得它们成为氢分离、存储以及生产手性药物化合物的有前景候选材料。
