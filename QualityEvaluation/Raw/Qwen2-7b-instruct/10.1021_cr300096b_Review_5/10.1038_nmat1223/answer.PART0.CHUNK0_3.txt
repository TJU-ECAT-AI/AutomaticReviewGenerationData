Alloy catalysts designed from first principles The rational design of pure and alloy metal catalysts from fundamental principles has the potential to yield catalysts of greatly improved activity and selectivity.
Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu, Au) while, at the same time, dissociating H2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.
Hydrogen is also increasingly used in energy production and storage technologies15,16,17,18,19, including fuel cells.
We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation. These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species.
The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption.
In general, adsorbates can draw to the surface components of alloys to which they bind strongly.
We have found, for example, that the thermodynamics are favourable for hydrogen to pull substrate Pt atoms to the Au surface of the Au*/Pt overlayer NSA.
The low dissociation barrier of H2 on NSAs is the most promising property of these materials for hydrogen-related catalytic applications.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by determining whether the solute atoms prefer to segregate to the surface or subsurface layers. In the case of NSAs, hydrogen adsorption can draw solute atoms from the subsurface to the surface, affecting the overall structure and reactivity of the alloy. The stability of NSAs is assessed by considering the solute/host segregation energy in vacuum and the effects of hydrogen adsorption on the surface composition. Weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation are advantageous properties for these alloys, enabling them to serve as low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for various applications, including pharmaceutical production and fuel cells. The unique combination of these properties allows for efficient hydrogen activation and subsequent reactions with other surface species, enhancing the catalytic performance of NSAs.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过决定溶质原子是否更倾向于分层到表面或亚表面层，从而影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和结构配置，特别是在如Pt-3d这样的铂基系统中。在近表面合金（NSA）的情况下，氢吸附可以吸引亚表面层中的溶剂原子到表面，影响合金的整体结构和活性。NSA的稳定性通过考虑真空下的溶质/宿主分离能以及氢吸附对表面组成的影响来评估。较弱的氢结合和容易的H2分解是这些材料的有利特性，使它们能够作为低温、高选择性的催化剂用于各种应用，包括制药生产和燃料电池。这些独特的性质允许高效地激活氢并随后与表面物种发生反应，从而增强NSA的催化性能。
