The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of the hex-reconstruction on the Pt(1 0 0) surface dictates the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a stoichiometry of Ag80Pt20. The anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction serves as a template for island growth. Upon annealing the sample above 600 K, more extensive alloying starts at the perimeter of the Ag adislands, resulting in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. Mixing of Ag with bulk Pt occurs at elevated temperatures. For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate increases configurational disorder, leading to Ag diffusion into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal. This diffusion is explained by two processes: site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分选和结构配置，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。Pt(1 0 0)表面上的六边形重构的存在决定了形成具有Ag80Pt20组成比例的延伸二维岛的出现。六边形重构的各向异性稳定性充当了岛屿生长的模板。通过退火将样品加热至600 K以上，会在Ag岛边缘开始更广泛的合金化，形成限制在表层的纳米相态AgPt合金。在较高温度下，Ag与基体Pt混合。对于伪同型Ag单层而言，为了增加表层的构象混乱，Ag和Pt之间的混合必须发生在表层和Pt基体之间。这种扩散由两种过程解释：Ag在第一和第二层之间的位点交换，以及空位介导的Ag在基体深层的扩散过程。

1. At 300 K, the formation of elongated 2D islands with a stoichiometry of Ag80Pt20 is observed. This is due to the amount of Pt expelled during the removal of the hex-reconstruction by the growing Ag islands. The island shape is determined by the anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction, with the row pattern serving as a growth template.

2. Annealing the sample above 600 K leads to extensive alloying initiated at the edge of the Ag islands through AgPt exchange, resulting in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. 

3. Temperature-dependent AES studies reveal that there is some mixing of Ag with the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.

1. 在300K时，形成了一种由Ag80Pt20组成的长条形2D岛屿。这归因于在生长的Ag岛屿期间去除六边形重建所释放的Pt的数量。岛屿形状由六边形重建的各向异性稳定性决定，行图案充当了岛屿生长的模板。

2. 将样品加热至600K以上会导致从岛屿边缘开始的广泛合金化，通过AgPt交换和表面层内形成的纳米相态AgPt合金。

3. 温度依赖的AES研究表明，在高温下Ag与基体Pt之间存在一定程度的混合。

[1] "Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal."
[2] "Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction."
[3] "Such formation of elongated islands has been previously reported after the deposition of several metals on this surface and this behavior may be expected on (1 0 0) hex-reconstructed surfaces, i.e. Pt, Au, and Ir, for a variety of deposited materials."
[4] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy."
[5] "The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."
[6] "The diffusion of Ag is limited to the surface layer."
[7] "This confinement of Ag to the surface kinetically restricts the coalescence of alloy terraces."
[8] "Although the nanophasic alloy remains essentially confined to the surface layer, AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."
[9] "Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature."
[10] "The former is a fast, reversible process observed at all of the temperatures studied in this work."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, through the formation of elongated islands during initial growth. The presence of a hexagonal reconstruction on the Pt crystal surface promotes the growth of these islands along the rows of the reconstruction, leading to a specific anisotropic shape. Annealing above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, which initiates at the perimeter of the islands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag with Pt from adjacent lower terraces. The diffusion of Ag is restricted to the surface layer, preventing the complete coalescence of alloy terraces. At higher temperatures, there is limited dissolution of Ag into the bulk Pt, and two processes are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature. The first process, a fast and reversible site exchange, is observed at all temperatures, while the second, more highly activated process, involving vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion, can only be observed at temperatures higher than 700 K within the experimental time frame.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过在Pt晶面表面形成六边形重构，影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中，促进了初始生长期间岛屿的形成。六边形重构的存在使得这些岛屿沿着重建面上的行以特定的各向异性形状生长。退火温度高于600 K导致纳米相态的AgPt合金形成，该过程从岛屿的边缘开始，并沿表面扩展，通过将Ag与相邻较低台阶上的Pt交换。Ag的扩散仅限于表面层，从而阻止了合金台阶的完全融合。在较高温度下，Ag部分溶解到内部Pt中，提出了两种解释AES信号随温度变化的时域响应的过程。第一种过程是一种快速且可逆的位点交换，在所有实验温度下都能观察到，而第二种过程，涉及空位介导的内部扩散，只能在温度高于700 K的情况下在实验时间范围内被观测到。

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems, by dictating the pathways and energies associated with alloy formation and segregation. In the context of Pt-3d alloys, annealing above 600 K facilitates the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, which is confined to the surface layer. This process is entropy-driven, aiming to reduce the free energy of the system by increasing configurational disorder in the surface layer.

2. The consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance depend on the specific nature of the alloy formation and segregation. The presence of a nanophasic alloy can alter the electronic structure and coordination environment of the active sites, potentially enhancing or diminishing catalytic activity for specific reactions. The interplay between the surface chemistry and the bulk properties of the alloy can affect the selectivity, stability, and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate is necessary to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer. This leads to Ag diffusion into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, which can decrease the Ag AES-signal with increasing temperature, indicating the mixing of Ag with the second and bulk layers of the crystal. This process is reversible upon cooling, as the entropy contribution to the free energy becomes less dominant, allowing Ag to diffuse back to the surface.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件通过决定合金形成和表面分离路径以及能量，影响了二元金属催化剂的稳定性和结构配置，尤其是在Pt基系统中。在Pt-3d合金的背景下，超过600 K的退火会导致银铂纳米相合金的形成，该合金仅限于表面层。这一过程主要由熵驱动，旨在通过增加表面层的构型混乱来降低系统的自由能。

2. 这些变化对催化性能和应用的后续影响取决于合金形成和分离的具体性质。纳米相合金的存在可以改变活性位点的电子结构和配位环境，可能增强或减弱特定反应的催化活性。表面化学与合金基体属性之间的相互作用可以影响催化剂的选择性、稳定性和效率。

3. 对于假同型Ag单层而言，Ag和Pt在表面层和Pt基底之间的混合以增加表面层的构型混乱是必要的。这导致Ag向Pt晶体的次表层扩散，随温度升高时Ag AES信号的减少表明Ag与晶体的第二层和基体层混合。这一过程在冷却后可逆，因为熵对自由能的贡献减少，允许Ag回流到表面。

1. The anisotropic island shape with straight edges on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface is a result of the hex-reconstruction's anisotropic stability, causing the lifting of the reconstruction across the entire width of the unit cell. This leads to elongated islands during the growth process.

2. Annealing a submonolayer of silver on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface at 600 K for 10 seconds results in a change in the surface morphology, with the characteristic row structure of the hex-reconstruction retreating from the island edges.

3. In a pseudomorphic silver monolayer, intermixing of silver and platinum between the surface layer and the Pt substrate increases configurational disorder. This process causes silver to diffuse into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, leading to a decrease in the AES signal with increasing temperature.

4. Two processes explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: site exchange between silver and platinum in the first and second layers, respectively, and vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion processes of silver in the subsurface region. The former process is reversible and mainly entropy-driven, while the latter requires higher activation barriers.

1. 直线边缘的岛状形状是由于六边形重构的各向异性稳定性，导致重建在整个单元格宽度上展开。这导致在生长过程中形成拉长的岛屿。

2. 在600 K下对Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面的银亚单层进行10秒的退火，会导致表面形态发生变化，特征行结构从岛边缘后退。

3. 对于拟晶态的银单层，在表面层和Pt基体之间发生银和铂的互混以增加表面层的配置熵。这一过程导致银扩散进入Pt晶体的亚表面区域，随着温度升高，AES信号降低。

4. 描述样本温度变化时AES信号的时间响应有两种过程：第一是在第一和第二层之间交换银和铂的位置，第二种是由空位介导的银在亚表面区域的扩散。前者是一个可逆的过程，主要由熵驱动，而后者需要更高的活化能。
