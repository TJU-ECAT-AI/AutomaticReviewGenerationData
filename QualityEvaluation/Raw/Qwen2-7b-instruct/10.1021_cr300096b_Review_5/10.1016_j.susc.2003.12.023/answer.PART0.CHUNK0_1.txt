1. At 300 K, the formation of elongated 2D islands with a stoichiometry of Ag80Pt20 is observed. This is due to the amount of Pt expelled during the removal of the hex-reconstruction by the growing Ag islands. The island shape is determined by the anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction, with the row pattern serving as a growth template.

2. Annealing the sample above 600 K leads to extensive alloying initiated at the edge of the Ag islands through AgPt exchange, resulting in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. 

3. Temperature-dependent AES studies reveal that there is some mixing of Ag with the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.

1. 在300K时，形成了一种由Ag80Pt20组成的长条形2D岛屿。这归因于在生长的Ag岛屿期间去除六边形重建所释放的Pt的数量。岛屿形状由六边形重建的各向异性稳定性决定，行图案充当了岛屿生长的模板。

2. 将样品加热至600K以上会导致从岛屿边缘开始的广泛合金化，通过AgPt交换和表面层内形成的纳米相态AgPt合金。

3. 温度依赖的AES研究表明，在高温下Ag与基体Pt之间存在一定程度的混合。
