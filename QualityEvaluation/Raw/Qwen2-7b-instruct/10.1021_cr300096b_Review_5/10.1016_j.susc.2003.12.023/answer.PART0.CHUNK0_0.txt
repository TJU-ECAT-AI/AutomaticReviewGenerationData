<p>At 300 K, formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. This island stoichiometry is dictated by the amount of Pt expelled due to removal of the hex-reconstruction of the clean Pt(1 0 0) surface by the growing Ag adislands.</p>
<p>The island shape can be explained by an anisotropic stability of the reconstruction, with the row pattern of the reconstruction acting as a template for island growth.</p>
<p>Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer.</p>
<p>There is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, on the other hand, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate has to occur to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer. Consequently, Ag diffuses into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal and the Ag AES-signal decreases with increasing temperature.</p>
<p>Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.</p>

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of the hex-reconstruction on the Pt(1 0 0) surface dictates the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a stoichiometry of Ag80Pt20. The anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction serves as a template for island growth. Upon annealing the sample above 600 K, more extensive alloying starts at the perimeter of the Ag adislands, resulting in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer. Mixing of Ag with bulk Pt occurs at elevated temperatures. For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate increases configurational disorder, leading to Ag diffusion into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal. This diffusion is explained by two processes: site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分选和结构配置，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。Pt(1 0 0)表面上的六边形重构的存在决定了形成具有Ag80Pt20组成比例的延伸二维岛的出现。六边形重构的各向异性稳定性充当了岛屿生长的模板。通过退火将样品加热至600 K以上，会在Ag岛边缘开始更广泛的合金化，形成限制在表层的纳米相态AgPt合金。在较高温度下，Ag与基体Pt混合。对于伪同型Ag单层而言，为了增加表层的构象混乱，Ag和Pt之间的混合必须发生在表层和Pt基体之间。这种扩散由两种过程解释：Ag在第一和第二层之间的位点交换，以及空位介导的Ag在基体深层的扩散过程。
