[1] "Heteroepitaxy of metals and alloying of metals at interfaces is of continuing interest for both fundamental studies and applications that involve multielement, structured materials."
[2] "Adsorption of any of several adsorbates (e.g., CO(a) and O(a)) on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface has also been observed to lift the reconstruction."
[3] "Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer."
[4] "This process appears to be mainly entropy driven."
[5] "For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, on the other hand, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate has to occur to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems, by dictating the pathways and energies associated with alloy formation and segregation. In the context of Pt-3d alloys, annealing above 600 K facilitates the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, which is confined to the surface layer. This process is entropy-driven, aiming to reduce the free energy of the system by increasing configurational disorder in the surface layer.

2. The consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance depend on the specific nature of the alloy formation and segregation. The presence of a nanophasic alloy can alter the electronic structure and coordination environment of the active sites, potentially enhancing or diminishing catalytic activity for specific reactions. The interplay between the surface chemistry and the bulk properties of the alloy can affect the selectivity, stability, and efficiency of the catalyst.

3. For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate is necessary to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer. This leads to Ag diffusion into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, which can decrease the Ag AES-signal with increasing temperature, indicating the mixing of Ag with the second and bulk layers of the crystal. This process is reversible upon cooling, as the entropy contribution to the free energy becomes less dominant, allowing Ag to diffuse back to the surface.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件通过决定合金形成和表面分离路径以及能量，影响了二元金属催化剂的稳定性和结构配置，尤其是在Pt基系统中。在Pt-3d合金的背景下，超过600 K的退火会导致银铂纳米相合金的形成，该合金仅限于表面层。这一过程主要由熵驱动，旨在通过增加表面层的构型混乱来降低系统的自由能。

2. 这些变化对催化性能和应用的后续影响取决于合金形成和分离的具体性质。纳米相合金的存在可以改变活性位点的电子结构和配位环境，可能增强或减弱特定反应的催化活性。表面化学与合金基体属性之间的相互作用可以影响催化剂的选择性、稳定性和效率。

3. 对于假同型Ag单层而言，Ag和Pt在表面层和Pt基底之间的混合以增加表面层的构型混乱是必要的。这导致Ag向Pt晶体的次表层扩散，随温度升高时Ag AES信号的减少表明Ag与晶体的第二层和基体层混合。这一过程在冷却后可逆，因为熵对自由能的贡献减少，允许Ag回流到表面。
