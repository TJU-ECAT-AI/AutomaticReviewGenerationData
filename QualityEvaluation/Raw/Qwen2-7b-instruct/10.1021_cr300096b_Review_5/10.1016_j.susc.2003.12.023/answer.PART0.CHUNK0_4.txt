1. The anisotropic island shape with straight edges on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface is a result of the hex-reconstruction's anisotropic stability, causing the lifting of the reconstruction across the entire width of the unit cell. This leads to elongated islands during the growth process.

2. Annealing a submonolayer of silver on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface at 600 K for 10 seconds results in a change in the surface morphology, with the characteristic row structure of the hex-reconstruction retreating from the island edges.

3. In a pseudomorphic silver monolayer, intermixing of silver and platinum between the surface layer and the Pt substrate increases configurational disorder. This process causes silver to diffuse into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, leading to a decrease in the AES signal with increasing temperature.

4. Two processes explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: site exchange between silver and platinum in the first and second layers, respectively, and vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion processes of silver in the subsurface region. The former process is reversible and mainly entropy-driven, while the latter requires higher activation barriers.

1. 直线边缘的岛状形状是由于六边形重构的各向异性稳定性，导致重建在整个单元格宽度上展开。这导致在生长过程中形成拉长的岛屿。

2. 在600 K下对Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面的银亚单层进行10秒的退火，会导致表面形态发生变化，特征行结构从岛边缘后退。

3. 对于拟晶态的银单层，在表面层和Pt基体之间发生银和铂的互混以增加表面层的配置熵。这一过程导致银扩散进入Pt晶体的亚表面区域，随着温度升高，AES信号降低。

4. 描述样本温度变化时AES信号的时间响应有两种过程：第一是在第一和第二层之间交换银和铂的位置，第二种是由空位介导的银在亚表面区域的扩散。前者是一个可逆的过程，主要由熵驱动，而后者需要更高的活化能。
