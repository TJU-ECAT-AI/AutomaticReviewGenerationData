[1] "Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal."
[2] "Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction."
[3] "Such formation of elongated islands has been previously reported after the deposition of several metals on this surface and this behavior may be expected on (1 0 0) hex-reconstructed surfaces, i.e. Pt, Au, and Ir, for a variety of deposited materials."
[4] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy."
[5] "The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."
[6] "The diffusion of Ag is limited to the surface layer."
[7] "This confinement of Ag to the surface kinetically restricts the coalescence of alloy terraces."
[8] "Although the nanophasic alloy remains essentially confined to the surface layer, AES indicates limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt after prolonged heating at elevated temperatures."
[9] "Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature."
[10] "The former is a fast, reversible process observed at all of the temperatures studied in this work."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, through the formation of elongated islands during initial growth. The presence of a hexagonal reconstruction on the Pt crystal surface promotes the growth of these islands along the rows of the reconstruction, leading to a specific anisotropic shape. Annealing above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, which initiates at the perimeter of the islands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag with Pt from adjacent lower terraces. The diffusion of Ag is restricted to the surface layer, preventing the complete coalescence of alloy terraces. At higher temperatures, there is limited dissolution of Ag into the bulk Pt, and two processes are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature. The first process, a fast and reversible site exchange, is observed at all temperatures, while the second, more highly activated process, involving vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion, can only be observed at temperatures higher than 700 K within the experimental time frame.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过在Pt晶面表面形成六边形重构，影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中，促进了初始生长期间岛屿的形成。六边形重构的存在使得这些岛屿沿着重建面上的行以特定的各向异性形状生长。退火温度高于600 K导致纳米相态的AgPt合金形成，该过程从岛屿的边缘开始，并沿表面扩展，通过将Ag与相邻较低台阶上的Pt交换。Ag的扩散仅限于表面层，从而阻止了合金台阶的完全融合。在较高温度下，Ag部分溶解到内部Pt中，提出了两种解释AES信号随温度变化的时域响应的过程。第一种过程是一种快速且可逆的位点交换，在所有实验温度下都能观察到，而第二种过程，涉及空位介导的内部扩散，只能在温度高于700 K的情况下在实验时间范围内被观测到。
