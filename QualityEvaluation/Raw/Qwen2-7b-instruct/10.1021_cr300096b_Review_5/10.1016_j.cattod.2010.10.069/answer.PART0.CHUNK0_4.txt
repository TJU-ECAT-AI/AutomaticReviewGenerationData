[1] "Our previous and present studies have shown that under the reductive environment including vacuum, CO and H2, the Pt skin surfaces with 3d TMs in the subsurface are energetically favorable."
[2] "Under the oxidizing conditions, the 3d TMs tend to segregate to the surface due to its strong interaction with oxygen."
[3] "Surprisingly, we find that the activity of elementary reaction between CO and atomic oxygen on atomic dispersed Pt3d TM surface alloys considered is similar to Pt surface."
[4] "In certain reaction conditions (very low oxygen partial pressures and/or low temperatures) or prepared conditions, the highly dispersed (or atomic dispersed) 3d TMs in the Pt surface could be stable either thermodynamically or kinetically."
[5] "The bi-functional mechanism can be invoked to improve the activity of catalytic reactions."

1. Under reductive conditions, the presence of 3d transition metals in the subsurface layer of Pt skin surfaces is energetically favorable, while under oxidizing conditions, these 3d metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong interaction with oxygen.
2. The bi-functional mechanism can enhance the activity of catalytic reactions by utilizing the active sites of both Pt and dispersed 3d transition metals.
3. Surprisingly, the activity of the elementary reaction between CO and atomic oxygen on atomic dispersed Pt3d TM surface alloys is comparable to that on a pure Pt surface.
4. In specific conditions such as low oxygen partial pressures or low temperatures, highly dispersed 3d transition metals in the Pt surface can be thermodynamically or kinetically stable.
5. The interplay between the structure and chemical state evolution of alloy catalysts under reaction conditions has significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.
