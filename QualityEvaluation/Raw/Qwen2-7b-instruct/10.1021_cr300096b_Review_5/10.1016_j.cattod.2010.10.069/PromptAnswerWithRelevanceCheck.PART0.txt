1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. In reductive conditions, 3d TM atoms tend to remain in the subsurface region. In contrast, under oxidizing conditions, these atoms segregate to the surface due to their strong interaction with oxygen. This segregation can lead to agglomeration of the 3d TM atoms in the surface.

2. The catalytic properties and performance of Pt-3d alloys in various applications are profoundly impacted by the dynamic interplay between structure, chemical state, and reaction conditions. The stability, surface segregation patterns, and structural configurations of these catalysts adapt to the prevailing environmental conditions, affecting their efficiency in specific reactions.

3. The atomic dispersion of 3d TM atoms in the Pt surface layer enables these catalysts to exhibit high activity in CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism. This mechanism allows CO to adsorb on the Pt sites while O2 activates on the dispersed 3d TM atoms.

4. In the case of oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in the Pt surface, the catalytic activity for CO oxidation is constrained by oxygen removal. The presence of defect sites or the edge of the oxidized 3d TM islands plays a crucial role in maintaining the activity by facilitating the coordination of oxygen atoms.

5. The relationship between the evolving structure and chemical state of alloy catalysts under reaction conditions and their catalytic activity is emphasized. This interplay highlights the importance of considering the dynamic nature of catalysts during their operation.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离以及结构配置有显著影响。在还原条件下，3d TM原子倾向于留在亚表面区域。相反，在氧化条件下，这些原子由于与氧的强相互作用而向表面分离，导致3d TM原子在表面上聚集。

2. Pt-3d合金在各种应用中的催化特性和性能受到反应条件下结构、化学状态动态变化的深刻影响。在不同环境条件下，这些催化剂的稳定性、表面分离模式和结构配置会适应并影响它们在特定反应中的效率。

3. 当3d TM原子在Pt表面层以原子分散状态存在时，这些催化剂在CO氧化中表现出高活性并通过生物功能机制实现。这种机制允许CO在Pt位点吸附，同时O2在分散的3d TM原子上激活。

4. 对于嵌入在Pt表面的氧化3d TM岛，CO氧化的催化活性受限于氧的去除。缺陷位点或氧化3d TM岛的边缘的存在对于保持活性至关重要，通过促进氧原子在边界处的协调来实现。

5. 结合结构和化学状态在反应条件下演变与催化剂活性之间的互动强调了考虑催化剂动态性质的重要性。
