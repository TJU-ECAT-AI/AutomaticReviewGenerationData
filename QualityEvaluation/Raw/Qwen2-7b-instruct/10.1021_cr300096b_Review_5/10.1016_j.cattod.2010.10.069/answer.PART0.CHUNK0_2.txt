[1] "Under reductive conditions (vacuum, CO, or hydrogen), 3d TM atoms prefer to stay in the subsurface region."
[2] "Under oxidizing conditions, 3d TM atoms tend to segregate to the surface due to strong O3d TMs interaction, leading to eventual 3d TM atoms agglomeration in the surface."
[3] "For CO oxidation, we find that the catalysts with atomic dispersed 3d TMs in Pt surface layer present an overall high activity via bi-functional mechanism."
[4] "For oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in Pt surface, the activity of CO oxidation is limited by the oxygen removal, and the presence of defect sites or the edge of oxidized 3d TM islands are essential."
[5] "The interplay between structure/chemical state evolution and activity of alloy catalysts under the reaction conditions is highlighted."

1. In reductive conditions, 3d TM atoms in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts tend to remain in the subsurface area due to thermodynamic preferences.
2. Oxidizing conditions cause 3d TM atoms to segregate to the surface, driven by strong interactions with oxygen, eventually forming agglomerated 3d TM islands.
3. Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with dispersed 3d TMs on the surface layer exhibit high catalytic activity for CO oxidation via a bi-functional mechanism.
4. Oxidized 3d TM islands in Pt surfaces limit CO oxidation activity by oxygen removal, with defect sites or island edges being crucial for activity.
5. The dynamic interplay between the structural transformation and chemical state of alloy catalysts and their catalytic performance under various reaction conditions is emphasized.

1. 在还原性条件下，Pt基双金属催化剂中的3d TM原子倾向于留在亚表面区域，这是由于热力学偏好。
2. 氧化条件导致3d TM原子向表面聚集，由氧与3d TM原子之间的强烈相互作用驱动，最终形成表面的氧化3d TM岛群。
3. 具有分散在表面层的3d TMs的Pt基双金属催化剂在CO氧化中表现出高催化活性，通过双功能机制。
4. Pt表面上氧化的3d TM岛限制了CO氧化活性，通过氧气的去除，缺陷位点或岛屿边缘对于活性至关重要。
5. 合金催化剂结构和化学状态演变与其在不同反应条件下催化性能之间的动态互动得到了强调。
