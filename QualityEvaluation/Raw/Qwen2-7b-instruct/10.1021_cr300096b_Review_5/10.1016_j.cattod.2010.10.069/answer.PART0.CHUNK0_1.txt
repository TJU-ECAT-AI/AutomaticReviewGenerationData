1. Under reductive conditions, 3d TM atoms prefer to stay in the subsurface region of Pt-based catalysts, while under oxidizing conditions, they tend to segregate to the surface due to strong interaction with oxygen. 
2. The structure and chemical state of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are highly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, affecting their stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration. 
3. The presence of 3d TMs in the Pt surface layer, especially in an atomic dispersed state, leads to high activity for CO oxidation through a bi-functional mechanism.
4. Oxidized 3d TM islands in Pt surfaces limit the activity of CO oxidation by restricting oxygen removal; defect sites or the edge of these islands are crucial for maintaining catalytic performance.
5. The dynamic interplay between the evolving structure and chemical state of alloy catalysts and their catalytic properties under reaction conditions is a key factor in their performance across various applications.

1. 在还原性条件下，3d TM原子倾向于留在铂基催化剂的亚表面区域，而在氧化性条件下，它们倾向于在表面上聚集，由于与氧的强烈相互作用。
2. bimetallic催化剂，特别是如Pt-3d合金这样的铂基系统，其结构和化学状态受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响，影响其稳定性、表面聚集和结构配置。
3. Pt表面层中分散的3d TMs的存在，尤其是以原子分散状态，导致CO氧化的高活性通过双功能机制。
4. Pt表面中的氧化3d TM岛限制了CO氧化的活性，因为它们限制了氧的移除；这些岛屿的缺陷位点或边缘对于维持催化性能至关重要。
5. 合金催化剂在其反应条件下结构和化学状态演变与催化性能之间的动态交互作用是它们在各种应用中性能的关键因素。
