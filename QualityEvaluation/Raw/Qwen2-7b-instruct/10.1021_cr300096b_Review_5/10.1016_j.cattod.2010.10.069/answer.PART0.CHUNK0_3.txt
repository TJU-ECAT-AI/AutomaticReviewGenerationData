1. Under reductive conditions, 3d TM atoms tend to remain in the subsurface region, while under oxidizing conditions, they segregate to the surface due to strong interaction with oxygen, eventually forming agglomerated islands on the surface.

2. For CO oxidation, the catalysts featuring atomic dispersed 3d TM atoms on the Pt surface exhibit high activity through a bi-functional mechanism.

3. The activity of CO oxidation on oxidized 3d TM islands embedded in the Pt surface is constrained by oxygen removal, necessitating the presence of defect sites or the edges of these islands for optimal catalytic performance.

4. The dynamic relationship between the evolving structure and chemical state of alloy catalysts and their catalytic activity in various conditions is emphasized.

1. 在还原性条件下，3d TM原子倾向于留在亚表面区域，而在氧化性条件下，它们会向表面聚集，由于与氧的强烈相互作用，最终形成表面岛状结构。

2. 对于CO氧化，具有原子分散的3d TM原子在Pt表面层的催化剂表现出高活性，通过双功能机制。

3. 在Pt表面嵌入的氧化3d TM岛屿上，CO氧化的活性受限于氧的去除，需要缺陷位点或这些岛屿的边缘来实现最佳催化性能。

4. 催化剂结构和化学状态的演变与其在不同条件下的催化活性之间的相互作用关系得到了强调。
