The study focused on understanding how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. To achieve this, computational and experimental methods were utilized. Numerical energy barrier (NEB) calculations offered insights into the energetics of the system. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to model the behavior of the catalyst under different conditions. Comparisons between experimental data and simulation results validated the theoretical predictions. The conclusions emphasized the significance of thermodynamic factors and reaction conditions in determining the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of the bimetallic catalysts.
