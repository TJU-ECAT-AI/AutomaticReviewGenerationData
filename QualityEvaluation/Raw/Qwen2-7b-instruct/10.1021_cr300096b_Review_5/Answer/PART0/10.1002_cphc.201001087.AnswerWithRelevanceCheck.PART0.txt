          [1] "For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration."
          [2] "These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely."
          [3] "The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion."
          [4] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys."
          [5] "The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing."
          [6] "Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals."
          [7] "Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions."
          [8] "The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously."
          [9] "Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02."
          [10] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys.

          Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

          Observations are compared with previous mechanistic predictions, highlighting the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, which is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).

          热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定、表面分离和结构配置产生了显著影响。这些催化剂的稳定性由组分之间的相互作用能量和分离能决定。被限制在表面层的表面合金与客体金属（如Pt和Pd）倾向于留在最外层，受动力学效应（如顶部两层之间交换的壁垒比体扩散低）的影响。这种稳定性对于保持表面合金的结构至关重要。

          这些表面合金已经进行了详细的结构表征，包括表面原子的二维分布，并且对与（电）催化相关的性质进行了深入研究。对Pt基表面合金的表面分离趋势和稳定性进行了研究，通过在平衡表面合金上方沉积一层Ru并随后退火。类似于表面抗介导生长或在各种单晶表面上沉积金属时观察到的埋藏金属的浮动现象，进一步支持了表面分离的理解。

          观察结果与之前的机制预测进行了比较，强调了初始沉积步骤期间岛屿生长行为的一致性，这与先前的报告相吻合。通过表面合金重组后的STM图像的定量分析获得了特定的组成（Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001)和Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)），准确度极高。稳定性的小差异可归因于客体金属的不同含量（44% Pd与70% Pt）。

          [1] "Vertically, the surface layer rests on a homogeneous substrate, at least in the ideal case of negligible bulk diffusion, while the lateral distribution of the surface components is accessible by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with chemical contrast."
          [2] "Phenomena such as 2D intermixing,[714] adsorption,[6,1532] or the catalytic/electroca- talytic reactivity[3335] have been investigated and linked to the atomic scale structure of the respective bimetallic surfaces."
          [3] "Because of the general tendency of surface alloys towards bulk dissolutionthe enor- mous reservoir of monometallic substrate underneath the 2D alloy layer of 107 atomic layers will always favor bulk dissolution at sufficiently high temperatures due to entropy effects they can be prepared only under conditions where bulk disso- lution is essentially inhibited."
          [4] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above."
          [5] "Whereas for Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), the islands exhibit a typ- ical layer-by-layer growth, with the first layer of Ru islands almost filled and the second layer beginning to be populated, Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) shows a distinct growth of bilayer is- lands."
          [6] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."
          [7] "These exchange processes may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctu- ating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed sub- surface layer, as predicted previously for vertical surfactant transport."
          [8] "A similar scenario for surface alloy formation was predicted also for PdRu/Ru(0001) by Rougemaille et al. based on STM and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) measurements."
          [9] "The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content,the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference be- tween RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding."

          The vertical placement of the surface layer on a homogeneous substrate, at least in ideal conditions where bulk diffusion is negligible, allows for the lateral distribution of surface components to be accessible via high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with chemical contrast. Various phenomena, such as 2D intermixing, adsorption, and catalytic/electrochemical reactivity, have been studied and connected to the atomic-scale structure of bimetallic surfaces.

          Due to the general tendency of surface alloys towards bulk dissolution, the vast reservoir of monometallic substrate beneath the 2D alloy layer of 107 atomic layers will always favor bulk dissolution at sufficiently high temperatures because of entropy effects. Surface alloys can only be prepared under conditions where bulk dissolution is essentially inhibited.

          Comparing the resulting surface structures with those of equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition provides insights into the questions raised. The growth patterns of islands for different surface alloys (e.g., Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) and Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)) indicate typical layer-by-layer growth for one and distinct bilayer island growth for the other.

          The slight differences in surface alloy stability might stem from the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy relative to Pt (70%). Exchange processes involving vacancies or fluctuating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed subsurface layer may occur, as predicted for vertical surfactant transport. Similar scenarios for surface alloy formation were also predicted for PdRu/Ru(0001) by Rougemaille et al. based on STM and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) measurements.

          The distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, contrasting with the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar conditions, could be attributed to the lower Pd content, the differing 2D distribution of components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.

          当表面层垂直放置在同质底物上，至少在可以忽略体扩散的理想情况下，表面成分的横向分布可以通过带有化学对比的高分辨率扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行访问。研究了诸如2D混合、吸附和催化/电化学活性等现象，并将它们与双金属表面的原子尺度结构联系起来。

          由于表面合金倾向于向基体溶解的普遍趋势，位于2D合金层下方的107个原子层的单金属底物的庞大储备，将在足够高的温度下由于熵效应而总是有利于基体溶解。只有在基体溶解几乎被抑制的条件下才能制备表面合金。

          将结果表面结构与Ru沉积前平衡表面合金的结构进行比较，可以回答提出的问题。不同表面合金（例如，Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)和Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001））的岛屿生长模式显示了一种典型的层状生长，而另一种则显示了独特的双层岛屿生长。

          表面合金稳定性的细微差异可能源自表面合金中Pd含量较低（44%）与Pt（70%）的相对差异。在覆盖合金下表面层的Ru薄膜中可能发生涉及空位或波动的针孔缺陷的交换过程，这是先前预测的垂直表面活性剂运输中出现的。Rougemaille等人基于STM和低能电子显微镜（LEEM）测量也预测了类似的表面合金形成场景用于PdRu/Ru(0001)。

          在类似条件下，与Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)上层状Ru生长形成鲜明对比的是，Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)表面合金上500 K时的独特的双层岛屿生长，可能是由于Pd含量较低，后者表面合金中组件的2D分布与Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)相比具有更多Ru3表面站点，或者RuRu键与RuPd键之间的差异不那么明显。
