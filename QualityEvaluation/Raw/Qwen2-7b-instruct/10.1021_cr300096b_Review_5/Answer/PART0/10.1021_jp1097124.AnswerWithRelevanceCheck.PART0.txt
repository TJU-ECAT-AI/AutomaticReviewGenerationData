          [1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain."
          [2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
          [3] "Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator."
          [4] "The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm."

          The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

          [1] "Density functional theory studies have shown that the confinement effect produced by the proximity of two metal surfaces induces a reactive environment which converts ethylene in an anion radical that adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain and is ready to react, initiating the polymerization chain."
          [2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
          [3] "These modifications in the surface DOS are due to the surfaceethylene electronic interaction; thus, they are expected to be unique for a specific surfacemolecule interaction, suggesting that this phenomenon may be suited for sensor applications."

          Density functional theory calculations reveal that the confinement effect, caused by the close proximity of two metal surfaces, creates a reactive environment that converts ethylene into an anion radical. This radical adopts the structure of a polyethylene monomer and is poised to initiate polymerization, demonstrating the utility of electron donor surfaces in enhancing reactivity for controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions.
