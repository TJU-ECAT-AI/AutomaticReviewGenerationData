          [1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."
          [2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."
          [3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."
          [4] "The origin of the catalytic activity and stability enhancement for the alloys is analyzed."

          The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions. This results in enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

          热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚集体配置有显著影响。由于强烈的Pt表面聚集体倾向，导致在三元合金表面上形成一层单层铂。这影响了氧和羟基离子的结合强度。与相应的双金属合金表面相比，这种结果增加了ORR的活性。此外，这些条件还提高了电化学稳定性，减少了Pt原子从合金表面的溶解。这些因素共同决定了Pt基合金催化剂在各种应用中的优异催化特性和性能。
