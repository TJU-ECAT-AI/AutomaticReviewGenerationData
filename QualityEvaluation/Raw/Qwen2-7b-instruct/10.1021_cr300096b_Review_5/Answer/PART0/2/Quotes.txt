[1] "Density functional theory studies have shown that the confinement effect produced by the proximity of two metal surfaces induces a reactive environment which converts ethylene in an anion radical that adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain and is ready to react, initiating the polymerization chain."
          [2] "The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought."
          [3] "These modifications in the surface DOS are due to the surfaceethylene electronic interaction; thus, they are expected to be unique for a specific surfacemolecule interaction, suggesting that this phenomenon may be suited for sensor applications."

[1] "Vertically, the surface layer rests on a homogeneous substrate, at least in the ideal case of negligible bulk diffusion, while the lateral distribution of the surface components is accessible by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with chemical contrast."
          [2] "Phenomena such as 2D intermixing,[714] adsorption,[6,1532] or the catalytic/electroca- talytic reactivity[3335] have been investigated and linked to the atomic scale structure of the respective bimetallic surfaces."
          [3] "Because of the general tendency of surface alloys towards bulk dissolutionthe enor- mous reservoir of monometallic substrate underneath the 2D alloy layer of 107 atomic layers will always favor bulk dissolution at sufficiently high temperatures due to entropy effects they can be prepared only under conditions where bulk disso- lution is essentially inhibited."
          [4] "Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above."
          [5] "Whereas for Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), the islands exhibit a typ- ical layer-by-layer growth, with the first layer of Ru islands almost filled and the second layer beginning to be populated, Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) shows a distinct growth of bilayer is- lands."
          [6] "The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%)."
          [7] "These exchange processes may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctu- ating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed sub- surface layer, as predicted previously for vertical surfactant transport."
          [8] "A similar scenario for surface alloy formation was predicted also for PdRu/Ru(0001) by Rougemaille et al. based on STM and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) measurements."
          [9] "The observation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content,the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference be- tween RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding."
