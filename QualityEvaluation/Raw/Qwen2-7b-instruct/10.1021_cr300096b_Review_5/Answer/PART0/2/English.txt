The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the energy required for metal segregation and the formation of specific structures on the catalyst surface. The stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) structures is also affected by these conditions, impacting the catalyst's overall performance and activity. The crystal plane plays a crucial role in determining the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface structures exposed to oxygen.

Density functional theory calculations reveal that the confinement effect, caused by the close proximity of two metal surfaces, creates a reactive environment that converts ethylene into an anion radical. This radical adopts the structure of a polyethylene monomer and is poised to initiate polymerization, demonstrating the utility of electron donor surfaces in enhancing reactivity for controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions.

The vertical placement of the surface layer on a homogeneous substrate, at least in ideal conditions where bulk diffusion is negligible, allows for the lateral distribution of surface components to be accessible via high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with chemical contrast. Various phenomena, such as 2D intermixing, adsorption, and catalytic/electrochemical reactivity, have been studied and connected to the atomic-scale structure of bimetallic surfaces.

          Due to the general tendency of surface alloys towards bulk dissolution, the vast reservoir of monometallic substrate beneath the 2D alloy layer of 107 atomic layers will always favor bulk dissolution at sufficiently high temperatures because of entropy effects. Surface alloys can only be prepared under conditions where bulk dissolution is essentially inhibited.

          Comparing the resulting surface structures with those of equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition provides insights into the questions raised. The growth patterns of islands for different surface alloys (e.g., Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) and Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001)) indicate typical layer-by-layer growth for one and distinct bilayer island growth for the other.

          The slight differences in surface alloy stability might stem from the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy relative to Pt (70%). Exchange processes involving vacancies or fluctuating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed subsurface layer may occur, as predicted for vertical surfactant transport. Similar scenarios for surface alloy formation were also predicted for PdRu/Ru(0001) by Rougemaille et al. based on STM and low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) measurements.

          The distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, contrasting with the layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar conditions, could be attributed to the lower Pd content, the differing 2D distribution of components in the latter surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites compared to Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or a less pronounced difference between RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding.
