        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, emphasizing how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model further highlight the profound implications of these factors on the catalytic properties and performance across various applications. 

        The presence of a strong Pt surface segregation tendency in ternary alloys leads to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces, which affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions. This results in enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces, and improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        For Pt-based systems, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are affected by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, dictating the distribution of metals on the surface. Controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles can tune the structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts, impacting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys includes the 2D distribution of surface atoms and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis, which have been thoroughly investigated.

        Our observations are discussed in comparison with previous mechanistic predictions, highlighting the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, which is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).

        The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, supporting the understanding of surface segregation. The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously.
