        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1103/physrevb.59.15990], which discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The theoretical study of reference [10.1021/jp2000859] focused on the local electronic alloy effects of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on a PtPd cluster model, illustrating the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The study of reference [10.1149/1.3409559] highlights the strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer on the surface of ternary alloys, affecting the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, thus influencing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and electrochemical stability in Pt-based systems. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, as detailed in the theoretical study of reference [10.1063/1.2900962].

        The study of reference [10.1021/ar50109a003] provides insights into the energetic interpretation of resulting structures in terms of interaction energies between components and segregation energies, emphasizing the importance of understanding whether these structures are thermodynamically stable or metastable. The characterization of surface alloys, including their 2D distribution of surface atoms and structure-related properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis, has been thoroughly investigated, offering a deeper understanding of the factors governing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. The theoretical prediction of the stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) under oxygen conditions, along with the effect of crystal planes on ORR activity and subsurface stability, further underscores the pivotal role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in Pt-based systems.

        The confinement effect, as explored in reference [10.1021/jp1097124], demonstrates the transformation of ethylene into a radical anion monomer, facilitating enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        The study of reference [10.1002/cphc.201001087] investigates the stability of surface alloys and the tendency for segregation in the context of depositing a cover layer of Ru on top of equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. This process allows for the observation of the floating of buried metal species, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, thereby supporting the understanding of surface segregation. The comparison of resulting surface structures with those of equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition provides insights into the questions raised regarding the stability and segregation tendencies.

        The investigation of NO2 exposure in reference [10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.030] leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer on the surface, which undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures, influencing the catalytic properties of Pt-3d alloys by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

        The analysis of reference [10.1149/1.3409559] reveals that the formation of a Pt monolayer on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces, and improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This collectively contributes to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        The study of reference [10.1021/ar50109a003] underscores the significance of understanding the energetic interpretation of resulting structures, considering interaction energies between components and segregation energies, to ascertain the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic catalysts.

This process is facilitated by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        The investigation of reference [10.1002/cphc.201001087] examines the stability of surface alloys and the tendency for segregation after depositing a Ru layer on equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. The floating of buried metal species, akin to phenomena observed in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, supports the understanding of surface segregation. Comparisons with previous mechanistic predictions highlight the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, which is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions, indicating the accuracy of the structural configurations.
