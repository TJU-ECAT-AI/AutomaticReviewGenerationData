        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, emphasizing how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model further highlight the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and investigation of structure-related properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been conducted. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied through the use of a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys followed by annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        Our findings demonstrate the significant role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in shaping the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors not only determine the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity but also influence the subsurface stability and electrochemical properties of these catalysts, thereby impacting their catalytic performance in various applications.

        In the future, the study of surface segregation in bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems, could pave the way for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for a range of industrial applications. The insights gained from this research can guide the design and synthesis of novel catalysts with tailored properties, optimizing their performance for specific catalytic tasks.
