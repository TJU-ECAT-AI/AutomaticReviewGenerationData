        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov \[1\], focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies, as exemplified by the work on the local electronic alloy effects of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on a PtPd cluster model \[2\], highlight the significant impact of these conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance across various applications.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy \[3\] and the improvement of stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys \[4\], underscore the importance of these factors in enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in diverse applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys \[5\]. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces \[6\]. These conditions also lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface, contributing to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications \[7\].

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions \[8\]. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm \[9\].

        The study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov \[10\] discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, focusing on the role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in influencing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The theoretical study on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model \[11\] provides insights into the mechanisms governing the catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts across different applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys \[12\]. The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion \[13\].

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to understand their thermodynamic stability, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration \[14\]. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely \[15\]. The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion \[16\].

        The origin of the catalytic activity and stability enhancement for the alloys is analyzed, revealing the complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the resulting structural configurations that significantly influence the performance of Pt-based catalysts in various applications \[17\].

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a, resembles that reported previously \[18\]. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yields surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02 \[19\]. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%) \[20\].

        The adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K forms an NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry \[21\]. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO \[22\]. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures \[23\]. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states \[24\]. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks \[25\]. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures \[26\]. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift \[27\]. The catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process \[28\].

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy \[29\] and the oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures \[30\] further elucidate the dynamic nature of surface configurations and their impact on the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based catalysts under varying reaction conditions. These studies provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the resulting structural configurations that significantly influence the performance of Pt-based catalysts in various applications.

        In conclusion, the study of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions reveals their profound influence on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts across various applications, highlighting the importance of understanding and optimizing these conditions for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts.
