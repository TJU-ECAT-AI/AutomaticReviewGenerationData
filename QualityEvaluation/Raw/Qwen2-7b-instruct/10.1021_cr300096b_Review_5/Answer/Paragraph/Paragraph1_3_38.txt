        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, emphasizing how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model further highlight the profound implications of these factors on the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across various applications. The presence of a strong Pt surface segregation tendency in ternary alloys leads to the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces, which affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, thus enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This, combined with improved electrochemical stability, results in superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications. The crystal plane of the metal surface also significantly affects both the oxygen reduction reaction activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, tend to stay in the outermost layer due to kinetic effects, such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers compared to bulk diffusion, contributing to their stability. Extensive characterization of surface alloys, including their 2D distribution and properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis, reveals the tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys. The stability of these surface alloys is investigated through the deposition of a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys followed by annealing, leading to the floating of buried metals and further support for the understanding of surface segregation. The energetic interpretation of resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between components and segregation energies, provides insights into whether they are thermodynamically stable or metastable configurations. The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures underscores the crucial roles of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in determining their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.
