        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov, discussing surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, emphasizing how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model also highlight the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on these catalysts' properties and performance. For instance, in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, these factors have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, with specific focus on Pt-based systems. This work has significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications.

        Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model demonstrate the substantial influence of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These studies elucidate the critical role of these factors in determining the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is pivotal for the performance of these catalysts in various applications.

        Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. These conditions also lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).

        NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift. The catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These improvements have significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications.

        Oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures underscores the pivotal role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in determining the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts in various applications.

        A. V. Ruban, H. L. Skriver, and J. K. Nrskov's study on surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys provides foundational insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. Their work highlights the importance of these factors in influencing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of these catalysts, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        The theoretical study focused on the local electronic alloy effects of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on PtPd cluster model reveals the profound impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These studies elucidate how the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts, providing critical information for optimizing the performance of these catalysts in various applications.

        Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces. The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. The origin of the catalytic activity and stability enhancement for the alloys is analyzed.

        Thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3 d metals in Pt elucidate the influence of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications. Specifically, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought. Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator. The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely. The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion. Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys.

        The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals. Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions. The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).

        In conclusion, the review section on the analytical examination of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions' influence on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, underscores the pivotal role of these factors in shaping the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications. The insights gained from this study provide a robust foundation for advancing the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial processes.
