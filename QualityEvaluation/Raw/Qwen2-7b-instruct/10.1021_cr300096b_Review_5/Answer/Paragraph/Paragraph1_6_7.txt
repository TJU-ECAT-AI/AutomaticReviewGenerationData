        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1103/physrevb.59.15990], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/jp2000859], [10.1149/1.3409559], and [10.1063/1.2900962]. The theoretical study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov focuses on the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, highlighting the significant influence of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications. The crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts. The presence of a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leads to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys, affecting the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, thus enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which control the distribution of metals on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by manipulating the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, impacting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. These surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation. Observations are compared with previous mechanistic predictions, highlighting the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, which is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).

        NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift. The catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These improvements have significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications. Oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures indicates that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        For Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are affected by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which dictate how the metals distribute themselves on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can also be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, which in turn impacts their reactivity and selectivity.

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrates the consistency with previous reports, and quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).
