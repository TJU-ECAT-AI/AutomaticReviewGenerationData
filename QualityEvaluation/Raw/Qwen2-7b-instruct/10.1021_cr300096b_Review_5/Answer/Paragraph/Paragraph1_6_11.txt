        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov highlights the thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influencing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This is exemplified through theoretical studies focusing on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model, underscoring how these factors significantly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. For instance, in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, these factors have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, exhibit tendencies to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys has been conducted, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, illustrated in Figures 1a and 2a, is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images after surface alloy reformation reveals specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)), demonstrating a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).

        In summary, the thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences are pivotal in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across diverse applications.

        通过Ruban、Skriver和Nrskov的研究详细分析了热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂稳定性和表面聚集的显著影响，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中的作用。具体体现在对氧相关分子在PtPd簇模型上的局部电子合金效应的理论研究中，这些因素对双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面聚集的结构配置产生了重大影响，尤其是对Pt基系统的影响。例如，在如Pt-3d合金的Pt基系统中，这些因素对这些材料在各种应用中的催化性质和性能有深远的影响。

        位于表面层的表面合金表现出倾向于留在外层的趋势，受动力学效应的影响，如在顶层两个层之间交换的较低壁垒相比，这有助于保持表面合金的稳定性。对表面合金的广泛表征包括表面原子的二维分布以及与（电）催化相关的结构特性进行了深入研究。对Pt基表面合金表面聚集和稳定性的研究是通过在平衡表面合金上沉积一层Ru并随后进行退火来进行的。埋藏金属的浮动现象，类似于表面抗介导生长或在各种单晶表面上沉积金属所看到的现象，进一步支持了表面聚集的理解。

        初始沉积步骤的岛状生长行为，如在图1a和2a所示，与之前的报告一致。原子级分辨率的STM图像的定量评估后表面合金重组揭示了特定的组成（Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001)和Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001）），显示了高精度。稳定性的小差异可以归因于客体金属的不同含量（44％Pd与70％Pt）。

        总之，热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面聚集的结构配置有显著影响，特别是对Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金。这些影响对于确定这些材料在不同应用中的催化性质和性能至关重要。
