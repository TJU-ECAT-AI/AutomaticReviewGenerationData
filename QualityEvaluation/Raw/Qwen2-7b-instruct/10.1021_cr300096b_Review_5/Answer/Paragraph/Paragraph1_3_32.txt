        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, emphasizing how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model highlight the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance across various applications.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The theoretical study focused on the local electronic alloy effects of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on a PtPd cluster model reveals that these factors play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, across different applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. These conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. The superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications are collectively attributed to these factors.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like the Pt-3d alloys. 

        The theoretical study focused on the energetic interpretation of resulting structures, including interaction energies between components and segregation energies, to understand the stability of surface alloys. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, has revealed their structure-related properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis.

        The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures highlights the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, it is essential to consider whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensively. The confinement of guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and thus the stability of the surface alloy is associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers compared to bulk diffusion.

        Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition provides answers to questions regarding the tendency for segregation of guest metals Pd and Pt. If there is a strong tendency for segregation, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys. The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step is illustrated in Figures 1a and 2a, which resembles that reported previously. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).

        Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3Ã—3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys.

The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which control the distribution of metals on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by manipulating the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, affecting their reactivity and selectivity.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought. Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator. The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely.

        NO2 exposures to produce a saturation monolayer coverage on a (3Ã—3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K form an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3Ã—3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED).
