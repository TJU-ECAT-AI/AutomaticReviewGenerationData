        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1103/physrevb.59.15990\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/jp2000859\], \[10.1149/1.3409559\], and \[10.1063/1.2900962\]. The theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model have been conducted, revealing that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions greatly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance across various applications. For instance, in the case of Pt-based systems, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, dictating how the metals distribute themselves on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be manipulated by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, impacting their reactivity and selectivity.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, tend to stay in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. These alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing, supporting the understanding of surface segregation.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions. This results in enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which control the distribution of metals on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by manipulating the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, affecting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These improvements have significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications.

        Oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures reveals that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        A. V. Ruban, H. L. Skriver, and J. K. Nrskov’s study in Phys. Rev. B 59, 15990 (1999) discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys.

        The theoretical study on the local electronic alloy effects of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on a PtPd cluster model indicates that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        The study on ternary alloys exhibits a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces. The presence of such a top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface.

        Thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3 d metals in Pt reveal that density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought. Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely. The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion. Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys. The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals. Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions.

        NO2 exposures to produce a saturation monolayer coverage on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K form an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K. Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states. Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation. Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal. Previous results using XPS conclude that Pt is not oxidized by reactions of NO2 on the 3 alloy under UHV conditions such as those investigated in this report.
