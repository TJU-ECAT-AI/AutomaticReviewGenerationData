        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov, focusing on the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, highlights how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The theoretical study by Skriver et al. further elucidates the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on PtPd clusters, emphasizing the profound implications of these conditions for the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The examination of ternary alloys reveals a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer, which affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, these conditions result in improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation in Pt-based systems, as discussed by various researchers, show that the crystal plane of the metal surface significantly influences both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts. Surface segregation patterns are influenced by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, and structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, impacting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The confinement effect on reactivity, as explored by Skriver et al., demonstrates how two metal surfaces transform ethylene into a radical anion monomer, preparing it for polymerization, thus enhancing reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Observations from the study by Ruban et al. confirm that the stability of surface alloys and the tendency for segregation are associated with the guest metals staying in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is essential for maintaining the structure of surface alloys, which have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying surface segregation and stability.

        The study by Skriver et al. on the energetic interpretation of resulting structures underscores the importance of knowing whether they are thermodynamically stable or represent a metastable configuration. These surface alloys have been characterized structurally, and their properties related to (electro-)catalysis have been intensively studied. The analysis of the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step and the comparison with previous mechanistic predictions highlight the consistency of the observed behavior with earlier reports.

        The theoretical work by Skriver et al. provides a theoretical demonstration that ethylene under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without an initiator, showcasing the enhanced reactivity of the confined ethylene molecule.

        The examination of NO2 exposure on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K reveals the formation of an NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. This dimer undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures, with adsorbed oxygen desorbing as O2 in three clear desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks, indicating the decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K, leading to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy remains unaffected by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as evidenced by the absence of a Pt AES shift. The interactions of NO2 influence the catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, playing a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.
