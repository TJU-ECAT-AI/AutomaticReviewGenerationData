        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov, which discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, highlighting how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model further emphasize the significant role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in affecting the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For instance, in the case of Pt-based systems, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are affected by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which dictate how the metals distribute themselves on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can also be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, impacting their reactivity and selectivity. The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys includes the 2D distribution of surface atoms and structure-related properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation. Observations are compared with previous mechanistic predictions, highlighting the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, which is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).
