        The study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model reveal that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions greatly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance across different applications. For instance, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like the Pt-3d alloys. NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift. The catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

        In particular, ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces. The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. The origin of the catalytic activity and stability enhancement for the alloys is analyzed.

        The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3 d metals in Pt are discussed, employing the density functional theory method. Predictions regarding the stability of subsurface 3 d metal in Pt(111) and Pt(100) in oxygen, as well as the effect of the crystal plane on ORR activity and subsurface stability, are made. The crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

        The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures reveals that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys.

        The theoretical study focused on the local electronic alloy effects of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on PtPd cluster model shows that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications.

        The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, resulting in enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        Thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3 d metals in Pt predict the stability of subsurface 3 d metal in Pt(111) and Pt(100) in oxygen and the effect of the crystal plane on ORR activity and subsurface stability. The crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought. Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely. The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion. Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys. The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals. Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions. The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).

        Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K forms an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. Adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K. Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states. Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation. Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal. Previous results using XPS conclude that Pt is not oxidized by reactions of NO2 on the 3 alloy under UHV conditions such as those investigated in this report.
