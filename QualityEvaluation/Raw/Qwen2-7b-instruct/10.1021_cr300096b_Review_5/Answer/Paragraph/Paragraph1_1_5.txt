        The in-depth analysis presented here elucidates the intricate relationship between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the properties of bimetallic catalysts, with a special focus on Pt-based systems, notably Pt-3d alloys. The studies referenced in this review emphasize the profound impact of these factors on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of these catalysts, and their consequential implications for catalytic performance.

        The theoretical studies, exemplified by the work of Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov, underscore how surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys are influenced by thermodynamic conditions, affecting the stability and structure of Pt-based catalysts. Similarly, the examination of the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on PtPd clusters reveals how reaction conditions can dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reactions, a critical aspect of catalytic activity in these systems.

        The exploration of ternary alloys highlights the strong tendency for Pt to segregate at the surface, leading to a Pt monolayer that modulates the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, thereby enhancing the activity of the catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions. This segregation pattern is also associated with improved electrochemical stability, offering insights into the design of more durable catalysts.

        The thermodynamic analysis of oxygen-induced segregation in Pt-based systems further elucidates how the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the activity and subsurface stability of these catalysts, contributing to the optimization of their performance across various applications.

        The theoretical demonstrations on the confinement effect of ethylene molecules between metal surfaces provide a unique perspective on the transformation of these molecules into radical anions, showcasing enhanced reactivity in both polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This phenomenon is facilitated by electron transfer between closely spaced metal surfaces, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        The characterization of surface alloys, particularly those involving Pt and Pd, reveals the stabilization effects of these alloys under reaction conditions, influenced by factors such as segregation energies and the tendency of guest metals to remain in the outermost layer. This stability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the catalyst structure during operation.

        The study of NO2 exposure on Pt-based catalysts demonstrates the complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the catalytic properties of these materials. The formation of a dimer and subsequent dissociation at specific temperatures indicates the dynamic nature of surface chemistry, affecting the catalytic activity and stability.

        The application of density functional theory (DFT) calculations offers a predictive framework for understanding the geometric and electronic properties of ethylene molecules confined between metal surfaces, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of polymerization initiation.

        The investigation of the energetic interpretation of resulting structures, including segregation energies and the stability of surface alloys, underscores the importance of these factors in determining the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts. The observed behaviors, such as the floating of buried metal species during surface growth, contribute to a deeper understanding of surface dynamics and the stabilization of alloy structures.

        The examination of NO2 adsorption and its effects on surface alloys, particularly in ternary systems, reveals the role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in modulating surface properties and catalytic performance. This includes the oxidation of surface elements and the influence of the Pt component on the stability of the catalyst.

        The study of surface segregation in Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloys with photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the potential for improving the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems. This has significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across various applications.

        The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity in PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures showcases how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can dynamically alter the catalytic properties of these materials, affecting their activity and selectivity.

        In summary, the reviewed studies collectively highlight the pivotal role of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in shaping the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. These insights are foundational for the development of advanced catalysts with optimized performance for a wide range of applications, from polymerization to catalytic oxidation reactions.
