        The study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov in 1999 highlights the significance of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in influencing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This is substantiated by theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model, which demonstrate that these factors significantly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. For instance, the formation of a Pt monolayer on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leads to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and improved electrochemical stability, contributing to the superior catalytic properties of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, tend to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of these alloys has revealed their 2D distribution of surface atoms and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys are studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation. 

        Thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation, affecting the thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, controlling the distribution of metals on the surface. The size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles can be manipulated to tune the structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts, impacting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. The energetic interpretation of resulting structures involves understanding interaction energies between components and segregation energies to determine whether the structures are thermodynamically stable or metastable.

        The theoretical demonstrations provided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer insights into the geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the confinement effect on reactivity is explored, highlighting its utility in various applications where controlled polymerization or specific chemical reactions are sought.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies, with surface alloys associated with the tendency of guest metals to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects. Surface alloys have been extensively characterized, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing, supporting the understanding of surface segregation.

        In conclusion, the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems, are deeply intertwined with thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors not only dictate the stability of the catalysts but also influence their surface segregation patterns, structural configurations, and thus, their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The insights gained from these studies pave the way for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for a range of industrial processes.

        Ruban、Skriver和Nrskov在1999年的研究揭示了热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面区室化和结构配置，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。理论研究表明，这些因素显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面区室化和结构配置，尤其是Pt基系统。例如，由于强Pt表面区室化的倾向，表面形成Pt单层导致氧还原反应（ORR）活性增强以及电化学稳定性的提高，从而促进了Pt基合金催化剂在各种应用中的优越催化性能。

        位于表面层的表面合金倾向于停留在外层，受动力学效应的影响，如上两层之间的交换壁垒较低，相比块体扩散而言。这种稳定性对于维持表面合金的结构至关重要。对这些合金进行了广泛表征，包括表面原子的二维分布和与（电）催化性质相关的结构特性。表面区室化和稳定性倾向的Pt基表面合金通过在等效表面合金顶部沉积Ru层并随后退火进行研究。埋藏金属的浮起现象，类似于表面抗介导生长或在各种单晶表面上沉积金属时出现的现象，进一步支持了对表面区室化的理解。

        热力学稳定性受到组分、原子间相互作用和合金形成能量壁垒的影响，这影响了Pt基系统的基本热力学稳定性。表面区室化模式由核化和生长等动力学过程决定，控制着金属在表面的分布。可以通过调整纳米粒子的大小、形状和取向来调整双金属催化剂的结构配置，从而影响它们的活性和选择性。

        从两个金属表面之间的接近产生的限制效果将乙烯转化为准备用于聚合的自由基离子单体，显示出对于可控聚合和特定化学反应增强的反应性。这个过程通过金属表面在足够短距离内的电子传输得以实现，通常在0.6到0.4 nm之间。结构配置的能解释涉及理解成分之间的相互作用能和区室化能，以确定结构是否是热力学稳定的或可能是一种不稳定且不明确的配置。

        密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提供了有关乙烯分子在两个金属表面之间的限制环境及其转化为自由基离子单体准备进行反应，形成聚合链的几何和电子性质的见解。已经探索了电子供体表面在已知的限制效果上的反应性，其在需要受控聚合或特定化学反应的应用中具有实用性。

        热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面区室化和结构配置有显著影响，特别是针对如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统。这些因素不仅决定了催化剂的稳定性，还影响其表面区室化模式、结构配置，并进而影响它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能。从这些研究中获得的洞察为开发更高效和选择性更强的催化剂开辟了道路，适用于一系列工业过程。
