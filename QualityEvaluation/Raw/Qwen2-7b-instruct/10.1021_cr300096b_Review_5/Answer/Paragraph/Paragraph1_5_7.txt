        The study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov (DOI: 10.1103/physrevb.59.15990) discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model (DOI: 10.1021/jp2000859) have been conducted, revealing that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions greatly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance across different applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys (DOI: 10.1021/ar50109a003). The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface, thus contributing to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain (DOI: 10.1021/jp1097124). The effect of an electron donor surface on the confinement effect on reactivity provides insights into controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions, demonstrating the theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement can initiate the polymerization chain without an initiator.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to understand whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration (DOI: 10.1002/cphc.201001087). Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions (DOI: 10.1021/jp1097124). The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like the Pt-3d alloys.

        NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface of a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K (DOI: 10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.030). This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures, impacting the catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy through the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy (DOI: 10.1063/1.2987704) aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. Oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures (DOI: 10.1021/jp206517) reveals that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions play crucial roles in determining their catalytic properties and performance.

        Our integrative understanding and prospective outlook is grounded in the detailed analysis of these studies, highlighting the pivotal role of thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and surface segregation in shaping the stability, structure, and catalytic performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. The future of this field lies in exploring novel alloy compositions and processing routes that can further optimize these factors for enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity in a variety of applications, from renewable energy technologies to chemical synthesis processes.

        热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离配置，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金（DOI：10.1021/ar50109a003）。由于强Pt表面分离倾向导致的Pt单层（ML）在三元合金表面的形成，影响了氧和羟基离子的结合强度，从而导致氧气还原反应（ORR）的活性增强，与二元合金表面相比。此外，这些条件还提高了电化学稳定性，减少了Pt原子从合金表面的溶解，从而为Pt基合金催化剂在各种应用中的优异催化性能做出了贡献。

        密度泛函理论（DFT）计算显示，一个乙烯分子在两个金属表面之间的限制环境内转变为一个能够准备进行聚合反应的自由基阴离子单体（DOI：10.1021/jp1097124）。通过电子供体表面，已知的限制效应对反应性的影响不仅适用于需要控制聚合的应用，也适用于特定化学反应，这提供了理论证明，即乙烯分子在电子和几何限制下可以启动聚合链的生成而不需要引发剂。

        对于结构和相互作用能量的解释，重要的是理解它们是否在排除批量溶解时是热力学稳定的，或者它们代表了一种可能的亚稳态或定义不明确的配置（DOI：10.1002/cphc.201001087）。表面合金，被限制在表面层，与客体金属如Pt和Pd倾向于停留在外层表面的倾向有关，受动力学效应的影响，如在顶部两层之间交换的较低壁垒与宏观扩散相比，这维持了表面合金的稳定性。

        由两个金属表面的接近所导致的限制效果，将乙烯转化为准备进行聚合的自由基阴离子单体，表现出增强的可控聚合和特定化学反应的活性（DOI：10.1021/jp1097124）。热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离配置，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。

        NO2暴露导致一个NN键合的N2O4二聚体在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上形成，并以直立倾斜的几何形状吸附在表面上（DOI：10.1016/j.susc.2004.03.030）。这种结构在220至300 K之间完全分解，释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO。吸附的NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O，在较高温度下，吸附的氧以三种清晰的脱附状态脱附。通过Sn AES峰的变化跟踪Sn氧化过程。NO2在220至300 K之间的分解导致表面氧和共吸附的NO的释放，随后氧化Sn在3合金中，从而影响Pt-3d合金的催化性质。

        Re 3 Pt多晶合金的表面分离性研究，使用光电子能谱（DOI：10.1063/1.2987704）旨在改善稳定性和表面分离配置，特别是在Pt基系统，如Pt-3d合金的情况下。PtNi双金属催化剂的表面结构和活性随氧化还原处理温度变化的振荡（DOI：10.1021/jp206517）揭示了热力学偏好和反应条件在决定其催化性能方面起着关键作用。

        我们整合的理解和前瞻性的展望基于这些研究的详细分析，突出了热力学偏好、反应条件和表面分离在塑造稳定性和结构以及催化性能方面对Pt基双金属催化剂的关键作用。该领域的未来在于探索优化这些因素以提高活性和选择性的新型合金组成和加工途径，应用于从可再生能源技术到化学合成过程的各种应用。

        [8] Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces.

Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface.

        [14] The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications. Specifically, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.
        [15] Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought. Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator. The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm.
        [16] For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely. The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion. Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys. The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals. Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions. The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).
        [17] NO2 exposures to produce a saturation monolayer coverage on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K form an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K. Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states. Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation. Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal. Previous results using XPS conclude that Pt is not oxidized by reactions of NO2 on the 3 alloy under UHV conditions such as those investigated in this report.
