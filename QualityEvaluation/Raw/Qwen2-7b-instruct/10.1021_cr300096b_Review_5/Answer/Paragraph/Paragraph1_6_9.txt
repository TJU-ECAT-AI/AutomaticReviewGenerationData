        The in-depth analysis of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions' influence on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly focusing on Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, is pivotal in understanding their catalytic properties and performance across various applications. This review delves into the theoretical and experimental insights derived from recent studies, emphasizing the critical role of thermodynamic stability, structural dynamics, and catalytic implications of bimetallic surface structures under varying reaction conditions.

        The study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov (DOI: 10.1103/physrevb.59.15990) elucidates the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, demonstrating how these energies, along with thermodynamic preferences, govern the stability and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts. The theoretical investigation of OOH, OH, and O adsorption on a PtPd cluster model (DOI: 10.1021/jp2000859) further underscores the significant impact of reaction conditions on the surface segregation and structural properties of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems.

        The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys, facilitated by a strong Pt surface segregation tendency, affects the binding strength of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (DOI: 10.1149/1.3409559). This, combined with improved electrochemical stability, reduces the dissolution of Pt atoms, contributing to the superior catalytic performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in diverse applications.

        The thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt (DOI: 10.1063/1.2900962) reveal the complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the resulting structural configurations. These factors dictate the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (DOI: 10.1021/jp1097124) show how the confinement effect, induced by the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer, enhancing its reactivity for polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces, typically occurring within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        The study on the energetic interpretation of resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies and segregation energies (DOI: 10.1002/cphc.201001087), emphasizes the importance of these energies in determining the stability and configuration of surface alloys, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These alloys, when subjected to redox treatments at variable temperatures, exhibit oscillations in surface structure and reactivity (DOI: 10.1021/jp206517), indicating the dynamic nature of their catalytic properties.

        The examination of surface segregation of Re3Pt polycrystalline alloy (DOI: 10.1063/1.2987704) and the oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts (DOI: 10.1021/jp206517) highlights the role of guest metal segregation and kinetic processes in influencing the stability and catalytic performance of bimetallic catalysts.

        In summary, the thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly shape the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors not only determine the catalytic properties and performance in various applications but also set the foundation for future advancements in catalyst design and optimization.

        The catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts are intricately linked to their surface configurations and the thermodynamic conditions under which they operate. By carefully tuning these parameters, researchers can optimize catalysts for specific applications, such as propane dehydrogenation, where the ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene is critical for industries requiring high-yield olefin production. Future work might focus on integrating these insights into the design of advanced catalysts capable of operating under harsher conditions, higher throughput, or with reduced energy consumption, thus enhancing their economic viability and environmental sustainability.
