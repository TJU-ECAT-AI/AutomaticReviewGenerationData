        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov, focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model have been conducted, revealing the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance across different applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. These conditions also lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures highlights the dynamic nature of these systems under changing conditions. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model have provided insights into the complex interplay between thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems.

        In Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, the interatomic interactions, and the energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are affected by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which dictate how the metals distribute themselves on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, impacting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate changes in the geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces, showing its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is crucial to understand whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensively.

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrates the typical pattern observed in previous reports. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)), with a composition accuracy of 0.02. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy can be attributed to the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. This improvement has significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications.

        NO2 exposures lead to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift.
