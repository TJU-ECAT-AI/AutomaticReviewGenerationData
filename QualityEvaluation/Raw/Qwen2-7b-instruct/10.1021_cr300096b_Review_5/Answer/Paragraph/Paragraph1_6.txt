        Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. These conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were studied by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, providing insights into the surface segregation patterns.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable or represent a metastable configuration. The structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely.

        Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures.

        In conclusion, thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications, contributing to their enhanced activity, stability, and selectivity.

        热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置，特别是在如Pt-3d合金的Pt基系统中。由于强烈的Pt表面分离倾向在三元合金表面形成一层Pt单层（ML），影响氧和羟基离子的结合强度，这增强了氧气还原反应（ORR）的活性，相比于双金属合金表面。这些条件导致了改善的电化学稳定性，减少了Pt原子从合金表面的溶解。这些因素共同促成了Pt基合金催化剂在各种应用中的优越催化性能。

        表面合金，受限于表面层，与Pt和Pd等客体金属倾向于留在外层的倾向相关联，受到动力学效应的影响，如上两层之间的交换壁垒低于常规扩散相比，从而确保了表面合金的稳定性。这种稳定性对于保持表面合金结构至关重要。表面合金的结构已经进行了广泛的表征，包括表面原子的二维分布，并且其与（电）催化相关的性质得到了彻底的调查。

        乙烯在两个金属表面之间的紧密接触下被限制，形成了一个立式、NN键合的N2O4二聚体，以倾斜的几何形状吸附在表面上。这种结构在220至300 K之间完全分解，释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO。吸附的NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O在较高温度下。
