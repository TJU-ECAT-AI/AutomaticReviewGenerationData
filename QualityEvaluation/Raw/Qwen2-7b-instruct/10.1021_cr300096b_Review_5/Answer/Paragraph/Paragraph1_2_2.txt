Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model have been conducted, revealing that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, impacting the performance of these catalysts across various applications.

        The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced ORR activity compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. The origin of the catalytic activity and stability enhancement for the alloys is analyzed in depth.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, tend to stay in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys has been performed, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms and structure-related properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied through various experimental techniques, providing insights into the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For instance, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

        The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion.
