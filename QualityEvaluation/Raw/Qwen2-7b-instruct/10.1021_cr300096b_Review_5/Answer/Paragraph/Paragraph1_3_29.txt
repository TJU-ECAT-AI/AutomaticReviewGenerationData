        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1103/physrevb.59.15990\], synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/jp2000859\] and \[10.1149/1.3409559\]. The theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model have been conducted, highlighting the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These conditions profoundly affect the catalytic properties and performance in various applications, including the enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and improved electrochemical stability.

        The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced ORR activity compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Moreover, these conditions lead to enhanced electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This contributes to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloy catalysts in various applications.

        The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which control the distribution of metals on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by manipulating the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, affecting their reactivity and selectivity.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated.

        The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures indicates the dynamic nature of these catalysts, influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These improvements have significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications.

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        For instance, in the case of Pt-based systems, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, the interatomic interactions, and the energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are affected by kinetic processes, such as nucleation and growth, which dictate how the metals distribute themselves on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can also be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, which in turn impacts their reactivity and selectivity.

        Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical for the performance of these catalysts in various applications. Specifically, the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts.

        Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought.

        Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator. The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.60.4 nm.

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely.

        The confinement of the guest metals Pt and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the topmost two layers as compared to bulk diffusion. Comparison of the resulting surface structures with those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to 2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated surface alloys.

        The stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segregation were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent annealing. Floating of buried metal species had been observed, for example, during surfaceant-mediated growth such as Ag homoepitaxy on Sb/Ag(111) or during deposition of various metals on Ag, Au, and Cu single crystals. Our observations are discussed in comparison with these previous mechanistic predictions.

        The island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illustrated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported previously. Quantitative evaluation of atomically resolved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02. The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy compared to Pt (70%).

        NO2 exposures to produce a saturation monolayer coverage on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K form an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED).

        However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K. Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states. Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation. Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal. Previous results using XPS conclude that Pt is not oxidized by reactions of NO2 on the 3 alloy under UHV conditions such as those investigated in this report.

        从参考文献\[10.1103/physrevb.59.15990\]的深入研究出发，结合了来自\[10.1021/jp2000859\]和\[\]的综合理解，对氧相关分子在PtPd簇模型上的局部电子合金效应进行了理论研究，揭示了热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂稳定性、表面分离和结构配置的显著影响，特别是针对Pt基系统，如Pt-3d合金。这些条件对各种应用中的催化性能产生了深远的影响，包括增强的氧气还原反应（ORR）活性和改进的电化学稳定性。

        形成的Pt单层（ML）由于强Pt表面分离倾向在三元合金表面的存在，影响了氧和羟基离子的结合强度，导致相对于相应的二金属合金表面，ORR活性得到增强。此外，这些条件导致了增强的电化学稳定性，减少了Pt原子从合金表面的溶解。这共同促进了Pt基合金催化剂在各种应用中的优越催化性能和性能。

        Pt基系统的热力学稳定性受组成、原子间相互作用和合金形成能垒的影响。表面分离模式受到核化和生长等动力学过程的影响，决定了金属在表面上的分布方式。双金属催化剂的结构配置可以通过调整纳米粒子的大小、形状和取向来调整，进而影响其活性和选择性。

        通过两个金属表面之间的接近，形成了乙烯的电子和几何约束，将其转化为准备进行聚合的自由基阴离子单体，展现出对于控制聚合和特定化学反应的增强反应性。这一过程在金属表面间足够短的距离内（大约0.6至0.4nm）由电子转移所驱动。

        界面合金，被限制在表面层，与客体金属如Pt和Pd倾向于停留在最外层的趋势相关联，受到动力学效应的影响，例如，与顶部两层相比，在层间扩散的低壁垒，这是与宏观扩散相比的。这种稳定性对于维持表面合金的结构至关重要。表面合金的结构特性已被广泛地从二维分布的表面原子到结构相关的性质进行详尽的调查。

        PtNi双金属催化剂的表面结构和反应性随着氧化还原处理温度的变化而波动，显示了这些催化剂的动态性质，受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响。这些因素在决定这些材料的催化性能和性能方面扮演着至关重要的角色。

        研究Re 3 Pt多晶合金的表面分离使用光电谱学的目的在于改善双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别关注Pt基系统，如Pt-3d合金。这些改进对于提高这些材料在不同应用中的催化性能和性能具有重要意义。

        热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置，特别是在Pt基系统，如Pt-3d合金。这些因素决定了氧气还原反应（ORR）效率的关键性，对于这些催化剂在各种应用中的性能至关重要。具体而言，金属表面的晶体平面影响ORR活性和亚表面稳定性。

        密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明了在两个金属表面之间受限的乙烷分子的几何和电子属性的变化，并且其转化成一个能够准备反应并形成聚合链的自由基阴离子单体。一个已知的限制效应对反应性的影响不仅适用于需要控制聚合的应用，而且也适用于寻求特定化学反应的应用。

        我们的发现提供了一个理论证明，即在电子和几何约束下的乙烯分子转换为自由基阴离子并可以在不使用引发剂的情况下启动聚合链。活性环境由当两个表面相距足够近时（大约0.6至0.4nm）发生的电子转移所造成。

        对于结果结构的能量解释，涉及两个成分之间的相互作用能量和分离能量，重要的是要知道它们是否是热力学稳定的，至少排除了基体溶解的可能性，或者它们代表了一种可能的过渡态和定义不清的配置。

        这些表面合金已经被结构上详细地表征，包括二维分布的表面原子，以及与（电）催化有关的结构特性得到了深入的研究。

        表面合金被限制在表面层中，与客体金属如Pt和Pd倾向于留在最外层的趋势相关联，受到动力学效应的影响，例如，层间交换的低壁垒，与宏观扩散相比。比较结果的表面结构与在Ru沉积之前的均衡表面合金表明了提出的问题的答案。如果存在强烈的分离倾向，Pd和Pt应浮起并在退火后形成与原始均衡表面合金相同的2D结构。

        这些表面合金的稳定性和分离趋势通过在均衡表面合金上沉积12ML的Ru层并随后退火来研究。埋藏金属物种的浮出已经在Ag同质外延在Sb/Ag(111)上的表面抗介导生长过程中观察到，或在向Ag、Au和Cu单晶表面上沉积各种金属时观察到。我们的观察与这些先前的机制预测进行了比较。

        NO2暴露于在120K下以饱和单层覆盖的(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金形成一个NN键合的N2O4二聚体，吸附在一个直立倾斜的几何形状上。这个二聚体在220至300K之间完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。氮氧化物(NO2)在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附已被通过温度程序脱附(TPD)、阿格电子能谱(AES)、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)和低能电子衍射(LEED)进行研究。

        然而，没有N2O4或NO2从单层状态分子地脱离。吸附的NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O在300至400K。在后者的条件下，吸附的氧气作为O2以三个清晰的脱附状态脱附。Sn AES峰的变化被用来跟踪Sn的氧化。NO2在220至300K之间在3合金上分解，释放表面氧气和共吸附的NO。表面氧气在3合金上氧化Sn在较高温度下。确定Sn1.5O物种与此结构的一致性与提议相符。使用XPS得出的结果表明，在UHV条件下，如本报告中研究的那样，Pt不受NO2反应的影响。

        Re 3 Pt多晶合金的表面分离研究旨在通过光电谱学提高双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别关注Pt基系统，如Pt-3d合金。这些改进对于提高这些材料在不同应用中的催化性能和性能具有重要意义。
