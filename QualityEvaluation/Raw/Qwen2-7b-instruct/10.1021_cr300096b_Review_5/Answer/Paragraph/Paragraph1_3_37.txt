        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov discusses the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, focusing on how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model further highlight the significant impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have profound implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. Extensive characterization of surface alloys includes the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing, providing insights into the mechanism of surface segregation.

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm. The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation, which dictate the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity.

        The oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures further illustrates the importance of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions in determining the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        In summary, the thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions play a pivotal role in shaping the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts across diverse applications. The detailed analysis and theoretical studies provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and pave the way for future research aimed at optimizing catalyst design and performance.
