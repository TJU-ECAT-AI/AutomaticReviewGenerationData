        Detailed analysis established from the study by Ruban, Skriver, and Nrskov \[1\], focusing on the surface segregation energies in transition-metal alloys, which significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys \[2\]. The theoretical study by \[3\] further elucidates the profound impact of thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions on the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, highlighting their catalytic properties and performance in various applications \[4\]. The formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surface of ternary alloys due to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency affects the binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl ions, leading to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces \[5\]. Moreover, these conditions lead to improved electrochemical stability, reducing the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface \[6\]. The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation \[7\]. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, controlling the distribution of metals on the surface \[8\]. The structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by manipulating the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, affecting their reactivity and selectivity \[9\].

        The confinement effect, resulting from the proximity of two metal surfaces, transforms ethylene into a radical anion monomer prepared for polymerization, exhibiting enhanced reactivity for both controlled polymerization and specific chemical reactions \[10\]. This process is enabled by electron transfer between the metal surfaces when they are in close proximity, typically within 0.6 to 0.4 nm \[11\].

        Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion \[12\]. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys. These surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated \[13\]. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing, further supporting the understanding of surface segregation \[14\].

        Thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt \[15\] predict the stability of subsurface 3d metal in Pt(111) and Pt(100) in oxygen, and the effect of the crystal plane on ORR activity, indicating that the crystal plane of the metal surface affects both the ORR activity and the subsurface stability of the catalysts \[16\].

        For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures, in terms of interaction energies between the two components and of the segregation energies, it is important to know whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when excluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metastable and possibly ill-defined configuration \[17\]. These surface alloys have already been characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and structure-related properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigated intensely \[18\].

        The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications. The stability of these catalysts is determined by the interaction energies between components and segregation energies \[19\]. Surface alloys, confined to the surface layer, are associated with the tendency of guest metals like Pt and Pd to remain in the outermost layer, influenced by kinetic effects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top two layers compared to bulk diffusion. This stability is crucial for maintaining the structure of surface alloys.

        Surface alloys have been extensively characterized structurally, including the 2D distribution of surface atoms, and their properties relevant to (electro-)catalysis have been thoroughly investigated. The tendency for surface segregation and stability of Pt-based surface alloys were studied by depositing a Ru layer on top of equilibrated surface alloys and then annealing. The floating of buried metals, akin to phenomena seen in surface ant-mediated growth or metal deposition on various single crystal surfaces, further supports the understanding of surface segregation.

        Observations are compared with previous mechanistic predictions, highlighting the island growth behavior during the initial deposition step, which is consistent with earlier reports. Quantitative analysis of STM images after surface alloy reformation yields specific compositions (Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001)) with a high degree of accuracy. The slight variations in stability can be attributed to the different contents of guest metals (44% Pd vs. 70% Pt).

        Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K forms an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift.

        The study of surface segregation of Re 3 Pt polycrystalline alloy with photoelectron spectroscopy \[20\] aims to improve the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, specifically in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These improvements have significant implications for enhancing the catalytic properties and performance of these materials across different applications \[21\].

        Oscillation of surface structure and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic catalysts with redox treatments at variable temperatures \[22\] reveals that thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to changes in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, affecting its catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

        In conclusion, the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications. The study highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms governing these properties to design more efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of industrial processes.
