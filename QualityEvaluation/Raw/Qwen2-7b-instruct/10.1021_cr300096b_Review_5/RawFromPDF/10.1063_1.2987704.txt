The surface segregation and electronic structure of
Re
3
Pt
polycrystalline alloy were investigated via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results from angle-resolved core-level XPS show the enrichment of Pt at the top surface layer upon annealing at
T
=
1200
K
⁠. The experimental results show excellent agreement with a theoretical model calculation, providing the element-specific depth profiles upon the high temperature annealing process. The presence of strong electron hybridization between Re and Pt is evident in the valence-band density-of-states ultraviolet photoemission spectra.

In the study of bimetallic catalysts, it is well known that the chemical reactivity and selectivity are strongly correlated to the geometric arrangement of the two metals.1,2 Also, the electronic properties of both metals are sometimes modified due to the presence of strong intermetallic bonding, which includes interactions of surface atoms with those in subsurface layers.3,4 Pt–Re bimetallic alloys have been highlighted in many studies due to their important roles in various catalytic applications, e.g., as electrocatalysts in low temperature fuel cells5 and as catalysts for petroleum refining for automotive fuels.6 A number of physical and chemical properties of Pt–Re alloys have been identified as contributing to the mechanism of the catalytic action, such as structural modification of Pt lattice due to Re,7 selective electro-oxidation of CO in

mixtures at Re sites,5 and changes in the chemical states of Pt and Re under the reaction conditions.8 However, a quantitative understanding of the surface segregation in this alloy is essential to identifying the mechanism of catalytic action in this bimetallic system. A theoretical study of surface segregation in Pt–Re bimetallic system was recently conducted by Wang et al.9 In their report, the surface segregation and core-shell structures of Pt–Re nanoparticles and
Re
3
Pt
bulk crystal surfaces were thoroughly examined with Monte Carlo simulation methods. Summarizing in brief, the formation of pure Pt “skin” layer is predicted in the case of the bulk crystal surfaces of
Re
3
Pt
alloys (hcp structures) and the large difference in the surface energy between the two elements was identified as the major driving force to the segregation of Pt on the outermost surface. In addition, the extent of Pt surface enrichment on various crystal facets was found to be correlated with the surface coordination numbers for each facet, i.e., the number of nearest neighbors. Also, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation has been extensively applied to unveil general stability of surface and subsurface structures for various bimetallic alloy systems.10 In the case of Pt

transition metal alloy systems, Menning and Chen11 presented the extensive systematic DFT calculations and experimental results of thermodynamics and kinetics of

metal segregation with the presence of oxygen.
In this report, the segregation of
Re
3
Pt
polycrystalline surfaces is studied with photoelectron spectroscopy. Core-level x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is employed to identify the surface depth profile as the segregation occurs. The intensity profiles of Pt and Re out of angle-resolved core-level XPS show the clear surface segregation of Pt on the top surface layers after high temperature annealing,
∼
1300
K
⁠, while the valence band (VB) density of states (DOS) from ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) show the evidence of strong electron hybridization between Re and Pt elements. The calculated XPS intensity profiles show excellent agreement with Monte Carlo calculation results9 on
Re

surface, providing surface depth profile information on Re3Pt polycrystalline surface upon high temperature annealing process.
The entire measurements are carried out in two separate ultrahigh vacuum chambers, both equipped with multiple stage axes manipulator, i.e.,
X
⁠,
Y
⁠,
Z
⁠, and theta
(
Θ
)
rotation. The angle-resolved XPS is performed using a
150
mm
mean radius hemispherical electron analyzer with a nine-channel detector (VG Microtech CLAM4 MCD) and a high intensity (up to
800
W
⁠) nonmonochromatized single anode
(
Mg
K
α
)
x-ray source is mounted at the magic angle with respect to the analyzer position. The sample is placed on the rotational axis of the manipulator, and the take-off angle is defined as 90°—polar angle
(
Θ
)
between the surface normal and the analyzer. The angular resolution of polar angle rotation is
±
1.1
°
⁠. For VB UPS measurement, the Advance Materials Chamber (AMC), located at beamline BL-9.3.2 of Advanced Light Source (ALS) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), is utilized. A hemispherical electron analyzer SES-100 (Gammadata Scienta) is used for the UPS measurements and the total energy resolution of the VB spectra is set to less than
∼
0.05
eV
⁠. The BL-9.3.2 is a bending magnet beamline equipped with a spherical grating monochromator, and details of beamline specifications can be found elsewhere.12 The base pressure of both UHV chambers is
∼

×

−
10
torr
⁠. The sample is provided by Matek, Inc., and its composition ratio is checked using Auger electron spectroscopy measurement. To achieve contamination free surface, the sample is treated with repeated cycles of argon ion bombardments and annealing at
1000
K
until no signals of C

s
and O

are present from core-level XPS. For the ion-bombardment process, the argon pressure is adjusted to
1
×
10
−
6

and the energy of ion is set to
500
eV
with emission current of
20
mA
⁠. The method of electron-beam heating with high voltage is applied to raise the temperatures of sample and the sample temperature is monitored by optical pyrometer.
In Fig. 1(a), the Pt

and Re

core-level spectra at surface normal emission are shown upon the sputtering and annealing processes, respectively. The contributions of satellite peaks due to nonmonochromatized x-ray source can be seen in the right-hand side of the main peaks. To have a clear comparison, two spectra are normalized to maximum signal of Re

f
peak. Figure 1(a) clearly shows that the annealing process contributes to the enhancement of Pt
4
f
signals compared to sputtered surface, showing the sign of the Pt enrichment on the surface. In order to achieve further information on Pt and Re distributions near surface, i.e., the element-specific surface depth profiles, each core-level peaks, Pt
4
f
and Re
4
f
⁠, are measured as the electron take-off angles are varied from surface normal to 30°. Due to the intrinsic nature of short inelastic mean-free path of electrons, the surface sensitivity of photoelectron signal is significantly enhanced at low electron take-off angle. In Fig. 1(b), the intensity ratios of Pt
4
f
and Re

f
peaks from each different surfaces are plotted as a function of electron take-off angle. While the sputtered surface shows almost little changes throughout all take-off angles, the annealed surface shows dramatic changes as the take-off angle becomes small, i.e., a clear evidence of Pt segregations on the top surface layer upon the annealing process. As mentioned above, this surface segregation of Pt on
Re

nanoparticles after annealing at high temperature is predicted with the theoretical study of Wang et al.9 With Monte Carlo simulations, the segregation profiles of Pt in extended surfaces for disordered hcp

  As a next step, to investigate further on the degrees of Pt segregations near the surface and to test out the results of theoretical Monte Carlo simulation, the depth-dependent photoelectron intensities are calculated based on the predicted Monte Carlo simulation results.9 Special software is utilized for the calculations of depth-dependent (varying take-off angles) photoelectron intensities of each element, Re

and Pt

peaks. The software includes various important parameters in calculating photoemission intensities, such as the differential photoelectron cross sections, the inelastic electron attenuation lengths, and geometrical setting on incoming x ray and analyzer. The details of software can be found elsewhere.13 The calculated intensities are directly compared to experimental results, as shown in Fig. 2. The adapted modeling parameters, which are the theoretical Monte Carlo simulation results, are shown in Table I. In Fig. 2, it is clear that model B shows the closest agreement with the experimental results, indicating the polycrystalline surface carries more

surface upon the annealing process.

To monitor the changes in the electronic structures near the surface as Pt segregation progresses, the VB photoemission spectra are observed. The measured VB photoemission spectra are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the annealing temperatures. The incident photon energy is set to
90
eV
⁠. Various photon energies are applied and fine features of VB spectrum are more pronounced with
90
eV
photon energy. The Shirley background is subtracted as an inelastic background correction. To identify the contributions of each element to the total density of states on
Re
3
Pt
alloy surface, VB spectra of Re(0001) and Pt polycrystalline at identical photon energy are shown together. The acceptance angle of electron analyzer is set to
±
5
°
and the measured VB spectra are close to the total DOS. In the case of Re(0001) VB spectrum, the two sharp peaks noted at
0.8
eV
(
S
2
)
and
1.8
eV
(
S

)
are the surface states, while the broad features near
2.0
eV
(
R
2
)
and
4.2
eV
(
R

)
are the bulk bands from Re
5

and

hybridization.14 From the Pt polycrystalline VB spectrum,
5
d
bulk band features can be seen clearly at near
2.0
eV
(
P
2
)
and
4.0
eV
(
P
1
)
⁠. From the first look at VB spectrum of sputtered surface, two broad features near
5.0
eV
(A) and
2.0
eV
(B) are the only distinguishable peaks. Due to the heavy dealloying effect, it is rather difficult to localize the contribution of each element separately on sputtered surface. As the temperature is increased, the significant reductions in the spectra weight at peak A of alloy can be noticed while the spectra intensities near B remained unchanged throughout the entire spectra. When the temperature of
1200
K
is reached, a clear enhancement in the spectral weight near
4.0
eV
can be observed, where a
P
1
bulk band of Pt is located (shown with dotted line). This observation possibly indicates that Pt segregates on the top surface as sample is being annealed, which is identical to the results from the above angle-resolved XPS data. However, considering both the surface sensitivity of UPS signals and the formation of Pt skin layer upon annealing, the observed VB spectra at high temperature do not resemble the one from Pt polycrystalline surface, suggesting the presence of strong hybridization between the Pt and Re, i.e., ligand effect. Even though it is rather difficult to quantify the degrees of segregation from VB spectra, the band widths and positions of band center provide the qualitative information on the changes in the measured VB spectra. In Table II,15 the calculated positions of
d
-band center and the widths are shown. As the temperature of sample is increased, the positions of
d
-band center move close to the Fermi level while its width becomes narrower, which is more closer to Pt polycrystalline VB spectrum than Re VB spectrum.

polycrystalline surfaces is examined with photoelectron spectroscopy. With the measurements of angle-resolved core-level XPS, the intensity profiles of Pt and Re show the clear surface segregation of Pt on the top surface layers after high temperature annealing at
