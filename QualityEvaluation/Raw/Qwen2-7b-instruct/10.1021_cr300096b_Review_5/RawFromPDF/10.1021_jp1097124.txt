Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show changes in geometric and electronic properties of an ethylene molecule confined between two metal surfaces and its conversion into a radical anion monomer ready to react, forming a polymer chain. Here we demonstrate the evolution of the molecular properties under confinement, as well as that of the metal surfaces, and the optimum range of surface−surface separation that allows the production of the radical anion and the dimerization reaction. The effect of an electron donor surface on the already known confinement effect on reactivity is useful not only in many applications where a controlled polymerization is desired but also where specific chemical reactions are sought.

1 Introduction
Let us imagine water molecules having a different geometry, for example, an H−O−H angle of 180°. For sure the world as we know it would be totally different. This hypothetical situation can become real when molecules are under geometric and electronic confinement. Because of these effects molecules may change their geometry and electronic distribution, making new reaction mechanisms and unusual chemical reactions possible. (1-4)
There are several studies about confinement effects in atoms and molecules. The first confined hydrogen atom model was introduced in 1937. (5) Since then, more accurate solutions have been reported for the confined hydrogen atom problem, (6, 7) as well as studies of the effect of confinement in other elements such as helium, (8) and changes have been predicted and observed in molecular orbitals of more complex molecules, such as ethylene, (2) anthracene, (1) and toluene (9) inside of zeolites. There are many fields interested on the properties of confinement systems such as semiconductors, (10) thermodynamics of systems under extreme pressure, (5) and catalysis. (2, 11) The interest is driven by the fact that specific properties and/or reactions can be facilitated by varying the degree or nature of confinement. In our recent work we showed that electronic and geometric properties of metallic surfaces interacting through a gap of 0.4 to about 1 nm change significantly as a function of the surface−surface separation. These confinement-induced electronic and geometrical surface variations were explored for the dissociation of molecular oxygen (3) and water, (4) and it was concluded that devices based on the underlying concept can be designed for specific applications by tuning alloy composition and surface separation. (3)
In this paper, we address a question similar to that in Corma's group earlier work: (2) Can ethylene confined be electronically and geometrically modified favoring the formation of polyethylene? However, differing with previous works, (12) the geometric confinement arises from electron-donor (transition metal) surfaces that play a vital role on the observed molecular changes. Thus, to induce electronic confinement, we examine a gap created between parallel slabs each exposing a monolayer of Ti over a Pt core (Ti/Pt). An ethylene molecule was located in the middle of the gap defined by the Ti/Pt surfaces and relaxed at different surface−surface separations, starting from two different initial configurations. Our findings provide a theoretical demonstration that the ethylene molecule under electronic and geometric confinement is converted into a radical anion and can initiate the polymerization chain without the need of an initiator. This concept is useful in a variety of applications ranging from a controlled polymerization (13, 14) and surface coating and more generally to produce specific radicals and/or unusual chemical reactions by appropriate tuning of the surface properties.
2 Computational Methods
Calculations were performed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). (15-18) Electron-ion interactions are described using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, (19) expanded within a plane wave basis setting up a cutoff energy of 400 eV. Electron exchange and correlation effects were described by the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) (20) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type exchange correlation functional. Spin polarization was included in every simulation. Figure 1 illustrates the system, taken as infinite in the x and y directions and finite in z direction. It consists of a periodically repeated fcc Pt slab covered in the top and in the bottom surfaces by a monolayer of a Ti metal; the systems were modeled using 4 × 4 supercells. The slabs are composed by six layers; the top and bottom layers are allowed to relax, whereas the two layers in the middle are fixed, on the assumption that they represent a “bulk”. Because of the periodic boundary conditions used in the three spatial directions, the top (111) surface is separated a distance H from another (111) surface, the bottom layer of the slab in the top neighboring cell. Such H distance is varied to evaluate specific properties as discussed below. The optimum bulk lattice constant of Pt was determined as 3.98 Å, a value 1.45% higher than the experimental (3.92 Å). (21) Brillouin zone integration for the surface system was performed using a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst Pack grid (22) and a Methfessel−Paxton (23) smearing of 0.2 eV, whereas for the molecules in gas phase a 1 × 1 × 1 Monkhorst Pack grid was employed. The convergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent iteration and the ionic relaxation loop were set to 10−4 eV and 10−3 eV, respectively.
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) A gap of dimension H, which is defined every two slabs. Each slab has four central layers of fcc Pt (gray) covered on top and bottom by a monolayer of Ti (blue). Each of the Ti monolayers and the Pt subsurface layers are allowed to relax; the two central Pt layers are fixed. (b) Ethylene molecule with labels of atoms and angles used for the description of Figure 2 and Tables 1 and 2. The relaxed gas phase ethylene molecule has the following bond distances and angles: C−C = 1.33 Å, H−C = 1.09 Å, H−C−C = 121.78°, H−C−H = 116.44°. Initial locations for confined C2H4: horizontal (c) and vertical position (d). In both cases, the initial C−C and C−H distances and angles correspond to the equilibrium C2H4 gas phase geometry.
After relaxing the Ti/Pt surface at a given H surface−surface separation without any adsorbate and the ethylene molecule in gas phase, both optimized systems were combined. The ethylene molecule was located in the middle of the gap between surfaces. Two cases were studied, with ethylene in horizontal and in vertical position, as shown in Figure 1.
The total electronic charge of an atom was obtained using Bader analysis, (24, 25) where the atomic charge is approximated by the charge enclosed within the Bader volume defined by zero flux surfaces. The d-band centers are referenced to the Fermi level; they were calculated from the site-projected electronic DOS using a k-point mesh of 16 × 16 × 1.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Geometric and Electronic Effects of Ethylene under Confinement
Figure 2 shows the distances and angles of the ethylene molecule after relaxation for each initial configuration at various values of surface−surface separation H. For ethylene initially located in horizontal position, H < 6.5 Å induces a significant change in the molecular geometry that as discussed below goes along with significant electronic changes. In contrast, very little changes are observed in the geometry of ethylene initially in vertical position (especially in the CC and CH distances), relative to gas phase ethylene.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Geometric evolution of the confined ethylene molecule as a function of surface−surface separation (H) between Ti/Pt surfaces. The vertical axes correspond to angles and interatomic distances at different H values for ethylene initially in horizontal position (left) and for that initially located in vertical position (right).
The final geometries in each case are shown in Figure 3. The ethylene molecule (initially in horizontal location) under the confinement of Ti/Pt surfaces is converted into a radical. The electronic charges shown in Table 1 reveal that electrons are transferred from the surface to the confined space and localized on the carbon atoms. As confinement increases, the total charges show the extra electrons on the ethylene molecule when it is converted into a radical anion.

Right: final geometry of the molecule initially located in vertical position at H = 6.08 Å. Very small changes are observed in this case with respect to the gas phase geometry.

aThe bottom row corresponds to the total charge of ethylene, and it is the total extra electrons that the surfaces have transferred to the molecule. The values correspond to relaxed ethylene initially located in the horizontal position (Figure 1c).
In contrast, the atomic charges of the molecule initially located in the vertical location (Table 2) are much smaller, although some electron localization is also observed at the lowest values of H. However, as confinement increases (H < 6.08 Å), the H atoms become attached to each of the surfaces, and eventually they could be separated from the original molecule. We do not discuss here such a reaction that could also have other interesting consequences.

To understand the electronic changes in the ethylene molecule we analyze the frontier molecular orbitals for the gas phase and confined molecules. The results are shown in Figure 4. This diagram shows that the energy gap, defined as the difference between the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and that of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), is 7.45 eV in the gas phase molecule and is reduced to 5.33 eV for the confined ethylene started in horizontal position. Thus, the energy of the π* antibonding orbital of the confined molecule becomes much closer to the corresponding π bonding orbital. On the other hand, the energy gap of confined ethylene in the vertical location remains very similar (7.37 eV) to that of the gas phase molecule. Essentially, our findings are in agreement with those of the simpler model proposed by Corma and Zicovich-Wilson. (2) The reduction of the HOMO−LUMO gap suggests the enhanced reactivity of the confined molecule.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Molecular orbital diagrams showing energies of HOMO and LUMO for ethylene (left), horizontal confined ethylene, H = 4.85 Å (center), and vertical confined ethylene, H = 6.08 Å (right). The energy difference (Δ) between the π orbital (HOMO) of confined ethylene relative to the free molecule and that between the π* orbital (LUMO) of confined ethylene relative to the free molecule are shown, as well as the HOMO−LUMO gaps in each case.
In contrast, the work of Borgoo et al. (26) finds exactly the opposite trend, with the HOMO−LUMO gap increasing as confinement increases. However, as remarked by the authors, their study does not include the interaction between the molecule and the confinement medium. Thus, in our complex system includingthe molecule + confinement medium the analysis has three components: one is the effect of confinement on the molecule (as given by the work of Borgoo et al.), and another is the electronic effect of the two clean interacting surfaces; the third is the interaction of the confined molecule with the interacting surfaces, and this last one yields the HOMO−LUMO trend as reported in our work and in refs 1 and 9.
Therefore, the described molecular properties are induced not only by geometric confinement but by the strong electron-donor character of the surfaces. As reported recently, the electronic structure of the metallic skin-surface is affected by electronic confinement. (3, 4) To investigate this, we look at the density of states (DOS) of the surface atoms (first exposed layer of Ti atoms).
Figure 5 shows the d-band DOS for the clean surface atoms at various values of the surface−surface separation H. Note that, when H becomes small enough, the two surfaces collapse (avalanche effect) (27) and the system becomes a “bulk” metal. Thus, changes in the electronic distribution observed in Figure 5 are due to a transition between a system consisting of two interacting surfaces and a bulk. Two major changes are observed in the DOS as a function of surface−surface separation: the values of the DOS corresponding to the peaks of the majority and minority d states (see arrows in Figure 5), and the exchange splitting (energy difference between DOS maxima of the spin-up and spin-down peaks at each side of the Fermi level); they both diminish as the surface−surface separation gets shorter. The first change represents the broadening of the d-band as the two surfaces become closer to each other; the difference in exchange splitting is directly related to the magnetic properties of the thin Ti film due to its interactions with Pt. (28-31) The net result is an enhancement of surface activity and the modification of other surface physical properties such as the magnetic moment. For the Ti/Pt clean surfaces, we observed charge transfer from Ti to Pt. The interaction of the Ti monolayer over the Pt core produces a strong polarization of the film, with positive charges of the order of 0.47 e on the Ti layer and an average of −0.43 e in the Pt layer in contact with the surface Ti layer. This surface polarization effect has been detected previously by experiments and computations. (32-34) However, there is very little change in the charge distribution as the surface−surface separation varies, indicating that the observed modifications in the DOS and exchange splitting do not translate in higher polarization, but rather in a broadening of the d-states and a decrease of the number of electrons available at the Fermi level, due to the enhanced interactions of the two surfaces.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Density of states (DOS) of clean Ti/Pt surfaces separated by a gap of 12.11, 5.43, and 4.85 Å. Their respective d-band centers are 0.029, 0.766, and 0.756 eV; they are all located at the right of the Fermi level located at 0 eV. Arrows point to the majority and minority DOS peaks where the largest changes are observed as the surface−surface separation varies.
The same phenomena are analyzed in the presence of ethylene. As shown in Figure 6, similarly to the clean surface features, the main effects at a given surface−surface separation are the reduction of the DOS at the prominent peaks in the majority and minority d states and that of the exchange splitting. Figure 6 shows this ethylene “finger print” at various surface−surface separations. At H = 12.11 Å the surfaces practically do not interact with the ethylene molecule so no changes are detected between the clean surface DOS and that in the presence of ethylene. On the other hand, at H = 5.43 Å and H = 4.85 Å the DOS at the peaks in the majority d states (left peaks) diminish from 26.62 to 22.62 and from 22.52 to 19.35, respectively; the peaks in the minority d states (right peaks) diminish from 21.69 to 19.99 and from 17.96 to 16.90 at H = 5.43 Å and H = 4.85 Å, respectively. Following similar trends, the exchange splitting diminishes from 0.75 to 0.69 eV and from 0.61 to 0.58 eV at H = 5.43 Å and H = 4.85 Å, respectively. These modifications in the surface DOS are due to the surface−ethylene electronic interaction; thus, they are expected to be unique for a specific surface−molecule interaction, suggesting that this phenomenon may be suited for sensor applications.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Prominent peaks from the DOS of the clean surface (red peaks) and in the presence of ethylene (black peaks) at different surface−surface separations. The left peaks are from the majority of d states and the right peaks from the minority of d states. Changes in the peak DOS and exchange splitting are due to the electronic interaction between both surfaces and also between the Ti/Pt surface and ethylene.
An investigation of the charge distribution indicates that a similar polarization effect as the one detected in the clean surfaces is observed in the presence of ethylene. The average charges of the metal surface and subsurface layers are approximately 0.50 e and −0.43 e, respectively, whereas the average net charge in the molecule is −0.22 e at H = 4.85 Å, whereas at 12.11 Å the charge distribution in the surface layers resembles that of the clean surfaces and the net molecular charge is zero. Thus, again we can conclude that the surface polarization is less affected by the change in the surface−surface separation, while the charge transfer to the molecule is enhanced due to the increased availability of surface electrons in the gap when the two surfaces become closer to each other.
3.2 Dimerization
As discussed above, analyses of the results of the relaxed geometry and charge density suggest that the horizontal ethylene under confinement becomes an anionic radical suited for polymerization, since its geometry and electronic properties are similar to the unit of a polyethylene chain. Figure 7 shows two anionic radicals with the geometry obtained under confinement. Rotating the radical, it is possible to find a favorable location for reaction since carbon−carbon interaction can occur without the interference of H−H repulsion to favor the dimer formation.
Figure 7
Figure 7. (a) Two anion radicals obtained from exposing ethylene molecules to electronic and geometric confinement. (b) Dimer obtained after relaxation of the initial geometries.
After relaxing both radicals initially located as shown in Figure 7, a dimer is formed, which may react with another radical to increase the chain length. The same reaction mechanism was evaluated under confinement. Two ethylene molecules with the geometry obtained after confined relaxation were located as shown in Figure 8 at H = 5.43, 5.77, and 6.08 Å between Ti/Pt surfaces. After relaxation, the dimer chain is formed indicating the feasibility of polymerization under confinement (Figure 8).
Figure 8
Figure 8. Relaxed polyethylene dimer molecules under various extents of confinement.
The charge analysis of polyethylene dimer under confinement supports its feasibility for continuous growth. The carbon atoms located in the extremes of the dimer bear a considerable excess of electrons in comparison with the other carbon and hydrogen atoms (Table 3). The sum of charges of all atoms reported in Table 3 shows the extra electrons on the dimer anion radical transferred from the Ti/Pt surfaces.

4 Conclusions
Our density functional theory studies have shown that the confinement effect produced by the proximity of two metal surfaces induces a reactive environment which converts ethylene in an anion radical that adopts the geometry of the monomer in a polyethylene chain and is ready to react, initiating the polymerization chain. The reactive environment is caused by electron transfer from the two surfaces when they are separated by sufficiently short distances in the order of 0.6−0.4 nm.
We remark that, whereas the extensively studied adsorption of ethylene on a single transition metal surface (35-37) is mainly driven by bonding of the π electrons to the metal sites, in this work we report a different phenomenon that is the conversion of ethylene into a radical anion, and this is exclusively caused by the interaction of the two surfaces, which we prove by taking the system to the limit of noninteracting surfaces. We have explained in Figures 5 and 6 what the electronic changes caused by confinement on the clean system formed by the two interacting surfaces are and how it induces changes on the molecule located in the gap. Besides controlled polymerization, we suggest that this enhanced reactivity may be useful for promoting many other chemical reactions with much lower barriers than those needed to be overcome on single catalytic surfaces.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) A gap of dimension H, which is defined every two slabs. Each slab has four central layers of fcc Pt (gray) covered on top and bottom by a monolayer of Ti (blue). Each of the Ti monolayers and the Pt subsurface layers are allowed to relax; the two central Pt layers are fixed. (b) Ethylene molecule with labels of atoms and angles used for the description of Figure 2 and Tables 1 and 2. The relaxed gas phase ethylene molecule has the following bond distances and angles: C−C = 1.33 Å, H−C = 1.09 Å, H−C−C = 121.78°, H−C−H = 116.44°. Initial locations for confined C2H4: horizontal (c) and vertical position (d). In both cases, the initial C−C and C−H distances and angles correspond to the equilibrium C2H4 gas phase geometry.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Geometric evolution of the confined ethylene molecule as a function of surface−surface separation (H) between Ti/Pt surfaces. The vertical axes correspond to angles and interatomic distances at different H values for ethylene initially in horizontal position (left) and for that initially located in vertical position (right).
Figure 3
Figure 3. Relaxed ethylene molecules under confinement. Left: molecule initially located in horizontal position at H = 5.43 Å. The final geometry is similar to a monomer in the polyethylene chain. Right: final geometry of the molecule initially located in vertical position at H = 6.08 Å. Very small changes are observed in this case with respect to the gas phase geometry.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Molecular orbital diagrams showing energies of HOMO and LUMO for ethylene (left), horizontal confined ethylene, H = 4.85 Å (center), and vertical confined ethylene, H = 6.08 Å (right). The energy difference (Δ) between the π orbital (HOMO) of confined ethylene relative to the free molecule and that between the π* orbital (LUMO) of confined ethylene relative to the free molecule are shown, as well as the HOMO−LUMO gaps in each case.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Density of states (DOS) of clean Ti/Pt surfaces separated by a gap of 12.11, 5.43, and 4.85 Å. Their respective d-band centers are 0.029, 0.766, and 0.756 eV; they are all located at the right of the Fermi level located at 0 eV. Arrows point to the majority and minority DOS peaks where the largest changes are observed as the surface−surface separation varies.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Prominent peaks from the DOS of the clean surface (red peaks) and in the presence of ethylene (black peaks) at different surface−surface separations. The left peaks are from the majority of d states and the right peaks from the minority of d states. Changes in the peak DOS and exchange splitting are due to the electronic interaction between both surfaces and also between the Ti/Pt surface and ethylene.
