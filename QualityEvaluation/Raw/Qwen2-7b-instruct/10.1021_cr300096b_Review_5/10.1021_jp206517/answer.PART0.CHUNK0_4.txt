<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions greatly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors cause alterations in the catalyst's activity and selectivity, which in turn affect its catalytic properties and performance across different applications.
