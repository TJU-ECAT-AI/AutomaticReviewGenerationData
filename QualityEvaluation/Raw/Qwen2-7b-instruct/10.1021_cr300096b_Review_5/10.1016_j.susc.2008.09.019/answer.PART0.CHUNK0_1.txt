Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the electronic structure of the surface. This, in turn, impacts the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For example, the presence of oxygen leads to a modification in the surface electronic structure, which can be attributed to the oxygen chemisorption energy. This energy correlation explains the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across late transition metals. Additionally, the use of bimetallic systems allows for the modification of the surface electronic structure, leading to favorable catalytic properties due to interfacial interactions and strain effects. The small lattice mismatch between Pt and Fe in Pt/Fe bimetallic systems, as demonstrated in previous calculations, contributes to the stability of the catalyst under various conditions. Furthermore, the adsorption model used in the study represents single crystal surfaces exposed to gas-phase oxygen, which provides insights into the surface behavior under fuel cell operating conditions. Lastly, the calculated workfunction change upon oxygen adsorption helps explain the weakened binding of oxygen on Pt/Fe bimetallic systems compared to pure Pt surfaces, offering a deeper understanding of the differences in catalytic properties between the two systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过影响表面电子结构，从而影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置。这种影响进一步决定了各种应用中的催化特性和性能。例如，氧的存在导致表面电子结构的修改，这可以归因于氧吸附能。这种能量相关性解释了Pt3M电极在晚期过渡金属上的火山形状依赖性的特定活性。此外，使用双金属体系允许修改表面电子结构，从而由于界面相互作用和应变效应导致有利的催化特性。证明Pt与Fe之间存在很小的晶格失配的计算结果，对于催化剂在各种条件下的稳定性提供了贡献。此外，用于研究的吸附模型代表了暴露于气体相氧气的单晶表面，为燃料电池运行条件下的表面行为提供见解。最后，计算得到的清洁Pt（0 0 1）表面在桥接氧上的工作函数变化帮助解释了Pt/Fe双金属系统中氧结合力较弱与纯Pt表面之间的差异，从而为理解两个系统中催化性质的差异提供了更深入的理解。
