[1] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure."
[2] "One non-trivial concern however for Pt3M would be the small reduction in Pt content compared to standard Pt loading as such Pt-based alloy systems are still generally rich in Pt."
[3] "Aside from significantly lowering Pt content, ultra thin bimetallic films exhibit modified surface electronic structure towards favorable catalytic property due to interfacial interactions."
[4] "It is known that this adsorption model represents single crystal surfaces exposed to gas-phase oxygen, and not to the fuel cell operating conditions."
[5] "The observed favorable catalytic activity is partly ascribed to decreased PtOH formation as a result of changes in the d-band properties of Pt due to its interaction with Pd."
[6] "Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points."
[7] "This decrease in workfunction of the bimetallic system verifies the electron shifting away from Pt nuclei towards the substrate."
[8] "So the role of the peak of d states (specifically due to the contribution of the spin polarization of dzz (the orbital protruding perpendicularly outward the surface) discussed previously, is noted."
[9] "We, thus, see that the differences in the localization of O-2p states play significant role in understanding the differences in the binding energies of O at these high symmetry sites."
[10] "Obviously, O is strongly localized on the bridge than for the other two configurations."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by affecting the electronic structure of the surface. This includes factors like the presence of surface electronic states, charge transfer between the metal components, and the modification of the d-band properties of Pt due to its interaction with other metals. These changes lead to altered catalytic properties and performance in applications such as fuel cells. The localized bonding of adsorbates, like oxygen, plays a significant role in determining their binding energies on the surface. The localized bonding enhances the efficiency of electron back donation from the metal to the adsorbate, affecting the catalytic activity. The d-band center model explains the weakened binding of adsorbates in bimetallic systems, which is expected due to the downward shift in the d-band center energy. The lattice mismatch and interfacial interactions are crucial factors that influence the electronic structure and catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，通过影响表面的电子结构。这包括表面电子状态的存在、金属组件之间的电荷转移以及Pt与其他金属的相互作用导致的Pt的d带性质变化等因素。这些改变导致了催化特性和在燃料电池等应用中的性能的变化。吸附物（如氧）的局部结合在决定其在表面的结合能中起着重要作用。局部结合提高了金属向吸附剂进行电子回授的效率，从而影响催化活性。d带中心模型解释了双金属体系中吸附剂结合力减弱的现象，这是由于d带中心能量向下移动所预期的。晶格失配和界面相互作用是影响双金属催化剂的电子结构和催化性能的关键因素。
