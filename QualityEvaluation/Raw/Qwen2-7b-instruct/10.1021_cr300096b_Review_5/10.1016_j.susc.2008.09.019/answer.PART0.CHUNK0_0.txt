[1] "Stamenkovic et al. in their combined experimental and theoretical studies, have explained the volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across the late transition metals (Ni  Ti) in terms of oxygen chemisorption energy resulting to a correlation between catalytic activity for ORR with variation in surface electronic structure."
[2] "Aside from significantly lowering Pt content, ultra thin bimetallic films exhibit modified surface electronic structure towards favorable catalytic property due to interfacial interactions."
[3] "The observed favorable catalytic activity is partly ascribed to decreased PtOH formation as a result of changes in the d-band properties of Pt due to its interaction with Pd."
[4] "Sasaki et al. reported increase in d-band vacancy of the deposited Pt submonolayer on Ru electrocatalyst caused by PtRu interaction."
[5] "It is true that this adsorption model represents single crystal surfaces exposed to gas-phase oxygen, and not to the fuel cell operating conditions."

1. The volcano-shape dependence of specific activity of Pt3M electrodes across late transition metals (Ni, Ti) is explained by Stamenkovic et al. through oxygen chemisorption energy, establishing a correlation between catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and variations in surface electronic structure.
2. Ultra-thin bimetallic films reduce Pt content while exhibiting modified surface electronic structures that favor catalytic properties, primarily due to interfacial interactions.
3. The favorable catalytic activity of Pt-based systems is partly attributed to decreased formation of PtOH, which results from changes in the d-band properties of Pt influenced by its interaction with other metals like Pd.
4. Sasaki et al. observed an increase in d-band vacancy in the deposited Pt submonolayer on a Ru electrocatalyst, indicating enhanced interaction between Pt and Ru.
5. The adsorption model described represents single crystal surfaces exposed to gas-phase oxygen, not the operational conditions of fuel cells.
6. The Pt local magnetic moment is directly related to the O atom that binds to it, indicating a specific interaction between the two elements.
7. Upon oxygen adsorption, the Pt surface with O on the bridge site exhibits a 0.25 eV increase in workfunction, suggesting a significant charge transfer to the oxygen molecule.
8. The charge transfer to oxygen upon adsorption is quantified at 0.90 e, as determined through the same analysis methods used previously.

1. Stamenkovic等人通过氧气化学吸附能解释了Pt3M电极在晚期过渡金属（Ni，Ti）中的火山形状依赖性活动，建立了催化活性与表面电子结构变化之间的相关性。
2. 超薄双金属薄膜通过界面相互作用表现出有利于催化性能的修改表面电子结构，同时显著降低了铂含量。
3. 铂基系统中观察到的有利催化活性部分归因于由于铂与其他金属如Pd的相互作用导致的铂OH形成减少，从而改变了铂的d带性质。
4. Sasaki等人在Ru电催化剂上观察到沉积的铂亚单层中d带空隙增加，表明了铂与Ru之间增强的相互作用。
5. 描述的吸附模型代表了暴露在气相氧下的单晶表面，而不是燃料电池的操作条件。
6. 直接与O原子结合的铂原子的磁矩表明了两者之间的特定相互作用。
7. 在氧吸附后，位于桥位的铂表面的功函数增加了0.25 eV，这表明对氧分子的显著电荷转移。
8. 通过之前使用的方法分析确定，吸附氧时的电荷转移量为0.90 e。
