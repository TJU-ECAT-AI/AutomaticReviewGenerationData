[1] "The goal of significantly lowering Pt content in fuel cell cathode catalyst has attracted researchers to consider adlayer structures on less expensive metal substrates."
[2] "Very recently, Pt monolayer on Pd(1 1 1) was found to show increased catalytic activity than Pt bulk and Pt nanoparticles while lowering Pt loading up to 90%."
[3] "Aside from significantly lowering Pt content, ultra thin bimetallic films exhibit modified surface electronic structure towards favorable catalytic property due to interfacial interactions."
[4] "The observed favorable catalytic activity is partly ascribed to decreased PtOH formation as a result of changes in the d-band properties of Pt due to its interaction with Pd."
[5] "The theoretical studies have proposed the change in the electronic properties of the metal adlayer which in turn results to a change in its reactivity to be attributable to the formation of surface metal-metal bond which include shifts of core levels due to charge transfer between monolayer and the substrate."
[6] "Others include change in density of states near the Fermi level."
[7] "Since both critical factors, strain effects and interfacial interaction, occur simultaneously in bimetallic systems, models with very small lattice mismatch between components may be good starting points."
[8] "This adsorption model represents single crystal surfaces exposed to gas-phase oxygen, and not to the fuel cell operating conditions."
[9] "Nevertheless, the paper presents significant information on bimetallic surface oxidation which may form basis for further gas-surface interaction studies."
[10] "The Pt atom used to show Pt local magnetic moment is that which directly binds to O."
[11] "The results on adsorption energies show that the bridge is the energetically most preferred site, followed by the hollow, then the top."
[12] "In this system, we may think of other crucial factors that govern O chemisorption other than O-adsorbed electron donation to surface Pt atoms."
[13] "Also, the most energetically preferred site (bridge) is a bit surprising as one would expect O to sit on highly coordinated site (fourfold hollows) on Pt surface."
[14] "Obviously, O is strongly localized on the bridge than for the other two configurations."
[15] "We then suggest that in such localized bonding, the Ptd electrons back donation to the adsorbed O may be seen more efficient."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These influences lead to modifications in the electronic structure of the catalyst surface, enhancing its catalytic properties. By considering adlayer structures on less expensive metal substrates, researchers aim to lower the content of precious metals like Pt. For instance, a monolayer of Pt on Pd(1 1 1) has shown increased catalytic activity compared to bulk Pt and nanoparticles, while reducing Pt loading up to 90%. The interactions between the Pt monolayer and the substrate can lead to shifts in core levels due to charge transfer, modifying the density of states near the Fermi level, and influencing the electronic properties of the metal adlayer. The lattice mismatch between components in bimetallic systems plays a crucial role in the formation of surface metal-metal bonds, affecting the catalytic activity. The adsorption model of oxygen on bimetallic surfaces, though not representative of the fuel cell operating conditions, provides insights into bimetallic surface oxidation and gas-surface interactions. The localized bonding of oxygen on the bridge site, despite being less coordinated, exhibits enhanced back donation of Ptd electrons to the adsorbed oxygen, contributing to the observed decreased binding strength of oxygen on bimetallic systems compared to pure Pt surfaces.

热力学偏好和反应条件可以显著影响双金属催化剂，尤其是以Pt为基础的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置。这些影响导致催化剂表面电子结构的修改，从而增强其催化性能。通过在成本较低的金属基底上考虑吸附层结构，研究人员旨在降低贵重金属如Pt的含量。例如，Pt单层在Pd(1 1 1)上的应用显示了与纯态Pt、纳米颗粒相比增加的催化活性，并且降低了90%的Pt负载。Pt层与基底之间的相互作用可能导致核心能级的位移，从而改变金属吸附层的密度状态，影响其电子性质。双金属体系中组件之间的小晶格失配在表面金属-金属键的形成中起着关键作用，影响催化活性。吸附模型提供了关于双金属表面氧化和气-表面相互作用的见解。尽管氧气在双金属表面上的吸附模型不完全代表燃料电池的操作条件，但其为双金属表面氧化提供了一定的基础信息。氧在桥接位置的局部结合，尽管结合点较少，但表现出对吸附氧的Ptd电子更强的回授捐赠，这有助于解释在双金属系统中观察到的氧结合强度比纯Pt表面弱的原因。
