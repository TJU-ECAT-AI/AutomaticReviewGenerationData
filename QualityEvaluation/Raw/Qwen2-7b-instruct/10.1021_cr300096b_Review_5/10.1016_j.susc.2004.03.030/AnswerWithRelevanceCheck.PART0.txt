          [1] "NO2 exposures to produce a saturation monolayer coverage on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K form an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry."
          [2] "The dimer completely dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface."
          [3] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
          [4] "However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state."
          [5] "Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K."
          [6] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states."
          [7] "Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation."
          [8] "Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO."
          [9] "Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures."
          [10] "Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal."
          [11] "Previous results using XPS conclude that Pt is not oxidized by reactions of NO2 on the 3 alloy under UHV conditions such as those investigated in this report."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like the Pt-3d alloys. NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This structure undergoes complete dissociation between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. The adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states. The Sn oxidation process is monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift. The catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。NO2暴露导致在表面上形成一个直立、NN键合的N2O4二聚体吸附在一个倾斜的角度。这种结构在220至300 K之间的温度下完全分解，释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO。吸附的NO2在较高温度下进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O。吸附的氧以三个清晰的脱附状态释放为O2。Sn的氧化过程通过监测Sn AES峰的变化来进行。在220至300 K之间的NO2分解导致表面氧和共吸附的NO的释放，这随后在较高温度下氧化了3合金中的Sn。在研究条件下，Pt在合金中的成分没有被NO2反应改变，没有出现Pt AES偏移。研究表明，Pt-3d合金的催化性质受到NO2相互作用的影响，导致特定表面配置的形成和氧气的释放，在整个催化过程中起着关键作用。
