[2] "At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry."

1. Adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy was investigated using various techniques, revealing that NO2 binds as an N,N-bonded dimer at 120 K. The dimer dissociates at 300 K, releasing NO2, NO, and O.

2. NO2 is a stronger oxidant than O2, capable of producing surface oxygen species on the PtSn alloy surface. This contrasts with O2, which does not dissociatively adsorb under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.

3. NO2 decomposes between 220 and 300 K on the 3 alloy, liberating surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. This process facilitates the oxidation of Sn in the alloy at higher temperatures.

4. The surface oxygen coverage can be increased by exposing the alloy to NO2 at 600 K, keeping the surface free of coadsorbed NO and providing thermal energy for NO2 dissociation. This allows for the initial attainment of a higher oxygen coverage of 1.1 ML.

5. Heating the surface to 900 K leaves an oxygen coverage of 0.2 ML associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O. This is lower than the coverage obtained by 600 K exposure.

6. Oxygen desorption occurs in three distinct thermal desorption peaks, including one associated with reduction of oxidized Sn species and another linked to the decomposition of SnOx.

7. The surface oxidation of the 3 alloy by NO2 is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, leading to the segregation and structural configuration of SnOx phases.

8. The catalytic properties of the Pt-based system are affected by the stability and configuration of the bimetallic alloy, with implications for applications requiring controlled surface reactivity and selectivity.

9. The implications for the performance of Pt-based catalysts in various applications depend on the balance between surface reactivity, stability, and the ability to control surface segregation and structure.

10. The findings suggest that the catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts can be tailored by manipulating the conditions under which NO2 adsorbs and reacts, influencing the surface oxidation and the formation of active oxygen species.

1. 在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，通过温度程序脱附、Auger电子能谱、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱和低能电子衍射等技术研究了NO2吸附。结果表明，120 K时，NO2以N,N共价键二聚体形式吸附，与表面通过单个氧原子形成倾斜但直立的几何结构。然而，该分子层状态下的N2O4或NO2不会分子化脱附。在300 K时，二聚体完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。

2. NO2是比O2更强的氧化剂，在PtSn表面合金上可以产生表面氧物种。这与O2在UHV条件下不进行离解吸附形成了对比。

3. 在220至300 K之间，NO2在3合金上分解，释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO。这一过程促进了在较高温度下Sn在合金中的氧化。

4. 通过在600 K下将NO2暴露于合金表面，并保持表面远离共吸附的NO，可以提供热能以促进NO2分解。这样可以获得初始的较高氧覆盖度为1.1 ML。

5. 将表面加热到900 K后，表面保留有0.2 ML与氧化Sn物种相关的氧，对应于有序表面薄膜的Sn1.5O。这是由600 K暴露获得的覆盖度所对应的。

6. 氧从减少的氧化Sn物种和SnOx分解的两个不同温度的脱附峰释放出来。

7. 3合金通过NO2氧化的表面氧化受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响，导致SnOx相的分离和结构配置。

8. Pt基催化剂的催化性质受到合金稳定性和结构配置的影响，这影响表面活性、稳定性和控制表面分离的能力。

9. Pt基催化剂在各种应用中的性能取决于吸附和反应条件下对表面活性、稳定性和表面结构控制的平衡。

10. 研究结果表明，通过调整NO2吸附和反应条件，可以定制Pt基催化剂的行为，影响表面氧化和活性氧物种的形成。
