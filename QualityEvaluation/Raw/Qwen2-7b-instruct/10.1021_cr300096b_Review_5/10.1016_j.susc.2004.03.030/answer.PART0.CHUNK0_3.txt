1. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) adsorbs on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy in the form of an N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, at 120 K. The dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. At 300 K, the dimer completely dissociates, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Further heating causes adsorbed NO2 to dissociate into NO and O at temperatures between 300 and 400 K. Adsorbed oxygen then desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states.
2. The investigation utilized techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to study the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy.
3. The surface oxidation process was monitored through shifts in the Sn AES peaks.

1.NO2在120 K时以N,N键合二聚体N2O4的形式吸附在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上。该二聚体通过单个氧原子与表面形成垂直但倾斜的相互作用。然而，没有分子形式的N2O4或NO2从单层状态脱附。在300 K时，二聚体完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。进一步加热导致吸附的NO2在300至400 K之间分解为NO和O。吸附的氧随后以三个清晰的脱附状态释放为O2。
2. 通过对(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上NO2的吸附和反应进行研究，采用了温度程序脱附（TPD）、奥尔电子能谱（AES）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和低能电子衍射（LEED）等技术。
3. 通过Sn AES峰位的变化监测了表面氧化过程。
