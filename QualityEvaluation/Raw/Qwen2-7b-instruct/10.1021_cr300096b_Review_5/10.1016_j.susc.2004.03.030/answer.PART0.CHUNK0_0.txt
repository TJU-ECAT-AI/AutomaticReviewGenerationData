1. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) adsorbs on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K, forming an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. This dimer dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. The chemisorbed NO2 species is a N-bonded nitrite species bound to the surface via the nitrogen atom, which is irreversibly adsorbed and decomposes completely during further heating. NO2 decomposition leads to surface oxygen and oxidation of Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures, with Pt remaining unoxidized under these conditions.

2. The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was 0.4 ML. Heating to 900 K leaves 0.2 ML of oxygen at the surface, associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species exhibiting a (4 × 4) LEED pattern.

3. Oxidation of the alloy can be increased by dosing NO2 on the surface held at 600 K, keeping the surface free of coadsorbed NO and providing thermal energy for activated NO2 dissociation. In this case, an oxygen coverage of 1.1 ML can be initially obtained, which, when heated to 900 K, produces a film with a stoichiometry of SnO1.5, not a fully oxidized SnO2 layer.

1.NO2在120 K时吸附在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，形成一个NN键合的二聚体N2O4，以直立倾斜的几何形状吸附。这个二聚体在220至300 K之间分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2物种是一个通过氮原子连接到表面的N键化的硝酸盐物种，该物种不可逆地吸附并完全在进一步加热时分解。NO2分解导致表面氧和Sn在较高温度下氧化，而Pt在此条件下未被氧化。

2. 加热N2O4单层的最大氧覆盖度为0.4 ML。加热至900 K后，表面保留有0.2 ML的氧，与氧化Sn物种相关联，对应于包含（4 × 4）LEED图案的有序Sn1.5O层。

3. 通过将NO2在600 K时保持在表面上进行剂量，可以增加合金的氧化程度，同时保持表面无共吸附的NO，并提供激活NO2分解所需的热能。在这种情况下，初始可以获得1.1 ML的氧覆盖度，加热至900 K后，产生一种SnO1.5层，而不是完全氧化的SnO2层。
