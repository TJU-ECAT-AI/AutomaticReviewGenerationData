1. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) adsorbs on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K, forming an NN bonded dimer, N2O4, adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry. This dimer dissociates between 220 and 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O at the surface. The chemisorbed NO2 species is a N-bonded nitrite species bound to the surface via the nitrogen atom, which is irreversibly adsorbed and decomposes completely during further heating. NO2 decomposition leads to surface oxygen and oxidation of Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures, with Pt remaining unoxidized under these conditions.

2. The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was 0.4 ML. Heating to 900 K leaves 0.2 ML of oxygen at the surface, associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species exhibiting a (4 × 4) LEED pattern.

3. Oxidation of the alloy can be increased by dosing NO2 on the surface held at 600 K, keeping the surface free of coadsorbed NO and providing thermal energy for activated NO2 dissociation. In this case, an oxygen coverage of 1.1 ML can be initially obtained, which, when heated to 900 K, produces a film with a stoichiometry of SnO1.5, not a fully oxidized SnO2 layer.

1.NO2在120 K时吸附在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，形成一个NN键合的二聚体N2O4，以直立倾斜的几何形状吸附。这个二聚体在220至300 K之间分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2物种是一个通过氮原子连接到表面的N键化的硝酸盐物种，该物种不可逆地吸附并完全在进一步加热时分解。NO2分解导致表面氧和Sn在较高温度下氧化，而Pt在此条件下未被氧化。

2. 加热N2O4单层的最大氧覆盖度为0.4 ML。加热至900 K后，表面保留有0.2 ML的氧，与氧化Sn物种相关联，对应于包含（4 × 4）LEED图案的有序Sn1.5O层。

3. 通过将NO2在600 K时保持在表面上进行剂量，可以增加合金的氧化程度，同时保持表面无共吸附的NO，并提供激活NO2分解所需的热能。在这种情况下，初始可以获得1.1 ML的氧覆盖度，加热至900 K后，产生一种SnO1.5层，而不是完全氧化的SnO2层。

1. Adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy was investigated using various techniques, revealing that NO2 binds as an N,N-bonded dimer at 120 K. The dimer dissociates at 300 K, releasing NO2, NO, and O.

2. NO2 is a stronger oxidant than O2, capable of producing surface oxygen species on the PtSn alloy surface. This contrasts with O2, which does not dissociatively adsorb under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.

3. NO2 decomposes between 220 and 300 K on the 3 alloy, liberating surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. This process facilitates the oxidation of Sn in the alloy at higher temperatures.

4. The surface oxygen coverage can be increased by exposing the alloy to NO2 at 600 K, keeping the surface free of coadsorbed NO and providing thermal energy for NO2 dissociation. This allows for the initial attainment of a higher oxygen coverage of 1.1 ML.

5. Heating the surface to 900 K leaves an oxygen coverage of 0.2 ML associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O. This is lower than the coverage obtained by 600 K exposure.

6. Oxygen desorption occurs in three distinct thermal desorption peaks, including one associated with reduction of oxidized Sn species and another linked to the decomposition of SnOx.

7. The surface oxidation of the 3 alloy by NO2 is influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, leading to the segregation and structural configuration of SnOx phases.

8. The catalytic properties of the Pt-based system are affected by the stability and configuration of the bimetallic alloy, with implications for applications requiring controlled surface reactivity and selectivity.

9. The implications for the performance of Pt-based catalysts in various applications depend on the balance between surface reactivity, stability, and the ability to control surface segregation and structure.

10. The findings suggest that the catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts can be tailored by manipulating the conditions under which NO2 adsorbs and reacts, influencing the surface oxidation and the formation of active oxygen species.

1. 在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，通过温度程序脱附、Auger电子能谱、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱和低能电子衍射等技术研究了NO2吸附。结果表明，120 K时，NO2以N,N共价键二聚体形式吸附，与表面通过单个氧原子形成倾斜但直立的几何结构。然而，该分子层状态下的N2O4或NO2不会分子化脱附。在300 K时，二聚体完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。

2. NO2是比O2更强的氧化剂，在PtSn表面合金上可以产生表面氧物种。这与O2在UHV条件下不进行离解吸附形成了对比。

3. 在220至300 K之间，NO2在3合金上分解，释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO。这一过程促进了在较高温度下Sn在合金中的氧化。

4. 通过在600 K下将NO2暴露于合金表面，并保持表面远离共吸附的NO，可以提供热能以促进NO2分解。这样可以获得初始的较高氧覆盖度为1.1 ML。

5. 将表面加热到900 K后，表面保留有0.2 ML与氧化Sn物种相关的氧，对应于有序表面薄膜的Sn1.5O。这是由600 K暴露获得的覆盖度所对应的。

6. 氧从减少的氧化Sn物种和SnOx分解的两个不同温度的脱附峰释放出来。

7. 3合金通过NO2氧化的表面氧化受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响，导致SnOx相的分离和结构配置。

8. Pt基催化剂的催化性质受到合金稳定性和结构配置的影响，这影响表面活性、稳定性和控制表面分离的能力。

9. Pt基催化剂在各种应用中的性能取决于吸附和反应条件下对表面活性、稳定性和表面结构控制的平衡。

10. 研究结果表明，通过调整NO2吸附和反应条件，可以定制Pt基催化剂的行为，影响表面氧化和活性氧物种的形成。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The decomposition of NO2 between 220 and 300 K liberates surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The remaining surface oxygen is associated with oxidized Sn species, forming a film with a stoichiometry of SnO1.5, as observed after NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K. This process increases the maximum oxygen coverage to θO=1.1 ML, which can be further reduced to θO=0.2 ML at 900 K, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species. The consequent implications for catalytic properties include enhanced oxidation capabilities and potentially improved selectivity in reactions involving NO2, leading to better performance in applications such as selective oxidation and reduction reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分布产生显著影响。NO2在220至300 K之间的分解释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO，然后在较高温度下氧化Sn在3合金中的表面。剩余的表面氧与氧化的Sn物种相关联，形成SnO1.5层状结构，这在600 K时的NO2暴露后观察到。这一过程增加了最大氧覆盖度至θO=1.1 ML，通过加热至900 K可进一步降低至θO=0.2 ML，对应于有序表面薄膜的Sn1.5O物种。这些后续的影响包括增强的氧化能力以及在涉及NO2的反应中可能改善的选择性，从而在选择性氧化和还原反应等应用中提高性能。

1. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) adsorbs on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy in the form of an N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, at 120 K. The dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. At 300 K, the dimer completely dissociates, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Further heating causes adsorbed NO2 to dissociate into NO and O at temperatures between 300 and 400 K. Adsorbed oxygen then desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states.
2. The investigation utilized techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to study the adsorption and reaction of NO2 on the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like the Pt-3d alloys. In the context of the study discussed, NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This configuration is proposed to be a monodentate species bonding through a single oxygen atom. As conditions change, the stability of this structure is influenced by factors such as temperature and the presence of other reactants. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The consequent implications for catalytic properties and performance involve changes in reactivity and selectivity, which are dependent on the surface chemistry and structure of the catalyst.

The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift. This suggests that Pt is not oxidized by NO2 reactions. The study demonstrates that the catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。在讨论的研究中，NO2暴露导致在表面上形成一个直立、NN键合的N2O4二聚体吸附在一个倾斜的角度。提出这种结构是一个单齿物种，通过一个氧原子与表面结合。随着条件的变化，这种结构的稳定性受到因素如温度和其他反应物存在的影响。NO2分解在220至300 K之间的温度下导致表面氧和共吸附NO的释放，这随后在较高温度下氧化了3合金中的Sn。由此产生的影响包括反应性和选择性的变化，这些取决于催化剂的表面化学和结构。

在研究条件下，Pt的成分没有被NO2反应改变，没有出现Pt AES偏移。这表明Pt没有由NO2反应氧化。研究表明，Pt-3d合金的催化性质受到NO2相互作用的影响，导致特定表面配置的形成和氧气的释放，在整个催化过程中起着关键作用。
