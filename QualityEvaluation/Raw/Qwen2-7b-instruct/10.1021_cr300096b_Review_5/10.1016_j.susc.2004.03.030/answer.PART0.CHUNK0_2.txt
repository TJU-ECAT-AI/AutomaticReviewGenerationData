The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The decomposition of NO2 between 220 and 300 K liberates surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The remaining surface oxygen is associated with oxidized Sn species, forming a film with a stoichiometry of SnO1.5, as observed after NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K. This process increases the maximum oxygen coverage to θO=1.1 ML, which can be further reduced to θO=0.2 ML at 900 K, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species. The consequent implications for catalytic properties include enhanced oxidation capabilities and potentially improved selectivity in reactions involving NO2, leading to better performance in applications such as selective oxidation and reduction reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分布产生显著影响。NO2在220至300 K之间的分解释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO，然后在较高温度下氧化Sn在3合金中的表面。剩余的表面氧与氧化的Sn物种相关联，形成SnO1.5层状结构，这在600 K时的NO2暴露后观察到。这一过程增加了最大氧覆盖度至θO=1.1 ML，通过加热至900 K可进一步降低至θO=0.2 ML，对应于有序表面薄膜的Sn1.5O物种。这些后续的影响包括增强的氧化能力以及在涉及NO2的反应中可能改善的选择性，从而在选择性氧化和还原反应等应用中提高性能。
