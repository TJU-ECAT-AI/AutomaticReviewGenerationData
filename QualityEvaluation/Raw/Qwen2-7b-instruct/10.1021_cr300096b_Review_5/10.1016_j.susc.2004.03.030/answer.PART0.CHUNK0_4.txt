Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like the Pt-3d alloys. In the context of the study discussed, NO2 exposure leads to the formation of an upright, NN bonded N2O4 dimer adsorbed in an upright, tilted geometry on the surface. This configuration is proposed to be a monodentate species bonding through a single oxygen atom. As conditions change, the stability of this structure is influenced by factors such as temperature and the presence of other reactants. The decomposition of NO2 at temperatures between 220 and 300 K leads to the liberation of surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO, which then oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures. The consequent implications for catalytic properties and performance involve changes in reactivity and selectivity, which are dependent on the surface chemistry and structure of the catalyst.

The stability of the Pt component in the alloy is not altered by the reaction with NO2 under the investigated conditions, as indicated by the absence of a Pt AES shift. This suggests that Pt is not oxidized by NO2 reactions. The study demonstrates that the catalytic properties of the Pt-3d alloy are influenced by the interactions of NO2, leading to the formation of specific surface configurations and the release of oxygen, which plays a crucial role in the oxidation of Sn and the overall catalytic process.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。在讨论的研究中，NO2暴露导致在表面上形成一个直立、NN键合的N2O4二聚体吸附在一个倾斜的角度。提出这种结构是一个单齿物种，通过一个氧原子与表面结合。随着条件的变化，这种结构的稳定性受到因素如温度和其他反应物存在的影响。NO2分解在220至300 K之间的温度下导致表面氧和共吸附NO的释放，这随后在较高温度下氧化了3合金中的Sn。由此产生的影响包括反应性和选择性的变化，这些取决于催化剂的表面化学和结构。

在研究条件下，Pt的成分没有被NO2反应改变，没有出现Pt AES偏移。这表明Pt没有由NO2反应氧化。研究表明，Pt-3d合金的催化性质受到NO2相互作用的影响，导致特定表面配置的形成和氧气的释放，在整个催化过程中起着关键作用。
