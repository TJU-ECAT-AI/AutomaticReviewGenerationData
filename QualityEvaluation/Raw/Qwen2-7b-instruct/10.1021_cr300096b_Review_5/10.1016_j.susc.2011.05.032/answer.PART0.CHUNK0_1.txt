Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In this study, the addition of a third transition metal M to the Pt3Ni system significantly altered the Pt surface segregation energy, leading to enhanced Pt segregation to the surface in the presence of metals like V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir. Transition metals with atomic sizes smaller than Pt, such as Ti, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, and Ta, promoted Pt segregation to the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces, albeit with less extent than Ni. Among the studied metals, Re was found to be the most effective in promoting Pt segregation. The relative Pt surface segregation energy, which compares the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3M and Pt3Ni (111) surfaces, exhibited the difference in promoting Pt surface segregation in binary alloys. Adding a third transition metal induced tensile strain, driving the largest component atoms to the outermost surface layer. Metals smaller than Pt maintained the extent of Pt surface segregation. A decreased heat of solution favored the surface segregation of the majority component Pt in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离配置，尤其是在以Pt为基础的系统如Pt-3d合金中。在本研究中，向Pt3Ni系统添加第三种过渡金属M显著改变了Pt表面分离能，导致在V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os和Ir等存在的情况下，Pt在表面上的分离得到增强。原子尺寸小于Pt的过渡金属，如Ti、Mn、Cr、Cu、Zr、Nb、Rh、Hf和Ta，促进了Pt向Pt3Ni/M (111)表面的分离，尽管其效果不如Ni。在所研究的金属中，Re被发现是最有效的促进Pt向Pt3Ni/M (111)表面外层分离的元素。相对的Pt表面分离能量，即比较在Pt3M和Pt3Ni (111)表面上的Pt分离能量，显示了在二元合金中促进Pt表面分离的差异。添加第三种过渡金属引起了拉应力，驱使最大的成分原子到最外层表面层。原子尺寸小于Pt的金属维持了Pt表面分离的范围。合金的热焓降低有利于在Pt3Ni/M (111)表面上的Pt表面分离。
