1. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts in Pt-based systems. This is exemplified by the Pt-3d alloys, where the introduction of a third transition metal (M) can alter the extent of Pt surface segregation. This alteration is due to the surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M. The stability and configuration of these bimetallic catalysts can impact their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

2. The study found that replacing nickel (Ni) with certain transition metals such as vanadium (V), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), technetium (Tc), ruthenium (Ru), tungsten (W), rhenium (Re), osmium (Os), and iridium (Ir) in the Pt-Ni system leads to an increased extent of Pt surface segregation. On the other hand, replacing Ni with palladium (Pd), gold (Au), or silver (Ag) would completely inhibit Pt segregating to the surface. 

3. The study revealed that the relative Pt surface segregation energy, which is the comparison between the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3M and Pt3Ni surfaces, exhibits the difference in promoting the Pt surface segregation between elements M and Ni in their corresponding Pt binary alloy surfaces. The findings showed consistency between the calculated relative Pt surface segregation energies for binary alloys and the variation of the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces compared to the Pt3Ni (111) surfaces.

4. The study provided valuable insights for developing low-cost, high-performance Pt alloys as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). It was identified that vanadium, iron, cobalt, molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, and iridium could enhance the Pt surface segregation as a third component metal replacing Ni in the Pt-Ni alloys. This enhancement could control the degree of enrichment of Ni and M beneath the pure Pt outermost layer, allowing for the tailoring of the surface electronic structure of these Pt ternary alloys.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响铂基复合催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置。这在Pt-3d合金中表现得尤为明显，引入第三种过渡金属（M）可以改变铂表面分层的程度。这种变化归因于由掺杂元素M引起的表面能量效应、应力效应和热解离效应。这些复合催化剂的稳定性和配置会影响它们在各种应用中的催化性能和特性。

2. 研究发现，将镍（Ni）替换为某些过渡金属，如钒（V）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、钼（Mo）、锝（Tc）、钌（Ru）、钨（W）、铼（Re）、锇（Os）和铱（Ir）在Pt-Ni系统中会导致铂表面分层程度的增加。相反，将Ni替换为钯（Pd）、金（Au）或银（Ag）会完全阻止铂向表面分层。

3. 研究揭示了相对铂表面分层能，即Pt表面分层能在Pt3M和Pt3Ni表面上的比较，展示了M和Ni在它们对应的Pt二元合金表面促进铂表面分层之间的差异。研究发现，对于二元合金计算出的相对铂表面分层能与Pt3Ni/M（111）表面相对于Pt3Ni（111）表面的铂表面分层能的变化之间存在一致性。

4. 研究为开发低成本、高效率的Pt合金作为氧还原反应（ORR）的催化剂提供了有价值的见解。研究发现，钒、铁、钴、钼、锝、钌、钨、铼、锇和铱可以增强铂表面分层作为替代Ni的第三种成分金属在Pt-Ni合金中。这种增强可以通过控制Ni和M在纯铂最外层下的富集程度来控制，从而调整这些Pt三元合金的表面电子结构。
