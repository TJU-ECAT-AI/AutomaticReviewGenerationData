1. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts in Pt-based systems. This is exemplified by the Pt-3d alloys, where the introduction of a third transition metal (M) can alter the extent of Pt surface segregation. This alteration is due to the surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M. The stability and configuration of these bimetallic catalysts can impact their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

2. The study found that replacing nickel (Ni) with certain transition metals such as vanadium (V), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), technetium (Tc), ruthenium (Ru), tungsten (W), rhenium (Re), osmium (Os), and iridium (Ir) in the Pt-Ni system leads to an increased extent of Pt surface segregation. On the other hand, replacing Ni with palladium (Pd), gold (Au), or silver (Ag) would completely inhibit Pt segregating to the surface. 

3. The study revealed that the relative Pt surface segregation energy, which is the comparison between the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3M and Pt3Ni surfaces, exhibits the difference in promoting the Pt surface segregation between elements M and Ni in their corresponding Pt binary alloy surfaces. The findings showed consistency between the calculated relative Pt surface segregation energies for binary alloys and the variation of the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces compared to the Pt3Ni (111) surfaces.

4. The study provided valuable insights for developing low-cost, high-performance Pt alloys as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). It was identified that vanadium, iron, cobalt, molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, and iridium could enhance the Pt surface segregation as a third component metal replacing Ni in the Pt-Ni alloys. This enhancement could control the degree of enrichment of Ni and M beneath the pure Pt outermost layer, allowing for the tailoring of the surface electronic structure of these Pt ternary alloys.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响铂基复合催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置。这在Pt-3d合金中表现得尤为明显，引入第三种过渡金属（M）可以改变铂表面分层的程度。这种变化归因于由掺杂元素M引起的表面能量效应、应力效应和热解离效应。这些复合催化剂的稳定性和配置会影响它们在各种应用中的催化性能和特性。

2. 研究发现，将镍（Ni）替换为某些过渡金属，如钒（V）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、钼（Mo）、锝（Tc）、钌（Ru）、钨（W）、铼（Re）、锇（Os）和铱（Ir）在Pt-Ni系统中会导致铂表面分层程度的增加。相反，将Ni替换为钯（Pd）、金（Au）或银（Ag）会完全阻止铂向表面分层。

3. 研究揭示了相对铂表面分层能，即Pt表面分层能在Pt3M和Pt3Ni表面上的比较，展示了M和Ni在它们对应的Pt二元合金表面促进铂表面分层之间的差异。研究发现，对于二元合金计算出的相对铂表面分层能与Pt3Ni/M（111）表面相对于Pt3Ni（111）表面的铂表面分层能的变化之间存在一致性。

4. 研究为开发低成本、高效率的Pt合金作为氧还原反应（ORR）的催化剂提供了有价值的见解。研究发现，钒、铁、钴、钼、锝、钌、钨、铼、锇和铱可以增强铂表面分层作为替代Ni的第三种成分金属在Pt-Ni合金中。这种增强可以通过控制Ni和M在纯铂最外层下的富集程度来控制，从而调整这些Pt三元合金的表面电子结构。

热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离配置，尤其是在以Pt为基础的系统如Pt-3d合金中。在本研究中，向Pt3Ni系统添加第三种过渡金属M显著改变了Pt表面分离能，导致在V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os和Ir等存在的情况下，Pt在表面上的分离得到增强。原子尺寸小于Pt的过渡金属，如Ti、Mn、Cr、Cu、Zr、Nb、Rh、Hf和Ta，促进了Pt向Pt3Ni/M (111)表面的分离，尽管其效果不如Ni。在所研究的金属中，Re被发现是最有效的促进Pt向Pt3Ni/M (111)表面外层分离的元素。相对的Pt表面分离能量，即比较在Pt3M和Pt3Ni (111)表面上的Pt分离能量，显示了在二元合金中促进Pt表面分离的差异。添加第三种过渡金属引起了拉应力，驱使最大的成分原子到最外层表面层。原子尺寸小于Pt的金属维持了Pt表面分离的范围。合金的热焓降低有利于在Pt3Ni/M (111)表面上的Pt表面分离。

How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

1. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions play a crucial role in determining the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. The surface energy effect is significant in controlling the extent of Pt segregation to the surface in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces. A decrease in surface energy favors Pt segregation, leading to a more stable and efficient catalyst.

2. The introduction of a third metal M into the Pt3Ni system influences the heat of solution, which is a measure of the strength of the Pt-M bond in the alloy. A more negative heat of solution promotes the segregation of Pt to the surface, enhancing the catalytic properties of the alloy. This is exemplified by the case of V, which, despite being larger than Pt, can induce tensile strain in the Pt3Ni crystal lattice, further promoting Pt segregation.

3. The structural configuration of the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces, influenced by the choice of M, can significantly impact the catalytic performance. For instance, replacing Ni with elements like V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir can lead to enhanced Pt surface segregation, resulting in improved catalytic activity for reactions such as oxygen reduction. The enrichment of Ni and M beneath the pure Pt outermost layer can be tailored to control the electronic structure of these ternary alloys, potentially optimizing their performance in fuel cell applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚结以及结构配置具有重要影响。表面能量效应在控制Pt在Pt3Ni/M（111）表面的聚结程度中起着关键作用。较低的表面能有利于Pt的聚结，从而实现更稳定的催化剂。

引入第三种金属M到Pt3Ni体系会影响溶解热，这是合金中Pt-M键强度的度量。更低的溶解热促进Pt向表面的聚结，增强合金的催化性能。例如，V的引入，尽管其比Pt大，但可以诱导Pt3Ni晶体晶格中的拉应力，进一步促进Pt的聚结。

Pt3Ni/M（111）表面的结构配置，受M的选择影响，显著影响催化性能。例如，用V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os或Ir替换Ni可以导致增强的Pt表面聚结，从而提高氧还原等反应的催化活性。这些合金外层纯Pt下Ni和M的富集可以通过控制电子结构来优化，可能优化它们在燃料电池应用中的性能。
