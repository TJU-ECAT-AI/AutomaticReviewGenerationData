1. Density functional theory was utilized to calculate the surface segregation energy of platinum (Pt) in the Pt3Ni (111) surface, doped with a third transition metal M. The aim was to explore how M influences the degree of Pt segregation to the outermost layer of these Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.

2. Transition metals such as V, Fe, Co, Mo, Tc, Ru, W, Re, Os, and Ir, when replacing Ni, can enhance the Pt segregation to the surface, resulting in even greater extent of segregation.

3. Contrarily, replacing Ni with transition metals Ag, Au, and Pd can prevent Pt from segregating to the surface.

4. Inserting a third transition metal into the Pt3Ni crystal creates tensile strain, driving the largest component atoms to segregate to the outermost surface layer.

5. Transition metals with atomic sizes smaller than Pt are better suited to maintain the level of Pt surface segregation in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.

6. A reduced heat of solution in alloys can encourage the surface segregation of the primary component, Pt, in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces.

1. 我们使用密度泛函理论方法计算了掺杂第三过渡金属M的Pt3Ni（111）表面中铂（Pt）的表面分离能，并研究了组件M对这些Pt3Ni/M（111）表面上层中Pt分离程度的影响。

2. 当用V、Fe、Co、Mo、Tc、Ru、W、Re、Os和Ir替换Ni时，可以增强Pt在表面上的分离，导致更大的分离程度。

3. 相反，用Ag、Au和Pd替换Ni可以阻止Pt在表面的分离。

4. 将第三过渡金属插入到Pt3Ni晶体中会产生拉伸应力，驱动最大的成分原子向最外层表面层分离。

5. 原子大小小于Pt的过渡金属更适合保持Pt在Pt3Ni/M（111）表面上的分离水平。

6. 合金中较低的热溶解度可以促进Pt（111）表面上的Pt主成分的表面分离。
