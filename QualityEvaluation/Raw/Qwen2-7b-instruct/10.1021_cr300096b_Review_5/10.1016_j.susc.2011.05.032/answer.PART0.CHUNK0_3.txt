[1] "We have used density functional theory method to calculate the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni (111) surface doped with a third transition metal M and thus investigated the influence of component M on the extent of Pt segregation to the outermost layer of these Pt3Ni/M (111) surface."
[2] "It was found that the surface energy effect, strain effect, and heat of solution effect induced by the doped element M would collectively affect the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surfaces."
[3] "For 4 d and 5 d transition metals, our results in Fig. 3 showed that those elements with half-filled d band could further decrease the Pt surface segregation energy while those elements with nearly-filled d band would increase the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface as compared with that in the based Pt3Ni (111) surface."
[4] "Our major findings were: (1) Relative Pt surface segregation energy, a comparison between the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3M and Pt3Ni (111) surfaces, exhibits the difference for elements M and Ni in promoting the Pt surface segregation in their corresponding Pt binary alloy surfaces."
[5] "In particular, our study obtained some useful insights for developing low-cost yet high performance Pt alloys as the electrocatalysts for ORR."

1. The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The addition of a third transition metal M to the Pt3Ni (111) surface modifies the surface energy, lattice strain, and heat of solution, which collectively impact the Pt surface segregation energy. This alteration affects the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications.

2. When considering 4 d and 5 d transition metals, those with a half-filled d band tend to further decrease the Pt surface segregation energy, whereas those with a nearly-filled d band increase the Pt surface segregation energy in the Pt3Ni/M (111) surface compared to the base Pt3Ni (111) surface.

3. The relative Pt surface segregation energy, which compares the Pt surface segregation energies in the Pt3M and Pt3Ni (111) surfaces, demonstrates the difference in promotion of Pt surface segregation by elements M and Ni in their respective binary alloy surfaces.

4. The study provides valuable insights for developing low-cost and high-performance Pt alloys as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR).

5. The insights gained from this research can guide the development of low-cost, high-performance, and long-durability Pt ternary alloy catalysts for fuel cell applications.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面富集和结构配置有显著影响，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。向Pt3Ni(111)表面添加第三过渡金属M修改了表面能量、晶格应变和溶解热，这些因素共同影响了Pt表面富集能。这进而影响了催化剂在各种应用中的催化性质和性能。

2. 当考虑4d和5d过渡金属时，具有半满d轨道的那些元素倾向于进一步降低Pt表面富集能，而具有接近满d轨道的那些元素则增加了与基底Pt3Ni(111)表面相比，在Pt3Ni/M(111)表面上的Pt表面富集能。

3. 相对Pt表面富集能，即在Pt3M和Pt3Ni(111)表面上的Pt表面富集能之间的比较，表明了M和Ni在它们各自的二元合金表面促进Pt表面富集的差异。

4. 研究提供了有关开发作为ORR电催化剂的低成本和高性能Pt合金的宝贵见解。

5. 从这项研究中获得的知识可以指导开发低成本、高性能且耐久性好的Pt三元合金催化剂用于燃料电池应用。
