Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory.
The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen.
Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one.
Further analysis reveals that segregation energy under adsorption environments can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems.
Therefore, the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength.
The interactions of oxygen with the alloy surfaces play a critical role in the segregation of Pt-based alloys.
Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size.
Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface.
However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures.
Stronger adsorption is therefore expected when oxygen atoms are bound to 3d-metal-enriched surfaces.
Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys.
According to Table 3, most calculated segregation energies are positive, revealing that the Pt-segregated surface is generally not thermodynamically favored when covered by 1/4 ML of oxygen.
The segregation energy under adsorbate environment can be expressed as (1) where and are the total energies of the segregated and non-segregated metal slabs with adsorbates.
The equation is very useful for analyzing adsorbent-induced segregation.
For Pt3Fe(1 1 1), Pt3Co(1 1 1), and Pt3Ni(1 1 1), the corresponding Pt-segregation energies under vacuum are 0.41, 0.61 and 0.38 eV, respectively.
However, the difference of the adsorption energies ranging from 0.33 to 1.37 eV is generally larger than the magnitude of (Table 4).
This yields the positive values of the segregation energy under oxygen adsorption, showing that the Pt surface segregation process is unlikely to take place in oxygen environment.
As the only exception, the value of (0.33 eV) for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) with top-site oxygen adsorption, is smaller than the magnitude of (0.38 eV), leading to a negative of 0.05 eV.
For the surface segregation of 3d metals, the calculated positive values of indicate that the 3d metals atoms tend not to segregate to the surface.
On the other hand, the oxygen adsorption on the M-segregated surface is much stronger than that of the non-segregated surface.
The combination of and however, still produces positive values of because the former term dominates the segregation trend.
The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism.
Current studies are underway to investigate some of these aspects and the results will be reported elsewhere.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Adsorption of oxygen modifies the surface segregation trend, making both Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces less stable compared to the non-segregated one. The stability and surface segregation trend are directly correlated with the surface-adsorbate binding strength. In the presence of adsorbates, the surface segregation energy can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference between the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. This expression helps analyze adsorbent-induced segregation. For Pt3Fe(1 1 1), Pt3Co(1 1 1), and Pt3Ni(1 1 1), the Pt-segregation energies under vacuum conditions are 0.41, 0.61, and 0.38 eV, respectively. However, the difference in adsorption energies is generally larger than the magnitude of these energies, leading to positive segregation energies under oxygen adsorption. This indicates that the Pt surface segregation process is unlikely in an oxygen environment. The oxygen adsorption on the M-segregated surface is stronger than that on the non-segregated surface, but the segregation trend is still dominated by the vacuum segregation energy. The complexity of the influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity stems from multiple factors including adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms, and the ORR mechanism. Ongoing research aims to explore these aspects further and report the findings.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面同质化配置产生显著影响。氧吸附改变表面同质化趋势，使Pt同质化和M同质化的表面比非同质化表面更不稳定。稳定性与表面吸附剂结合强度直接相关。在吸附剂存在下，表面同质化能可表示为真空条件下同质化能与同质化和非同质化合金系统的吸附能差异之和。此表达式有助于分析吸附剂诱导的同质化。对于Pt3Fe(1 1 1)、Pt3Co(1 1 1)和Pt3Ni(1 1 1)，真空条件下的Pt同质化能分别为0.41、0.61和0.38 eV。然而，吸附能的差异通常大于这些能量的幅度，导致氧吸附下具有正的同质化能。这表明Pt表面同质化过程在氧气环境中不太可能发生。氧吸附在M同质化表面上比非同质化表面上更强，但同质化趋势仍由真空同质化能主导。表面同质化对ORR催化活性的影响复杂性源自多个因素，包括吸附剂浓度、同质化动力学、Pt和/或较不贵重原子的溶解以及ORR机制。正在进行的研究旨在进一步探索这些方面，并报告研究结果。
