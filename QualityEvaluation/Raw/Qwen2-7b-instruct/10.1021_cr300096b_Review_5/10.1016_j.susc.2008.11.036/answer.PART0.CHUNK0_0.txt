Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory. The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen. Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one.
Further analysis reveals that segregation energy under adsorption environments can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. Therefore, the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength.
In our previous study [19] , we pointed out that the distance between the first and the second layers (d12) generally increases with a negative segregation energy and the displacement can approximately predict the segregation trend under vacuum. However, the values of d12 in Table 2 indicate that the rule does not apply under adsorption conditions.
As discussed above, the segregation energy under adsorbate environment, \(\Delta E_{\text{segr}}^{*}\), can be expressed as (1)
where \(E_{\text{seg}}\) and \(E_{\text{non-seg}}\) are the total energies of the segregated and non-segregated metal slabs with adsorbates. The adsorption energies for the segregated and non-segregated systems can be obtained from the following equations:(2) (3) in which \(E_{\text{seg}}^{*}\), \(E_{\text{non-seg}}^{*}\), and \(E_{\text{o}}\) refer to the energies of the segregated slab, the non-segregated slab and the adsorbate, respectively. Rearranging Eqs. (2),(3) and combining them with Eq. (1), one has (4) \(\Delta E_{\text{vac}}\) is the segregation energy of the metal system under vacuum conditions, denoted as \(E_{\text{segr}}^{\text{vac}}\). Consequently, Eq. (4) can be rewritten as (5) Eq. (5) indicates that the segregation trend of an alloy system in the presence of adsorbates can be evaluated by the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energies of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems.

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of adsorbed oxygen modifies the surface segregation trend, making both Pt-segregation and M-segregation less stable than the non-segregated state. The segregation energy under adsorption conditions is correlated to the strength of the surface-adsorbate binding. The distance between the first and second layers (d12) can predict the segregation trend under vacuum conditions, but this rule does not apply under adsorption conditions. The segregation energy under vacuum (\(\Delta E_{\text{vac}}\)) and the adsorption energy difference between the segregated and non-segregated systems determine the overall segregation trend under adsorption conditions.

2. The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as the concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms, and the ORR mechanism. The stability, surface composition, and electronic properties of Pt-based alloys are crucial for their catalytic performance. Understanding how surface segregation changes under various conditions is essential for optimizing their use in applications requiring enhanced catalytic properties.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是铂基系统（如铂-3d合金）的稳定性和表面聚集体配置有显著影响。吸附氧的存在显著改变了表面聚集体趋势，使得铂聚集体和M聚集体的状态比非聚集体状态更不稳定。吸附条件下表面聚集体趋势与表面-吸附剂结合强度成正比。在真空条件下，第一层和第二层之间的距离（d12）可以预测聚集体趋势，但在吸附条件下这一规则不适用。真空条件下（\(\Delta E_{\text{vac}}\））的聚集体能量和聚集体和非聚集体系统之间的吸附能差决定了整体吸附条件下聚集体趋势。

2. 表面聚集体对氧还原反应（ORR）催化活性的影响复杂，涉及吸附物浓度、聚集体动力学、铂和/或较不贵重原子的溶解以及ORR机制等因素。铂基合金的稳定性和表面组成及其电子性质对于催化性能至关重要。理解不同条件下表面聚集体变化对于优化其在需要增强催化性能的应用中的使用至关重要。
