1. Under an oxygen coverage of 1/4 monolayer, both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated surface. This demonstrates that the stability of the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly influenced by the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and the surface.

2. The surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly linked to the surface-adsorbate binding strength. This relationship implies that the strength of the adsorbate's interaction with the surface plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the segregated surface states.

3. The segregation energy under the presence of adsorbates can be mathematically represented as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the difference in adsorption energy between the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. This equation provides a method to assess how adsorbents impact the segregation process.

4. The segregation trend of an alloy system in the presence of adsorbates can be analyzed by considering the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the difference in adsorption energies between the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. This approach helps in understanding the effects of adsorbates on the segregation process and predicting the stability of the surface states.

1. 在1/4单层氧覆盖下，Pt分离和M分离表面的稳定性都低于非分离表面。这表明吸附条件下的表面分离趋势稳定性直接由表面吸附剂结合强度决定。

2. 表面分离趋势在吸附条件下的直接关系是表面吸附剂结合强度。这一关系意味着吸附剂与表面的相互作用强度对确定分离表面状态的稳定性起着关键作用。

3. 含有吸附剂的存在下，分离能量可以数学表示为真空条件下分离能量与分隔系统之间吸附能差的和。这个方程提供了一种方法来评估吸附剂如何影响分离过程，并预测表面状态的稳定性。

4. 考虑真空条件下分离能量和分离和非分离合金系统之间的吸附能差，可以分析合金系统在吸附剂存在的分离趋势。这种方法有助于理解吸附剂对分离过程的影响并预测表面状态的稳定性。
