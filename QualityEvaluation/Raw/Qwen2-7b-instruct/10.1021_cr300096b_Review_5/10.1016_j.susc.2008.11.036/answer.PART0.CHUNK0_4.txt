1. "Surface segregation has been drawing much experimental and theoretical attention due to its importance to materials science, catalysis and surface chemistry."
2. "The phenomenon is able to influence many important physical and chemical properties such as permeation, surface adsorption, crystal growth, metal corrosion, etc."
3. "In particular, it has been found out that the catalytic activities of alloys can be significantly altered through surface segregation."
4. "Compared to pure Pt, enhanced ORR activities were observed in the case of Pt alloyed with 3d metals."
5. "Remarkably, surface segregation was found closely related to the activity improvement."
6. "For instance, Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on bulk alloy of Pt3Co and the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt-segregating on the topmost layer of the annealed surface."
7. "They predicted that for both (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) crystal planes the subsurface Pt3dPt configurations were thermodynamically preferred in vacuum and that the surface 3dPtPt configurations were preferred with the adsorption of oxygen."
8. "The strength of oxygen adsorption is also correlated to the distance of oxygen and the surface layer, dO1."
9. "Moreover, our calculations give the following order of the oxygen binding strength for the non-segregated and M-segregated structures by comparing the most stable adsorption site for each alloy: Pt3Fe(1 1 1) > Pt3Co(1 1 1) > Pt3Ni(1 1 1), whereas the reverse order are observed for the Pt-segregated structures."
10. "Therefore, the non-segregated structures remain the most thermodynamically stable."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Surface segregation can lead to substantial changes in the catalytic activities of alloys. For instance, Pt-alloys with 3d metals display enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities, which are closely related to surface segregation. The surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength. The presence of adsorbates modifies the stability and structure of the alloy surfaces, affecting their catalytic properties. The segregation energies under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy differences between segregated and non-segregated alloy systems determine the stability of the surface configurations. Non-segregated structures remain the most thermodynamically stable, indicating that the stability of bimetallic catalysts is influenced by the interplay between surface segregation and adsorption conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是铂基系统如铂-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置。表面分离可导致合金催化活性的显著变化。例如，铂合金与3d金属结合时显示增强的氧还原反应（ORR）活性，这与表面分离密切相关。吸附条件下的表面分离趋势直接与表面吸附剂结合强度相关。吸附物的存在改变了合金表面的稳定性和结构，影响其催化性质。真空条件下分离能和分层结构之间的吸附能量差异决定了表面配置的稳定性。非分离结构保持最热力学稳定的特性，表明双金属催化剂的稳定性受到表面分离和吸附条件之间相互作用的影响。
