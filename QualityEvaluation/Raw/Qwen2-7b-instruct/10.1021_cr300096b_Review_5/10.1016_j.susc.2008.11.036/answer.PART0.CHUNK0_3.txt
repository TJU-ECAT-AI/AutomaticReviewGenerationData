Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory. The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen. Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one. Further analysis reveals that segregation energy under adsorption environments can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In the presence of adsorbed atomic oxygen, the surface structure is notably modified, making neither Pt-segregation nor M-segregation favorable on the (1 1 1) surface at 1/4 ML oxygen coverage. The segregation energy under surface adsorption is represented as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference between the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. This affects the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications.

在氧吸附的影响下，热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离配置，特别是在铂基系统如铂-3d合金中。在1/4 ML氧覆盖下，(1 1 1)表面的表面结构明显改变，使得Pt分离和M分离都不利于铂3d合金。表面吸附能可以表示为真空条件下分离能与分隔合金系统的分离能之和。这影响催化剂的催化特性和在各种应用中的性能。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Surface segregation has been found to be closely associated with the enhanced activity of platinum-based alloys in catalytic processes, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The unique catalytic activity observed on the Pt-skin surface compared to the pure Pt catalyst demonstrates the importance of surface segregation in modifying the catalytic properties of alloys.
