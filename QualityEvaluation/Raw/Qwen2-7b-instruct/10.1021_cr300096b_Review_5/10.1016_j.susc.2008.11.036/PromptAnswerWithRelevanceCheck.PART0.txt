Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory. The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen. Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one.
Further analysis reveals that segregation energy under adsorption environments can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. Therefore, the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength.
In our previous study [19] , we pointed out that the distance between the first and the second layers (d12) generally increases with a negative segregation energy and the displacement can approximately predict the segregation trend under vacuum. However, the values of d12 in Table 2 indicate that the rule does not apply under adsorption conditions.
As discussed above, the segregation energy under adsorbate environment, \(\Delta E_{\text{segr}}^{*}\), can be expressed as (1)
where \(E_{\text{seg}}\) and \(E_{\text{non-seg}}\) are the total energies of the segregated and non-segregated metal slabs with adsorbates. The adsorption energies for the segregated and non-segregated systems can be obtained from the following equations:(2) (3) in which \(E_{\text{seg}}^{*}\), \(E_{\text{non-seg}}^{*}\), and \(E_{\text{o}}\) refer to the energies of the segregated slab, the non-segregated slab and the adsorbate, respectively. Rearranging Eqs. (2),(3) and combining them with Eq. (1), one has (4) \(\Delta E_{\text{vac}}\) is the segregation energy of the metal system under vacuum conditions, denoted as \(E_{\text{segr}}^{\text{vac}}\). Consequently, Eq. (4) can be rewritten as (5) Eq. (5) indicates that the segregation trend of an alloy system in the presence of adsorbates can be evaluated by the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energies of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems.

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of adsorbed oxygen modifies the surface segregation trend, making both Pt-segregation and M-segregation less stable than the non-segregated state. The segregation energy under adsorption conditions is correlated to the strength of the surface-adsorbate binding. The distance between the first and second layers (d12) can predict the segregation trend under vacuum conditions, but this rule does not apply under adsorption conditions. The segregation energy under vacuum (\(\Delta E_{\text{vac}}\)) and the adsorption energy difference between the segregated and non-segregated systems determine the overall segregation trend under adsorption conditions.

2. The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is complex, involving factors such as the concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms, and the ORR mechanism. The stability, surface composition, and electronic properties of Pt-based alloys are crucial for their catalytic performance. Understanding how surface segregation changes under various conditions is essential for optimizing their use in applications requiring enhanced catalytic properties.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是铂基系统（如铂-3d合金）的稳定性和表面聚集体配置有显著影响。吸附氧的存在显著改变了表面聚集体趋势，使得铂聚集体和M聚集体的状态比非聚集体状态更不稳定。吸附条件下表面聚集体趋势与表面-吸附剂结合强度成正比。在真空条件下，第一层和第二层之间的距离（d12）可以预测聚集体趋势，但在吸附条件下这一规则不适用。真空条件下（\(\Delta E_{\text{vac}}\））的聚集体能量和聚集体和非聚集体系统之间的吸附能差决定了整体吸附条件下聚集体趋势。

2. 表面聚集体对氧还原反应（ORR）催化活性的影响复杂，涉及吸附物浓度、聚集体动力学、铂和/或较不贵重原子的溶解以及ORR机制等因素。铂基合金的稳定性和表面组成及其电子性质对于催化性能至关重要。理解不同条件下表面聚集体变化对于优化其在需要增强催化性能的应用中的使用至关重要。

1. Under an oxygen coverage of 1/4 monolayer, both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated surface. This demonstrates that the stability of the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly influenced by the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and the surface.

2. The surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly linked to the surface-adsorbate binding strength. This relationship implies that the strength of the adsorbate's interaction with the surface plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the segregated surface states.

3. The segregation energy under the presence of adsorbates can be mathematically represented as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the difference in adsorption energy between the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. This equation provides a method to assess how adsorbents impact the segregation process.

4. The segregation trend of an alloy system in the presence of adsorbates can be analyzed by considering the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the difference in adsorption energies between the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems. This approach helps in understanding the effects of adsorbates on the segregation process and predicting the stability of the surface states.

Surface segregation of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys under oxygen environment has been examined using periodic density functional theory.
The segregation trend at a (1 1 1) surface is found to be substantially modified by the adsorbed oxygen.
Our calculations indicate that under 1/4 monolayer O coverage both the Pt-segregated and M-segregated surfaces are less stable than the non-segregated one.
Further analysis reveals that segregation energy under adsorption environments can be expressed as the sum of the segregation energy under vacuum conditions and the adsorption energy difference of the segregated and non-segregated alloy systems.
Therefore, the surface segregation trend under adsorption conditions is directly correlated to the surface-adsorbate binding strength.
The interactions of oxygen with the alloy surfaces play a critical role in the segregation of Pt-based alloys.
Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is mainly determined by the surface energy and the atomic size.
Metal atoms with larger radii and lower surface energies usually tend to segregate to the surface.
However, in the presence of adsorbate atoms on the surface, the surface composition may be different in that the adsorption can stabilize or destabilize the alloy structures.
Stronger adsorption is therefore expected when oxygen atoms are bound to 3d-metal-enriched surfaces.
Oxygen adsorption decreases the stability of the Pt-segregated surfaces and even alters the segregation trend for Pt3M alloys.
According to Table 3, most calculated segregation energies are positive, revealing that the Pt-segregated surface is generally not thermodynamically favored when covered by 1/4 ML of oxygen.
The segregation energy under adsorbate environment can be expressed as (1) where and are the total energies of the segregated and non-segregated metal slabs with adsorbates.
The equation is very useful for analyzing adsorbent-induced segregation.
For Pt3Fe(1 1 1), Pt3Co(1 1 1), and Pt3Ni(1 1 1), the corresponding Pt-segregation energies under vacuum are 0.41, 0.61 and 0.38 eV, respectively.
However, the difference of the adsorption energies ranging from 0.33 to 1.37 eV is generally larger than the magnitude of (Table 4).
This yields the positive values of the segregation energy under oxygen adsorption, showing that the Pt surface segregation process is unlikely to take place in oxygen environment.
As the only exception, the value of (0.33 eV) for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) with top-site oxygen adsorption, is smaller than the magnitude of (0.38 eV), leading to a negative of 0.05 eV.
For the surface segregation of 3d metals, the calculated positive values of indicate that the 3d metals atoms tend not to segregate to the surface.
On the other hand, the oxygen adsorption on the M-segregated surface is much stronger than that of the non-segregated surface.
The combination of and however, still produces positive values of because the former term dominates the segregation trend.
The influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity is quite complex because of the existence of many factors such as concentration of adsorbates, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms and the ORR mechanism.
Current studies are underway to investigate some of these aspects and the results will be reported elsewhere.

However, the difference in adsorption energies is generally larger than the magnitude of these energies, leading to positive segregation energies under oxygen adsorption. This indicates that the Pt surface segregation process is unlikely in an oxygen environment. The oxygen adsorption on the M-segregated surface is stronger than that on the non-segregated surface, but the segregation trend is still dominated by the vacuum segregation energy. The complexity of the influence of surface segregation on the ORR catalytic activity stems from multiple factors including adsorbate concentration, segregation kinetics, dissolution of Pt and/or less-noble atoms, and the ORR mechanism. Ongoing research aims to explore these aspects further and report the findings.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面同质化配置产生显著影响。氧吸附改变表面同质化趋势，使Pt同质化和M同质化的表面比非同质化表面更不稳定。稳定性与表面吸附剂结合强度直接相关。在吸附剂存在下，表面同质化能可表示为真空条件下同质化能与同质化和非同质化合金系统的吸附能差异之和。此表达式有助于分析吸附剂诱导的同质化。对于Pt3Fe(1 1 1)、Pt3Co(1 1 1)和Pt3Ni(1 1 1)，真空条件下的Pt同质化能分别为0.41、0.61和0.38 eV。然而，吸附能的差异通常大于这些能量的幅度，导致氧吸附下具有正的同质化能。这表明Pt表面同质化过程在氧气环境中不太可能发生。氧吸附在M同质化表面上比非同质化表面上更强，但同质化趋势仍由真空同质化能主导。表面同质化对ORR催化活性的影响复杂性源自多个因素，包括吸附剂浓度、同质化动力学、Pt和/或较不贵重原子的溶解以及ORR机制。正在进行的研究旨在进一步探索这些方面，并报告研究结果。
