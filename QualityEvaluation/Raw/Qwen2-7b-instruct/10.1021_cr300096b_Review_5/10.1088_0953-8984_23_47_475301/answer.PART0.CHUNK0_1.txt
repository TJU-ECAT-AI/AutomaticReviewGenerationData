The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. In the case of PtPd alloys, the simulations revealed that Pd atoms tend to segregate towards the outermost layers of both extended surfaces and nanoparticle surfaces, leading to an increasing Pt concentration moving from the surface into the bulk. Moreover, the equilibrium nanoparticles exhibit Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. Particularly, the Pd atoms are predicted to preferentially segregate to the (100) facets over the (111) facets in the shells of these nanoparticles. These findings suggest that the specific surface configurations and atomic arrangements play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件对铂钯合金等双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离以及结构配置产生了显著影响，特别是在以铂为基础的系统中。在铂钯合金的研究中，模拟结果表明钯原子倾向于向扩展表面的最外层和纳米粒子表面的最外层分离，导致从表面到内部基体的铂浓度逐渐增加。此外，均衡的铂钯纳米颗粒具有钯富集的外壳和铂富集的核心。特别地，在这些纳米颗粒的外壳中，钯原子被预测优先在(100)晶面而不是(111)晶面上进行分离。这些发现表明特定的表面构型和原子排列在决定铂基双金属催化剂的催化性质和性能方面起着关键作用。
