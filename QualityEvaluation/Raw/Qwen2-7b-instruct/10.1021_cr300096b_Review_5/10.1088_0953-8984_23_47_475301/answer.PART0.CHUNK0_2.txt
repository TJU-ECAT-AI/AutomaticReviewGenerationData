[1] "The MEAM potentials were fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the lattice parameters, cohesive energies and surface energies of pure Pt and Pd metals, as well as the density functional theory calculation results of the lattice parameters and heat of formation of L12 Pt3Pd, L10 PtPd and L12 PtPd3 crystal."
[2] "Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk."
[3] "The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores."
[4] "In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets."

1. The MEAM potentials were calibrated to match the lattice parameters, cohesive energies, surface energies of pure Pt and Pd metals, as well as theoretical calculations for the lattice parameters and heat of formation of specific PtPd crystal structures.
2. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that Pd atoms segregated to the outermost layers of extended surfaces, with Pt concentration increasing systematically from these surfaces towards the bulk.
3. Equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles exhibited Pd-enriched outer layers and Pt-enriched inner cores.
4. Predictions indicated that Pd atoms preferentially segregated onto the (100) facets compared to the (111) facets within the nanoparticle shells.

1. MEAM势函数被调整以匹配纯Pt和Pd金属的晶格参数、结合能和表面能，以及L12 Pt3Pd、L10 PtPd和L12 PtPd3晶体结构的密度泛函理论计算结果。
2. 蒙特卡罗模拟显示，Pd原子在扩展表面的最外层中发生聚集，Pt浓度从这些表面向内部材料逐渐增加。
3. 平衡状态下的PtPd纳米颗粒具有Pd富集的外壳和Pt富集的核心。
4. 预测表明，在纳米粒子壳层中，Pd原子更倾向于聚集在(100)晶面而不是(111)晶面上。
