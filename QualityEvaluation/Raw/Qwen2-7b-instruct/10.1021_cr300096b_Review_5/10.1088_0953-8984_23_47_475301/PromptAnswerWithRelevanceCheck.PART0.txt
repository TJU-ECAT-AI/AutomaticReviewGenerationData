The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. In the case of PtPd alloys, the simulations revealed that Pd atoms tend to segregate towards the outermost layers of both extended surfaces and nanoparticle surfaces, leading to an increasing Pt concentration moving from the surface into the bulk. Moreover, the equilibrium nanoparticles exhibit Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. Particularly, the Pd atoms are predicted to preferentially segregate to the (100) facets over the (111) facets in the shells of these nanoparticles. These findings suggest that the specific surface configurations and atomic arrangements play crucial roles in determining the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation method combined with modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials was employed to explore the behavior of PtPd alloys. The MEAM potentials were calibrated to match the experimental data on lattice parameters, cohesive energies, surface energies, and theoretical calculations of lattice parameters and heat of formation for various PtPd crystals. The simulation revealed that Pd atoms tend to segregate to the outermost layers of the extended surfaces, leading to an increasing Pt concentration moving from the surface into the bulk of the alloy. Furthermore, the equilibrium nanoparticles of the alloy demonstrated a unique structure with Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. Particularly, Pd atoms were predicted to preferentially segregate to the (100) facets over the (111) facets in the nanoparticle shell. These findings highlight the importance of surface segregation and the distribution of elements within the alloy structure, which consequently impact the catalytic properties and performance of PtPd-based catalysts in various applications.
