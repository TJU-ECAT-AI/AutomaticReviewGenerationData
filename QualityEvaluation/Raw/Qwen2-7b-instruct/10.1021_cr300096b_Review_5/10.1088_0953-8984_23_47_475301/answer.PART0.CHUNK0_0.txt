[1] "The MEAM potentials were fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the lattice parameters, cohesive energies and surface energies of pure Pt and Pd metals, as well as the density functional theory calculation results of the lattice parameters and heat of formation of L12 Pt3Pd, L10 PtPd and L12 PtPd3 crystal."
[2] "Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk."
[3] "The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores."
[4] "In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets."

1. The MEAM potentials were calibrated to mirror the lattice parameters, cohesive energies, and surface energies of pure platinum and palladium metals, as well as the lattice parameters and enthalpy of formation of specific crystal structures through density functional theory calculations.

2. The Monte Carlo simulations revealed that palladium atoms tend to segregate at the outermost layers of the extended surfaces, with the concentration of platinum increasing steadily from the surface into the bulk material.

3. Equilibrium nanoparticles composed of platinum-palladium alloys exhibit a palladium-enriched outer layer and a platinum-enriched core structure.

4. Within the shell of these nanoparticles, palladium atoms are forecasted to preferentially segregate onto the (100) facets over the (111) facets.

1. MEAM势函数被拟合以重现纯铂和钯金属的晶格参数、结合能和表面能，以及通过密度泛函理论计算获得的特定晶体结构的晶格参数和形成热。

2. 蒙特卡洛模拟表明，钯原子倾向于在扩展表面的最外层聚集，铂浓度从表面均匀增加至内部主体。

3. 平衡的铂钯合金纳米粒子具有钯富集的外壳和铂富集的核心结构。

4. 这些纳米粒子的壳层中，钯原子预测会优先分布在(100)晶面而非(111)晶面上。
