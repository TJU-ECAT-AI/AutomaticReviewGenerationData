[1] "The MEAM potentials were fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the lattice parameters, cohesive energies and surface energies of pure Pt and Pd metals, as well as the density functional theory calculation results of the lattice parameters and heat of formation of L12 Pt3Pd, L10 PtPd and L12 PtPd3 crystal."
[2] "Using the MC method and the developed MEAM potentials, we calculated the Pt concentrations in the outermost three layers of the equilibrium (111), (100) and (110) extended surfaces as well as the outermost surfaces of the equilibrium cubo-octahedral nanoparticles of PtPd alloys."
[3] "Our simulation results showed that the Pd atoms would segregate into the outermost layers of the extended surfaces and the Pt concentration would increase monotonically from the extended surfaces into the bulk."
[4] "The equilibrium PtPd nanoparticles were found to have Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores."
[5] "In the shell of the PtPd nanoparticles, the Pd atoms were predicted to preferably segregate to the (100) facets rather than the (111) facets."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation method combined with modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials was employed to explore the behavior of PtPd alloys. The MEAM potentials were calibrated to match the experimental data on lattice parameters, cohesive energies, surface energies, and theoretical calculations of lattice parameters and heat of formation for various PtPd crystals. The simulation revealed that Pd atoms tend to segregate to the outermost layers of the extended surfaces, leading to an increasing Pt concentration moving from the surface into the bulk of the alloy. Furthermore, the equilibrium nanoparticles of the alloy demonstrated a unique structure with Pd-enriched shells and Pt-enriched cores. Particularly, Pd atoms were predicted to preferentially segregate to the (100) facets over the (111) facets in the nanoparticle shell. These findings highlight the importance of surface segregation and the distribution of elements within the alloy structure, which consequently impact the catalytic properties and performance of PtPd-based catalysts in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分离以及结构配置产生了显著影响，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。本研究通过蒙特卡洛模拟方法结合修改后的嵌入原子方法（MEAM）势能函数来探讨铂钯合金的行为。MEAM势能被校准以匹配实验数据的晶格参数、凝聚能、表面能以及理论计算的晶格参数和形成热，适用于不同类型的铂钯晶体。模拟结果表明，钯原子倾向于在扩展表面的外层分离，导致合金从表面到内部的铂浓度逐渐增加。此外，合金的平衡纳米颗粒显示出独特的结构，具有钯富集的壳层和铂富集的核心。特别地，在纳米颗粒的外壳中，钯原子被预测优先分离到(100)晶面而不是(111)晶面。这些发现强调了表面分离以及合金结构中元素分布的重要性，这进而影响铂钯基催化剂在各种应用中的催化性能和表现。
