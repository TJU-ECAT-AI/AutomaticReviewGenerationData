1. STM experiments show that Au deposition on Pt clusters leads to the formation of bimetallic PtAu clusters, as Au atoms seed at existing Pt nuclei. LEIS studies were conducted on clusters with bulk compositions ranging from 25% to 87.5% Pt, revealing a Pt coreAu shell structure based on the thermodynamics predicting a lower surface free energy for Au compared to Pt.

2. Thermodynamic principles predict that bimetallic PtAu clusters will have a Pt core and an Au shell due to the lower surface free energy of Au and the large bulk miscibility gap between the two metals.

3. When the total metal coverage is 0.25 ML, the PtAu clusters' surface composition changes with temperature, as indicated by the Au and Pt signals in Figure 5.

4. CO desorption from PtAu clusters continues up to an Au coverage of 3 ML, showing that the Pt content affects CO desorption.

5. O2 is another adsorbate that can induce changes in the composition of bimetallic alloys and thin films, but these changes typically occur at high pressures and elevated temperatures, unlike the CO-induced changes observed in this study.

[1] "The ability to tailor active sites for specific desired reactions has long been a goal for the design and development of superior catalysts."
[2] "To this end, bimetallic surfaces have shown great promise as novel catalytic materials since bimetallics are known to exhibit properties that are distinctly different from the single metal constituents."
[3] "Recent studies have also demonstrated that the cluster-support interface can play a major role in the chemistry of supported metal clusters, particularly for Au on reducible oxide supports like titania."
[4] "The ultimate goal of this work is to provide fundamental understanding on how the catalytic activity can be tailored through the control of bimetallic surface sites and interactions between the clusters and the support."
[5] "The presence of Pt in the bimetallic clusters also suppresses cluster sintering, (20) which is a potential problem when the catalysts are heated in air in order to remove residual carbon species."
[6] "Furthermore, the PtAu system is interesting to study because Au and Pt undergo qualitatively different interactions with the titania support: Pt clusters become encapsulated by reduced titania upon heating in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) (20, 22-25) or in H2 (26-28) while Au clusters do not encapsulate. (29)"
[7] "In this work, we have examined the growth and surface chemistry of bimetallic PtAu clusters vapor-deposited on TiO2(110)."
[8] "For the clusters with a total coverage of 0.25 ML, changes in the Au and Pt signals with heating are shown in Figure 5."
[9] "For the pure 0.25 ML Pt clusters, the 40% loss in Au signal during heating to 1000 K is attributed to a combination of cluster sintering and Au desorption, which has an onset temperature of 1000 K."
[10] "CO desorption from the 0.25 ML Pt + 0.25 ML Au clusters is observed even when the surfaces are pure Au, indicating that Pt diffusion to the cluster surface is driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds."
[11] "The yield of CO2 produced from oxidation of CO scales with the amount of Pt at the surface of the bimetallic clusters."
[12] "CO oxidation does not occur in the absence of Pt surface sites since O2 does not dissociate at Au surface sites."
[13] "The lack of CO oxidation on the clusters consisting of 100% Au at the surface is attributed to the inability to dissociate O2 on the PtAu clusters."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by determining the most energetically favorable states and processes. For instance, the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap between the two metals favor the formation of a Pt core-Au shell structure, enhancing the stability of bimetallic clusters. Reaction conditions, such as the presence of adsorbates like CO and O2, can drive the diffusion of metal atoms to the surface, altering the surface composition and structure. The interactions between the clusters and the support material, like titania, also play a crucial role, affecting the catalytic properties. For example, Pt clusters tend to encapsulate by reduced titania upon heating, whereas Au clusters do not. This behavior influences the surface segregation and, consequently, the catalytic performance. The presence of Pt in the bimetallic system helps suppress cluster sintering, which enhances the stability of the catalyst. The catalytic activity can be tailored by controlling the bimetallic surface sites and the interactions between the clusters and the support. The yield of CO2 produced from CO oxidation is influenced by the amount of Pt present on the surface, highlighting the importance of Pt in the oxidation process. CO oxidation does not occur on the PtAu clusters with 100% Au at the surface due to the inability of O2 to dissociate at Au sites, emphasizing the critical role of Pt surface sites in the oxidation mechanism.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分选以及结构配置。例如，Au表面自由能低于Pt且两者之间具有较大的晶粒性间隙，有利于形成Pt内核-Au壳层结构，增强双金属簇的稳定性。反应条件，如吸附物如CO和O2的存在，可以驱动金属原子扩散至表面，改变表面组成和结构。簇与支持材料（如二氧化钛）之间的相互作用也起着关键作用，影响催化性能。例如，Pt簇倾向于通过还原的二氧化钛进行封装，而Au簇则不会。这种行为影响表面分选，并进而影响催化性能。Pt在双金属系统中的存在有助于抑制簇的聚集，增强催化剂的稳定性。可以通过控制双金属表面位点和簇与支持之间的相互作用来调整催化活性。CO氧化产物的产生量受表面Pt含量的影响，强调了Pt在氧化过程中的重要性。在表面完全为Au的PtAu簇上，由于O2无法在Au表面位点分解，CO氧化不发生，这突出了表面Pt位点在氧化机制中的关键作用。

[1] "The growth, surface composition, and chemical activity of bimetallic PtAu clusters on TiO2(110) have been investigated."
[2] "For bulk compositions ranging from 25%87.5% Pt with total metal coverages of 0.25 and 0.50 ML, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt."
[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."
[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites."
[5] "Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure."
[6] "The presence of Au does not prevent migration of TiOx onto the surface of the PtAu clusters."
[7] "After the PtAu clusters are annealed, the extent of Pt encapsulation on the surface of the PtAu clusters is similar to that on the pure Pt clusters although there is some evidence that the encapsulation is slightly less extensive on the PtAu clusters at 800 K compared to pure Pt."
[8] "Notably, Au films deposited on Pt(111) (111, 112) and highly stepped Pt(553) (112) form PtAu alloys at temperatures above 800 K as Au diffuses into the Pt surface."
[9] "On Pt(111), the CO desorption peak shape is relatively symmetric and the maximum desorption intensity occurs at 400420 K although a shoulder is detected at 500 K in some cases."
[10] "When the Pt(111) surface is sputtered and annealed only to 600 K prior to CO adsorption in order to introduce a greater number of defect sites, a CO desorption peak at 500 K appears in addition to the main peak at 420 K."
[11] "CO desorption from Pt films on Au or Au films on Pt is different from on the PtAu clusters because CO does not appear to induce diffusion of Pt to the surface."
[12] "Specifically, it appears that O2 does not dissociate on the PtAu clusters, and therefore subsequent exposure of the surface to CO does not produce CO2, which is observed in reaction only on the pure Pt clusters."
[13] "Studies of the activity on Au overlayers deposited on Pt(335) also demonstrate that no oxygen dissociation occurs when Pt is completely covered with Au, (55) implying that electronic modification of Au by Pt does not make Au sites active for O2 dissociation."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts by determining the energetics of adsorbates binding to the catalyst surface. For Pt-based systems, the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt, along with the bulk miscibility gap between the two metals, dictates that the surfaces of bimetallic PtAu clusters tend to consist of a shell of Au over a core of Pt when Au is the dominant component. 

2. Reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific adsorbates can drive the migration of metal atoms from the bulk to the surface, as seen with CO inducing the diffusion of Pt to the surface of PtAu clusters, enhancing its catalytic activity. The thermodynamic stability of the PtAu configuration is influenced by the binding energies of adsorbates, which can promote or hinder the surface segregation of one metal over another.

3. The catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts are impacted by the surface composition and structure, as well as the electronic interactions between the two metals. For instance, CO oxidation is inhibited on PtAu clusters with a pure Au surface, indicating that the lack of Pt sites prevents the dissociation of O2 necessary for the reaction to proceed.

4. The implications of these findings are that by controlling the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, their activity for specific reactions can be tailored. This knowledge is crucial for designing catalysts with enhanced performance for various applications, such as improving the efficiency of methanol fuel cells or developing catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

5. The migration of metal atoms in clusters is facilitated by the lower coordination numbers and higher mobility of atoms within the cluster structure compared to in the bulk. This mobility allows for the dynamic rearrangement of atoms in response to external stimuli, affecting the catalytic activity of the material.

6. The stability and reactivity of bimetallic catalysts are sensitive to electronic modifications introduced by alloying. In particular, Au and Pt can form alloys at high pressures or temperatures, which can alter their reactivity towards adsorbates like O2 and CO.

7. The presence of Au on the surface of Pt-based catalysts can inhibit the dissociation of O2, which is a critical step in CO oxidation reactions. This is due to the lower adsorption energy of O2 on Au compared to Pt, preventing the necessary O2 dissociation for CO oxidation to occur.

8. The catalytic performance of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts can be enhanced by optimizing the balance between the two metals, considering their individual activities and interactions. For example, the presence of Pt in the bimetallic system can suppress cluster sintering and enhance the activity for specific reactions, while Au can inhibit poisoning of Pt sites by certain adsorbates.

9. The thermodynamic stability of the PtAu configuration on the surface of the catalyst influences the reactivity of the system. When the surface composition is such that Au is dominant, it can affect the adsorption and dissociation of reactants like O2 and CO, leading to altered catalytic activity.

10. The surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, such as the presence of Au or Pt, can significantly impact the catalytic activity for reactions like CO oxidation. The lack of Pt sites on the surface of PtAu clusters with a pure Au composition prevents the dissociation of O2, which is essential for CO oxidation.

11. The diffusion of Au into the Pt surface upon deposition of Au films on Pt(111) or highly stepped Pt(553) surfaces leads to the formation of PtAu alloys at high temperatures. This alloying process can modify the electronic properties of the surface, affecting the reactivity towards adsorbates and altering the catalytic performance of the material.

12. The presence of defects or impurities on the surface, such as steps and kinks, can lead to enhanced reactivity for reactions like CO desorption. These defect sites are more accessible to adsorbates and can facilitate the dissociation of adsorbates, influencing the catalytic activity of the material.

13. The diffusion of metal atoms to the surface of catalysts, driven by adsorbates or temperature, can significantly impact the reactivity of the material. This process can lead to the formation of active sites that enhance the efficiency of catalytic reactions, such as CO oxidation, by providing more surface area for the reaction to occur.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件通过决定吸附剂与催化剂表面的能性，影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置。对于Pt基系统，Au的较低表面自由能与Pt形成对比，以及两种金属在宏观尺度上的可混溶性，决定了当Au是主导成分时，双金属PtAu簇表面倾向于由覆盖在Pt核心之上的Au壳层构成。

2. 反应条件如温度、压力和特定吸附剂的存在，可以驱动金属原子从宏观体向表面的迁移，例如CO诱导Pt在PtAu簇表面上扩散，从而增强其催化活性。热力学稳定性的变化取决于吸附剂的结合能量，这些能量可以促进或阻止表面金属的分离。

3. 双金属Pt基催化剂的催化特性和性能受表面组成和结构的影响，以及两种金属之间的电子相互作用。例如，在纯Au表面上缺乏Pt位点阻碍了O2的解离，从而抑制了CO氧化反应。

4. 通过控制双金属催化剂的组成和结构，可以调整其针对特定反应的活性，这对于设计具有增强性能的催化剂以用于各种应用至关重要，例如改进甲醇燃料电池的效率或开发用于脱氢烃的催化剂。

5. 集群中金属原子的迁移依赖于集群结构内较低的配位数和较高的原子流动性，这使得原子对刺激的响应更加动态，影响材料的催化活性。

6. Au和Pt在高压力或温度下形成的合金可以改变表面的电子性质，影响吸附剂如O2和CO的吸附性，进而影响催化剂的活性。

7. Pt基催化剂表面Au的存在可以抑制O2的解离，这是CO氧化反应的关键步骤。由于Au上O2的吸附能较低，防止了必要的O2解离，导致CO氧化不能在纯Au表面上发生。

8. 通过优化两种金属之间的平衡，考虑它们各自的活性和相互作用，可以提高双金属Pt基催化剂的性能。例如，Pt的存在可以抑制Pt位点由某些吸附剂中毒，而Au可以抑制Pt位点被某些吸附剂中毒。

9. 双金属催化剂表面组成的稳定性影响系统的反应性。当表面组成以Au为主导时，它会影响吸附剂和反应物如O2和CO的吸附和解离，从而改变催化剂的活性。

10. PtAu簇表面的Au或Pt的存在显著影响CO氧化等反应的活性。纯Au表面上缺乏Pt位点阻止了O2的解离，这是CO氧化过程所必需的。

11. Au沉积到Pt（111）或高度台阶状Pt（553）表面后，通过加热导致Pt表面形成PtAu合金。这种合金化过程可以修改表面的电子性质，影响吸附剂的活性，并改变材料的催化性能。

12. 表面缺陷或杂质如台阶和尖角的存在可以显著影响反应活性，如CO脱附。这些缺陷点更容易接触到吸附剂，可以促进吸附剂的解离，从而影响材料的催化活性。

13. 由吸附剂或温度驱动的金属原子向表面的扩散可以显著影响材料的反应性。这一过程可能导致活性位点的形成，从而增加催化反应的效率，提供更多的表面面积供反应发生。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, in several ways. Firstly, the deposition of Au on Pt clusters results in the formation of bimetallic PtAu clusters due to the seeding of mobile Au atoms at existing Pt nuclei. For bulk compositions ranging from 25%87.5% Pt with total metal coverages of 0.25 and 0.50 ML, the cluster surfaces consist of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, especially when the clusters are initially pure Au at the surface. The presence of Au in the bimetallic clusters suppresses cluster sintering, making it less likely to occur when the catalysts are heated in air to remove residual carbon species. The dynamic nature of the bimetallic clusters in the presence of adsorbates, such as CO, allows for the induction of Pt surface segregation, illustrating the interplay between the catalytic properties and performance of these systems under various conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离以及结构配置产生了影响。首先，Au在Pt簇上的沉积导致形成PtAu双金属簇，这是由于移动的Au原子在现有Pt核上播种的结果。对于从25%到87.5%的Pt组分与总金属覆盖度为0.25和0.50 ML的体系，簇表面主要由Au组成，当Pt含量达到50%及以下时。CO在PtAu簇上的吸附在室温下促进了Pt向簇表面的扩散，特别是在初始纯Au表面的簇中更为明显。Au的存在减少了簇的熔合，使得在加热空气以去除残留碳物种时更不容易发生。在吸附剂如CO存在的条件下，双金属簇表现出动态性，可以诱导Pt表面分离，这揭示了在不同条件下这些系统催化特性和性能之间的相互作用。
