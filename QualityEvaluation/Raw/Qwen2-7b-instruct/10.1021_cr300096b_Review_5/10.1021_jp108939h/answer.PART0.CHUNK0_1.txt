[1] "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments demonstrate that the deposition of Au on Pt clusters results in the formation of bimetallic PtAu clusters due to the seeding of the mobile Au atoms at existing Pt nuclei."
[2] "The presence of Au does not prevent migration of TiOx onto the surface of the PtAu clusters."
[3] "The yield of CO2 produced from oxidation of CO scales with the amount of Pt at the surface of the bimetallic clusters."
[4] "CO oxidation does not occur in the absence of Pt surface sites since O2 does not dissociate at Au surface sites."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Au atoms tend to seed at existing Pt nuclei during the deposition process, leading to the formation of bimetallic PtAu clusters.
2. The migration of TiOx onto the surface of PtAu clusters is not hindered by the presence of Au.
3. The efficiency of CO2 production from CO oxidation is proportional to the amount of Pt present on the surface of the bimetallic clusters.
4. Without Pt surface sites, CO oxidation cannot occur because O2 does not dissociate at Au sites.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. Au原子倾向于在现有Pt核上播种，从而形成PtAu双金属簇。
2. Au的存在不会阻止TiOx向PtAu簇表面迁移。
3. CO氧化效率与簇表面Pt的数量成正比。
4. 缺乏Pt表面位点时，CO氧化无法发生，因为O2不能在Au位点分解。
