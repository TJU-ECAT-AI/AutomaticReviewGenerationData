1. STM experiments show that Au deposition on Pt clusters leads to the formation of bimetallic PtAu clusters, as Au atoms seed at existing Pt nuclei. LEIS studies were conducted on clusters with bulk compositions ranging from 25% to 87.5% Pt, revealing a Pt coreAu shell structure based on the thermodynamics predicting a lower surface free energy for Au compared to Pt.

2. Thermodynamic principles predict that bimetallic PtAu clusters will have a Pt core and an Au shell due to the lower surface free energy of Au and the large bulk miscibility gap between the two metals.

3. When the total metal coverage is 0.25 ML, the PtAu clusters' surface composition changes with temperature, as indicated by the Au and Pt signals in Figure 5.

4. CO desorption from PtAu clusters continues up to an Au coverage of 3 ML, showing that the Pt content affects CO desorption.

5. O2 is another adsorbate that can induce changes in the composition of bimetallic alloys and thin films, but these changes typically occur at high pressures and elevated temperatures, unlike the CO-induced changes observed in this study.

1.STM实验表明，Au沉积在Pt簇上导致形成PtAu双金属簇，因为可移动的Au原子在现有Pt核上播种。对从25%到87.5%的Pt组成范围内的簇进行了LEIS研究，揭示了基于Au比Pt的更低表面自由能和两种金属的大块混溶间隙的热力学预测的Pt核心Au壳结构。

2. 热力学原则预测，由于Au的更低表面自由能和两种金属之间的大块混溶间隙，PtAu双金属簇将具有Pt核心和Au壳。

3. 当总金属覆盖度为0.25 ML时，通过图5中的Au和Pt信号变化，可以观察到PtAu簇表面组成的温度变化。

4. CO从PtAu簇的脱附直到Au覆盖度达到3 ML，显示Pt含量影响CO脱附。

5. O2是另一种可以诱导合金和薄膜中组成变化的吸附剂，但这些变化通常发生在高压力和升高温度下，与本研究中观察到的CO诱导变化不同。
