[1] "The ability to tailor active sites for specific desired reactions has long been a goal for the design and development of superior catalysts."
[2] "To this end, bimetallic surfaces have shown great promise as novel catalytic materials since bimetallics are known to exhibit properties that are distinctly different from the single metal constituents."
[3] "Recent studies have also demonstrated that the cluster-support interface can play a major role in the chemistry of supported metal clusters, particularly for Au on reducible oxide supports like titania."
[4] "The ultimate goal of this work is to provide fundamental understanding on how the catalytic activity can be tailored through the control of bimetallic surface sites and interactions between the clusters and the support."
[5] "The presence of Pt in the bimetallic clusters also suppresses cluster sintering, (20) which is a potential problem when the catalysts are heated in air in order to remove residual carbon species."
[6] "Furthermore, the PtAu system is interesting to study because Au and Pt undergo qualitatively different interactions with the titania support: Pt clusters become encapsulated by reduced titania upon heating in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) (20, 22-25) or in H2 (26-28) while Au clusters do not encapsulate. (29)"
[7] "In this work, we have examined the growth and surface chemistry of bimetallic PtAu clusters vapor-deposited on TiO2(110)."
[8] "For the clusters with a total coverage of 0.25 ML, changes in the Au and Pt signals with heating are shown in Figure 5."
[9] "For the pure 0.25 ML Pt clusters, the 40% loss in Au signal during heating to 1000 K is attributed to a combination of cluster sintering and Au desorption, which has an onset temperature of 1000 K."
[10] "CO desorption from the 0.25 ML Pt + 0.25 ML Au clusters is observed even when the surfaces are pure Au, indicating that Pt diffusion to the cluster surface is driven by the formation of strong Pt-CO bonds."
[11] "The yield of CO2 produced from oxidation of CO scales with the amount of Pt at the surface of the bimetallic clusters."
[12] "CO oxidation does not occur in the absence of Pt surface sites since O2 does not dissociate at Au surface sites."
[13] "The lack of CO oxidation on the clusters consisting of 100% Au at the surface is attributed to the inability to dissociate O2 on the PtAu clusters."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by determining the most energetically favorable states and processes. For instance, the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt and the large bulk miscibility gap between the two metals favor the formation of a Pt core-Au shell structure, enhancing the stability of bimetallic clusters. Reaction conditions, such as the presence of adsorbates like CO and O2, can drive the diffusion of metal atoms to the surface, altering the surface composition and structure. The interactions between the clusters and the support material, like titania, also play a crucial role, affecting the catalytic properties. For example, Pt clusters tend to encapsulate by reduced titania upon heating, whereas Au clusters do not. This behavior influences the surface segregation and, consequently, the catalytic performance. The presence of Pt in the bimetallic system helps suppress cluster sintering, which enhances the stability of the catalyst. The catalytic activity can be tailored by controlling the bimetallic surface sites and the interactions between the clusters and the support. The yield of CO2 produced from CO oxidation is influenced by the amount of Pt present on the surface, highlighting the importance of Pt in the oxidation process. CO oxidation does not occur on the PtAu clusters with 100% Au at the surface due to the inability of O2 to dissociate at Au sites, emphasizing the critical role of Pt surface sites in the oxidation mechanism.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分选以及结构配置。例如，Au表面自由能低于Pt且两者之间具有较大的晶粒性间隙，有利于形成Pt内核-Au壳层结构，增强双金属簇的稳定性。反应条件，如吸附物如CO和O2的存在，可以驱动金属原子扩散至表面，改变表面组成和结构。簇与支持材料（如二氧化钛）之间的相互作用也起着关键作用，影响催化性能。例如，Pt簇倾向于通过还原的二氧化钛进行封装，而Au簇则不会。这种行为影响表面分选，并进而影响催化性能。Pt在双金属系统中的存在有助于抑制簇的聚集，增强催化剂的稳定性。可以通过控制双金属表面位点和簇与支持之间的相互作用来调整催化活性。CO氧化产物的产生量受表面Pt含量的影响，强调了Pt在氧化过程中的重要性。在表面完全为Au的PtAu簇上，由于O2无法在Au表面位点分解，CO氧化不发生，这突出了表面Pt位点在氧化机制中的关键作用。
