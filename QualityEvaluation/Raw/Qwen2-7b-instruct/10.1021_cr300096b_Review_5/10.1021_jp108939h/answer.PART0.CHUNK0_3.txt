[1] "The growth, surface composition, and chemical activity of bimetallic PtAu clusters on TiO2(110) have been investigated."
[2] "For bulk compositions ranging from 25%87.5% Pt with total metal coverages of 0.25 and 0.50 ML, the cluster surfaces consisted of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower; however, a mix of Au and Pt atoms were found at the cluster surfaces at higher fractions of deposited Pt."
[3] "Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that it is thermodynamically favorable for Pt to diffuse to the cluster surface in order to bind to CO."
[4] "For CO oxidation, the first step in the reaction is the dissociation of O2 at Pt sites."
[5] "Since this process requires more than one contiguous Pt site, it is not surprising that O2 dissociation cannot occur on the PtAu clusters that are 100% Au at the surface before CO exposure."
[6] "The presence of Au does not prevent migration of TiOx onto the surface of the PtAu clusters."
[7] "After the PtAu clusters are annealed, the extent of Pt encapsulation on the surface of the PtAu clusters is similar to that on the pure Pt clusters although there is some evidence that the encapsulation is slightly less extensive on the PtAu clusters at 800 K compared to pure Pt."
[8] "Notably, Au films deposited on Pt(111) (111, 112) and highly stepped Pt(553) (112) form PtAu alloys at temperatures above 800 K as Au diffuses into the Pt surface."
[9] "On Pt(111), the CO desorption peak shape is relatively symmetric and the maximum desorption intensity occurs at 400420 K although a shoulder is detected at 500 K in some cases."
[10] "When the Pt(111) surface is sputtered and annealed only to 600 K prior to CO adsorption in order to introduce a greater number of defect sites, a CO desorption peak at 500 K appears in addition to the main peak at 420 K."
[11] "CO desorption from Pt films on Au or Au films on Pt is different from on the PtAu clusters because CO does not appear to induce diffusion of Pt to the surface."
[12] "Specifically, it appears that O2 does not dissociate on the PtAu clusters, and therefore subsequent exposure of the surface to CO does not produce CO2, which is observed in reaction only on the pure Pt clusters."
[13] "Studies of the activity on Au overlayers deposited on Pt(335) also demonstrate that no oxygen dissociation occurs when Pt is completely covered with Au, (55) implying that electronic modification of Au by Pt does not make Au sites active for O2 dissociation."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts by determining the energetics of adsorbates binding to the catalyst surface. For Pt-based systems, the lower surface free energy of Au compared to Pt, along with the bulk miscibility gap between the two metals, dictates that the surfaces of bimetallic PtAu clusters tend to consist of a shell of Au over a core of Pt when Au is the dominant component. 

2. Reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of specific adsorbates can drive the migration of metal atoms from the bulk to the surface, as seen with CO inducing the diffusion of Pt to the surface of PtAu clusters, enhancing its catalytic activity. The thermodynamic stability of the PtAu configuration is influenced by the binding energies of adsorbates, which can promote or hinder the surface segregation of one metal over another.

3. The catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts are impacted by the surface composition and structure, as well as the electronic interactions between the two metals. For instance, CO oxidation is inhibited on PtAu clusters with a pure Au surface, indicating that the lack of Pt sites prevents the dissociation of O2 necessary for the reaction to proceed.

4. The implications of these findings are that by controlling the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, their activity for specific reactions can be tailored. This knowledge is crucial for designing catalysts with enhanced performance for various applications, such as improving the efficiency of methanol fuel cells or developing catalysts for the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

5. The migration of metal atoms in clusters is facilitated by the lower coordination numbers and higher mobility of atoms within the cluster structure compared to in the bulk. This mobility allows for the dynamic rearrangement of atoms in response to external stimuli, affecting the catalytic activity of the material.

6. The stability and reactivity of bimetallic catalysts are sensitive to electronic modifications introduced by alloying. In particular, Au and Pt can form alloys at high pressures or temperatures, which can alter their reactivity towards adsorbates like O2 and CO.

7. The presence of Au on the surface of Pt-based catalysts can inhibit the dissociation of O2, which is a critical step in CO oxidation reactions. This is due to the lower adsorption energy of O2 on Au compared to Pt, preventing the necessary O2 dissociation for CO oxidation to occur.

8. The catalytic performance of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts can be enhanced by optimizing the balance between the two metals, considering their individual activities and interactions. For example, the presence of Pt in the bimetallic system can suppress cluster sintering and enhance the activity for specific reactions, while Au can inhibit poisoning of Pt sites by certain adsorbates.

9. The thermodynamic stability of the PtAu configuration on the surface of the catalyst influences the reactivity of the system. When the surface composition is such that Au is dominant, it can affect the adsorption and dissociation of reactants like O2 and CO, leading to altered catalytic activity.

10. The surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, such as the presence of Au or Pt, can significantly impact the catalytic activity for reactions like CO oxidation. The lack of Pt sites on the surface of PtAu clusters with a pure Au composition prevents the dissociation of O2, which is essential for CO oxidation.

11. The diffusion of Au into the Pt surface upon deposition of Au films on Pt(111) or highly stepped Pt(553) surfaces leads to the formation of PtAu alloys at high temperatures. This alloying process can modify the electronic properties of the surface, affecting the reactivity towards adsorbates and altering the catalytic performance of the material.

12. The presence of defects or impurities on the surface, such as steps and kinks, can lead to enhanced reactivity for reactions like CO desorption. These defect sites are more accessible to adsorbates and can facilitate the dissociation of adsorbates, influencing the catalytic activity of the material.

13. The diffusion of metal atoms to the surface of catalysts, driven by adsorbates or temperature, can significantly impact the reactivity of the material. This process can lead to the formation of active sites that enhance the efficiency of catalytic reactions, such as CO oxidation, by providing more surface area for the reaction to occur.
