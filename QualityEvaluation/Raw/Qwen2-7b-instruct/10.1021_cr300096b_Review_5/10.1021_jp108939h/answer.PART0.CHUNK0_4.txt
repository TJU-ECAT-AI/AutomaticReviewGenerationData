The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, in several ways. Firstly, the deposition of Au on Pt clusters results in the formation of bimetallic PtAu clusters due to the seeding of mobile Au atoms at existing Pt nuclei. For bulk compositions ranging from 25%87.5% Pt with total metal coverages of 0.25 and 0.50 ML, the cluster surfaces consist of nearly pure Au at Pt compositions of 50% and lower. The adsorption of CO on the PtAu clusters at room temperature promotes the diffusion of Pt to the surface of the clusters, especially when the clusters are initially pure Au at the surface. The presence of Au in the bimetallic clusters suppresses cluster sintering, making it less likely to occur when the catalysts are heated in air to remove residual carbon species. The dynamic nature of the bimetallic clusters in the presence of adsorbates, such as CO, allows for the induction of Pt surface segregation, illustrating the interplay between the catalytic properties and performance of these systems under various conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离以及结构配置产生了影响。首先，Au在Pt簇上的沉积导致形成PtAu双金属簇，这是由于移动的Au原子在现有Pt核上播种的结果。对于从25%到87.5%的Pt组分与总金属覆盖度为0.25和0.50 ML的体系，簇表面主要由Au组成，当Pt含量达到50%及以下时。CO在PtAu簇上的吸附在室温下促进了Pt向簇表面的扩散，特别是在初始纯Au表面的簇中更为明显。Au的存在减少了簇的熔合，使得在加热空气以去除残留碳物种时更不容易发生。在吸附剂如CO存在的条件下，双金属簇表现出动态性，可以诱导Pt表面分离，这揭示了在不同条件下这些系统催化特性和性能之间的相互作用。
