[1] "The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions."
[2] "The consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications depend on how these factors interact."
[3] "For instance, in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, the presence of another metal can lead to changes in the surface composition and structure, affecting the catalytic activity."
[4] "These changes might result in improved selectivity, increased turnover frequency, or altered reaction pathways, depending on the specific metal combination and reaction conditions."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors influence the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For example, the presence of another metal in a Pt-based system can alter the surface composition and structure, potentially enhancing selectivity, increasing the turnover frequency, or changing the reaction pathways. The specific metal combination and reaction conditions determine the catalytic behavior.
