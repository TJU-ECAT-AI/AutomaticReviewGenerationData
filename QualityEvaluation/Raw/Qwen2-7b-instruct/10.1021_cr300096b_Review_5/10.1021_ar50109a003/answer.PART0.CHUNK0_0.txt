[1] "The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys."
[2] "These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications."
[3] "For instance, in the case of Pt-based systems, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, the interatomic interactions, and the energy barriers for alloy formation."
[4] "Surface segregation patterns are affected by the kinetic processes, such as nucleation and growth, which dictate how the metals distribute themselves on the surface."
[5] "Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can also be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of the nanoparticles, which in turn impacts their reactivity and selectivity."
