          [1] "The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys."
          [2] "These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications."
          [3] "For instance, in the case of Pt-based systems, the thermodynamic stability is influenced by the composition, the interatomic interactions, and the energy barriers for alloy formation."
          [4] "Surface segregation patterns are affected by the kinetic processes, such as nucleation and growth, which dictate how the metals distribute themselves on the surface."
          [5] "Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can also be tuned by controlling the size, shape, and orientation of the nanoparticles, which in turn impacts their reactivity and selectivity."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications. The thermodynamic stability of Pt-based systems is influenced by the composition, interatomic interactions, and energy barriers for alloy formation. Surface segregation patterns are determined by kinetic processes such as nucleation and growth, which control the distribution of metals on the surface. Structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted by manipulating the size, shape, and orientation of nanoparticles, affecting their reactivity and selectivity.
