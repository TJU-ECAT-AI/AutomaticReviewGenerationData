1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. For instance, in Pt-Fe alloys, altering the substrate temperature can transition the deposition mode from island growth to layer growth. This occurs due to the enhanced bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms at higher temperatures, decreasing interface energy and favoring layer growth. 

2. These changes in structure are crucial for their catalytic properties and performance. The ability to switch between metallic Fe, FeO, and subsurface Fe on Pt(111) surfaces, via oxidation and reduction treatments, indicates the potential for reversible modulation of the catalyst's performance.

3. At a specific substrate temperature of 487 K, monolayer Fe films were successfully formed on Pt(111). A transition from island to layer growth of Fe films was observed when the substrate temperature was lowered to 300 K. This temperature change facilitated a stronger bonding between Fe and Pt, leading to layer growth.

4. Higher substrate temperatures enhanced the bonding between Fe and Pt, which decreased the interface energy and promoted layer growth of Fe on Pt(111).

5. By oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, Fe atoms can be brought back to the topmost surface, forming the FeO/Pt(111) surface.

6. The reversible modulation of surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces is possible through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. This provides flexibility in adjusting the catalyst's properties for different applications.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件可以显著影响双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt系统的稳定、表面分层和结构配置。例如，在Pt-Fe合金中，改变基板温度可以从岛生长转变为层生长的沉积模式。这发生于较高温度下，Fe原子与表面Pt原子之间的增强结合导致界面能降低，有利于在Pt(111)上形成层状生长的Fe。

2. 这些结构变化对于其催化性质和性能至关重要。通过氧化和还原处理可切换表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe在Pt(111)表面上的结构，表明催化剂性能可逆调节的可能性。

3. 在特定基板温度487 K下，成功在Pt(111)上形成了单层Fe薄膜。当基板温度降至300 K时，观察到Fe薄膜从岛状生长转变为层状生长的转变。这种温度变化促进了Fe和Pt之间更强的结合，从而促进层状生长在Pt(111)上。

4. 较高的基板温度增强了Fe和Pt之间的结合，降低了界面能，并促进了在Pt(111)上形成层状生长的Fe。

5. 通过在O2中氧化Pt/Fe/Pt(111)表面，可以使Fe原子返回到最表面，形成FeO/Pt(111)表面。

6. 通过循环氧化和还原处理，可以在Pt(111)表面上可逆调节表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe结构。这为不同应用调整催化剂性质提供了灵活性。
