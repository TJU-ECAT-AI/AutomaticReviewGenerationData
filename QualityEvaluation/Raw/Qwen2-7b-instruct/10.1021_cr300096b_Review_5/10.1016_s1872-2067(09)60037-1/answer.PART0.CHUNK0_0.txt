[1] "Monolayer Fe films were formed on Pt(111) at 487 K. A transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited on Pt(111) was observed when the substrate temperature changed from 487 K to 300 K. The higher temperature induced a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."
[2] "The monolayer Fe films grown on Pt(111) can be driven into the subsurface region by UHV annealing up to 850 K, which formed the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111)."
[3] "Fe can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. Higher temperatures promote a strong bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms, decreasing interface energy and favoring layer growth of Fe on Pt(111). This leads to the formation of Pt-skin structures when Fe is driven into the subsurface region via UHV annealing. Oxidation of the Pt-skin structure in O2 transforms it into a FeO surface structure, which can revert to a surface Fe structure through mild reduction in H2. These reversible transformations of surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe enable the control of catalyst properties, enhancing their performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的稳定、表面分层和结构配置有显著影响。较高温度促进Fe原子团与表面Pt原子之间形成强烈键合，降低界面能，有利于在Pt(111)上形成层状生长的Fe。这导致通过高真空退火将Fe驱动至亚表面区域形成Pt-皮层结构。在O2中氧化Pt-皮层结构可转化为FeO表面结构，通过在H2中的温和还原可重新转变为表面Fe结构。这些可逆转换使表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe的结构得以控制，从而增强其在各种应用中的性能。
