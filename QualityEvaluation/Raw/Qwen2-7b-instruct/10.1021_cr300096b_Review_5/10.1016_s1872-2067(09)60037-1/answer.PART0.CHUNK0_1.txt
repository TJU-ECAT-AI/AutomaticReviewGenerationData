[1] "Fe can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) surface."
[2] "The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."
[3] "The higher temperature induced a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys. These conditions determine whether the alloy forms in the surface, subsurface, or bulk regions. For instance, higher temperatures promote a stronger bonding between Fe and Pt atoms, decreasing the interface energy and favoring layer growth of Fe on Pt(111). Conversely, at lower temperatures, island growth occurs. Oxidative environments can lead to surface segregation, forming FeO structures on the Pt surface, while reducing conditions can revert these structures to metallic Fe. This reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces offers flexibility in tailoring catalyst properties for specific applications, such as enhanced catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reactions or efficient oxidation of carbon monoxide. The specific surface configurations and their catalytic performances are closely linked to the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics at the metal-metal interface.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的如Pt-Fe合金的稳定性、表面分层、和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件决定了合金是在表面、亚表面还是基体区域形成。例如，较高的温度促进了Fe和Pt原子之间的强烈结合，降低了界面能，有利于在Pt(111)上形成Fe层生长。相反，在较低的温度下，则会发生岛状生长。氧化性环境可能导致表面分层，形成Pt表面上的FeO结构，而还原条件可以将这些结构还原为金属Fe。这种Pt(111)表面Fe结构的可逆调节提供了调整催化剂特性的灵活性，以适应特定的应用，如增强氧还原反应中的催化活性或有效氧化一氧化碳。特定的表面配置及其催化性能与金属-金属界面处的热力学和动力学之间的相互作用密切相关。
