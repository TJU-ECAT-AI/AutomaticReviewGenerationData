[1] "Monolayer Fe films were formed on Pt(111) at 487 K. A transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited on Pt(111) was observed when the substrate temperature changed from 487 K to 300 K. The higher temperature induced a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."
[2] "The monolayer Fe films grown on Pt(111) can be driven into the subsurface region by UHV annealing up to 850 K, which formed the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111)."
[3] "Fe can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. Higher temperatures promote a strong bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms, decreasing interface energy and favoring layer growth of Fe on Pt(111). This leads to the formation of Pt-skin structures when Fe is driven into the subsurface region via UHV annealing. Oxidation of the Pt-skin structure in O2 transforms it into a FeO surface structure, which can revert to a surface Fe structure through mild reduction in H2. These reversible transformations of surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe enable the control of catalyst properties, enhancing their performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的稳定、表面分层和结构配置有显著影响。较高温度促进Fe原子团与表面Pt原子之间形成强烈键合，降低界面能，有利于在Pt(111)上形成层状生长的Fe。这导致通过高真空退火将Fe驱动至亚表面区域形成Pt-皮层结构。在O2中氧化Pt-皮层结构可转化为FeO表面结构，通过在H2中的温和还原可重新转变为表面Fe结构。这些可逆转换使表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe的结构得以控制，从而增强其在各种应用中的性能。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys. These conditions determine whether the alloy forms in the surface, subsurface, or bulk regions. For instance, higher temperatures promote a stronger bonding between Fe and Pt atoms, decreasing the interface energy and favoring layer growth of Fe on Pt(111). Conversely, at lower temperatures, island growth occurs. Oxidative environments can lead to surface segregation, forming FeO structures on the Pt surface, while reducing conditions can revert these structures to metallic Fe. This reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces offers flexibility in tailoring catalyst properties for specific applications, such as enhanced catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reactions or efficient oxidation of carbon monoxide. The specific surface configurations and their catalytic performances are closely linked to the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics at the metal-metal interface.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt系统的如Pt-Fe合金的稳定性、表面分层、和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件决定了合金是在表面、亚表面还是基体区域形成。例如，较高的温度促进了Fe和Pt原子之间的强烈结合，降低了界面能，有利于在Pt(111)上形成Fe层生长。相反，在较低的温度下，则会发生岛状生长。氧化性环境可能导致表面分层，形成Pt表面上的FeO结构，而还原条件可以将这些结构还原为金属Fe。这种Pt(111)表面Fe结构的可逆调节提供了调整催化剂特性的灵活性，以适应特定的应用，如增强氧还原反应中的催化活性或有效氧化一氧化碳。特定的表面配置及其催化性能与金属-金属界面处的热力学和动力学之间的相互作用密切相关。

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability and configuration of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as the surface energy, interface energy, and kinetic limitations during growth.

2. The transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited on Pt(111) occurs when the substrate temperature is altered from 487 K to 300 K. Higher temperatures promote a stronger bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms, decreasing the interface energy and favoring the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111).

3. Monolayer Fe films on Pt(111) can be driven into the subsurface region through UHV annealing at temperatures up to 850 K, creating a Pt-skin structure. This structure involves Fe in the subsurface region and Pt on the surface.

4. By oxidizing the Pt-skin surface in O2, Fe can be returned to the topmost surface, forming a FeO/Pt(111) surface. The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe configurations on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置产生了重大影响。这些催化剂的稳定性及其配置受到诸如表面能量、界面能量以及生长过程中的动力学限制等因子的影响。

2. 当将沉积在Pt(111)上的Fe的沉积温度从487 K改变到300 K时，观察到层生长转变为岛状生长的转变。更高的温度促进了Fe原子团与表面Pt原子之间的强烈结合，降低了界面能量，并有利于在Pt(111)上形成Fe层。

3. 在487 K下形成的单层Fe薄膜可以通过在850 K的高真空环境中进行退火，被驱动进入Pt(111)的亚表面区域，形成Pt-Fe-Pt(111)结构。该结构包含在亚表面区域的Fe和表面的Pt。

4. 通过在O2中氧化Pt-Fe-Pt(111)表面，Fe可以返回至顶层表面，形成FeO/Pt(111)表面。通过循环氧化和还原处理，可以可逆地控制Pt(111)表面上的表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe配置。

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems. For instance, in Pt-Fe alloys, altering the substrate temperature can transition the deposition mode from island growth to layer growth. This occurs due to the enhanced bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms at higher temperatures, decreasing interface energy and favoring layer growth. 

2. These changes in structure are crucial for their catalytic properties and performance. The ability to switch between metallic Fe, FeO, and subsurface Fe on Pt(111) surfaces, via oxidation and reduction treatments, indicates the potential for reversible modulation of the catalyst's performance.

3. At a specific substrate temperature of 487 K, monolayer Fe films were successfully formed on Pt(111). A transition from island to layer growth of Fe films was observed when the substrate temperature was lowered to 300 K. This temperature change facilitated a stronger bonding between Fe and Pt, leading to layer growth.

4. Higher substrate temperatures enhanced the bonding between Fe and Pt, which decreased the interface energy and promoted layer growth of Fe on Pt(111).

5. By oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, Fe atoms can be brought back to the topmost surface, forming the FeO/Pt(111) surface.

6. The reversible modulation of surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces is possible through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. This provides flexibility in adjusting the catalyst's properties for different applications.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件可以显著影响双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt系统的稳定、表面分层和结构配置。例如，在Pt-Fe合金中，改变基板温度可以从岛生长转变为层生长的沉积模式。这发生于较高温度下，Fe原子与表面Pt原子之间的增强结合导致界面能降低，有利于在Pt(111)上形成层状生长的Fe。

2. 这些结构变化对于其催化性质和性能至关重要。通过氧化和还原处理可切换表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe在Pt(111)表面上的结构，表明催化剂性能可逆调节的可能性。

3. 在特定基板温度487 K下，成功在Pt(111)上形成了单层Fe薄膜。当基板温度降至300 K时，观察到Fe薄膜从岛状生长转变为层状生长的转变。这种温度变化促进了Fe和Pt之间更强的结合，从而促进层状生长在Pt(111)上。

4. 较高的基板温度增强了Fe和Pt之间的结合，降低了界面能，并促进了在Pt(111)上形成层状生长的Fe。

5. 通过在O2中氧化Pt/Fe/Pt(111)表面，可以使Fe原子返回到最表面，形成FeO/Pt(111)表面。

6. 通过循环氧化和还原处理，可以在Pt(111)表面上可逆调节表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe结构。这为不同应用调整催化剂性质提供了灵活性。

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These conditions affect the formation of layers, islands, and the segregation of metals, altering the surface properties and catalytic performance. For instance, a higher substrate temperature facilitates the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111) by inducing a strong bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms, decreasing the interface energy. Conversely, lower temperatures promote island growth.

2. Annealing temperatures impact the evolution of surface compositions and structures in Pt-based systems. For example, annealing the Fe/Pt(111) surface in UHV can lead to the diffusion of surface Fe into the subsurface region, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)). The stability of this structure can be reduced under certain conditions, such as exposure to an oxidative environment, leading to the formation of a surface FeO structure.

3. The catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based systems can be reversibly modulated by cycling between oxidation and reduction treatments. This process allows for the transformation between surface Fe, subsurface Fe, and surface FeO structures on the Pt surface, providing flexibility in adjusting the surface configurations and enhancing catalytic activity.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）中的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件会影响层状、岛状形成以及金属的分层，改变表面性质和催化性能。例如，较高的基底温度通过促进Fe原子与Pt表面原子的强烈结合来促进在Pt(111)上的Fe层生长，从而降低界面能。相反，较低的温度则有利于岛状生长。

2. 在UHV中对Fe/Pt(111)表面进行退火温度变化，可以导致表面Fe向亚表面区域扩散，形成Pt壳结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）。在某些情况下，如暴露于氧化环境中，该结构的稳定性会降低，导致表面FeO结构的形成。

3. Pt基系统的催化特性和性能可以通过氧化和还原循环处理进行可逆调节。这一过程允许表面Fe、亚表面Fe和表面FeO结构之间的转换，为调整表面配置并增强催化活性提供了灵活性。
