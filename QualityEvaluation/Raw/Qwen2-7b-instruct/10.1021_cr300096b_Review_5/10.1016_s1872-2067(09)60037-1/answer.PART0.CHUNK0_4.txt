[1] "Monolayer Fe films were formed on Pt(111) at 487 K. A transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited on Pt(111) was observed when the substrate temperature changed from 487 K to 300 K. The higher temperature induced a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."
[2] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."
[3] "The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. The three structures of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can be transformed one into another."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These conditions affect the formation of layers, islands, and the segregation of metals, altering the surface properties and catalytic performance. For instance, a higher substrate temperature facilitates the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111) by inducing a strong bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms, decreasing the interface energy. Conversely, lower temperatures promote island growth.

2. Annealing temperatures impact the evolution of surface compositions and structures in Pt-based systems. For example, annealing the Fe/Pt(111) surface in UHV can lead to the diffusion of surface Fe into the subsurface region, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)). The stability of this structure can be reduced under certain conditions, such as exposure to an oxidative environment, leading to the formation of a surface FeO structure.

3. The catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based systems can be reversibly modulated by cycling between oxidation and reduction treatments. This process allows for the transformation between surface Fe, subsurface Fe, and surface FeO structures on the Pt surface, providing flexibility in adjusting the surface configurations and enhancing catalytic activity.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）中的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件会影响层状、岛状形成以及金属的分层，改变表面性质和催化性能。例如，较高的基底温度通过促进Fe原子与Pt表面原子的强烈结合来促进在Pt(111)上的Fe层生长，从而降低界面能。相反，较低的温度则有利于岛状生长。

2. 在UHV中对Fe/Pt(111)表面进行退火温度变化，可以导致表面Fe向亚表面区域扩散，形成Pt壳结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）。在某些情况下，如暴露于氧化环境中，该结构的稳定性会降低，导致表面FeO结构的形成。

3. Pt基系统的催化特性和性能可以通过氧化和还原循环处理进行可逆调节。这一过程允许表面Fe、亚表面Fe和表面FeO结构之间的转换，为调整表面配置并增强催化活性提供了灵活性。
