[1] "Monolayer Fe films were formed on Pt(111) at 487 K. A transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited on Pt(111) was observed when the substrate temperature changed from 487 K to 300 K. The higher temperature induced a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."
[2] "The monolayer Fe films grown on Pt(111) can be driven into the subsurface region by UHV annealing up to 850 K, which formed the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111)."
[3] "Fe can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The stability and configuration of these catalysts are influenced by factors such as the surface energy, interface energy, and kinetic limitations during growth.

2. The transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited on Pt(111) occurs when the substrate temperature is altered from 487 K to 300 K. Higher temperatures promote a stronger bonding between Fe adatoms and surface Pt atoms, decreasing the interface energy and favoring the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111).

3. Monolayer Fe films on Pt(111) can be driven into the subsurface region through UHV annealing at temperatures up to 850 K, creating a Pt-skin structure. This structure involves Fe in the subsurface region and Pt on the surface.

4. By oxidizing the Pt-skin surface in O2, Fe can be returned to the topmost surface, forming a FeO/Pt(111) surface. The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe configurations on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置产生了重大影响。这些催化剂的稳定性及其配置受到诸如表面能量、界面能量以及生长过程中的动力学限制等因子的影响。

2. 当将沉积在Pt(111)上的Fe的沉积温度从487 K改变到300 K时，观察到层生长转变为岛状生长的转变。更高的温度促进了Fe原子团与表面Pt原子之间的强烈结合，降低了界面能量，并有利于在Pt(111)上形成Fe层。

3. 在487 K下形成的单层Fe薄膜可以通过在850 K的高真空环境中进行退火，被驱动进入Pt(111)的亚表面区域，形成Pt-Fe-Pt(111)结构。该结构包含在亚表面区域的Fe和表面的Pt。

4. 通过在O2中氧化Pt-Fe-Pt(111)表面，Fe可以返回至顶层表面，形成FeO/Pt(111)表面。通过循环氧化和还原处理，可以可逆地控制Pt(111)表面上的表面Fe（或FeO）和亚表面Fe配置。
