[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."
[2] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[3] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[4] "Here, using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[5] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."
