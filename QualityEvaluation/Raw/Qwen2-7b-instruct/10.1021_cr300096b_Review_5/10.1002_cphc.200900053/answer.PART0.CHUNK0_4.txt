[1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal-in either the metallic or the oxidized state-can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[3] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[5] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[6] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the nature of the surface structures, which in turn impact the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For instance, the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts, such as the presence of a Pt-skin surface with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region, can lead to enhanced catalytic performance compared to pure Pt surfaces. The dynamic changes in catalyst surface structure during reactions, such as reversible processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion, offer opportunities to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity. By controlling these processes, the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on bimetallic catalysts can be adjusted, thereby optimizing their performance for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离性，以及其结构配置。这些因素决定了表面结构的性质，进而影响催化性能和在各种应用中的表现。例如，在双金属催化剂中，如Pt-3d合金中Pt薄层表面下存在3d过渡金属，可以产生比纯Pt表面更高的催化性能。反应过程中催化剂表面结构的动态变化，如可逆过程如湿润-干燥和烧结分散，提供了调整催化活性和选择性的机会。通过控制这些过程，可以调整双金属催化剂上的CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力，从而优化其性能以满足特定应用需求。
