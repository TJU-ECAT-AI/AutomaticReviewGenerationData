[1] "Bimetallic catalysts often present superior catalytic performance in comparison to their parent metals and have been widely used in many catalytic processes."
[2] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal-in either the metallic or the oxidized state-can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[4] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[5] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[6] "Using well-defined FePt systems, we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[7] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunabiity in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors dictate the catalytic properties and performance of the catalysts in various applications. For instance, the presence of additional metals like 3d transition metals in the subsurface region of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts enhances their catalytic performance compared to pure Pt surfaces. The dynamic nature of the catalyst surface structure during reactions allows for the reversible modulation of surface structures, which can be controlled through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. This modulation affects the surface adsorption strength and oxidation ability of the bimetallic catalysts, offering tunability in their catalytic performance.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分层结构配置产生了显著影响。这些因素决定了催化剂在各种应用中的催化性质和性能。例如，在Pt基双金属催化剂中存在额外的金属（如3d过渡金属）在亚表面区域可以提高其催化性能，与纯Pt表面相比。催化剂表面结构的动态性允许表面结构的可逆调节，可以通过循环氧化和还原处理进行控制。这种调节影响双金属催化剂的表面吸附强度和氧化能力，为它们的催化性能提供了可调性。
