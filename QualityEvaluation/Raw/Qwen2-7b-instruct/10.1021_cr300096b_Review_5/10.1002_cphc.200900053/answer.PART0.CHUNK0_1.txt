[1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metalin either the metallic or the oxidized statecan be exposed on the surface,in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[3] "For example, Pt- based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[5] "For example, reversible surface processes such as wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion have been observed in monometallic catalyst systems when the gaseous environment changes between reducing and oxidative conditions."
[6] "The bimetallic catalysts may show similar dependence of surface structure on the redox potential of reaction gases, which offers eventually the opportunity to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity."
[7] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems, we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors determine the presence of various metal states on the surface, near the surface, or within the bulk of the catalyst. A critical aspect is that the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts plays a pivotal role in their catalytic properties. For instance, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with a Pt-skin surface and 3d transition metals at the subsurface region demonstrate superior catalytic performance compared to pure Pt surfaces. The dynamic nature of catalyst surface structures during reactions allows for reversible processes like wetting-dewetting and sintering dispersion, which are observable in monometallic systems when the gas environment shifts between reducing and oxidative conditions. These processes in bimetallic catalysts enable a similar dependence on the redox potential of reaction gases, offering the possibility to adjust catalytic activity and selectivity. Through cycled oxidation and reduction treatments, the surface structure of bimetallic FePt catalysts can be switched between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface, demonstrating tunable surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面分层、结构配置产生显著影响。这些因素决定了催化剂表面、表面附近或内部存在的各种金属状态。关键的一点是，双金属催化剂的表面结构对其催化性能至关重要。例如，含有Pt皮肤表面和3d过渡金属在亚表面区域的Pt基双金属催化剂，在许多反应中的催化性能优于纯Pt表面。催化剂表面结构的动态性质允许在反应过程中发生可逆过程，如湿润-脱湿和烧结分散，这些在具有还原和氧化气体环境变化的单金属系统中可观察到。在双金属催化剂中，这些过程使得依赖于反应气体的氧化还原电位成为可能，提供了调整催化活性和选择性的机会。通过循环氧化和还原处理，双金属FePt催化剂的表面结构可以在具有Fe位于下方的Pt皮肤表面和富含铁氧化物的Pt表面之间切换，显示出可调的表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力。
