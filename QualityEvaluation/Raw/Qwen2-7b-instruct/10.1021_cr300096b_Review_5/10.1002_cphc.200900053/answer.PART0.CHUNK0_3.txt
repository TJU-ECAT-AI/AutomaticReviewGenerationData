[1] "Compared with monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have more surface structural complexity, where the second metal-in either the metallic or the oxidized state-can be exposed on the surface, in the near surface region, or embedded in bulk region."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the surface structure of the bimetallic catalyst is critical to their catalytic properties."
[3] "For example, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts consisting of Pt-skin surfaces with 3d transition metals at the subsurface region present super catalytic performances in many reactions compared to the pure Pt surface."
[4] "The structure of a catalyst surface often changes dynamically during reactions."
[5] "Using well-defined FePt(111) systems we show that the surface structure of the bimetallic FePt catalysts can be indeed switched between the Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and the iron oxide rich Pt surface."
[6] "The reversible structural modulation regulated by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments exhibits feasible tunability in the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These conditions lead to dynamic changes in the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts. For instance, the surface structure can switch between a Pt-skin surface with Fe underneath and an iron oxide-rich Pt surface. This reversible structural modulation enables tuning of the surface CO adsorption strength and CO oxidation ability on the bimetallic catalysts. As a result, the catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts in various applications are affected.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件导致双金属催化剂表面结构的动态变化。例如，表面结构可以切换为具有Fe在下面的Pt表皮表面或富含铁氧化物的Pt表面。这种可逆的结构调节使得表面CO吸附强度和CO氧化能力在双金属催化剂上具有可调性。因此，这些催化剂在各种应用中的催化性质和性能受到影响。
