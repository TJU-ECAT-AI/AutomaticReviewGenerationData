Balbuena* View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract The adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt-segregated and nonsegregated surfaces of Pt3M(111) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) has been systematically investigated using periodic density functional theory calculations. It is found that the surface adsorption properties can be considerably modified by introducing the 3d metals. For each alloy system, the binding strength of oxygen follows the order of Pt-skin < Pt(111) < Pt3M. Among the three alloys, Pt3Fe(111) is the most favorable for O adsorption on the nonsegregated surface, whereas Pt3Ni(111) is preferred on the Pt-segregated surface. Our calculations show that the magnitude of surface adsorption energies is determined by both the surface geometry and the electronic structure. Remarkably, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The discrepant adsorption properties are therefore mainly attributed to the direct involvement of 3d metals either on the surface or in the subsurface. In addition to reactivity, we analyze electrochemical stability of the studied alloys in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, evaluating the electrode potential shift with respect to that found in pure Pt surfaces, which is related to the chemical potential change of surface Pt atoms upon metal dissolution. A simplified slab model is employed to evaluate the chemical potentials for pure metals and alloys using density functional theory calculations. Our results are consistent with previous experimental and theoretical studies, indicating an enhanced electrochemical stability of Pt-skin surfaces produced from Pt3M alloys. Furthermore, the potential shift of Pt-skin surfaces under 0.25 monolayer of adsorbed atomic oxygen is examined. Oxygen adsorption is found to destabilize both the Pt-skin and pure Pt surfaces. However, the Pt-skin surfaces under adsorbed oxygen are still more stable against dissolution than the pure Pt surfaces under the same oxygen coverage.This publication is licensed under the terms of your institutional subscription.

However, the sluggish O2 reduction kinetics on the cathode significantly impedes the energy conversion efficiency of fuel cells. Over the past years, numerous efforts to develop alternative catalysts to Pt focused primarily on Pt-based bimetallic alloys, in which platinum is partially replaced by other less expensive metals, such as Fe, Co, and Ni. Recent studies showed that the activity enhancement of Pt-based alloys varies from 24 (1-3) to 1025 times. (4, 5) Since the detailed reaction mechanisms have not been fully understood, the origin of the enhanced oxygen reduction activity remains unclear, although it is generally accepted that the effect can arise from the modification of surface geometries and/or electronic structures. For many years, the adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt and Pt-based alloys was studied extensively by experimental (6-8) and computational methods. (9-15) Notably, several studies of O adsorption on Pt-skin surfaces revealed that the binding strength is weaker than that on the pure Pt(111) surface, and this may facilitate the removal of adsorbed O, therefore increasing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) rate. (12, 15-17) Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the formation of a Pt-skin layer is accompanied with a Pt-depleted layer underneath for many Pt-3d alloys. (18-21) Very recently, Stamenkovic et al. examined the Pt3Ni(111) surface and found that the first layer consists only of Pt and the second layer is strongly Pt-depleted (48% of Pt compared to 75% of Pt in the bulk). (22) All this information indicates that the composition of the second layer metals is considerably different from that in the bulk. Nevertheless, the effect, which may influence the adsorption properties, has scarcely been considered in previous computational studies.In addition to activity, durability of metal electrode nanocatalysts in acid medium has become one of the most important challenges of low-temperature fuel cell technologies. It has been reported that platinum electrode surface area loss significantly shortens the lifetime of fuel cells. (23) In recent years, platinum-based alloys, used as cathode electrocatalysts, were found to possess enhanced stability compared to pure Pt. (14, 24) The phenomenon is quite unusual, because alloy metals, such as Fe, Co, and Ni, generally exhibit greater chemical and electrochemical activities than pure Pt. Some studies revealed that the surface structure of these alloys differs considerably from that in the bulk: A pure Pt-skin is formed in the outermost layer of the alloys because of surface segregation of Pt atoms (3, 4, 22, 25-27) and the modified surface structure is thought to be responsible for the stability enhancement of the catalysts. On the other hand, surface adsorption may play a critical role in the stability of catalysts in the process of catalytic reactions. For the ORR, various oxygenated species are likely to be adsorbed on the cathode catalyst surface. (15) Stamenkovic et al. compared the kinetics of the ORR on the bulk alloy of Pt3Co and the Pt-skin structure produced by Pt segregation on the outermost layer of the annealed surface. They found that the ORR was uniquely active on the Pt-skin surface and the rate of reaction was 4 times as fast as that on the pure Pt catalyst. (3) Although the surface properties in the presence of adsorbates have been extensively investigated, (12, 14, 28, 29) much less is known about the corresponding electrochemical stability and tendency to dissolution.Reports from cyclic voltammetry electrochemical experiments indicate that the potential shift recorded in alloys (relative to pure Pt) corresponding to the onset of the surface oxide growth can be taken as a measure of the electrochemical stability and tendency to dissolution of metal alloys in comparison to pure metal surfaces. (30, 31) Very recently, Greeley and Norskov proposed a thermodynamic procedure for estimating the potential shift of surface alloys using periodic density functional theory (DFT). (32) They found a positive potential shift for Pt-skin surfaces of Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni, indicating that the skin structure is electrochemically more stable than pure Pt surfaces. In this project, we study the stability of Pt-skins in the presence of adsorbates on the basis of Greeley and Norskovs work, by using an alternative approach to evaluate the surface chemical potential of metals that are related to the electrochemical potential of alloy surfaces. We focus on well-studied Pt3M alloy systems (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) and use DFT to characterize the adsorption of atomic oxygen on the alloy surfaces and to examine the potential shift of the Pt-skin surfaces under adsorbed oxygen. It should be noted that adsorbates may alter the surface structures of alloys in some cases. (33) However, following the surface evolution is beyond the scope of this work. Our segregation model, (34) based on the previous experimental result, (22) is constructed by exchanging the positions of the topmost layer M atoms and the second layer Pt atoms. We compare the surface geometries, the adsorption energies, and the electronic structures of the Pt segregated/nonsegregated alloy systems and show that the adsorption and electrochemical stability properties can be significantly modified with changes in the composition of surface structures. Real nanoparticles in the size range (210 nm) utilized in fuel cell cathodes contain a majority of (111) facets, (35) which we analyze in this work, although we acknowledge that other crystallographic planes and a considerable amount of low-coordinated sites are also present. 2 Computational Methods It has been reported that Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys possess close-packed fcc structures, (1, 36, 37) in which the Pt atoms occupy the face-centered positions and the M atoms are located at the corners of the unit cell. The lattice constants for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni, obtained from our previous study, are 3.91, 3.89, and 3.88 Å, (34) respectively, in good agreement with reported experimental values, (18, 36, 38) which are 3.87, 3.85, and 3.89 Å, respectively. A 2 × 2 (111) unit cell was employed for all the slab models. Each cell consists of a five-layer slab and six equivalent layers of vacuum. In the super cell, each slab layer contains three Pt atoms and one M atom. As illustrated in Figure 1, the Pt-segregated structures were built by exchanging M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer. The topmost layer is consequently fully covered by Pt atoms, and the second layer contains 50% Pt atoms. We note that our segregation model only includes changes in the first two surface layers. Although the third and probably other subsurface layers may also be affected, their influence should be minor, and we neglect this effect here in a first approximation. The atoms in the top three layers were allowed to relax to their lowest energy configuration, while the atoms of the bottom two layers were fixed to their bulk positions, keeping their optimized lattice constants. The adsorption of atomic oxygen was modeled on the Pt3M and Pt-skin surfaces. Various types of adsorption sites, including top, bridge, HCP, and FCC, were examined at 0.25 monolayer (ML) coverages.Figure 1 Figure 1. Slab model used for periodic DFT calculations. The structure is composed of a five-layer slab and a six-layer vacuum space. The Pt-segregated structure is constructed by exchanging the M and Pt atoms pointed by the red arrows. Gray and light blue spheres represent the Pt and M atoms, respectively.Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), (39-43) in which the KohnSham equations are solved by self-consistent algorithms. The valence electrons were described by plane wave basis sets with a cutoff energy of 350 eV, and the core electrons were replaced by the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials (44, 45) for improving the computational efficiency. The Brillouin zone was sampled with an 8 × 8 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh for our slab calculations. The exchange-correlation functional was described within the generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew et al. (46) The MethfesselPaxon method was employed to determine electron occupancies with a smearing width of 0.2 eV. The convergence criteria for the electronic self-consistent iteration and the ionic relaxation loop were set to 105 eV and 104 eV/Å, respectively.The d-band centers were evaluated from the site-projected electronic density of states using a much bigger k-point mesh (15 × 15 × 1), and the values are referenced to the Fermi level. The adsorption energy of atomic oxygen, Eads, is defined as Eads = Eslab/O  Eslab  Eo, in which Eslab/O is the total energy of the slab with atomic oxygen, Eslab is the energy of the slab, and Eo is the energy of gas-phase O.To analyze the Pt dissolution reaction, we consider, following GreeleyNorskovs derivation, (32) that the electrode potential UM of a metal M for the redox reaction Mn+ + ne  M, according to the Nernst equation, is given by (1) where UM0 is the standard electrode potential, and αM and αMn+ are the chemical activities of M and Mn+, respectively. At a given concentration of Mn+, the electrode potential is solely determined by αM, which depends on the chemical environment of M. Therefore, for the M atoms in pure metal and alloy systems, the difference in electrode potentials can be described as follows. (32) Referring to the electrode reaction that describes the dissolution of pure metal M to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) reaction, Mn+ + n/2H2  Mpure + nH+, the thermodynamic relationship at equilibrium is (2) where UM,pure is the electrode potential of pure M versus SHE, μH+0 and μH20 are the chemical potentials of H+ and H2 at standard conditions, and μM,puresurf and μMn+ are the chemical potentials of pure metal atoms dissolving from the surface and those of dissolved ions. Similarly, for the electrode reaction concerning the dissolution of M in an alloy system, Mn+ + n/2H2  Malloy + nH+, the corresponding electrode potential of M in the alloy, UM,alloy, is related to the chemical potentials through the following equation (47) (3) in which μM,alloysurf is the chemical potential of M dissolving from the alloy surface. Assuming that the chemical potential of Mn+ in contact with the pure metal surface is the same as that in contact with the alloy electrode surface and combining eqs 2 and 3, we have (4) Regarding the assumption of equality of the chemical potentials of the ions in solutions in contact with the different metal surfaces, we note that the chemical potential of Mn+ is mainly determined by the properties of the solution, and it is expected that such solution properties (at the same ionic concentration) do not change significantly because of changes in the electrode surface composition. The potential shift observed in alloying is a manifestation of a delay in the formation of a surface oxide, which triggers the oxidation of the metal surface atoms. This change in the oxidation process involves the migration of adsorbed surface oxygen into the subsurface and the oxidation of the surface metal atoms. Therefore, we expect that changes in the chemical potential of the Pt atoms in the different metal environments will be the main effect that defines the potential shift.Thus, denoting the electrode potential shift as ΔU = UM,alloy  UM,pure, eq 4 can be rewritten as (5) To evaluate μM,alloysurf and μM,puresurf, we consider that the chemical potential of M, μM, is defined as (6) where A is the total free energy, E is the total energy, and NM is the number of M atoms. Considering that the entropy contributions may be canceled when calculating the chemical potential difference between pure and alloy surfaces, it is safe to take the approximation in eq 6, in which the chemical potential is approximated by the energy difference when the number of metal atoms M changes. Since metal dissolution always takes place on the surface area, we use a slab model to estimate the chemical potential. A surface metal atom is removed from the slab, and a new slab with a surface cavity is optimized. The chemical potential is obtained by calculating the total energies of the original and new slabs, Eslab and Eslab:(7) where ΔNM is the difference in the number of M atoms between the slab systems. Note that the chemical potentials that we are calculating are those of the surface layer, which are much different from the bulk ones. (48) Thus, the chemical potential is the energy needed to remove one atom from the surface, and such energy is dependent on the surface structure and composition. In this work, we are considering the chemical potentials of (111) surfaces. If the surface has a different structure, such as the presence of steps and kinks, or simply a different crystallographic surface, the chemical potential should be different, but we are not studying such effects in this work. However, the surface environment (i.e., the composition and structure of the subsurface) will also influence the chemical potential. That is why we use eq 7 to estimate the chemical potential, because the composition and structure of the slab (and also the presence or absence of adsorbates) will induce changes that will be reflected in the estimated chemical potential. We also tested the convergence of the cell size on our estimation of the chemical potential. Our calculations show that the approximation is valid even when a small super cell is used, as indicated by the results from five-layer slabs with 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 5 × 5 super cells showing a convergent value of the difference Eslab  Eslab. The energy calculations were performed with VASP using the same procedure and parameters explained for the adsorption calculations. 3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Adsorption Properties
To verify the accuracy of our computational model, we calculate the adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt(111) surfaces at 0.25 ML surface coverage. Four possible adsorption sites, on-top, bridge, hcp, and fcc, are examined and the calculated adsorption energies are 3.14, 3.86, 4.05, and 4.48 eV, respectively. The fcc hollow is found to be the most stable adsorption site, whereas the top site is the least favorable one, both consistent with previous theoretical studies. (9, 12) The fcc adsorption energy agrees well with experimental results: Gland et al. determined an initial desorption energy of 4.77 eV for the Pt(111)/O system at 700 K, (7) and Yeo et al. reported a PtO bond energy of 4.32 eV on a clean Pt(111) surface. (8) Moreover, the calculated surface-oxygen distance for the fcc adsorption, 1.22 Å, is also in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.21  0.03 Å. (49) Because of the presence of M (M = Pt, Co, and Ni) in the Pt3M alloys, additional adsorption sites are identified on the (111) surface, including two top sites, three bridge sites, and four hollow sites (two fcc and two hcp). The corresponding sites in a super cell are illustrated in Figure 2: Two top sites are located on surface Pt (top-Pt) and M (top-M) atoms; three bridge sites lie above either two adjacent Pt atoms (bridge-Pt2 and bridge-Pt2) or one Pt atom and one adjacent M atom (bridge-PtM) on the surface; and four hollow sites are located over 3-fold positions consisting of three neighboring surface Pt atoms (hcp-Pt3 and fcc-Pt3) or two surface Pt atoms and one neighboring surface M atom (hcp-Pt2M and fcc-Pt2M). The adsorption sites can be divided into two groups: M sites, the ones in which that surface 3d metal atoms are directly involved (top-M, bridge-PtM, hcp-Pt2M, and fcc-Pt2M), and Pt sites, the sites that are solely composed of surface Pt atoms (top-Pt, bridge-Pt2, bridge-Pt2, hcp-Pt3, and fcc-Pt3). M sites generally have stronger binding strength to oxygen than Pt sites, as shown in Table 1.

The surface coverage of O is 1/4 ML.Introducing 3d metals into the Pt(111) system considerably alters the surface adsorption properties. The interlayer distance is decreased because of the relatively smaller volume of 3d metal atoms. According to Table 2, the distance between the first and second layer, d12, is 0.030.10 Å shorter in the slabs with various oxygen adsorption modes than that in the Pt(111) slab. The most stable O binding site is still the fcc hollow (fcc-Pt2M) for each Pt3M(111) surface, and the adsorption energies for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni are 0.41, 0.33, and 0.27 eV stronger than that of Pt(111), respectively. This stronger binding arises from the interaction between the surface 3d metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) and O. Compared to the Pt(111) system, the length of PtO approximately remains unchanged and the MO bond is found to be around 0.170.20 Å shorter than PtO. A similar trend is also observed for hcp-Pt2M, bridge-PtM, and top-M sites, indicating stronger adsorption energies than the corresponding sites on the pure Pt(111) surface. The binding strength of O at M sites in the alloys possesses the same order as in Pt(111): fcc > hcp > bridge > top. For the hcp-Pt2M, bridge-PtM, and top-M sites in Pt3Fe(111), the adsorption energies are only 0.27, 0.39, and 0.67 eV less strong than those of fcc-Pt2M. The corresponding differences are 0.25, 0.45, and 0.80 eV in Pt3Co(111), and 0.30, 0.59, and 1.45 eV in Pt3Ni(111), respectively. For Pt3Fe(111) and Pt3Co(111), the bonding energy difference between fcc and top sites decreases to 0.67 and 0.80 eV, much smaller in comparison with that of Pt(111) (1.34 eV), while the difference increases to 1.45 eV for Pt3Ni(111). The discrepancy suggests that the adsorption strength is heavily determined by the nature of the surface atom species. Moreover, our calculations indicate that the binding strength of O follows the order of Pt(111) < Pt3Ni(111) < Pt3Co(111) < Pt3Fe(111) for each of the four adsorption types. Pt3Fe(111) always exhibits the strongest capability in binding O among the three alloy systems.Table 2.

For top, bridge, and hcp sites, the surface adsorption energy of Pt3M is comparable to that of pure Pt, whereas for fcc-Pt3, the oxygen adsorption on the alloy surface is even slightly weaker than that on the pure Pt(111) surface. We find that the distance between the top two layers is related to the strength of oxygen adsorption: For each adsorption type, oxygen binding in the Pt sites always produces larger d12 than in M sites (Table 2). For each alloy system, the adsorption energies of fcc-Pt3 and hcp-Pt3 sites are quite close. In particular, the hcp-Pt3 site of Pt3Fe(111) is found to be more favorable than the fcc-Pt3 site.More oxygen adsorption sites can be identified on the Pt-segregated surfaces because of the sublayer structures of Pt3M. Three top sites, seven bridge sites, three hcp sites, and three fcc sites are investigated in this work, as shown in Figure 3. The calculated adsorption energies at various sites are listed in Table 3. For the sites with the same adsorption type (top, bridge, hcp, and fcc), the binding strengths are basically close to each other. Our calculations indicate that fcc sites are still the most favorable for all the alloy systems and the O binding strength still follows the order of fcc > hcp > bridge > top, analogous to Pt(111) and nonsegregated Pt3M surfaces. However, the oxygen adsorption energies of the segregated alloys are much weaker than those of the nonsegregated ones. As summarized in Table 4, the adsorption energy difference between the nonsegregated and segregated systems, ΔEads, is 0.851.37 eV for Pt3Fe(111), 0.751.12 eV for Pt3Co(111), and 0.330.68 eV for Pt3Ni(111). Pt segregation to the surface yields the biggest ΔEads for Pt3Fe and the least one for Pt3Ni. Accordingly, the order of O adsorption strength changes to Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111) for the Pt-segregated systems, which is reverse of the order found for the nonsegregated Pt3M alloys. Despite the big difference of surface adsorption properties between the Pt-segregated and nonsegregated alloys, the corresponding d12 distance between the top two layers varies only slightly. In most cases, the discrepancy is within 0.02 Å (Tables 2 and 5). Moreover, the adsorption strength on the Pt-skin surface is even weaker than that on pure Pt(111) surface. Therefore, the general trend of O binding strength is determined as Pt-skin of Pt3M < Pt(111) < Pt3M(111). The calculated PtO length also follows the same order: For each adsorption site, the PtO bond length listed in Table 5 is a little elongated for the Pt-skin systems compared to those on pure Pt(111), indicating a weaker interaction of the adsorbed O and surface Pt atoms. For example, the PtO bond is 2.048 Å for the fcc site in pure Pt(111), while the average bond length ranges from 2.052 to 2.096 Å in the segregated Pt3M alloys. Furthermore, we also notice the shortest PtO length in Pt3Ni(111) and the longest one in Pt3Fe(111), in accordance with the order of O adsorption strength (Pt3Ni(111) > Pt3Co(111) > Pt3Fe(111)) for the Pt-skin surfaces.Figure 3 Figure 3.

The result fully agrees with previous work by Xu et al. (12) In general, adsorption properties on metal surfaces are primarily determined by two factors: the surface geometry and the electronic structure. In this article, strain effects refer to the effects caused by the change of geometry, while electronic effects refer to the effects due to the change of metal species.Since Fe, Co, and Ni exhibit much higher affinity to oxygen than Pt, the oxygen atoms prefer to bind to the 3d metal atoms on Pt3M surfaces and this leads to more negative adsorption energies. Therefore, the electronic properties dominate the surface adsorption properties of oxygen on the nonsegregated Pt3M surfaces. For the Pt-segregated surfaces, the geometric properties also play an important role, mainly because of the strain arising from the compressed distance of surface atoms. Our DFT calculations show that the PtPt distance in the Pt-skin layer is about 1.6, 2.0, and 2.3% compressed in comparison to the equilibrium distance in pure Pt(111). Xu et al. estimated that the magnitude of the oxygen adsorption energy in various sites is reduced by 0.130.25 eV on a 2% compressed Pt(111) surface at 1/4 ML coverage. (12) According to our calculations, the corresponding difference in adsorption energy is 0.20.45 eV between the pure Pt(111) and the Pt-skin surfaces. (For Pt-skins, we only choose the most stable site in each adsorption type when comparing the adsorption energy.) The larger difference suggests that in addition to the strain effect the electronic properties may also affect the strength of oxygen adsorption in the Pt-skin structures. We infer that the electronic effect arises not from the surface Pt atoms but from the sublayer 3d metal atoms. It has been reported that the surface electronic structure related to the adsorption properties of some adsorbates may be characterized by the d-band. (50) We calculate the d-band center and the filling of the d-band of surface Pt atoms in the nonsegregated Pt3M surfaces and the corresponding Pt-skins. The results are listed in Table 6. For each alloy system, the d-band properties differ only slightly between the two structures. In the Pt-skin structure, the d-band center generally moves positively by 0.040.05 eV and the d-band filling decreases only by 0.20.5%. The small differences suggest that the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is not considerably modified by surface segregation. Hence, the variation of surface adsorption properties between segregated and nonsegregated alloy surfaces should be primarily attributed to the involvement of the subsurface 3d metals, which may yield a strong binding between the first and second layers.Table 6.

3.2 Electrochemical Potential Shift of Pt-Skin Surfaces
As discussed in the Introduction, cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed that a potential shift may arise in alloy surfaces at potentials in the region corresponding to the onset of surface oxide growth, as compared to those found for pure Pt surfaces. (22) Such delay on the formation of the surface oxide is associated with an enhanced stability of the Pt atoms in the alloy surface. (51-53) Here, we first investigate the Pt2+ + 2e  Pt electrode reaction and evaluate the electrode potential shift for Pt(111) skins of Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys using the procedure outlined in the Computational Methods. As illustrated in Figure 4a, for the alloy systems, each slab layer contains three Pt atoms and one M atom in the super cell. For each unit cell, removing each Pt atom from the surface produces a cavity structure (Figure 4b). Since Eslab varies with the position of the removed Pt atom, we evaluate the chemical potentials using the configuration with the lowest total slab energy. The chemical potential difference μM,alloy  μM,pure and the electrode potential shift ΔU were obtained from eqs 5 and 7. The results listed in Table 7 clearly show the stability enhancement of Pt-skins: The values of the electrode potential shift are 0.15, 0.12, and 0.08 V for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni, respectively. The positive values of the shifts indicate that the dissolution of Pt atoms from Pt-skin surfaces is delayed to higher potentials. Stamenkovic et al. found an increased stability for the Pt-skin surface of Pt3Ni(111), (22) and Greeley and Norskov estimated the corresponding potential shifts for the alloy surfaces as 0.19, 0.16, and 0.14 V for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni. (32) Our result is essentially in agreement with these experimental and theoretical studies.

However, a more realistic surface is that where oxygenated species are adsorbed as a consequence of the catalyzed reaction. In the ORR, the adsorption of various intermediates may affect the stability of Pt and Pt-based alloy catalysts. The approach described above is capable of estimating the electrochemical stability and the dissolution trend in the presence of adsorbates. We use the same slab model to investigate the potential shift of pure Pt and Pt-skins under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen. The most stable adsorption sites (fcc) for the Pt-skin surfaces discussed in section 3.1 are shown in Figure 5. We find that the Pt atoms bonding directly to O are more difficult to lose, owing to the strong interactions between Pt and O. For example, removing an O-bonded Pt atom from the Pt-skin surface in Pt3Co(111) requires extra 0.30.5 eV energy according to our calculations. Therefore, for each super cell, removal of the circled Pt atom in Figure 5a produces a new slab with the lowest total energy. Our calculations result in a negative electrode potential shift both for pure Pt and for the Pt-skins, with respect to the clean pure Pt surface, indicating that the surfaces are less stable than the pure Pt surface without oxygen adsorption. According to Table 7, the values of the potential shift are 0.36, 0.32, 0.34, and 0.33 V for the surfaces of pure Pt, Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni, referenced to their electrode potentials in the absence of oxygen adsorption. This may be attributed to weaker interactions of the surface and sublayer atoms: The distance between the first layer and the second layer is generally increased by 0.02 Å for the oxygen-adsorbed slabs (compared to the respective clean surfaces) and the bonding energy is accordingly decreased by 0.60.7 eV for each surface Pt atom. However, the Pt-skin surfaces from the alloys still show enhanced stability with reference to pure Pt under 0.25 ML of oxygen: The potential shifts are 0.19, 0.14, and 0.11 V higher for Pt3Fe, Pt3Co, and Pt3Ni than those of pure Pt and the enhancements are comparable to the nonadsorption cases. It is also noticed that the order of the stability enhancement in Pt-skin surfaces (Pt3Fe > Pt3Co > Pt3Ni) follows the opposite order to the adsorption strengths, suggesting that weak affinities of the Pt surface atoms to the adsorbed oxygen correlate with strong binding of the Pt surface layer to the subsurface, thus enhancing the stability of Pt atoms against dissolution.

(b) Top view of the oxygen adsorption sites and cavities on the skin surface. Gray, light blue, and red spheres represent the Pt, M, and O atoms, respectively. 4 Conclusions We studied the surface adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt-segregated and nonsegregated Pt3M(111) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) surfaces using periodic DFT calculations. The slab model of Pt segregation is constructed on the basis of the most recent experimental results on Pt3M alloys. The 3d metals in the alloys are found to be capable of modifying the electronic and geometric properties and consequently to alter the binding strength. Four types of adsorption sites (top, bridge, hcp, and fcc) were examined, and the magnitudes of the oxygen adsorption energies follow the order of fcc > hcp > bridge > top for each alloy system. On the Pt3M(111) surfaces, the oxygen atoms are more strongly bound than on pure Pt(111) because of the relatively high oxygen affinity toward the 3d metals, whereas the corresponding Pt-skin surfaces exhibit weaker oxygen binding strength caused by the surface strain and by the presence of the 3d metals modifying the electronic structure of the sublayers. Therefore, the strength of surface adsorption has the order of Pt skin < Pt(111) < Pt3M. Comparison of the adsorption strength of the three alloys leads to the conclusion that Pt3Fe(111) is the most favorable for oxygen adsorption on the nonsegregated surface and Pt3Ni(111) is the most favorable on the Pt-segregated surface.Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases. Furthermore, we note that the d-band properties of the surface Pt atoms differ only slightly between the segregated and nonsegregated alloys. The adsorption strength is therefore mainly determined by 3d metals in the alloys: On the nonsegregated surfaces the 3d metal atoms are directly involved into O adsorption and thus enhance the adsorption strength, whereas on the Pt-segregated surfaces they weaken the O adsorption owing to the surface strain and the electronic effect.The surface chemical potentials of Pt atoms in Pt-skin (111) surfaces are evaluated and compared to those of pure Pt(111) surfaces, and their difference is related to the electrochemical potential shift associated with the dissolution reaction of Pt atoms in the two different surfaces. It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.Author Information Corresponding Author Perla B.
