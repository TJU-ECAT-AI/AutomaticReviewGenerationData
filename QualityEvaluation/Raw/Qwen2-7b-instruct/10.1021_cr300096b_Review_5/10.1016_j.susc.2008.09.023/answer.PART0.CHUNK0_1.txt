[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) has been successfully used to study the adsorption and reaction on catalytic surfaces."
[2] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."
[3] "The (211) surface has (111) terraces separated by monatomic (100) steps as shown in Fig. 3, where site 1 corresponds to a step site while sites 2 and 3 are terrace sites."
[4] "The surface segregation energy, Esegr, is generally defined as the energy of moving an atom from the interior to the surface of a crystal."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. For instance, the presence of oxygen can alter the surface segregation and structural configuration, impacting the catalytic efficiency. The (211) surface, characterized by (111) terraces separated by monatomic (100) steps, plays a crucial role in these processes. The energy required to move an atom from the interior to the surface of a crystal, known as the surface segregation energy, serves as a key indicator of the stability and configuration changes due to the interaction with oxygen and other adsorbates.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分层，以及结构配置产生了显著影响，特别是在基于Pt的系统，如Pt-3d合金中。这些因素影响催化性能和在各种应用中的表现。例如，氧的存在可以改变表面分层和结构配置，从而影响催化效率。具有（111）台阶和单原子（100）台阶的（211）表面在这些过程中起着关键作用。从内部到表面移动原子所需的能量，称为表面分层能，是由于与氧和其他吸附剂相互作用导致稳定性和配置变化的重要指标。
