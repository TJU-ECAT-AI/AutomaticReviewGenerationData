[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) is used to study oxygen adsorption and its effect on surface segregation in (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys."
[2] "It is found that the most energetically favorable oxygen adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step."
[3] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems."
[4] "The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."
[5] "In the case of the Pt3M we test the segregation of Pt, negative values of surface segregation energy imply that Pt atoms segregate to surface, whereas positive segregation energies mean no Pt segregation to the surface."

1. Density functional theory (DFT) is utilized to analyze the impact of oxygen adsorption on surface segregation in (211) surfaces of Pt-based alloys.
2. The bridge site, located over and parallel to the (100) step, is identified as the most energetically favorable location for oxygen adsorption.
3. Surface segregation is observed in systems including Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), indicating the redistribution of atoms on the surface.
4. The Pt/Ir(core) structure uniquely exhibits an antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of oxygen adsorption.
5. In Pt3M systems, negative surface segregation energy signifies the movement of Pt atoms towards the surface, while positive values indicate no such movement.

1. 密度泛函理论（DFT）被用于研究氧吸附对（211）表面上铂基合金表面掺杂的影响。
2. 发现，桥位，位于与（100）步平行的位置上，是氧吸附能最有利的地点。
3. 观察到表面掺杂现象存在于Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(core)系统中，表明原子在表面的重新分布。
4. Pt/Ir(core)结构独特地表现出即使在氧吸附存在的条件下也具有反掺杂行为。
5. 在Pt3M系统中，负的表面掺杂能量表示Pt原子向表面移动，而正值则表示没有这样的移动。
