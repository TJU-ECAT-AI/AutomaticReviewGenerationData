[1] "Density functional theory is used to study oxygen adsorption and its effect on surface segregation in (211) surfaces of Pt(shell)/M(core) and Pt3M (M = Co, Ir) alloys."
[2] "It is found that the most energetically favorable oxygen adsorption site is the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step."
[3] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems."
[4] "The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."
[5] "For the core-shell structures having pure Pt in their shell we test M segregation to the surface, thus a negative value of segregation energy indicates that the M atoms are able to segregate to the surface, while a positive segregation energy suggests no M segregation on the surface."
[6] "In the case of the Pt3M we test the segregation of Pt, negative values of surface segregation energy imply that Pt atoms segregate to surface, whereas positive segregation energies mean no Pt segregation to the surface."
[7] "The surface segregation energy, Esegr, is generally defined as the energy of moving an atom from the interior to the surface of a crystal."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These conditions dictate the most stable sites for oxygen adsorption, which in turn affects the surface segregation behavior of the alloy components. The presence of oxygen can promote or inhibit the segregation of certain elements, depending on the specific alloy composition and the nature of the interaction between the alloy components and oxygen.

2. The results of this study reveal that the bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step is the most energetically favorable location for oxygen adsorption on (211) surfaces of Pt-based alloys. This finding is crucial for understanding how oxygen interacts with these surfaces and influences the catalytic properties of the alloys.

3. Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt-based alloys such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), indicating that under certain conditions, atoms of the alloy components can move from the interior to the surface. This behavior is influenced by factors such as the type of alloy, the presence of oxygen, and the specific structure of the alloy.

4. Among the studied systems, only the Pt/Ir(core) structure demonstrates antisegregation behavior, meaning that the Ir atoms segregate away from the surface even when oxygen is present. This unique behavior could have implications for the design of catalysts with specific surface properties and reactivity patterns.

5. The surface segregation energy is quantitatively determined as the energy required to move an atom from the interior to the surface of the crystal. Negative values indicate that the atoms are more likely to segregate to the surface, while positive values suggest the opposite. This energy parameter is crucial for understanding the energetics of surface segregation in Pt-based alloys and its impact on catalytic performance.

6. The study employs density functional theory (DFT) to analyze the adsorption of oxygen and its effect on surface segregation in Pt-based alloys. This computational approach provides insights into the structural and energetic aspects of the adsorption process, enabling a detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved.

7. The computational details of the study involve the use of the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) for DFT calculations. The calculations consider the effects of oxygen adsorption on the surface structure and segregation behavior of Pt-based alloys, taking into account the presence of defects such as steps and terraces on the (211) surfaces.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基合金如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离行为有显著影响。这些条件决定了氧吸附的最有利位置，进而影响合金成分的表面分离行为。氧的存在可以促进或抑制特定元素的分离，这取决于合金的组成以及合金成分与氧之间的相互作用性质。

2. 该研究结果表明，在(211)表面的Pt基合金上，桥接位点位于平行于(100)台阶的位置是能量最有利的氧吸附位置。这一发现对于理解氧与这些表面的相互作用及其对合金催化性能的影响至关重要。

3. 在Pt基合金（如Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co核心）中观察到了表面分离现象，这意味着在特定条件下，合金成分的原子可以从内部移动到表面。这种行为受到诸如合金类型、氧的存在和合金结构等因素的影响。

4. 在研究的系统中，只有Pt/Ir核心结构显示出反向分离行为，这意味着Ir原子即使在氧存在的情况下也会从表面分离。这种独特的行为可能对设计具有特定表面特性和活性模式的催化剂有重要意义。

5. 表面分离能被定量确定为将原子从内部移动到晶体表面所需的能量。负值表示原子更有可能向表面分离，正值则表示相反。这个能量参数对于理解Pt基合金的表面分离动力学及其对催化性能的影响至关重要。

6. 研究采用密度泛函理论（DFT）来分析氧吸附和表面分离在Pt基合金中的作用。这一计算方法提供了关于吸附过程的结构和能态的深入理解，从而揭示了催化机制。

7. 计算细节涉及使用维也纳原初模拟包（VASP）进行DFT计算。这些计算考虑了氧吸附对表面结构和分离行为的影响，同时考虑到(211)表面上存在的缺陷如台阶和平台。
