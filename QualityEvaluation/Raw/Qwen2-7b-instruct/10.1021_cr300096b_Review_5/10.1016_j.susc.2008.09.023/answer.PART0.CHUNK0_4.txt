1. The most stable site for oxygen adsorption on a (211) surface is the bridge site parallel to the (100) step. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution and understanding the impact of segregation on surface structure is crucial. This study investigates how surface segregation is affected by oxygen adsorption on stepped (211) surfaces. Adsorption energies vary across different sites. Surface segregation energy quantifies the energy required to move an atom from the interior to the surface. The adsorption energy is calculated by subtracting the total energy of the slab with oxygen adsorbed from the sum of the total energy of the slab without oxygen and the energy of the oxygen atom.

1. 氧吸附在(211)表面上最稳定的位点是平行于(100)步的桥位。表面积分分布的特征化和表面聚集对表面结构的影响至关重要。本研究探讨了如何在阶梯状(211)表面上的氧吸附影响表面聚集。不同位点的吸附能有所不同。表面聚集能量化将原子从内部移动到表面所需的能量。吸附能通过从带有氧吸附的板的总能量中减去没有氧的板的总能量和氧原子的能量来计算。
