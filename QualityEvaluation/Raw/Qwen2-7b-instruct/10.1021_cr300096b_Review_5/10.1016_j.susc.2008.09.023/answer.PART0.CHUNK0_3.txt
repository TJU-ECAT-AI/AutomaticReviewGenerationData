1. Density functional theory (DFT) was applied to investigate the impact of oxygen adsorption on surface segregation in (211) surfaces of Pt-based alloys. The bridge site over and parallel to the (100) step was identified as the most energetically favorable site for oxygen adsorption. Surface segregation phenomena was observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibited unique antisegregation behavior even in the presence of oxygen adsorption.

2. Catalytic activity is significantly influenced by the arrangement of atoms in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface. Characterizing the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and understanding the effects of segregation on surface structure is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance.

3. The (211) surface features (111) terraces separated by monatomic (100) steps. This structure plays a significant role in the interaction of oxygen with the surface and the subsequent surface segregation processes.

4. Surface segregation energy (Esegr) quantifies the energy required to move an atom from the interior to the surface of a crystal. Adsorption energy (Eads) is determined by subtracting the total energy of the slab with oxygen adsorbed from the sum of the total energy of the slab without oxygen and the total energy of the oxygen atom.

1. 密度泛函理论（DFT）被用来研究氧吸附对Pt基合金（211）表面相分离的影响。桥接位置，平行于（100）步，被确定为氧吸附的最有利能级位置。在Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(core)系统中观察到了表面相分离现象。只有Pt/Ir(core)结构在氧吸附存在的情况下显示出反相分离行为。

2. 催化活性显著取决于催化剂表面前23层原子的排列。表征催化合金的表面原子分布并阐明相分离对表面结构的影响对于优化催化剂性能至关重要。

3. （211）表面由（111）台阶与单原子（100）步骤隔开。这种结构在氧与表面相互作用以及随后的表面相分离过程中起着重要作用。

4. 表面相分离能（Esegr）衡量将原子从内部移动到晶体表面所需的能量。吸附能（Eads）通过从带有氧吸附的晶片的总能量减去没有氧的晶片的总能量和氧原子的总能量来确定。
