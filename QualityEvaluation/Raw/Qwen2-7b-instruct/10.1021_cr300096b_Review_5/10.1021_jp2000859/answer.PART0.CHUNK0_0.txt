Theoretical studies on the local electronic alloy effects of oxygen-related molecules on a PtPd cluster model have been conducted. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions greatly affect the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences have significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance across different applications.
