[1] "The effect of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms on adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene (CH2CH2) on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy with θSn = 0.33 was investigated by using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)."
[2] "Preadsorbed H decreased the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and less H was required to completely block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy than that on Pt(111)."
[3] "Preadsorbed H also decreased the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface."
[4] "The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this Sn/Pt(111) alloy is dramatically different than on the Pt(111) surface: the H-addition reaction channel taking ethylene to ethane on Pt(111) is totally inhibited on the alloy."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by altering the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. In the case of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, the presence of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms significantly affects the adsorption, desorption, and reaction pathways. The adsorption energy of ethylene is slightly weakened by the hydrogen, yet the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene decreases linearly with increasing hydrogen coverage, leading to substantial site-blocking effects. This means that even a relatively small amount of hydrogen, specifically 0.35 ML, can completely block ethylene chemisorption on the alloy, indicating that two Pt atoms are required for ethylene adsorption. Furthermore, the reaction chemistry of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy is markedly different from that on pure Pt(111), with the hydrogenation reaction channel involving ethylene and hydrogen being totally inhibited on the alloy.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过改变催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用，影响双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面层析、结构配置。对于在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的乙烯，表面吸附氢原子对吸附、脱附和反应路径产生显著影响。乙烯的吸附能略微减弱，但化学吸附的乙烯饱和覆盖率随着氢覆盖度的增加而线性降低，导致显著的位点阻塞效应。这意味着仅需相对少量的氢，即0.35 ML，就能完全阻止合金上的乙烯化学吸附，表明需要两个Pt原子进行乙烯吸附。此外，乙烯在Sn/Pt(111)合金上的反应化学与纯Pt(111)上的大不相同，涉及乙烯和氢的氢化反应通道在合金上被完全抑制。
