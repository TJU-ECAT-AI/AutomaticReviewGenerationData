The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In the case of Pt(111), ethylene chemisorbs molecularly via nearly complete rehybridization, forming two PtC σ-bonds. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene, requiring less hydrogen to completely block ethylene chemisorption on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy compared to pure Pt(111). On the Sn/Pt(111) alloy, the H-addition reaction channel that leads to ethane formation on Pt(111) is inhibited. Coadsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on Pt(111) results in the formation of ethane upon heating. Alloying Pt with Sn shifts the sp3-hybridization of carbon atoms in di-σ-bonded ethylene towards sp2-hybridized carbon in π-bonded ethylene, which is known to hydrogenate to ethane faster under catalytic conditions on pure Pt(111). However, on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy, this pathway is inhibited, indicating that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive. The findings contribute to our understanding of the surface science of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis, offering insights into why the activity for alkene hydrogenation is decreased in supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面相分离以及结构配置产生显著影响。在Pt(111)上，乙烯以分子形式化学吸附，并通过广泛的后键结合完全重新杂化，形成两个PtC σ键。共吸附的氢降低了化学吸附的乙烯饱和覆盖度，且在Sn/Pt(111)合金上所需的氢量比纯Pt(111)少。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上，导致乙烷形成的H-添加反应途径被抑制。在Pt(111)上，氢和乙烯的共吸附在加热时导致乙烷的形成。合金化的Pt与Sn改变了二σ键合乙烯中碳原子的sp3杂化向sp2杂化的π键合乙烯方向，这在纯Pt(111)上报告为π键合乙烯氢化到乙烷的速度快于二σ键合乙烯。然而，在Sn/Pt(111)合金上，这一途径被抑制，表明π键合乙烯并不特别活跃。这些发现对于推进氢化和脱氢催化科学的理解具有重要意义，有助于解释为什么在支持的双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中烯烃氢化活性降低的原因。

<p>Hydrogen coadsorption weakens the interaction between ethylene and the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface. One effect is to cause a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene, but this perturbation is rather small. The most significant, and unexpected, effect of hydrogen coadsorption is to cause a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption. Preadsorption of 0.3-ML H is sufficient to eliminate population of di-σ-bonded ethylene on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>There is a direct, large repulsive interaction between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene molecules on the 3 alloy.29 Such a geometric or site-blocking effect has often been invoked to explain the action of a second metal atom, such as Sn or Bi, or other adatoms, such as S, O, or C, on transition metal chemistry, but such an effect is rarely used in explaining the action of the relatively small H adatoms. The site-blocking behavior of H on the 3 alloy and Pt(111) is similar, although one might expect small differences to arise from the weaker, and thus longer, PtH bond on the alloy which allows the H adatom to sit higher at the surface or perhaps have a little additional negative charge, and thus larger diameter, interfering with the close approach of ethylene to Pt atoms at the surface needed to facilitate strong bonding interactions. The large difference in the amount of H needed on the 3 alloy and Pt(111) to completely eliminate sites for ethylene to chemisorb arises from the influence of alloyed Sn. These surface Sn atoms directly eliminate Pt sites by their physical presence and also affect the electronic structure of neighboring Pt sites. 30,31 Another possible influence is that preadsorbed H exerts an electronic or ligand effect in which H adatoms change the local density of states at Pt sites on the 3 alloy, and this inhibits back-bonding so severely that di-σ-bonded ethylene cannot be formed. There is support for this notion. RAIRS has been used to show that di-σ-bonded ethylene on Pd(111) is converted to π-bonded ethylene when the surface is presaturated by H adatoms. 32 First-principles calculation of ethylene and H coadsorption on Pd(110) 33 shows that the presence of coadsorbed H increases the four-electron repulsion between the ethylene π orbital and the dz2 band of the metal and decreases the back-donation interaction between the metal dz2 orbital and the ethylene π* orbital. Because ethylene is already less rehybridized on the 3 alloy than on Pt(111), the addition of coadsorbed hydrogen could reduce the back-bonding just enough to convert di-σ-bonded ethylene to π-bonded ethylene, which is only physisorbed on the 3 alloy and therefore not adsorbed at 100 K (desorbing at 85 K on K/Pt(111) 34).</p>
<p>The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating.3,13This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy. This is unexpected. Alloyed Sn in Pt(111) shifts the sp3-hybridization of carbon atoms in di-σ-bonded ethylene in the direction of sp2-hybridized carbon in π-bonded ethylene,20 and it has been reported that π-bonded ethylene hydrogenates to ethane much faster than di-σ-bonded ethylene under catalytic conditions on Pt(111).8 However, Domen's recent IRAS findings 35 excluded the existence of π-bonded ethylene under similar catalytic conditions, and they concluded that the rate-determining step of hydrogenation does not involve forming either di-σ-bonded or π-bonded ethylene (they proposed that activation of hydrogen plays an important role in ethylene hydrogenation under catalytic conditions). Our finding that no ethylene hydrogenation occurs upon heating a coadsorbed monolayer of H adatoms and ethylene on the 3 alloy implies that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive and ethylene simply desorbs at a temperature that is lower than that required for hydrogenation.</p>

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In the context of the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, hydrogen coadsorption leads to a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene. More significantly, it results in a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption, requiring only 0.3 ML of hydrogen to eliminate ethylene adsorption sites. This site-blocking behavior is attributed to a large repulsive interaction between hydrogen adatoms and ethylene molecules, which can be explained by the physical presence of surface Sn atoms eliminating Pt sites and altering the electronic structure of neighboring Pt sites. Additionally, hydrogen may exert an electronic or ligand effect, changing the local density of states at Pt sites, which inhibits back-bonding, converting di-σ-bonded ethylene to π-bonded ethylene. The stability of bimetallic catalysts is thus affected by these interactions, leading to changes in surface segregation and structural configurations. The catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts in various applications are consequently impacted by these interactions and the resulting changes in the surface chemistry and reactivity of the adsorbed species.

The large difference in hydrogenation activity between the Pt(111) surface and the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy is another key finding. On Pt(111), coadsorbed hydrogen and ethylene form mostly ethane upon heating. However, this reaction pathway is completely blocked on the alloy. This is unexpected, as alloyed Sn shifts the sp3-hybridization of carbon atoms in di-σ-bonded ethylene towards sp2-hybridization, similar to π-bonded ethylene. Under catalytic conditions, π-bonded ethylene is reported to hydrogenate to ethane faster than di-σ-bonded ethylene on Pt(111). Nevertheless, Domen's recent findings exclude the existence of π-bonded ethylene under similar conditions, suggesting that the rate-determining step of hydrogenation does not involve either di-σ-bonded or π-bonded ethylene. The absence of ethylene hydrogenation upon heating a coadsorbed monolayer of hydrogen and ethylene on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy implies that π-bonded ethylene is not reactive, and ethylene simply desorbs at a lower temperature than required for hydrogenation. This finding has implications for the catalytic activity of supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts, particularly in alkene hydrogenation reactions, where the addition of Sn decreases the interaction between alkenes and Pt, and the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface.

热力学偏好和反应条件对二金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面沉积行为产生影响。在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金的背景下，氢共吸附导致共吸附的双键乙烯吸附能降低。更显著的是，它导致乙烯化学吸附位点几乎1:1的位点阻塞，仅需要0.3 ML的氢来消除乙烯吸附位点。这种位点阻塞行为归因于氢原子与乙烯分子之间的大排斥作用，这可以由表面Sn原子的物理存在消除Pt位点以及相邻Pt位点的电子结构变化来解释。此外，氢可能施加电子或配体效应，改变Pt位点的局部密度态，抑制后键合，将双键乙烯转化为π键乙烯。因此，这些相互作用和由此产生的表面化学和吸附物种活性的变化影响了二金属催化剂的稳定性、表面沉积行为和结构配置。

在Pt(111)表面和（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金之间，氢化活性的巨大差异是另一个关键发现。在Pt(111)上，共吸附的氢和乙烯加热时主要形成乙烷。然而，在合金中，这一反应途径完全被阻止。这出乎意料，因为合金化的Sn将双键乙烯中的碳原子的sp3杂化向sp2杂化转变，类似于π键乙烯。在催化条件下，π键乙烯在Pt(111)上的氢化速度比双键乙烯快。然而，Domen最近的研究排除了在类似条件下存在π键乙烯，他们认为激活氢在乙烯氢化下起着重要作用。没有乙烷氢化在加热共吸附的一层氢和乙烯在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上的发现表明π键乙烯不具有反应性，乙烯简单地在低于氢化所需温度的温度下脱附。这一发现对支持二金属Pt/Sn催化剂的催化活性，特别是在烯烃氢化反应中，具有重要意义，其中添加Sn减少了烯烃与Pt的相互作用，并减少了催化剂表面吸附烯烃的活性。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by altering the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. In the case of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, the presence of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms significantly affects the adsorption, desorption, and reaction pathways. The adsorption energy of ethylene is slightly weakened by the hydrogen, yet the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene decreases linearly with increasing hydrogen coverage, leading to substantial site-blocking effects. This means that even a relatively small amount of hydrogen, specifically 0.35 ML, can completely block ethylene chemisorption on the alloy, indicating that two Pt atoms are required for ethylene adsorption. Furthermore, the reaction chemistry of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy is markedly different from that on pure Pt(111), with the hydrogenation reaction channel involving ethylene and hydrogen being totally inhibited on the alloy.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen affects the adsorption energy of ethylene on these surfaces, leading to a decrease in its saturation coverage. This is due to substantial site-blocking effects, which become particularly pronounced at higher hydrogen coverages. The desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface is also reduced by the presence of hydrogen. Moreover, the reaction chemistry of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy differs markedly from that on pure Pt(111). Specifically, the hydrogenation pathway that typically leads to the formation of ethane from ethylene on Pt(111) is completely inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy. This implies that the addition of Sn to the Pt surface not only reduces the interaction between alkenes and Pt but also decreases the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface. These findings provide crucial insights into the surface science of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis and shed light on the decreased activity of alkene hydrogenation observed in supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.
