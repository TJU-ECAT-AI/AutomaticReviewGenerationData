[1] "Preadsorbed H decreased the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and less H was required to completely block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy than that on Pt(111)."
[2] "Preadsorbed H also decreased the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface."
[3] "The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this Sn/Pt(111) alloy is dramatically different than on the Pt(111) surface: the H-addition reaction channel taking ethylene to ethane on Pt(111) is totally inhibited on the alloy."
[4] "This is much less hydrogen than is needed to completely block the adsorption of ethylene on Pt(111)."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen alters the adsorption energy and saturation coverage of ethylene on the alloy surface, reducing the energy required to block ethylene chemisorption compared to pure Pt surfaces. This is due to a repulsive interaction between hydrogen adatoms and ethylene molecules, causing a site-blocking effect. The desorption activation energy for ethylene is also decreased on the alloy surface. The reaction chemistry of ethylene on the alloy is markedly different, inhibiting the hydrogenation pathway to ethane that is prevalent on pure Pt surfaces. This implies that hydrogenation activities are decreased in bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts, as the interaction between alkenes and Pt is reduced, and the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface is diminished.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离以及结构配置产生了显著影响。共吸附的氢改变了乙烷在合金表面的吸附能和饱和覆盖率，减少在合金上完全阻塞乙烷化学吸附所需的氢量与纯Pt表面相比。这是由于氢原子与乙烷分子之间的排斥作用，导致了位点堵塞效应。乙烷在合金表面的脱附活化能也降低。乙烷在合金上的反应化学与纯Pt表面大不相同，抑制了纯Pt表面上存在的将乙烷转化为乙烷的氢化途径。这意味着在Pt/Sn双金属催化剂中，氢化活性降低，因为烯烃与Pt的相互作用减弱，并且催化剂表面上吸附的烯烃的活性降低。
