<p>Hydrogen coadsorption weakens the interaction between ethylene and the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface. One effect is to cause a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene, but this perturbation is rather small. The most significant, and unexpected, effect of hydrogen coadsorption is to cause a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption. Preadsorption of 0.3-ML H is sufficient to eliminate population of di-σ-bonded ethylene on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>There is a direct, large repulsive interaction between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene molecules on the 3 alloy.29 Such a geometric or site-blocking effect has often been invoked to explain the action of a second metal atom, such as Sn or Bi, or other adatoms, such as S, O, or C, on transition metal chemistry, but such an effect is rarely used in explaining the action of the relatively small H adatoms. The site-blocking behavior of H on the 3 alloy and Pt(111) is similar, although one might expect small differences to arise from the weaker, and thus longer, PtH bond on the alloy which allows the H adatom to sit higher at the surface or perhaps have a little additional negative charge, and thus larger diameter, interfering with the close approach of ethylene to Pt atoms at the surface needed to facilitate strong bonding interactions. The large difference in the amount of H needed on the 3 alloy and Pt(111) to completely eliminate sites for ethylene to chemisorb arises from the influence of alloyed Sn. These surface Sn atoms directly eliminate Pt sites by their physical presence and also affect the electronic structure of neighboring Pt sites. 30,31 Another possible influence is that preadsorbed H exerts an electronic or ligand effect in which H adatoms change the local density of states at Pt sites on the 3 alloy, and this inhibits back-bonding so severely that di-σ-bonded ethylene cannot be formed. There is support for this notion. RAIRS has been used to show that di-σ-bonded ethylene on Pd(111) is converted to π-bonded ethylene when the surface is presaturated by H adatoms. 32 First-principles calculation of ethylene and H coadsorption on Pd(110) 33 shows that the presence of coadsorbed H increases the four-electron repulsion between the ethylene π orbital and the dz2 band of the metal and decreases the back-donation interaction between the metal dz2 orbital and the ethylene π* orbital. Because ethylene is already less rehybridized on the 3 alloy than on Pt(111), the addition of coadsorbed hydrogen could reduce the back-bonding just enough to convert di-σ-bonded ethylene to π-bonded ethylene, which is only physisorbed on the 3 alloy and therefore not adsorbed at 100 K (desorbing at 85 K on K/Pt(111) 34).</p>
<p>The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating.3,13This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy. This is unexpected. Alloyed Sn in Pt(111) shifts the sp3-hybridization of carbon atoms in di-σ-bonded ethylene in the direction of sp2-hybridized carbon in π-bonded ethylene,20 and it has been reported that π-bonded ethylene hydrogenates to ethane much faster than di-σ-bonded ethylene under catalytic conditions on Pt(111).8 However, Domen's recent IRAS findings 35 excluded the existence of π-bonded ethylene under similar catalytic conditions, and they concluded that the rate-determining step of hydrogenation does not involve forming either di-σ-bonded or π-bonded ethylene (they proposed that activation of hydrogen plays an important role in ethylene hydrogenation under catalytic conditions). Our finding that no ethylene hydrogenation occurs upon heating a coadsorbed monolayer of H adatoms and ethylene on the 3 alloy implies that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive and ethylene simply desorbs at a temperature that is lower than that required for hydrogenation.</p>

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In the context of the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy, hydrogen coadsorption leads to a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene. More significantly, it results in a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption, requiring only 0.3 ML of hydrogen to eliminate ethylene adsorption sites. This site-blocking behavior is attributed to a large repulsive interaction between hydrogen adatoms and ethylene molecules, which can be explained by the physical presence of surface Sn atoms eliminating Pt sites and altering the electronic structure of neighboring Pt sites. Additionally, hydrogen may exert an electronic or ligand effect, changing the local density of states at Pt sites, which inhibits back-bonding, converting di-σ-bonded ethylene to π-bonded ethylene. The stability of bimetallic catalysts is thus affected by these interactions, leading to changes in surface segregation and structural configurations. The catalytic properties and performance of these catalysts in various applications are consequently impacted by these interactions and the resulting changes in the surface chemistry and reactivity of the adsorbed species.

The large difference in hydrogenation activity between the Pt(111) surface and the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy is another key finding. On Pt(111), coadsorbed hydrogen and ethylene form mostly ethane upon heating. However, this reaction pathway is completely blocked on the alloy. This is unexpected, as alloyed Sn shifts the sp3-hybridization of carbon atoms in di-σ-bonded ethylene towards sp2-hybridization, similar to π-bonded ethylene. Under catalytic conditions, π-bonded ethylene is reported to hydrogenate to ethane faster than di-σ-bonded ethylene on Pt(111). Nevertheless, Domen's recent findings exclude the existence of π-bonded ethylene under similar conditions, suggesting that the rate-determining step of hydrogenation does not involve either di-σ-bonded or π-bonded ethylene. The absence of ethylene hydrogenation upon heating a coadsorbed monolayer of hydrogen and ethylene on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy implies that π-bonded ethylene is not reactive, and ethylene simply desorbs at a lower temperature than required for hydrogenation. This finding has implications for the catalytic activity of supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts, particularly in alkene hydrogenation reactions, where the addition of Sn decreases the interaction between alkenes and Pt, and the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface.

热力学偏好和反应条件对二金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面沉积行为产生影响。在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金的背景下，氢共吸附导致共吸附的双键乙烯吸附能降低。更显著的是，它导致乙烯化学吸附位点几乎1:1的位点阻塞，仅需要0.3 ML的氢来消除乙烯吸附位点。这种位点阻塞行为归因于氢原子与乙烯分子之间的大排斥作用，这可以由表面Sn原子的物理存在消除Pt位点以及相邻Pt位点的电子结构变化来解释。此外，氢可能施加电子或配体效应，改变Pt位点的局部密度态，抑制后键合，将双键乙烯转化为π键乙烯。因此，这些相互作用和由此产生的表面化学和吸附物种活性的变化影响了二金属催化剂的稳定性、表面沉积行为和结构配置。

在Pt(111)表面和（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金之间，氢化活性的巨大差异是另一个关键发现。在Pt(111)上，共吸附的氢和乙烯加热时主要形成乙烷。然而，在合金中，这一反应途径完全被阻止。这出乎意料，因为合金化的Sn将双键乙烯中的碳原子的sp3杂化向sp2杂化转变，类似于π键乙烯。在催化条件下，π键乙烯在Pt(111)上的氢化速度比双键乙烯快。然而，Domen最近的研究排除了在类似条件下存在π键乙烯，他们认为激活氢在乙烯氢化下起着重要作用。没有乙烷氢化在加热共吸附的一层氢和乙烯在（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上的发现表明π键乙烯不具有反应性，乙烯简单地在低于氢化所需温度的温度下脱附。这一发现对支持二金属Pt/Sn催化剂的催化活性，特别是在烯烃氢化反应中，具有重要意义，其中添加Sn减少了烯烃与Pt的相互作用，并减少了催化剂表面吸附烯烃的活性。
