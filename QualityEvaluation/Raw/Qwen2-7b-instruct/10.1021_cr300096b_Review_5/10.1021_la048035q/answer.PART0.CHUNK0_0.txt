The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In the case of Pt(111), ethylene chemisorbs molecularly via nearly complete rehybridization, forming two PtC σ-bonds. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene, requiring less hydrogen to completely block ethylene chemisorption on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy compared to pure Pt(111). On the Sn/Pt(111) alloy, the H-addition reaction channel that leads to ethane formation on Pt(111) is inhibited. Coadsorption of hydrogen and ethylene on Pt(111) results in the formation of ethane upon heating. Alloying Pt with Sn shifts the sp3-hybridization of carbon atoms in di-σ-bonded ethylene towards sp2-hybridized carbon in π-bonded ethylene, which is known to hydrogenate to ethane faster under catalytic conditions on pure Pt(111). However, on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy, this pathway is inhibited, indicating that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive. The findings contribute to our understanding of the surface science of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis, offering insights into why the activity for alkene hydrogenation is decreased in supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面相分离以及结构配置产生显著影响。在Pt(111)上，乙烯以分子形式化学吸附，并通过广泛的后键结合完全重新杂化，形成两个PtC σ键。共吸附的氢降低了化学吸附的乙烯饱和覆盖度，且在Sn/Pt(111)合金上所需的氢量比纯Pt(111)少。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上，导致乙烷形成的H-添加反应途径被抑制。在Pt(111)上，氢和乙烯的共吸附在加热时导致乙烷的形成。合金化的Pt与Sn改变了二σ键合乙烯中碳原子的sp3杂化向sp2杂化的π键合乙烯方向，这在纯Pt(111)上报告为π键合乙烯氢化到乙烷的速度快于二σ键合乙烯。然而，在Sn/Pt(111)合金上，这一途径被抑制，表明π键合乙烯并不特别活跃。这些发现对于推进氢化和脱氢催化科学的理解具有重要意义，有助于解释为什么在支持的双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中烯烃氢化活性降低的原因。
