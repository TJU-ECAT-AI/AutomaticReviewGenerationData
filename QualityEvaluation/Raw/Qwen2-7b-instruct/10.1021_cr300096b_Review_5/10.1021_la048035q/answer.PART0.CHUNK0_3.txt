[1] "Preadsorbed H decreased the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and less H was required to completely block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy than that on Pt(111)."
[2] "Preadsorbed H also decreased the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface."
[3] "The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this Sn/Pt(111) alloy is dramatically different than on the Pt(111) surface: the H-addition reaction channel taking ethylene to ethane on Pt(111) is totally inhibited on the alloy."
[4] "Coadsorbed H on the alloy slightly weakens (10%) the adsorption energy for ethylene on the this alloy. However, the chemisorbed monolayer saturation coverage of ethylene decreased linearly with increasing θH on the alloy due to substantial site-blocking effects, which totally eliminate ethylene chemisorption at θH = 0.35 ML."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The presence of coadsorbed hydrogen affects the adsorption energy of ethylene on these surfaces, leading to a decrease in its saturation coverage. This is due to substantial site-blocking effects, which become particularly pronounced at higher hydrogen coverages. The desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface is also reduced by the presence of hydrogen. Moreover, the reaction chemistry of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy differs markedly from that on pure Pt(111). Specifically, the hydrogenation pathway that typically leads to the formation of ethane from ethylene on Pt(111) is completely inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy. This implies that the addition of Sn to the Pt surface not only reduces the interaction between alkenes and Pt but also decreases the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface. These findings provide crucial insights into the surface science of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis and shed light on the decreased activity of alkene hydrogenation observed in supported bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置产生了显著影响。吸附氢的存在会影响这些表面上乙烯的吸附能，导致其饱和覆盖率的降低。这是由于在较高的氢覆盖率下出现显著的位点阻塞效应。乙烯在合金表面的脱附活化能也因氢的存在而降低。此外，乙烯在Sn/Pt(111)合金上的反应化学与在纯Pt(111)表面完全不同。具体而言，在Sn/Pt(111)合金上，通常导致乙烯转化为乙烷的氢化路径被完全抑制。这表明将Sn添加到Pt表面不仅减少了烯烃与Pt之间的相互作用，而且降低了吸附在催化剂表面的烯烃的反应活性。这些发现为理解氢化和脱氢催化科学提供了关键信息，并揭示了在支持的双金属Pt/Sn催化剂中观察到的烯烃氢化活性降低的原因。
