[1] "As seen above, the role of the morphology or crystallo- graphic changes and of the electronic structure change brought about by alloying, on the electrocatalysis of the orr still remains elusive."
[2] "It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpo- tential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt,which was maintained after all the electrochemical mea- surements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2."
[3] "The jk was determined for each electrode at constant potential in the manner described in the experimental section. A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient."
[4] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhance- ment is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."
[5] "Such positive shifts were also observed for other binding energies. These chemical shifts of the core orbitals such as 4d3/2 and 4d5/2, which we observe here, show that the electronic structure changes in the skin Pt as well as in the Pt in the bulk alloy phase, and strongly suggests a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase of the valence electron (5d) vacancy."
[6] "Beyond the Fe content at the maximum enhancement, a back-donation of elec- trons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule might be not enough due to too much d-vacancy, resulting in the slowdown of the orr."

1. The exact role of the morphology, crystallographic changes, and electronic structure modifications resulting from alloying in the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains unclear. 

2. Alloying platinum (Pt) with iron (Fe) leads to a substantial decrease in the overpotential required for the ORR, with a reduction of approximately 150 millivolts on a 51% Fe-49% Pt alloy compared to pure Pt, and this reduction was maintained after all electrochemical measurements.

3. The maximum catalytic efficiency was observed at around 50 atomic percent Fe content, showing an enhancement factor of about 25 over pure Pt at 0.8 volts, and this enhancement remained consistent at less positive potentials as long as sufficient oxygen was supplied.

4. Despite the presence of a pure Pt layer on the alloy surface, a significant enhancement in catalytic activity was achieved, as depicted in Figure 2.

5. Positive chemical shifts in the 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 core orbitals were observed for Pt atoms, indicating changes in the electronic structure both on the surface and within the bulk alloy phase, suggesting a reduction in the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron (5d) vacancy.

6. At Fe contents beyond the point of maximum enhancement, the back-donation of electrons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule may not occur effectively due to excessive d-vacancy, leading to a slowdown in the ORR.

1. 形貌、晶体学变化以及合金化带来的电子结构改变在氧还原反应（ORR）中的具体作用仍然不清楚。

2. 将铂（Pt）与铁（Fe）合金化会导致过电势的显著降低，以51% Fe-49% Pt合金为例，在与纯Pt相比时，所需的过电势减少了大约150毫伏特，并且这一减少在所有电化学测量后保持不变。

3. 在约50原子百分比Fe含量处观察到最大催化效率，显示出相对于纯Pt在0.8伏特时增强因子约为25倍，并且随着充足的氧气供应，这种增强在更正的电位下保持一致。

4. 尽管合金表面存在一层纯铂层，但在合金化过程中仍实现了显著的催化活性增强，如图2所示。

5. 观察到Pt原子的核心轨道（4d3/2和4d5/2）上的正化学位移，这表明表面和合金基体中铂的电子结构发生了变化，暗示费米能级的降低或5d价电子的增加。

6. 在达到最大增强点的Fe含量之上，由于过剩的d空位，Pt原子向吸附的O2分子进行有效的电子回授可能不再发生，导致氧还原反应速度减慢。

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The presence of a pure Pt skin-layer on the surface of these alloys, typically around 1 nanometer thick, modifies the electronic structure, contributing to enhanced catalytic properties. The enhancement in catalytic activity is primarily due to the 5d-vacancy of the surface, rather than changes in Pt interatomic distance or surface roughness. These catalysts consistently display improved performance under various conditions and after electrochemical measurements. Their stability is crucial for practical applications in PEMFCs, necessitating examination in more corrosive conditions akin to highly dispersed states. Despite the alloying, the rate-determining step for the oxygen reduction reaction remains unchanged, indicating that the Pt and alloy surfaces exhibit similar Tafel slopes. The alloys maintain their enhanced performance throughout these tests.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响着双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置。这些合金表面通常覆盖着约1纳米厚的纯Pt层，这种层能够修改电子结构，从而增强催化性能。催化活性的提升主要归因于表面的5d空位，而不是Pt原子间距或表面粗糙度的变化。在各种条件下以及经过电化学测量后，这些催化剂始终表现出改善的性能。它们的稳定性对于实际应用至关重要，需要在更腐蚀性的条件下进行检验，这类似于高度分散的状态。尽管存在合金化，但氧还原反应的决定性步骤并未改变，表明Pt和合金表面具有相似的塔菲尔斜率。这些合金在整个测试过程中保持其增强的性能。

1. The document discusses the challenges in understanding how thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the resulting stability, surface segregation, and structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys, influence their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The study focuses on the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on PtFe alloys and finds that the enhancement of catalytic activity is due to the modification of the electronic structure of the Pt surface, rather than changes in interatomic distances or surface roughness.

2. The document explains that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity on PtFe alloys can be well explained by the presence of a 5d-vacancy in the surface, which leads to a stronger metal-oxygen interaction. This results in faster bond scission and/or bond formation between the O atom and H+ in the electrolyte, thus enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. The document mentions that the enhancement mechanism does not depend on the geometric factor, as the interatomic distance of the surface should be the same as that of pure Pt, regardless of the alloy composition. This implies that the enhancement observed is not solely attributed to the geometric structure of the alloy surfaces.

4. The document discusses the implications of the findings for the development of more active cathode catalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), which are crucial for reducing the amount of precious metals used without compromising performance. The study reveals the principal role of the electronic structure of Pt and Pt alloys for the ORR, and suggests that this principle applies to other alloys such as PtNi. The stability of these alloys under various electrochemical measurements indicates their potential for practical applications in PEFCs.

1. 文档探讨了热力学偏好、反应条件以及合金化导致的形貌、晶体结构变化和电子结构变化如何影响铂基系统（如Pt-Fe合金）中双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置，进而影响它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能。研究重点是铂铁合金上氧还原反应（ORR）的电催化作用，并发现增强催化活性的原因在于铂表面电子结构的修改，而不是原子间距离或表面粗糙度的变化。

2. 文档解释说，铂铁合金上ORR增强的催化活性可以通过表面存在的5d空位来很好地解释，这导致更强的金属-氧相互作用。这会导致氧原子与电解质中的H+之间更快的键断裂和/或形成新的键，从而增强催化性能。

3. 文档提到，增强机制不依赖于几何因素，因为无论合金组成如何，表面的原子间距离都应与纯铂相同。这意味着观察到的增强并不是仅由合金表面的几何结构所决定的。

4. 文档讨论了这些发现对聚合物电解质燃料电池（PEFCs）中更活跃阴极催化剂开发的含义，这对于减少使用贵金属的同时保持性能至关重要。研究揭示了铂和铂合金的电子结构在ORR中的主导作用，并表明这一原理适用于其他合金如铂镍。这些合金在各种电化学测量下的稳定性表明其在PEFC中的潜在应用可能性。
