[1] "The role of the morphology or crystallo- graphic changes and of the electronic structure change brought about by alloying, on the electrocatalysis of the orr still remains elusive."
[2] "The enhancement could be well explained by the 5d-vacancy of the surface, but not by Pt interatomic distance or roughening of the surfaces."
[3] "The electronic structure changes in the skin Pt as well as in the Pt in the bulk alloy phase, and strongly suggests a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase of the valence electron (5d) vacancy."
[4] "The role of the geometric factor, which they rationalized in the enhancement mechanism, is not accepted because the present bulk alloys and probably the dispersed alloys used in PEFCs are all covered with a Pt skin and the interatomic distance of the surface should be the same as that of pure Pt."

1. The document discusses the challenges in understanding how thermodynamic preferences, reaction conditions, and the resulting stability, surface segregation, and structural configurations of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys, influence their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The study focuses on the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on PtFe alloys and finds that the enhancement of catalytic activity is due to the modification of the electronic structure of the Pt surface, rather than changes in interatomic distances or surface roughness.

2. The document explains that the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity on PtFe alloys can be well explained by the presence of a 5d-vacancy in the surface, which leads to a stronger metal-oxygen interaction. This results in faster bond scission and/or bond formation between the O atom and H+ in the electrolyte, thus enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. The document mentions that the enhancement mechanism does not depend on the geometric factor, as the interatomic distance of the surface should be the same as that of pure Pt, regardless of the alloy composition. This implies that the enhancement observed is not solely attributed to the geometric structure of the alloy surfaces.

4. The document discusses the implications of the findings for the development of more active cathode catalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), which are crucial for reducing the amount of precious metals used without compromising performance. The study reveals the principal role of the electronic structure of Pt and Pt alloys for the ORR, and suggests that this principle applies to other alloys such as PtNi. The stability of these alloys under various electrochemical measurements indicates their potential for practical applications in PEFCs.

1. 文档探讨了热力学偏好、反应条件以及合金化导致的形貌、晶体结构变化和电子结构变化如何影响铂基系统（如Pt-Fe合金）中双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置，进而影响它们在各种应用中的催化性质和性能。研究重点是铂铁合金上氧还原反应（ORR）的电催化作用，并发现增强催化活性的原因在于铂表面电子结构的修改，而不是原子间距离或表面粗糙度的变化。

2. 文档解释说，铂铁合金上ORR增强的催化活性可以通过表面存在的5d空位来很好地解释，这导致更强的金属-氧相互作用。这会导致氧原子与电解质中的H+之间更快的键断裂和/或形成新的键，从而增强催化性能。

3. 文档提到，增强机制不依赖于几何因素，因为无论合金组成如何，表面的原子间距离都应与纯铂相同。这意味着观察到的增强并不是仅由合金表面的几何结构所决定的。

4. 文档讨论了这些发现对聚合物电解质燃料电池（PEFCs）中更活跃阴极催化剂开发的含义，这对于减少使用贵金属的同时保持性能至关重要。研究揭示了铂和铂合金的电子结构在ORR中的主导作用，并表明这一原理适用于其他合金如铂镍。这些合金在各种电化学测量下的稳定性表明其在PEFC中的潜在应用可能性。
