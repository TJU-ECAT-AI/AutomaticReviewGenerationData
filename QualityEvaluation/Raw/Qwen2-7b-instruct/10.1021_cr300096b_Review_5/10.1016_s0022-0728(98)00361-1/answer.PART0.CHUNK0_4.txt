[1] "The design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymerelectrolyte fuel cells, which are now attracting enormous interest as a primary power source for zero-emission electric vehicles."
[2] "It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpotential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt,which was maintained after all the electrochemical measurements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2."
[3] "A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient."
[4] "These chemical shifts of the core orbitals such as 4d3/2 and 4d5/2, which we observe here, show that the electronic structure changes in the skin Pt as well as in the Pt in the bulk alloy phase, and strongly suggests a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase of the valence electron (5d) vacancy."
[5] "Beyond the Fe content at the maximum enhancement, a back-donation of electrons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule might be not enough due to too much d-vacancy, resulting in the slowdown of the orr."

1. The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In the case of PtFe alloys, the addition of Fe leads to a dramatic reduction of overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a decrease of approximately 150 mV on Pt51Fe49 compared to pure Pt. This reduction is maintained even after extensive electrochemical measurements. The maximum enhancement is observed at around 50 atomic percent of Fe content, where the activity is 25 times higher than pure Pt activity at 0.8 V, and remains constant at less positive potentials as long as the oxygen supply is sufficient. The electronic structure of the surface layer of the alloy changes, suggesting a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron (5d) vacancy. Beyond the optimal Fe content, the back-donation of electrons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule might slow down the ORR due to excessive d-vacancy.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件影响双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂系统的铂合金（如铂铁合金）的稳定性、表面富集和结构配置。在铂铁合金的情况下，通过添加铁，氧还原反应（ORR）的过电势显著降低，纯铂与铂51铁49之间的减少大约为150毫伏。这种减少即使在广泛的电化学测量后也能保持不变。在大约50原子百分比的铁含量下观察到最大增强，此时活动是纯铂在0.8伏时的25倍，并且在更正的电位下，只要氧气供应充足，就保持不变。合金表面层的电子结构发生变化，暗示费米能级的降低或价电子（5d）空位的增加。超过最佳的铁含量，从铂原子向吸附的O2分子捐赠电子可能由于过多的d空位而减慢ORR。
