[1] "As seen above, the role of the morphology or crystallo- graphic changes and of the electronic structure change brought about by alloying, on the electrocatalysis of the orr still remains elusive."
[2] "It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpo- tential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt,which was maintained after all the electrochemical mea- surements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2."
[3] "The jk was determined for each electrode at constant potential in the manner described in the experimental section. A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient."
[4] "We must emphasize that the extremely large enhance- ment is achieved as shown in Fig. 2, in spite of the presence of such a Pt skin on the alloy surface."
[5] "Such positive shifts were also observed for other binding energies. These chemical shifts of the core orbitals such as 4d3/2 and 4d5/2, which we observe here, show that the electronic structure changes in the skin Pt as well as in the Pt in the bulk alloy phase, and strongly suggests a lowering of the Fermi level or an increase of the valence electron (5d) vacancy."
[6] "Beyond the Fe content at the maximum enhancement, a back-donation of elec- trons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule might be not enough due to too much d-vacancy, resulting in the slowdown of the orr."

1. The exact role of the morphology, crystallographic changes, and electronic structure modifications resulting from alloying in the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains unclear. 

2. Alloying platinum (Pt) with iron (Fe) leads to a substantial decrease in the overpotential required for the ORR, with a reduction of approximately 150 millivolts on a 51% Fe-49% Pt alloy compared to pure Pt, and this reduction was maintained after all electrochemical measurements.

3. The maximum catalytic efficiency was observed at around 50 atomic percent Fe content, showing an enhancement factor of about 25 over pure Pt at 0.8 volts, and this enhancement remained consistent at less positive potentials as long as sufficient oxygen was supplied.

4. Despite the presence of a pure Pt layer on the alloy surface, a significant enhancement in catalytic activity was achieved, as depicted in Figure 2.

5. Positive chemical shifts in the 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 core orbitals were observed for Pt atoms, indicating changes in the electronic structure both on the surface and within the bulk alloy phase, suggesting a reduction in the Fermi level or an increase in the valence electron (5d) vacancy.

6. At Fe contents beyond the point of maximum enhancement, the back-donation of electrons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule may not occur effectively due to excessive d-vacancy, leading to a slowdown in the ORR.

1. 形貌、晶体学变化以及合金化带来的电子结构改变在氧还原反应（ORR）中的具体作用仍然不清楚。

2. 将铂（Pt）与铁（Fe）合金化会导致过电势的显著降低，以51% Fe-49% Pt合金为例，在与纯Pt相比时，所需的过电势减少了大约150毫伏特，并且这一减少在所有电化学测量后保持不变。

3. 在约50原子百分比Fe含量处观察到最大催化效率，显示出相对于纯Pt在0.8伏特时增强因子约为25倍，并且随着充足的氧气供应，这种增强在更正的电位下保持一致。

4. 尽管合金表面存在一层纯铂层，但在合金化过程中仍实现了显著的催化活性增强，如图2所示。

5. 观察到Pt原子的核心轨道（4d3/2和4d5/2）上的正化学位移，这表明表面和合金基体中铂的电子结构发生了变化，暗示费米能级的降低或5d价电子的增加。

6. 在达到最大增强点的Fe含量之上，由于过剩的d空位，Pt原子向吸附的O2分子进行有效的电子回授可能不再发生，导致氧还原反应速度减慢。
