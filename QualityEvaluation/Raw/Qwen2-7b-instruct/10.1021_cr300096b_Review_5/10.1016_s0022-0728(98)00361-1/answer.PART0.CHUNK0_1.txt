The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The presence of a pure Pt skin-layer on the surface of these alloys, typically around 1 nanometer thick, modifies the electronic structure, contributing to enhanced catalytic properties. The enhancement in catalytic activity is primarily due to the 5d-vacancy of the surface, rather than changes in Pt interatomic distance or surface roughness. These catalysts consistently display improved performance under various conditions and after electrochemical measurements. Their stability is crucial for practical applications in PEMFCs, necessitating examination in more corrosive conditions akin to highly dispersed states. Despite the alloying, the rate-determining step for the oxygen reduction reaction remains unchanged, indicating that the Pt and alloy surfaces exhibit similar Tafel slopes. The alloys maintain their enhanced performance throughout these tests.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响着双金属催化剂，尤其是基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置。这些合金表面通常覆盖着约1纳米厚的纯Pt层，这种层能够修改电子结构，从而增强催化性能。催化活性的提升主要归因于表面的5d空位，而不是Pt原子间距或表面粗糙度的变化。在各种条件下以及经过电化学测量后，这些催化剂始终表现出改善的性能。它们的稳定性对于实际应用至关重要，需要在更腐蚀性的条件下进行检验，这类似于高度分散的状态。尽管存在合金化，但氧还原反应的决定性步骤并未改变，表明Pt和合金表面具有相似的塔菲尔斜率。这些合金在整个测试过程中保持其增强的性能。
