[1] "The design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is essential for polymerelectrolyte fuel cells, which are now attracting enormous interest as a primary power source for zero-emission electric vehicles."
[2] "It was found that a dramatic reduction of overpotential for the orr is achieved by alloying Pt with Fe, i.e. ca. 150 mV less on Pt51Fe49 compared with that of Pt,which was maintained after all the electrochemical measurements for plotting LevichKoutecky plots such as that shown in the inset in Fig. 2."
[3] "The jk was determined for each electrode at constant potential in the manner described in the experimental section. A maximum jk is obtained at ca. 50 at.% Fe content, where the enhancement is a factor of ca. 25 over that of Pt alone at 0.8 V, and was almost constant at less positive potentials as long as the O2 supply was sufficient."
[4] "Such a positive chemical shift of Pt atoms was observed at all of the alloys examined regardless of the composition, although the shifts decreased after the experiment."
[5] "Mechanisms for the orr on pure Pt have been proposed but still remain elusive. As one of the possible mechanisms, Yeager et al. considered that the rds for the orr on a Pt catalyst surface in acid electrolytes is the adsorption step of an O2 molecule, as side-on or bridged type accompanied, with an electron transfer."
[6] "Beyond the Fe content at the maximum enhancement, a back-donation of electrons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed O2 molecule might be not enough due to too much d-vacancy, resulting in the slowdown of the orr."

1. The design of high performance cathode electrocatalysts is crucial for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, which are gaining significant interest as a primary power source for zero-emission electric vehicles.

2. Alloying platinum (Pt) with iron (Fe) significantly reduces the overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), achieving approximately 150 millivolts less on a Pt51Fe49 alloy compared to pure Pt, and this reduction was consistent across all electrochemical measurements.

3. The maximum current density (jK) was obtained at around 50 atomic percent (at.% Fe content), demonstrating an enhancement factor of approximately 25 over pure Pt activity at 0.8 volts, and this enhancement remained stable at less positive potentials as long as the oxygen supply was adequate.

4. A positive chemical shift of platinum (Pt) atoms was observed across all alloys tested, irrespective of their composition, with the shifts decreasing post-experiment.

5. One possible mechanism for the ORR on pure platinum (Pt) involves the adsorption of an oxygen molecule on the Pt catalyst surface, accompanied by electron transfer, as a side-on or bridged type.

6. Beyond the optimal Fe content for maximum enhancement, the back-donation of electrons from a Pt atom to an adsorbed oxygen molecule might slow down the ORR due to excessive d-vacancy.

1. 高性能阳极催化剂的设计对于聚合物电解质燃料电池至关重要，它们正在作为零排放电动汽车的主要电源引起巨大兴趣。

2. 将铂（Pt）与铁（Fe）合金化显著降低了氧还原反应（ORR）的过电势，Pt51Fe49合金相比纯Pt的过电势减少了约150毫伏，并且这种减少在所有电化学测量中保持一致。

3. 在大约50原子百分比（at.% Fe含量）下获得最大电流密度（jK），显示与纯Pt在0.8伏特时的增强因子约为25倍，这种增强在氧气供应充足的情况下，在更正的电位下保持稳定。

4. 不论合金组成如何，都观察到了铂（Pt）原子的正化学偏移，实验后这些偏移有所降低。

5. 对于纯铂（Pt）上氧还原反应（ORR）的一种可能机制涉及氧分子在Pt催化剂表面的吸附，伴随电子转移，以侧向或桥接类型。

6. 超过最大增强的Fe含量，从Pt原子向吸附的氧分子进行电子回授可能会因过多的d空穴而减缓ORR，导致ORR变慢。
