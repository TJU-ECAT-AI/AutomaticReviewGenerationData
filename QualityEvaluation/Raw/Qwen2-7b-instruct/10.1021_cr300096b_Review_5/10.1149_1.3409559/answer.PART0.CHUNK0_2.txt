1. The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The introduction of iridium into these systems leads to a strong Pt surface segregation tendency, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on the surfaces. This top Pt monolayer induces relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups, which suggests an enhancement in the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the Pt-skin surfaces of these ternary alloys demonstrate improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性和表面偏聚。引入铱到这些系统中导致了强烈的铂表面偏聚倾向，导致在表面上形成一层铂单层。这种顶层铂单层导致氧和羟基团的结合强度相对较弱，这表明与相应的双金属合金表面相比，进一步增强了ORR的活性。此外，这些三元合金的铂表层显示出对铂原子从合金表面溶解的增强电化学稳定性。
