[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."
[2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."
[3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."
[4] "The origin of the catalytic activity and stability enhancement for the alloys is analyzed."

1. Ternary alloys display a significant tendency for platinum surface segregation, which results in the formation of a platinum monolayer on their surfaces. This leads to a decrease in the binding strength of oxygen and hydroxyl groups on the surface, thereby enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloys. Additionally, the Pt-skin surfaces of certain alloys demonstrate increased electrochemical stability against the dissolution of platinum atoms from the alloy surface. The underlying reasons for these enhancements in catalytic activity and stability are explored in detail.

1. 三元合金表现出显著的铂表面分离倾向，导致在它们的表面上形成一层单层铂。这导致氧气和羟基分子与表面的结合强度降低，从而相对于双金属合金表面，进一步提高了氧还原反应（ORR）的活性。此外，某些合金的铂皮肤表面表现出对铂原子溶解的合金表面的增强电化学稳定性。对于这些活性和稳定性的增强背后的原因进行了详细分析。
