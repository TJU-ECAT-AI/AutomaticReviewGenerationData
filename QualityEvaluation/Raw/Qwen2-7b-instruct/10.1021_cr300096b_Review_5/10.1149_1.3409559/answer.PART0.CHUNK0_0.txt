[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."
[2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The strong surface segregation tendency towards platinum (Pt) in ternary alloys leads to the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen (O) and hydroxyl (OH) species, enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, the Pt-skin surfaces of these alloys demonstrate improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms. The enhanced catalytic activity and stability are attributed to the unique surface configurations and interactions under specific thermodynamic and reaction conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件对二元催化剂的稳定性和表面聚集体配置有显著影响，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。在三元合金中，Pt的强烈表面聚集体倾向导致其表面形成一层Pt单层。这导致氧(O)和羟基(OH)物种的结合强度相对较弱，从而增强ORR的活性。此外，这些合金的Pt表皮表面显示出对Pt原子溶解的增强电化学稳定性。增强的催化活性和稳定性归因于在特定热力学和反应条件下独特的表面配置和相互作用。
