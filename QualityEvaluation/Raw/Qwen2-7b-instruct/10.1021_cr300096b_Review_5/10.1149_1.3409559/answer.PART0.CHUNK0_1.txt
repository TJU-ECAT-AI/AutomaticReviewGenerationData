[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."
[2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."
[3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In these systems, the strong surface segregation tendency towards platinum leads to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on the surfaces of ternary alloys. This ML results in relatively weaker binding strengths of oxygen and hydroxyl groups, which suggests an enhancement in the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Additionally, the Pt-skin surfaces demonstrate improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These factors collectively contribute to the superior catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloys in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对二元催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置产生了显著影响。在这些系统中，强表面分离倾向导致三元合金表面形成一层铂单层（ML）。这种ML导致氧和羟基团的结合强度相对较弱，这表明ORR的活性得到了增强与相应的双金属合金表面相比。此外，铂表层显示出对铂原子从合金表面溶解的电化学稳定性提高。这些因素共同决定了铂基合金在各种应用中的优异催化性能和表现。
