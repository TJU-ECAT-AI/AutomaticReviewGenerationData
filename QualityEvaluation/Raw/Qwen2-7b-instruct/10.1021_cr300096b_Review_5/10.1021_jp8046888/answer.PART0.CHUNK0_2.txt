[1] "The surface adsorption properties can be considerably modified by introducing the 3d metals."
[2] "Remarkably, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys."
[3] "The discrepancy suggests that the adsorption strength is heavily determined by the nature of the surface atom species."
[4] "Therefore, the strength of surface adsorption has the order of Pt skin < Pt(111) < Pt3M."
[5] "Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases."
[6] "Furthermore, we note that the d-band properties of the surface Pt atoms differ only slightly between the segregated and nonsegregated alloys."
[7] "It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces."
[8] "Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by modifying their electronic and geometric properties. This leads to altered adsorption strengths, where the strength is determined by the nature of the surface atom species. The adsorption strength has an order of Pt skin < Pt(111) < Pt3M, with Pt3Fe(111) being the most favorable for oxygen adsorption on the nonsegregated surface and Pt3Ni(111) on the Pt-segregated surface. The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces is enhanced compared to those in pure Pt surfaces, both in clean surfaces and under adsorbed oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过修改它们的电子和几何属性，影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置。这导致吸附力的变化，吸附力由表面原子物种的性质决定。吸附力的顺序为Pt皮肤 < Pt(111) < Pt3M，其中Pt3Fe(111)在非分离表面上最有利于氧吸附，而Pt3Ni(111)在Pt分离表面上。与纯Pt表面相比，在Pt皮肤表面上的Pt原子的稳定性增强，并且在清洁表面和吸附氧的情况下都是如此。增强的稳定性程度遵循研究合金中三种合金的氧吸附强度的相反顺序，表明3d亚层原子的保护作用，这些原子通过其与Pt表面层的强烈结合来确定。
