<p>It has been reported that Pt3M (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloys possess close-packed fcc structures, (1, 36, 37) in which the Pt atoms occupy the face-centered positions and the M atoms are located at the corners of the unit cell.</p>
<p>A 2 × 2 (111) unit cell was employed for all the slab models. Each cell consists of a five-layer slab and six equivalent layers of vacuum. In the super cell, each slab layer contains three Pt atoms and one M atom.</p>
<p>The d-band centers were evaluated from the site-projected electronic density of states using a much bigger k-point mesh (15 × 15 × 1).</p>
<p>Our calculations show that the interlayer distance of the top two layers varies little in the process of oxygen adsorption and the length of Pt/MO can be used to measure the binding strength in most cases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we note that the d-band properties of the surface Pt atoms differ only slightly between the segregated and nonsegregated alloys.</p>
<p>It is found that the stability of Pt atoms of Pt-skin surfaces of the three alloys in this study is enhanced with respect to those in pure Pt surfaces. Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.</p>

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by modifying their electronic and geometric properties. These changes lead to altered binding strengths and different catalytic properties. For instance, the presence of 3d metals in the alloys enhances the binding strength of oxygen on the nonsegregated surface compared to pure Pt(111) due to their high affinity towards oxygen. However, on the Pt-segregated surfaces, the presence of 3d metals weakens the oxygen adsorption due to surface strain and the electronic effect. The stability of Pt atoms on Pt-skin surfaces is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in clean surfaces and under oxygen adsorption, with the degree of enhancement following the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys. This protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer, contributes to the stability of the catalysts.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过修改它们的电子和几何特性，影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。这些变化导致了吸附力的不同和不同的催化性质。例如，在非分离表面上，合金中的3d金属增强了氧与Pt的结合强度，因为它们对氧有很高的亲和力。然而，在Pt分离表面上，由于表面应力和电子效应，3d金属削弱了氧吸附。Pt皮肤表面的Pt原子的稳定性增强，与纯Pt表面相比，无论是清洁表面还是在氧吸附下，这种增强的程度遵循所研究合金中氧吸附强度的相反顺序。这种由强烈结合到Pt表面层的3d亚表面原子决定的保护作用，促进了催化剂的稳定性。
