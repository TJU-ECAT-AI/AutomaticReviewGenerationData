1. The surface adsorption properties of Pt-segregated and nonsegregated Pt3M(111) surfaces are influenced by the electronic structure and surface geometry, with the electronic structure being the primary factor. The 3d metals in the alloys modify these properties, leading to differences in the binding strength of oxygen.

2. The stability of Pt-skin surfaces of the studied alloys is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in the absence and presence of oxygen adsorption. The degree of enhancement follows the reverse order of the oxygen adsorption strengths, highlighting the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms.

3. The d-band properties of surface Pt atoms in segregated and nonsegregated alloys differ minimally, indicating that the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is not significantly altered by surface segregation.

4. The binding strength of oxygen is measured by the interlayer distance and the length of Pt/MO bonds, with slight variations during oxygen adsorption.

5. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is observed under both clean and oxygen-adsorbed conditions, with the enhancement degree correlating inversely with the oxygen adsorption strength.

6. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms in segregated and nonsegregated alloys is similar, suggesting that the changes in adsorption properties are mainly due to the involvement of the 3d metals on the surface or subsurface.

7. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is comparable to the non-adsorption cases, indicating the protective effect of the 3d subsurface atoms against dissolution.

1. Pt3M合金表面吸附性质受到电子结构和表面几何形状的影响，电子结构是主要因素。合金中的3d金属修改了这些属性，导致氧气结合强度的不同。

2. 研究合金的Pt皮肤表面稳定性相对于纯Pt表面增强，无论是否存在氧吸附。增强的程度与氧吸附强度呈相反顺序，强调了3d亚表面原子对保护作用的角色。

3. 分散和非分散合金中表面Pt原子的d带性质差异较小，表明表面分散对表面Pt原子的电子结构影响不大。

4. 氧吸附期间，通过上两层间的距离和Pt/MO键长测量氧气的结合强度，这些变化很小。

5. Pt皮肤表面在干净和氧吸附条件下均表现出稳定性增强，增强程度与氧吸附强度成反比，表明3d亚表面原子对防止溶解的保护效果。

6. 分散和非分散合金中表面Pt原子的电子结构相似，说明表面吸附性质的变化主要是由于表面或亚表面的3d金属的参与。
