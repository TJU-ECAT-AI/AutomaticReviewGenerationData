[1] "Adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt-segregated and nonsegregated surfaces of Pt3M(111) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) has been systematically investigated using periodic density functional theory calculations."
[2] "Remarkably, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys."
[3] "In addition to reactivity, we analyze electrochemical stability of the studied alloys in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, evaluating the electrode potential shift with respect to that found in pure Pt surfaces, which is related to the chemical potential change of surface Pt atoms upon metal dissolution."
[4] "Our calculations show that the magnitude of surface adsorption energies is determined by both the surface geometry and the electronic structure."
[5] "Remarkably, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys."
[6] "We find that the Pt atoms bonding directly to O are more difficult to lose, owing to the strong interactions between Pt and O."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors impact the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt surfaces can modify the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst, affecting its reactivity and stability. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys enhances the adsorption strength of oxygen, leading to stronger interactions between Pt and O atoms. This, in turn, can increase the stability of the Pt atoms against dissolution, making the catalyst more durable. The surface segregation of Pt atoms modifies the surface structure, which can further influence the adsorption properties and stability of the catalyst. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is crucial in determining the adsorption energies, which are influenced by both the surface geometry and the electronic properties of the 3d metals. The stability enhancement of Pt atoms in the presence of adsorbed oxygen indicates the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, which are determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.
