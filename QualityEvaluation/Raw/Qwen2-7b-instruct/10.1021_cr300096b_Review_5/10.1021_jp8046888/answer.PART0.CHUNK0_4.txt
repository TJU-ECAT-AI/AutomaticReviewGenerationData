[2] "Surface adsorption properties can be considerably modified by introducing the 3d metals."
[3] "Remarkably, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms only differs very slightly for the segregated and nonsegregated alloys."
[4] "In addition to reactivity, we analyze electrochemical stability of the studied alloys in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, evaluating the electrode potential shift with respect to that found in pure Pt surfaces, which is related to the chemical potential change of surface Pt atoms upon metal dissolution."
[5] "The adsorption strength is therefore mainly determined by 3d metals in the alloys: On the nonsegregated surfaces the 3d metal atoms are directly involved into O adsorption and thus enhance the adsorption strength, whereas on the Pt-segregated surfaces they weaken the O adsorption owing to the surface strain and the electronic effect."
[6] "Such stability enhancement is observed both in clean surfaces and under 0.25 ML of adsorbed atomic oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the three studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer."

How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences lead to notable modifications in the electronic and geometric properties, affecting the binding strength of adsorbates. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt system notably modifies these properties. For instance, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms changes minimally between segregated and non-segregated alloys, yet the adsorption strength is determined by the presence of these 3d metals. Specifically, on non-segregated surfaces, the direct involvement of 3d metals enhances the adsorption strength, whereas on segregated surfaces, the surface strain and electronic effect weaken the adsorption. This dynamic relationship between the adsorption properties and the electronic structure of the 3d metals in the alloys directly impacts the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.

The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces of Pt-3d alloys is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces. This enhanced stability is observed both in clean surfaces and under the presence of adsorbed oxygen, with the degree of enhancement following the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys. This indicates the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, which bind strongly to the Pt surface layer, thereby contributing to the improved catalytic performance of these materials.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面异构化以及结构配置产生了显著影响，并且这些影响对于这些材料在各种应用中的催化特性和性能具有重要含义。这些因素导致了电子和几何性质的明显变化，从而影响吸附剂的结合强度。引入3d金属到Pt系统中会显著改变这些性质。例如，在非异构化的表面上，表面Pt原子的电子结构变化很小，但吸附强度则由这些3d金属的存在所决定。具体来说，在非异构化的表面上，直接参与吸附的3d金属增强了吸附强度，而在异构化的表面上，表面应力和电子效应削弱了吸附作用。这种3d金属在合金中电子结构与吸附性质之间的动态关系直接影响了这些材料的催化特性和性能。

在Pt-3d合金的Pt皮肤表面中，Pt原子的稳定性比纯Pt表面有所增强。这种增强的稳定性在清洁表面和存在吸附氧的情况下都能观察到，而增强的程度遵循研究合金中氧吸附强度相反的顺序。这表明3d亚层原子的保护作用，它们强烈地与Pt表面层结合，从而提高了这些材料的催化性能。
