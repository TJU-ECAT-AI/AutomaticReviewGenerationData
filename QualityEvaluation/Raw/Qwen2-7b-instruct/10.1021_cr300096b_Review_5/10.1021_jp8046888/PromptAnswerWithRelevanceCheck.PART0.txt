Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions can significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors impact the catalytic properties and performance in various applications. The adsorption of atomic oxygen on Pt surfaces can modify the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst, affecting its reactivity and stability. The presence of 3d metals in the alloys enhances the adsorption strength of oxygen, leading to stronger interactions between Pt and O atoms. This, in turn, can increase the stability of the Pt atoms against dissolution, making the catalyst more durable. The surface segregation of Pt atoms modifies the surface structure, which can further influence the adsorption properties and stability of the catalyst. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is crucial in determining the adsorption energies, which are influenced by both the surface geometry and the electronic properties of the 3d metals. The stability enhancement of Pt atoms in the presence of adsorbed oxygen indicates the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, which are determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer.

1. The surface adsorption properties of Pt-segregated and nonsegregated Pt3M(111) surfaces are influenced by the electronic structure and surface geometry, with the electronic structure being the primary factor. The 3d metals in the alloys modify these properties, leading to differences in the binding strength of oxygen.

2. The stability of Pt-skin surfaces of the studied alloys is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in the absence and presence of oxygen adsorption. The degree of enhancement follows the reverse order of the oxygen adsorption strengths, highlighting the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms.

3. The d-band properties of surface Pt atoms in segregated and nonsegregated alloys differ minimally, indicating that the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms is not significantly altered by surface segregation.

4. The binding strength of oxygen is measured by the interlayer distance and the length of Pt/MO bonds, with slight variations during oxygen adsorption.

5. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is observed under both clean and oxygen-adsorbed conditions, with the enhancement degree correlating inversely with the oxygen adsorption strength.

6. The electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms in segregated and nonsegregated alloys is similar, suggesting that the changes in adsorption properties are mainly due to the involvement of the 3d metals on the surface or subsurface.

7. The stability enhancement of Pt-skin surfaces is comparable to the non-adsorption cases, indicating the protective effect of the 3d subsurface atoms against dissolution.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by modifying their electronic and geometric properties. This leads to altered adsorption strengths, where the strength is determined by the nature of the surface atom species. The adsorption strength has an order of Pt skin < Pt(111) < Pt3M, with Pt3Fe(111) being the most favorable for oxygen adsorption on the nonsegregated surface and Pt3Ni(111) on the Pt-segregated surface. The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces is enhanced compared to those in pure Pt surfaces, both in clean surfaces and under adsorbed oxygen, and the degree of stability enhancement follows the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys, indicating the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by modifying their electronic and geometric properties. These changes lead to altered binding strengths and different catalytic properties. For instance, the presence of 3d metals in the alloys enhances the binding strength of oxygen on the nonsegregated surface compared to pure Pt(111) due to their high affinity towards oxygen. However, on the Pt-segregated surfaces, the presence of 3d metals weakens the oxygen adsorption due to surface strain and the electronic effect. The stability of Pt atoms on Pt-skin surfaces is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces, both in clean surfaces and under oxygen adsorption, with the degree of enhancement following the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys. This protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, determined by their strong binding to the Pt surface layer, contributes to the stability of the catalysts.

How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. These influences lead to notable modifications in the electronic and geometric properties, affecting the binding strength of adsorbates. The introduction of 3d metals into the Pt system notably modifies these properties. For instance, the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms changes minimally between segregated and non-segregated alloys, yet the adsorption strength is determined by the presence of these 3d metals. Specifically, on non-segregated surfaces, the direct involvement of 3d metals enhances the adsorption strength, whereas on segregated surfaces, the surface strain and electronic effect weaken the adsorption. This dynamic relationship between the adsorption properties and the electronic structure of the 3d metals in the alloys directly impacts the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.

The stability of Pt atoms in Pt-skin surfaces of Pt-3d alloys is enhanced compared to pure Pt surfaces. This enhanced stability is observed both in clean surfaces and under the presence of adsorbed oxygen, with the degree of enhancement following the opposite order of the oxygen adsorption strengths in the studied alloys. This indicates the protective role of the 3d subsurface atoms, which bind strongly to the Pt surface layer, thereby contributing to the improved catalytic performance of these materials.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面异构化以及结构配置产生了显著影响，并且这些影响对于这些材料在各种应用中的催化特性和性能具有重要含义。这些因素导致了电子和几何性质的明显变化，从而影响吸附剂的结合强度。引入3d金属到Pt系统中会显著改变这些性质。例如，在非异构化的表面上，表面Pt原子的电子结构变化很小，但吸附强度则由这些3d金属的存在所决定。具体来说，在非异构化的表面上，直接参与吸附的3d金属增强了吸附强度，而在异构化的表面上，表面应力和电子效应削弱了吸附作用。这种3d金属在合金中电子结构与吸附性质之间的动态关系直接影响了这些材料的催化特性和性能。

在Pt-3d合金的Pt皮肤表面中，Pt原子的稳定性比纯Pt表面有所增强。这种增强的稳定性在清洁表面和存在吸附氧的情况下都能观察到，而增强的程度遵循研究合金中氧吸附强度相反的顺序。这表明3d亚层原子的保护作用，它们强烈地与Pt表面层结合，从而提高了这些材料的催化性能。
