How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences dictate that under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with a larger atomic radius is preferred to relieve strain at the bimetallic surface. This process leads to the surface segregation of Pt in Pt-based bimetallic systems. The presence of hydrogen bonds does not alter the thermodynamic driving force for this surface segregation process. 

When exposed to oxygen in an oxidative environment, the 3d transition metals, such as Ni, become oxidized, leading to the formation of oxides like NiO. These oxides tend to encapsulate the Pt surfaces due to their lower surface energy and strong interaction with Pt. This encapsulation process influences the surface structure and composition of the bimetallic nanoparticles.

On the other hand, under hydrogen-reducing conditions, Pt tends to segregate to the outer surfaces of the nanoparticles, forming a Pt-skin structure. This segregation process is driven by the minimization of strain energy. The structural configuration of the bimetallic nanoparticles changes in response to the alternating redox conditions, affecting their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

These reversible mass transport processes in bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi, PtCu, and PtCo, have significant implications for their catalytic activities. The dynamic behavior of these catalysts allows for tunable surface structures and compositions, which can enhance their catalytic efficiency and stability under different reaction conditions.

The observed reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems are crucial for understanding and optimizing their catalytic properties in real-world applications. The findings suggest that the principal processes governing surface structural changes in bimetallic model catalyst systems are indeed active in the bimetallic nanoparticle systems under real reaction conditions.

热力学偏好决定了，在真空条件下，原子半径较大的金属在双金属表面的表面分离是优先的，以缓解双金属表面的应力。这一过程导致了Pt基双金属系统中Pt的表面分离。氢键的存在不会改变这一表面分离过程的热力学驱动力。

当暴露于氧氧化环境时，3d过渡金属，如Ni，会被氧化，形成如NiO之类的氧化物。这些氧化物倾向于包覆Pt表面，因为它们的表面能量较低，并且与Pt有强烈的相互作用。这种包覆过程影响了双金属纳米颗粒的表面结构和组成。

另一方面，在氢还原条件下，Pt倾向于向纳米颗粒的外表面分离，形成一层Pt皮肤结构。这一分离过程是由降低应变能驱动的。在交替的氧化还原条件下，双金属催化剂的结构配置会发生变化，从而影响它们在各种应用中的催化性能。

这些可逆的质量传输过程在Pt基双金属催化剂中（如PtNi、PtCu和PtCo）具有重要意义。这些动态行为允许调整表面结构和组成，从而提高其催化效率和稳定性。

观察到的Pt基双金属催化剂的可逆结构变化对于理解并优化其催化性质至关重要。研究结果表明，控制表面结构变化的主要过程在真实反应条件下的双金属纳米颗粒系统中确实存在。

这些发现对理解和优化双金属催化剂在实际应用中的催化性质具有重要意义。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in the surface states of these catalysts in response to alternating oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. Specifically, the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to other metals facilitates its surface segregation, enhancing its reactivity. The encapsulation of Pt by metal oxides upon oxidation and the diffusion of other metals to the particle surfaces upon reduction create Pt-skin structures, altering the catalytic properties of these systems. These reversible changes are crucial for optimizing the performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, as they allow for tuning the surface structure and composition in accordance with the redox potential of the reaction gases.

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. These conditions affect whether metals segregate to the surface or remain dispersed within the particle, leading to different catalytic properties. For instance, the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to other 3d metals promotes surface segregation of Pt in Pt-based bimetallic systems. Reaction environments also dictate whether metals are oxidized or reduced, impacting the overall structure and function of the catalyst.

2. In Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtNi nanoparticles, reversible structural changes are observed when subjected to alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Oxidation leads to the encapsulation of particles by formed oxides, while reduction allows both Pt and Ni to maintain their metallic state. These changes are attributed to the dynamic mass transport processes that occur in response to the redox potential of the reaction gases.

3. In PtNi nanoparticles, upon oxidation at 300 8C in O2 (0.1 MPa), Ni is oxidized and encapsulated by the formed NiO. Meanwhile, both Pt and Ni remain metallic under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance, 300 8C). This segregation and diffusion process results in the formation of Pt-skin structures, indicating that the reversible mass transport processes are actively influencing the surface structure and composition.

4. The reversible mass transport processes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems are crucial for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. These processes are driven by the changing redox potential of the reaction gases, leading to oscillations in the surface structure and composition of the catalysts. The ability of these catalysts to dynamically adjust their surface state enables them to effectively participate in a wide range of industrial reactions.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对二元催化剂，尤其是铂基系统（如铂-3d合金）的稳定性、表面聚集和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件决定了金属是否会在表面聚集或分散在颗粒内部，从而影响催化剂的催化特性。例如，铂较大的原子半径促进了铂基二元合金系统的表面聚集。反应环境也决定了金属是氧化还是还原，这直接影响催化剂的整体结构和功能。

2. 在铂基二元系统中，如铂镍纳米粒子，当在交替的氢气和氧气气氛下进行热处理时，观察到了可逆的结构变化。氧化导致形成的氧化物封装了粒子，而还原条件允许铂和镍保持其金属状态。这些变化归因于响应反应气体氧化还原电位的动态质量传输过程。

3. 在铂镍纳米粒子中，当在氧气（0.1 MPa）下300 8C进行氧化处理时，镍被氧化并由形成的氧化物封装。同时，在20%氢气与氩平衡条件下300 8C的还原条件下，铂和镍都保持为金属状态。这种聚集和扩散过程导致形成铂皮结构，表明可逆的质量传输过程正在影响催化剂的表面结构和组成。

4. 铂基二元催化剂系统的可逆质量传输过程对于理解它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能至关重要。这些过程由反应气体的氧化还原电位变化驱动，导致催化剂表面状态的振荡。这些催化剂能够动态调整其表面状态的能力使它们能够有效参与广泛的工业反应。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. When exposed to oxidizing atmospheres, such as oxygen, Ni in these catalysts tends to become oxidized, forming NiO. This NiO then encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Conversely, under reducing atmospheres, such as hydrogen, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface regions, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes are triggered by the changes between oxidizing and reducing conditions and contribute to the oscillations in the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors are observed in other Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems, including those with Cu and Co components.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions play a crucial role in influencing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the dynamic behaviors of catalysts when they are subjected to cycling between oxidizing and reducing gases. The reversibility of these changes is essential for maintaining the performance of catalysts in various applications.

In Pt-based bimetallic systems, the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to other elements leads to surface segregation, where Pt tends to segregate to the outer surfaces of nanoparticles. This process minimizes strain energy at the bimetallic surface. When exposed to oxidizing atmospheres, such as oxygen, the segregation of 3d transition metals like Ni or Cu onto the top surface occurs due to strong bonding between oxygen and these metals. This leads to the oxidation of these metals into their oxide forms. The lower surface energy of the formed metal oxides, along with their strong interaction with the base metal, causes encapsulation of the Pt surfaces.

In reducing atmospheres, such as hydrogen, the encapsulated Pt surfaces are exposed, leading to the diffusion of the encapsulated metals back to the particle surfaces. This results in the formation of Pt-skin structures, where the outer layer is rich in Pt, while the core contains the other metal(s).

These reversible mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The oscillations in surface structure and composition observed in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts contribute to their dynamic behavior under changing reaction conditions. The reversibility of these changes is of great significance in maintaining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in real-world applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件在影响双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚集状态方面起着关键作用。这些因素影响催化剂在氧化气体和还原气体循环作用下的动态行为。这些变化的可逆性对于维持各种应用中的催化剂性能至关重要。

在Pt基双金属系统中，Pt与其它元素相比较大的原子半径导致表面聚集，使得Pt倾向于聚集到纳米颗粒的外表面。这一过程可以最小化双金属表面的应力能。当暴露于氧化气氛（如氧气）中时，3d过渡金属如Ni或Cu会在表面聚集，由于氧与这些金属之间强烈的结合力。这导致这些金属被氧化为它们的氧化物形式。形成的金属氧化物的较低表面能量，以及它们与基体金属之间的强烈相互作用，导致包裹Pt表面。

在还原气氛（如氢气）中，包裹的Pt表面暴露出来，导致被包裹的金属向颗粒表面扩散。这形成了Pt皮肤结构，其中外层富含Pt，而核心包含其他金属（s）。

在氧化或还原反应中活动的这些可逆质量传输过程完全取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。观察到的表面结构和组成振荡对Pt基双金属催化剂具有重要意义。这些变化的可逆性对于维持这些材料在实际应用中的催化性质和性能至关重要。
