<p>The dynamic behaviors in heterogeneous catalyst systems are closely correlated with reaction gas composition. Oxidizing and reducing atmospheres are the most frequently encountered reaction environments in many industrial reaction processes, such as partial oxidation reactions and hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures.</p>
<p>The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems. The similar reversible dynamic behaviors have been found in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts supported HOPG.</p>

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. When exposed to oxidizing atmospheres, such as oxygen, Ni in these catalysts tends to become oxidized, forming NiO. This NiO then encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Conversely, under reducing atmospheres, such as hydrogen, both Pt and Ni remain in their metallic states. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces, while Ni diffuses to the subsurface regions, leading to the formation of Pt-skin structures. These reversible mass transport processes are triggered by the changes between oxidizing and reducing conditions and contribute to the oscillations in the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors are observed in other Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems, including those with Cu and Co components.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置，尤其是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。当暴露在氧化气氛下，如氧气，Ni在这种催化剂中倾向于氧化形成NiO。这种NiO然后包裹了双金属颗粒。相反，在还原气氛下，如氢气，Pt和Ni都保持在金属状态。Pt向颗粒表面分层，而Ni则扩散到次表面区域，导致形成Pt皮层结构。这些可逆的质量传输过程由氧化和还原条件的变化触发，并对Pt基双金属催化剂的表面结构和组成振荡产生贡献。在包括Cu和Co成分在内的其他Pt基双金属催化剂系统中也观察到了类似的可逆动态行为。
