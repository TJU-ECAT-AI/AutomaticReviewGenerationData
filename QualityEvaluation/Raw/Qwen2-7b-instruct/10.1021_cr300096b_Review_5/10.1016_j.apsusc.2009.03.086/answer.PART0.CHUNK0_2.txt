[1] "The dynamic behaviors in heterogeneous catalyst systems are closely correlated with reaction gas composition. Oxidizing and reducing atmospheres are the most frequently encountered reaction environments in many industrial reaction processes, such as partial oxidation reactions and hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres."
[3] "Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles. Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance, 300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic."
[4] "The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. These conditions affect whether metals segregate to the surface or remain dispersed within the particle, leading to different catalytic properties. For instance, the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to other 3d metals promotes surface segregation of Pt in Pt-based bimetallic systems. Reaction environments also dictate whether metals are oxidized or reduced, impacting the overall structure and function of the catalyst.

2. In Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtNi nanoparticles, reversible structural changes are observed when subjected to alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres. Oxidation leads to the encapsulation of particles by formed oxides, while reduction allows both Pt and Ni to maintain their metallic state. These changes are attributed to the dynamic mass transport processes that occur in response to the redox potential of the reaction gases.

3. In PtNi nanoparticles, upon oxidation at 300 8C in O2 (0.1 MPa), Ni is oxidized and encapsulated by the formed NiO. Meanwhile, both Pt and Ni remain metallic under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance, 300 8C). This segregation and diffusion process results in the formation of Pt-skin structures, indicating that the reversible mass transport processes are actively influencing the surface structure and composition.

4. The reversible mass transport processes in Pt-based bimetallic catalyst systems are crucial for understanding their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. These processes are driven by the changing redox potential of the reaction gases, leading to oscillations in the surface structure and composition of the catalysts. The ability of these catalysts to dynamically adjust their surface state enables them to effectively participate in a wide range of industrial reactions.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对二元催化剂，尤其是铂基系统（如铂-3d合金）的稳定性、表面聚集和结构配置有显著影响。这些条件决定了金属是否会在表面聚集或分散在颗粒内部，从而影响催化剂的催化特性。例如，铂较大的原子半径促进了铂基二元合金系统的表面聚集。反应环境也决定了金属是氧化还是还原，这直接影响催化剂的整体结构和功能。

2. 在铂基二元系统中，如铂镍纳米粒子，当在交替的氢气和氧气气氛下进行热处理时，观察到了可逆的结构变化。氧化导致形成的氧化物封装了粒子，而还原条件允许铂和镍保持其金属状态。这些变化归因于响应反应气体氧化还原电位的动态质量传输过程。

3. 在铂镍纳米粒子中，当在氧气（0.1 MPa）下300 8C进行氧化处理时，镍被氧化并由形成的氧化物封装。同时，在20%氢气与氩平衡条件下300 8C的还原条件下，铂和镍都保持为金属状态。这种聚集和扩散过程导致形成铂皮结构，表明可逆的质量传输过程正在影响催化剂的表面结构和组成。

4. 铂基二元催化剂系统的可逆质量传输过程对于理解它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能至关重要。这些过程由反应气体的氧化还原电位变化驱动，导致催化剂表面状态的振荡。这些催化剂能够动态调整其表面状态的能力使它们能够有效参与广泛的工业反应。
