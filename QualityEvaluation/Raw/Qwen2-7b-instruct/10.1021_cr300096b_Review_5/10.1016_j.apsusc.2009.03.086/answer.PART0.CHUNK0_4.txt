Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions play a crucial role in influencing the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors affect the dynamic behaviors of catalysts when they are subjected to cycling between oxidizing and reducing gases. The reversibility of these changes is essential for maintaining the performance of catalysts in various applications.

In Pt-based bimetallic systems, the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to other elements leads to surface segregation, where Pt tends to segregate to the outer surfaces of nanoparticles. This process minimizes strain energy at the bimetallic surface. When exposed to oxidizing atmospheres, such as oxygen, the segregation of 3d transition metals like Ni or Cu onto the top surface occurs due to strong bonding between oxygen and these metals. This leads to the oxidation of these metals into their oxide forms. The lower surface energy of the formed metal oxides, along with their strong interaction with the base metal, causes encapsulation of the Pt surfaces.

In reducing atmospheres, such as hydrogen, the encapsulated Pt surfaces are exposed, leading to the diffusion of the encapsulated metals back to the particle surfaces. This results in the formation of Pt-skin structures, where the outer layer is rich in Pt, while the core contains the other metal(s).

These reversible mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases. The oscillations in surface structure and composition observed in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts contribute to their dynamic behavior under changing reaction conditions. The reversibility of these changes is of great significance in maintaining the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in real-world applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件在影响双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚集状态方面起着关键作用。这些因素影响催化剂在氧化气体和还原气体循环作用下的动态行为。这些变化的可逆性对于维持各种应用中的催化剂性能至关重要。

在Pt基双金属系统中，Pt与其它元素相比较大的原子半径导致表面聚集，使得Pt倾向于聚集到纳米颗粒的外表面。这一过程可以最小化双金属表面的应力能。当暴露于氧化气氛（如氧气）中时，3d过渡金属如Ni或Cu会在表面聚集，由于氧与这些金属之间强烈的结合力。这导致这些金属被氧化为它们的氧化物形式。形成的金属氧化物的较低表面能量，以及它们与基体金属之间的强烈相互作用，导致包裹Pt表面。

在还原气氛（如氢气）中，包裹的Pt表面暴露出来，导致被包裹的金属向颗粒表面扩散。这形成了Pt皮肤结构，其中外层富含Pt，而核心包含其他金属（s）。

在氧化或还原反应中活动的这些可逆质量传输过程完全取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。观察到的表面结构和组成振荡对Pt基双金属催化剂具有重要意义。这些变化的可逆性对于维持这些材料在实际应用中的催化性质和性能至关重要。
