The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in the surface states of these catalysts in response to alternating oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. Specifically, the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to other metals facilitates its surface segregation, enhancing its reactivity. The encapsulation of Pt by metal oxides upon oxidation and the diffusion of other metals to the particle surfaces upon reduction create Pt-skin structures, altering the catalytic properties of these systems. These reversible changes are crucial for optimizing the performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications, as they allow for tuning the surface structure and composition in accordance with the redox potential of the reaction gases.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统（如Pt-3d合金）的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置产生了显著影响。这些因素导致催化剂表面状态在交替氧化和还原气氛下产生动态变化。具体而言，Pt较大的原子半径使其更容易在其表面上分层，从而增强其活性。氧化时Pt被金属氧化物封装，而还原条件下其他金属扩散到粒子内部区域形成Pt外壳结构，改变这些系统的催化特性。这些可逆变化对于优化各种应用中的双金属催化剂性能至关重要，因为它们允许根据反应气体的氧化还原电位调整表面结构和组成。
