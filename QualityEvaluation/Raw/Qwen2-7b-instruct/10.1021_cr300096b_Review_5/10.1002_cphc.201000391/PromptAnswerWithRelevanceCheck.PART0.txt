[1] "We start with a TPD spectrum for CO desorption from the unmodified Ru(0001) surface, which is included in Figure 3a for comparison (thin line)."
[2] "The onset of local surface alloy formation after heating of the bimetallic sample to 850 K does not induce any major changes in the shape or temperature range of the CO TPD spectrum (Figure 3b) compared to that obtained after annealing to 700 K."
[3] "For deuterium adsorption, the formation of mixed ensembles upon surface alloy formation has to be considered in addition to strain and lateral ligand effects,7,17 if similar to findings for the non-modified constituents of the bimetallic surface [Ru(0001)23,24,50 and Pt(111)25,26], threefold hollow sites are the preferred adsorption site for D binding on the bimetallic surface."

[1] "The correlation between structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and by the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules."
[2] "The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer was revealed by STM. Looking at the atomic-scale structural development of Pt islands and step decorations upon annealing to increasing temperatures, we expand our previous findings about the onset of surface alloy formation near vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films."
[3] "The distribution of the foreign atoms is clearly inhomogeneous. There is a pronounced enrichment of Ru atoms in the outer regions of the Pt islands and in the step decorations, while in the inner parts of the Pt islands the density of Ru atoms is very low."
[4] "For CO desorption, this process results in a successive decrease of the signal intensity at 410 K, after each annealing step up to 700 K."
[5] "While the latter can, at least qualitatively, be explained by a stabilization of adsorption on the Pt island edges sites (and/or destabilization of the Ru sites along the edge), the physical origin of the down-shift of the high-temperature peak and its trailing edge compared to desorption from Ru(0001) cannot be rationalized in a local adsorption picture and is not clear yet."
[6] "Deuterium adsorption is more strongly affected by surface alloy formation, which is attributed to the presence of mixed Pt5xRux/Ru(0001) adsorption ensembles (pentamers), with D binding strength in between those of pure Ru5/Ru(0001) and Pt5/Ru(0001) ensembles."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by altering the distribution of components in the topmost layer. This leads to changes in chemical properties, catalytic activities, and performance. Specifically, annealing can cause the formation of surface alloys, which affects adsorption behaviors of probe molecules like CO and D2. The inhomogeneous distribution of Ru atoms in Pt islands and step decorations indicates the onset of surface alloy formation. The stabilization of adsorption on Pt island edges suggests a kinetic stabilization of CO adsorption, possibly due to the higher adsorption energy at these sites. The physical origin of the down-shift in desorption peaks compared to desorption from non-modified surfaces is not fully understood. Deuterium adsorption is more sensitive to surface alloy formation due to the presence of mixed ensembles, indicating a dependency of its binding strength on the composition of the adsorption ensemble. Complete intermixing of the surface alloy layer at higher temperatures leads to pronounced changes in the adsorption properties of both CO and deuterium, demonstrating the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of the bimetallic surface.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过改变层顶部分布，进而影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面偏聚状态，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。这导致化学性质、催化活性和性能的变化。具体来说，退火可以导致表面合金的形成，从而影响探针分子如CO和D2的吸附行为。Ru原子在Pt岛和台阶装饰中的不均匀分布表明表面合金形成的开始。Pt岛边缘上吸附的稳定性可能是因为这些位置的吸附能更高，暗示了CO吸附的动能稳定化。高温度峰和其尾端向下偏移的物理起源尚未完全理解。由于混合簇的存在，脱氘吸附对表面合金的形成更为敏感，这表明其结合强度依赖于吸附簇的组成。在较高温度下完全互混的表面合金层导致CO和D2吸附性质发生显著变化，清楚地证明了探针分子吸附对双金属表面局部结构和组成的敏感性。

[3] "Considering that there is no loss of Pt surface atoms into deeper layers even after annealing to 1300 K,16 the transfer of desorption intensity from the low-temperature range to the high-temperature range means that the effects on Pt and Ru surface atoms are asymmetric, with significant stabilization when changing from adsorption on a fully Pt-surrounded Pt surface atom [Pt(Pt6)/Ru(0001)] to a partly Pt-surrounded Pt surface atom [e.g. Pt(Pt3Ru3)/Ru(0001)], but little destabilization when going from a fully Ru-surrounded Ru surface atom [Ru(Ru6)/Ru(0001)] to a partly Ru-surrounded Ru surface atom [e.g. Ru(Pt3Ru3)/Ru(0001)]."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This impacts their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. During the annealing process, the enrichment of Ru atoms in the outer regions of the Pt islands and in the step decorations, while the density of Ru atoms is lower in the inner parts of the Pt islands, highlights the inhomogeneity in the distribution of the two metals. The modification of the chemical properties of the bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surface is asymmetric when considering the effects on Pt and Ru surface atoms. Specifically, there is significant stabilization when transitioning from adsorption on a fully Pt-surrounded Pt surface atom to a partly Pt-surrounded one, whereas the destabilization is minimal when moving from a fully Ru-surrounded Ru surface atom to a partly Ru-surrounded one.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置产生了显著影响，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。这直接影响了它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能。在退火过程中，Ru原子在Pt岛屿的外缘和台阶装饰中的富集，而在Pt岛屿内部部分的密度较低，表明两种金属分布的不均匀性。在考虑Pt和Ru表面原子的影响时，化学性质的变化是不对称的。具体来说，在从完全被Pt包围的Pt表面原子过渡到部分被Pt包围的原子时，存在显著的稳定化；而从完全被Ru包围的Ru表面原子过渡到部分被Ru包围的原子时，去稳定化程度则较小。

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This is evidenced by the study of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts through scanning tunneling microscopy and the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules. Upon stepwise annealing, the surface structure undergoes modification, leading to changes in chemical properties. These changes are more pronounced during the surface alloy formation, which occurs at temperatures above 750 K, for instance, at 850 K. The results highlight the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of bimetallic surfaces, even when dealing with chemically active metals like Ru and Pt. This sensitivity indicates the critical role of structural and compositional variations in determining the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚集状态以及结构配置。通过扫描隧道显微镜和吸附CO和D2探针分子对双金属PtRu/Ru(0001)模型催化剂的研究，证明了这些影响。在逐步退火过程中，表面结构会发生修改，进而导致化学性质的变化。这些变化在表面合金形成阶段更为明显，这通常发生在高于750K的温度下，例如在850K时。结果表明，探针分子吸附对双金属表面的局部结构和组成非常敏感，即使涉及到化学活性金属如Ru和Pt也是如此。这种敏感性表明，在不同应用中，结构和组分变化对于确定双金属催化剂的催化特性和性能至关重要。

Looking at the atomic-scale structural development of Pt islands and step decorations upon annealing to increasing temperatures, we expand our previous findings about the onset of surface alloy formation near vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films."
[3] "Dendritic Pt monolayer islands (diameter 36 nm) are formed after Pt deposition at room temperature, which grow in size and assume a relaxed hexagonal shape after annealing to higher temperature (750 K)."
[4] "For both adsorbates, desorption from the Pt-covered areas results in a desorption peak at distinctly lower temperatures compared to desorption from Ru(0001) or Pt(111), reflecting a pronounced destabilization, which is due to a combination of strain effects and vertical electronic ligand effects."
[5] "While the latter can, at least qualitatively, be explained by a stabilization of adsorption on the Pt island edges sites (and/or destabilization of the Ru sites along the edge), the physical origin of the down-shift of the high-temperature peak and its trailing edge compared to desorption from Ru(0001) cannot be rationalized in a local adsorption picture and is not clear yet."
[6] "Finally, CO adsorption on the Pt island edge sites is kinetically stabilized against diffusion to more stable Ru sites at temperatures below 140 K."
[7] "The onset of alloy formation by exchange of Pt and Ru surface atoms is observed after heating to 850 K."
[8] "Annealing to higher temperatures leads to stronger (but still incomplete) intermixing, which also induces pronounced changes of the CO and D adsorption behavior."
[9] "For CO adsorption, the additional modification of the adsorption behavior upon increasing surface alloy formation can be explained by a combination of electronic (lateral) ligand and strain effects, leading to a strengthening of CO adsorption on Pt sites and a weakening on Ru sites."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The annealing process, in this case, leads to the transformation of Pt islands on the Ru substrate into a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy through the exchange of Pt and Ru surface atoms. This process affects the chemical properties of the surface, leading to changes in the adsorption behaviors of probe molecules like CO and D2. The surface alloy formation results in the modification of the chemical properties, with the adsorption behavior on Pt sites becoming more stable and on Ru sites becoming less stable, demonstrating the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of the bimetallic surface. The structural changes and the distribution of the components in the topmost layer are revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing insights into the catalytic properties and performance of the bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置产生显著影响。在本案例中，通过置换Pt和Ru表面原子的过程导致Pt岛在Ru晶片上的转变成PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金。这一过程影响表面的化学性质，导致探针分子（如CO和D2）吸附行为的变化。表面合金形成导致化学性质的修改，Pt位点上的吸附变得更为稳定，而Ru位点上的吸附变得不那么稳定，这表明探针分子吸附对双金属表面的局部结构和组成具有敏感性。通过扫描隧道显微镜揭示了表面层的结构变化和成分分布，为不同应用中的双金属催化剂的催化特性和性能提供了见解。
