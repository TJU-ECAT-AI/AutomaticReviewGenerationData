[1] "We start with a TPD spectrum for CO desorption from the unmodified Ru(0001) surface, which is included in Figure 3a for comparison (thin line)."
[2] "The onset of local surface alloy formation after heating of the bimetallic sample to 850 K does not induce any major changes in the shape or temperature range of the CO TPD spectrum (Figure 3b) compared to that obtained after annealing to 700 K."
[3] "For deuterium adsorption, the formation of mixed ensembles upon surface alloy formation has to be considered in addition to strain and lateral ligand effects,7,17 if similar to findings for the non-modified constituents of the bimetallic surface [Ru(0001)23,24,50 and Pt(111)25,26], threefold hollow sites are the preferred adsorption site for D binding on the bimetallic surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The TPD spectrum for CO desorption from the unmodified Ru(0001) surface is provided for comparison with other surfaces.
2. Heating the bimetallic sample to 850 K for surface alloy formation does not significantly alter the CO TPD spectrum shape or temperature range compared to annealing to 700 K.
3. The preferred adsorption site for deuterium on the bimetallic surface is the threefold hollow site, similar to findings for the non-modified constituents of the bimetallic surface.

1. 对未修改的Ru(0001)表面的CO脱附谱图进行了比较。
2. 将二金属样品加热至850 K进行表面合金化后，CO TPD谱图形状或温度范围的变化与加热至700 K相比不明显。
3. 在二元合金表面中，Deuterium的优选吸附位点是三折空位，这与非修改的二元合金表面成分的研究结果一致。
