[1] "The correlation between structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and by the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules."
[2] "The influence of the surface structure on the chemical properties is more evident during surface alloy formation, which sets in for annealing above 750 K, for example upon annealing to 850 K."
[3] "The results clearly demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the (local) structure and composition of a bimetallic surface at constant overall composition of the surface layer, even for a combination of two chemically active metals such as Ru and Pt."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This is evidenced by the study of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts through scanning tunneling microscopy and the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules. Upon stepwise annealing, the surface structure undergoes modification, leading to changes in chemical properties. These changes are more pronounced during the surface alloy formation, which occurs at temperatures above 750 K, for instance, at 850 K. The results highlight the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of bimetallic surfaces, even when dealing with chemically active metals like Ru and Pt. This sensitivity indicates the critical role of structural and compositional variations in determining the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚集状态以及结构配置。通过扫描隧道显微镜和吸附CO和D2探针分子对双金属PtRu/Ru(0001)模型催化剂的研究，证明了这些影响。在逐步退火过程中，表面结构会发生修改，进而导致化学性质的变化。这些变化在表面合金形成阶段更为明显，这通常发生在高于750K的温度下，例如在850K时。结果表明，探针分子吸附对双金属表面的局部结构和组成非常敏感，即使涉及到化学活性金属如Ru和Pt也是如此。这种敏感性表明，在不同应用中，结构和组分变化对于确定双金属催化剂的催化特性和性能至关重要。
