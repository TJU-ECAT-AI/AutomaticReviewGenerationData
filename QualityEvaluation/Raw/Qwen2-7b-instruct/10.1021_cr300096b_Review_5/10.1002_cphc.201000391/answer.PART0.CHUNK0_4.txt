[1] "The correlation between structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and by the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules."
[2] "The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer was revealed by STM. Looking at the atomic-scale structural development of Pt islands and step decorations upon annealing to increasing temperatures, we expand our previous findings about the onset of surface alloy formation near vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films."
[3] "Dendritic Pt monolayer islands (diameter 36 nm) are formed after Pt deposition at room temperature, which grow in size and assume a relaxed hexagonal shape after annealing to higher temperature (750 K)."
[4] "For both adsorbates, desorption from the Pt-covered areas results in a desorption peak at distinctly lower temperatures compared to desorption from Ru(0001) or Pt(111), reflecting a pronounced destabilization, which is due to a combination of strain effects and vertical electronic ligand effects."
[5] "While the latter can, at least qualitatively, be explained by a stabilization of adsorption on the Pt island edges sites (and/or destabilization of the Ru sites along the edge), the physical origin of the down-shift of the high-temperature peak and its trailing edge compared to desorption from Ru(0001) cannot be rationalized in a local adsorption picture and is not clear yet."
[6] "Finally, CO adsorption on the Pt island edge sites is kinetically stabilized against diffusion to more stable Ru sites at temperatures below 140 K."
[7] "The onset of alloy formation by exchange of Pt and Ru surface atoms is observed after heating to 850 K."
[8] "Annealing to higher temperatures leads to stronger (but still incomplete) intermixing, which also induces pronounced changes of the CO and D adsorption behavior."
[9] "For CO adsorption, the additional modification of the adsorption behavior upon increasing surface alloy formation can be explained by a combination of electronic (lateral) ligand and strain effects, leading to a strengthening of CO adsorption on Pt sites and a weakening on Ru sites."
[10] "Deuterium adsorption is more strongly affected by surface alloy formation, which is attributed to the presence of mixed Pt5xRux/Ru(0001) adsorption ensembles (pentamers), with D binding strength in between those of pure Ru5/Ru(0001) and Pt5/Ru(0001) ensembles."
[11] "The results clearly demonstrate the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the (local) structure and composition of a bimetallic surface."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The annealing process, in this case, leads to the transformation of Pt islands on the Ru substrate into a PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy through the exchange of Pt and Ru surface atoms. This process affects the chemical properties of the surface, leading to changes in the adsorption behaviors of probe molecules like CO and D2. The surface alloy formation results in the modification of the chemical properties, with the adsorption behavior on Pt sites becoming more stable and on Ru sites becoming less stable, demonstrating the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of the bimetallic surface. The structural changes and the distribution of the components in the topmost layer are revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing insights into the catalytic properties and performance of the bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置产生显著影响。在本案例中，通过置换Pt和Ru表面原子的过程导致Pt岛在Ru晶片上的转变成PtRu/Ru(0001)表面合金。这一过程影响表面的化学性质，导致探针分子（如CO和D2）吸附行为的变化。表面合金形成导致化学性质的修改，Pt位点上的吸附变得更为稳定，而Ru位点上的吸附变得不那么稳定，这表明探针分子吸附对双金属表面的局部结构和组成具有敏感性。通过扫描隧道显微镜揭示了表面层的结构变化和成分分布，为不同应用中的双金属催化剂的催化特性和性能提供了见解。
