[1] "The correlation between structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and by the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules."
[2] "The surface structure and distribution of the components in the topmost layer was revealed by STM. Looking at the atomic-scale structural development of Pt islands and step decorations upon annealing to increasing temperatures, we expand our previous findings about the onset of surface alloy formation near vacancy islands in Pt monolayer films."
[3] "The distribution of the foreign atoms is clearly inhomogeneous. There is a pronounced enrichment of Ru atoms in the outer regions of the Pt islands and in the step decorations, while in the inner parts of the Pt islands the density of Ru atoms is very low."
[4] "For CO desorption, this process results in a successive decrease of the signal intensity at 410 K, after each annealing step up to 700 K."
[5] "While the latter can, at least qualitatively, be explained by a stabilization of adsorption on the Pt island edges sites (and/or destabilization of the Ru sites along the edge), the physical origin of the down-shift of the high-temperature peak and its trailing edge compared to desorption from Ru(0001) cannot be rationalized in a local adsorption picture and is not clear yet."
[6] "Deuterium adsorption is more strongly affected by surface alloy formation, which is attributed to the presence of mixed Pt5xRux/Ru(0001) adsorption ensembles (pentamers), with D binding strength in between those of pure Ru5/Ru(0001) and Pt5/Ru(0001) ensembles."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, by altering the distribution of components in the topmost layer. This leads to changes in chemical properties, catalytic activities, and performance. Specifically, annealing can cause the formation of surface alloys, which affects adsorption behaviors of probe molecules like CO and D2. The inhomogeneous distribution of Ru atoms in Pt islands and step decorations indicates the onset of surface alloy formation. The stabilization of adsorption on Pt island edges suggests a kinetic stabilization of CO adsorption, possibly due to the higher adsorption energy at these sites. The physical origin of the down-shift in desorption peaks compared to desorption from non-modified surfaces is not fully understood. Deuterium adsorption is more sensitive to surface alloy formation due to the presence of mixed ensembles, indicating a dependency of its binding strength on the composition of the adsorption ensemble. Complete intermixing of the surface alloy layer at higher temperatures leads to pronounced changes in the adsorption properties of both CO and deuterium, demonstrating the sensitivity of probe molecule adsorption to the local structure and composition of the bimetallic surface.

热力学偏好和反应条件通过改变层顶部分布，进而影响双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面偏聚状态，特别是在Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金中。这导致化学性质、催化活性和性能的变化。具体来说，退火可以导致表面合金的形成，从而影响探针分子如CO和D2的吸附行为。Ru原子在Pt岛和台阶装饰中的不均匀分布表明表面合金形成的开始。Pt岛边缘上吸附的稳定性可能是因为这些位置的吸附能更高，暗示了CO吸附的动能稳定化。高温度峰和其尾端向下偏移的物理起源尚未完全理解。由于混合簇的存在，脱氘吸附对表面合金的形成更为敏感，这表明其结合强度依赖于吸附簇的组成。在较高温度下完全互混的表面合金层导致CO和D2吸附性质发生显著变化，清楚地证明了探针分子吸附对双金属表面局部结构和组成的敏感性。
