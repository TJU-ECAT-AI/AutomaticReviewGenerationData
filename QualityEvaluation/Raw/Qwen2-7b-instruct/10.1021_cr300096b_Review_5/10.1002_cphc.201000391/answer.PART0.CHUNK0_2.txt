[1] "The correlation between structural and chemical properties of bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) model catalysts and their modification upon stepwise annealing of a submonolayer Pt-covered Ru(0001) surface up to the formation of an equilibrated PtxRu1x/Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloy was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and by the adsorption of CO and D2 probe molecules."
[2] "The distribution of the foreign atoms is clearly inhomogeneous. There is a pronounced enrichment of Ru atoms in the outer regions of the Pt islands (Figures 2a,b) and in the step decorations, while in the inner parts of the Pt islands the density of Ru atoms is very low (Figures 2ce)."
[3] "Considering that there is no loss of Pt surface atoms into deeper layers even after annealing to 1300 K,16 the transfer of desorption intensity from the low-temperature range to the high-temperature range means that the effects on Pt and Ru surface atoms are asymmetric, with significant stabilization when changing from adsorption on a fully Pt-surrounded Pt surface atom [Pt(Pt6)/Ru(0001)] to a partly Pt-surrounded Pt surface atom [e.g. Pt(Pt3Ru3)/Ru(0001)], but little destabilization when going from a fully Ru-surrounded Ru surface atom [Ru(Ru6)/Ru(0001)] to a partly Ru-surrounded Ru surface atom [e.g. Ru(Pt3Ru3)/Ru(0001)]."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. This impacts their catalytic properties and performance in various applications. During the annealing process, the enrichment of Ru atoms in the outer regions of the Pt islands and in the step decorations, while the density of Ru atoms is lower in the inner parts of the Pt islands, highlights the inhomogeneity in the distribution of the two metals. The modification of the chemical properties of the bimetallic PtRu/Ru(0001) surface is asymmetric when considering the effects on Pt and Ru surface atoms. Specifically, there is significant stabilization when transitioning from adsorption on a fully Pt-surrounded Pt surface atom to a partly Pt-surrounded one, whereas the destabilization is minimal when moving from a fully Ru-surrounded Ru surface atom to a partly Ru-surrounded one.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面分层和结构配置产生了显著影响，特别是在如Pt-3d合金这样的Pt基系统中。这直接影响了它们在各种应用中的催化特性和性能。在退火过程中，Ru原子在Pt岛屿的外缘和台阶装饰中的富集，而在Pt岛屿内部部分的密度较低，表明两种金属分布的不均匀性。在考虑Pt和Ru表面原子的影响时，化学性质的变化是不对称的。具体来说，在从完全被Pt包围的Pt表面原子过渡到部分被Pt包围的原子时，存在显著的稳定化；而从完全被Ru包围的Ru表面原子过渡到部分被Ru包围的原子时，去稳定化程度则较小。
