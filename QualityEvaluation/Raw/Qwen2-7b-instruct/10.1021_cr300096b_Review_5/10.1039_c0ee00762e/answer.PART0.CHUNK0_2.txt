[1] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[2] "The free energy barrier to OOH dissociation, an activity quantity, can serve for the fine tuning of catalyst composition because of the similarity of the ORR mechanisms for Pt-based alloys and Pt."
[3] "We can conclude that the Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity."

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. Alloying leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms more resistant to segregation or dissolution. The free energy barrier to OOH dissociation acts as a key activity indicator for adjusting catalyst composition. The analysis revealed that the Pt2Mo skin alloy optimally balances stability and activity, making it a suitable candidate for stable and active ORR cathodes.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，特别是基于铂的系统如铂-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置有显著影响。合金化导致铂d带的稳定化，使表面铂原子更难分离或溶解。OOH解离的自由能壁垒作为活性量，用于调整催化剂组成的精细调整，因为铂基合金和铂的ORR机制相似。分析表明，铂2钼皮肤合金在稳定性和活性之间实现了最佳平衡，使其成为稳定且活性良好的ORR阴极的理想候选材料。
