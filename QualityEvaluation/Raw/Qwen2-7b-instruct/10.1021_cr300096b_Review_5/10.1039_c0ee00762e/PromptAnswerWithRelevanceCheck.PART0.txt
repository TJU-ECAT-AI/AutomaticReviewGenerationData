How do thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, and what are the consequent implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications?

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys. The alloying process typically stabilizes the Pt d-band, leading to a decrease in surface segregation and dissolution propensity. Clean alloy surfaces exhibit enhanced stability, indicated by positive ΔGc*, compared to pure Pt surfaces. However, the presence of adsorbed oxygen at high electrochemical potentials causes a significant decrease in stability, as evidenced by negative ΔGc* values for alloy surfaces. The structural configuration of these catalysts is influenced by the lateral interaction between adsorbed species and the surface, which affects the energetics of the adsorption and dissociation processes. In the case of Pt-based catalysts, the aqueous environment and in situ oxygen coverage play crucial roles in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity on alloy surfaces. The optimization of alloy composition, particularly the proportion of the alloying element, impacts both the stability and activity of the catalysts. For instance, a 30% molybdenum (Mo) content in the Pt-Mo alloy (Pt2Mo) was found to achieve the best balance between stability and activity, surpassing pure Pt in terms of stability and outperforming other compositions in activity at 0.9 V.

The implications for their catalytic properties and performance are substantial. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those incorporating elements like molybdenum, offer enhanced stability and activity compared to pure Pt, making them attractive for applications requiring high performance and durability, such as fuel cells. The optimization of alloy composition allows for tailoring the catalysts' performance to specific operational conditions, potentially improving the efficiency and longevity of devices that rely on ORR catalysis.

The detailed analysis of the Pt2M skin alloys provides a comprehensive framework for the rational design of ORR catalysts. By considering the thermodynamic stability and kinetic parameters such as the free energy barrier for OOH dissociation, researchers can predict and engineer catalysts with improved performance for various applications, including but not limited to, fuel cell technology and other electrocatalytic processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性和表面聚积配置。合金化过程通常稳定Pt d带，降低表面聚积和溶解倾向。清洁合金表面的稳定性通过正ΔGc*与纯Pt表面形成对比得到增强。然而，高电化学势下的吸附氧导致合金表面稳定性显著下降，表现为覆盖有吸附氧的合金表面的ΔGc*值为负。这些催化剂的结构配置受吸附物种与表面之间的侧向相互作用的影响，这影响吸附和分解过程的能垒。对于Pt基催化剂而言，水环境和原位氧覆盖在促进合金表面的ORR活性中扮演着关键角色。合金组成优化，尤其是合金元素的比例，影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。例如，在Pt-Mo合金（Pt2Mo）中，Mo含量为30%时，可以实现最佳的稳定性和活性平衡，超越纯Pt，并且在0.9 V时相对于其他组成在活性上表现出优势。

这些对催化特性和性能的影响至关重要。双金属催化剂，特别是那些包含元素如钼的催化剂，提供相比纯Pt更优的稳定性和活性，使其成为需要高性能和耐用性的设备的吸引性选择，如燃料电池。通过调整合金组成，研究人员可以根据特定的操作条件来定制催化剂性能，可能提高依赖于ORR催化作用的设备的效率和使用寿命。

对Pt2M皮肤合金的详细分析提供了设计高效ORR催化剂的全面框架。通过考虑热力学稳定性和动力学参数，如OOH分解的自由能壁垒，研究者可以预测并工程设计具有改进性能的催化剂，应用于各种应用领域，包括但不限于燃料电池技术和其他电催化过程。

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors impact the alloy's susceptibility to corrosion and its catalytic properties. For instance, the stability of alloys is notably sensitive to the alloying element and the oxygen coverage. The corrosion of platinum under electrochemical conditions is accelerated at specific oxygen coverages. A positive ΔGc*, indicating a better anti-segregation and anti-corrosion ability, suggests a more stable material compared to pure platinum. Even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions pose a significant challenge for long-term cathode operation. The Pt d-band stabilization, resulting from alloying, contributes to the higher stability of clean alloy surfaces. Oxygen coverage and the aqueous environment play crucial roles in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on alloy surfaces. For Pt2Mo, the optimization of the Pt:Mo ratio ensures a balance between stability and activity. The adsorption strength and dissociation barrier of oxygen and oxygen-containing species on the alloy surface determine the ORR efficiency. High oxygen adsorption on PtMo surfaces leads to a more challenging dissociation process, increasing the overall barrier for ORR.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是铂基系统如铂-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置产生了影响。这些因素影响合金的腐蚀倾向和催化性能。例如，合金的稳定性受到合金元素和氧覆盖度的影响。在特定的氧覆盖度下，铂在电化学条件下的腐蚀加速。正的ΔGc*表明材料具有更好的抗分层和抗腐蚀能力，与纯铂相比更稳定。即使在电化学条件下，甚至皮肤合金也面临长期阴极操作的严重问题。铂d带的稳定化，由于合金化而产生，有助于清洁合金表面的更高稳定性。氧气覆盖率和水环境在促进合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）中起着关键作用。对于Pt2Mo，优化铂：钼的比例确保了稳定性和活性之间的平衡。氧气吸附强度和氧及其衍生物的解离壁垒决定了ORR的效率。在PtMo表面的高氧气吸附导致更困难的解离过程，增加了ORR的整体障碍。
