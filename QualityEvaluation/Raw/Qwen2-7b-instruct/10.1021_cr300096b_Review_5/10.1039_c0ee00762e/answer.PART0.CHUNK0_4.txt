[1] "The stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O."
[2] "The corrosion of Pt under electrochemical conditions occurs only above a certain surface O coverage, as controlled by electrochemical potential."
[3] "A positive ΔGc* would imply a better anti-segregation and anti-corrosion ability of the material than Pt."
[4] "The stability of even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions could be a severe problem for the long-term operation of cathodes."
[5] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band."
[6] "With Mo being identified as a promising alloying candidate, we are now in the position to examine the ORR reaction kinetics at 0.80.9 V potentials to ensure that ORR can also occur efficiently on Pt2Mo."
[7] "We found that these TSs dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The reaction free energy profiles for the OOH pathway on Pt2Mo and Pt surfaces are shown in Fig. 3 and the data is detailed in Table S1 in the ESI."
[8] "For example, at 0.9 V, the ΔG on Pt is 0.63 V, while it is only 0.43 eV on Pt2Mo."
[9] "These results demonstrate that the aqueous environment, together with the in situ O coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces."
[10] "We notice that due to the too weak adsorption of O2 and O on PtMo, the dissociation of OOH on PtMo becomes kinetically difficult, which leads to the high overall barrier on PtMo."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors impact the alloy's susceptibility to corrosion and its catalytic properties. For instance, the stability of alloys is notably sensitive to the alloying element and the oxygen coverage. The corrosion of platinum under electrochemical conditions is accelerated at specific oxygen coverages. A positive ΔGc*, indicating a better anti-segregation and anti-corrosion ability, suggests a more stable material compared to pure platinum. Even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions pose a significant challenge for long-term cathode operation. The Pt d-band stabilization, resulting from alloying, contributes to the higher stability of clean alloy surfaces. Oxygen coverage and the aqueous environment play crucial roles in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on alloy surfaces. For Pt2Mo, the optimization of the Pt:Mo ratio ensures a balance between stability and activity. The adsorption strength and dissociation barrier of oxygen and oxygen-containing species on the alloy surface determine the ORR efficiency. High oxygen adsorption on PtMo surfaces leads to a more challenging dissociation process, increasing the overall barrier for ORR.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂，尤其是铂基系统如铂-3d合金的稳定性和表面分离配置产生了影响。这些因素影响合金的腐蚀倾向和催化性能。例如，合金的稳定性受到合金元素和氧覆盖度的影响。在特定的氧覆盖度下，铂在电化学条件下的腐蚀加速。正的ΔGc*表明材料具有更好的抗分层和抗腐蚀能力，与纯铂相比更稳定。即使在电化学条件下，甚至皮肤合金也面临长期阴极操作的严重问题。铂d带的稳定化，由于合金化而产生，有助于清洁合金表面的更高稳定性。氧气覆盖率和水环境在促进合金表面的氧还原反应（ORR）中起着关键作用。对于Pt2Mo，优化铂：钼的比例确保了稳定性和活性之间的平衡。氧气吸附强度和氧及其衍生物的解离壁垒决定了ORR的效率。在PtMo表面的高氧气吸附导致更困难的解离过程，增加了ORR的整体障碍。
