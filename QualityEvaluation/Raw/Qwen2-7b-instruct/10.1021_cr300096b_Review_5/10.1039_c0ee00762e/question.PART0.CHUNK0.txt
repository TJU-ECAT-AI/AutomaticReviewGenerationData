Towards active and stable oxygen reduction cathodes: a density functional theory survey on Pt2M skin alloys Pt metal, when used as a cathode for oxygen reduction (O2 + 4H+ + 4e  2H2O), suffers from high overpotential and catalyst corrosion. Here, first-principles based theoretical methods for electrochemical systems are utilized to identify the critical factors affecting cathode performance. By analyzing a large set of Pt alloys, we show that alloys are in general less stable than Pt at the same O coverage under electrochemical conditions, and that maintaining a zero O coverage at the working potentials (e.g. 0.9 V) is key to achieve both high activity and stability. Two quantities, i.e. the surface corrosion energy and the free energy barrier to OOH dissociation, are found to be the main descriptors for the stability and activity. A Pt2Mo skin alloy is discovered to be a good candidate for an oxygen reduction cathode. The theoretical framework provides a new route for the rational design of oxygen reduction catalysts.
Broader context The identification of active and stable cathode materials for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction (OR) has been a long-standing problem in fuel cell technology. In this contribution, we utilize the first-principles periodic continuum solvation method developed recently to establish a complete theoretic framework for screening potential OR cathode materials. Unlike most previous work in the field focusing mainly on the activity issue, we start from a screening of Pt2M skin alloys by assessing their surface stability via a quantitative measure, i.e. surface corrosion energy. We show that the key difficulty in the design of OR cathodes is in fact not to achieve a high activity, but to maintain a high stability of the metal surface under the corrosive cathode conditions. From more than 20 different Pt2M alloys, we identify Mo as a good element, which can alloy with Pt to make a stable surface at high electrochemical potentials. We further show that Pt2Mo possesses a lower kinetic barrier for OR compared to Pt, and the barrier towards OOH dissociation is a key kinetic parameter for OR activity. With this bottom-up approach, we believe that the development of OR cathodes for fuel cell applications can be greatly facilitated.
Platinum, as an indispensable electrode material, plays a central role in modern fuel cell applications.1,2 However, the high overpotential (>300 mV) in oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) on Pt cathodes significantly limits the energy efficiency of fuel cells.3,4 Moreover, because of the agglomeration and dissolution of metal particles, the lifetime of Pt cathodes places another severe constraint on the long-term application.46 To date, many alloy materials composed of Pt and other elements, namely PtM alloys, have been tested in experiments (e.g. M = Ni,79Co,8,1012Fe,8,13Ti,8 V,8Sc, Y,14Cu1519), and it remains highly challenging to find alternative catalysts better than Pt with both high activity and high stability. This is partly because the ORR catalyst is required to activate O2 under corrosive conditions (oxidative, acidic and high potential (1 V vs.NHE)). Fundamentally, due to the lack of an atomistic picture of the process, no reliable measure for efficiently screening catalysts is available towards the rational selection of the alloying element and the identification of the optimum alloying ratio (Pt:M).
Although a complete microscopic mechanistic picture of the ORR is still under debate, some factors influencing the activity and stability have been outlined recently. By analyzing the morphology of active PtNi skin alloys (a monolayer of Pt over bulk Pt3Ni alloy) that were demonstrated to have a higher ORR activity than that of bulk alloys and pure Pt, Stamenkovic et al. observed that the active PtNi skin alloy has a lower surface O coverage at 0.80.9 V compared to a pure Pt catalyst, which implies a weaker O adsorption on the skin alloy.7 Norskov and coworkers utilized the computed O atom adsorption energy as a thermodynamic descriptor to select potential ORR alloy catalysts by large-scale first principles calculations,14 as it was suggested that a good ORR catalyst may possess a lower O binding ability by 0.2 eV than pure Pt. Experiments were then utilized to identify the best candidate.14 In addition to the activity issue, the long-term stability of ORR cathodes against dissolution in acidic media is another major concern.2025 It was observed that PtM (M = Co, Fe) bulk alloy catalysts do not provide long-term improvements in catalytic activity and electrochemical durability, due to the leaching of the alloying M element under intensive potential cycling.11,24,25 For instance, PtCo nanoparticles will slowly evolve towards Pt-skin alloy structures in the long-term PEMFC test.26,27 The higher stability of clean Pt covered skin alloys under vacuum were also confirmed by theoretical calculations.28,29 Recently, we studied the atomic-level mechanism of Pt cathode dissolution using first principles calculations, by taking into account the effect of the electrochemical environment explicitly.32c We showed that the corrosion of Pt under electrochemical conditions occurs only above a certain surface O coverage, as controlled by electrochemical potential: on the Pt(111) surface, Pt atoms start to dissolve above 0.5 monolayer (ML) O coverage, corresponding to 1.05 V vs.NHE. The surface O coverage on Pt surfaces increases rapidly upon increase of the electrochemical potential, according to the surface phase diagram.
While the atomic O adsorption energy (data often available only for clean surfaces) is believed to be important for the activity of the ORR catalyst, this descriptor alone appears not to be sensitive enough to predict a good ORR catalyst.14,30 Especially since, based on knowledge recently gained for electrocatalytic reactions, the in situ O coverage of the cathode at the working potentials (0.80.9 V) could be high and the presence of the lateral interaction might significantly affect the stability and activity. Obviously, the electrochemical conditions, including the electrochemical potential, the surface coverage and the solvation effects, must play important roles in catalytic kinetics and thus should be taken into account to identify the key descriptors towards the rational design of ORR catalysts.
To establish a complete theoretical framework for understanding the ORR activity and stability, here we first analyze a set of Pt2M skin alloys by focusing on their surface stability with and without the presence of adsorbed O. Next, by evaluating the surface stability at 1.05 V under electrochemical conditions and computing the reaction profile of ORR, we show that Pt2Mo skin alloy is a good candidate for an ORR cathode operating at a potential of 0.9 V. All calculations were performed using the plane-wave density functional theory slab method, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP).31 The methods for calculating electrochemical systems and the detailed setup are provided in the ESI along with our recent work.32 We started with the investigation of the surface stability of a set of Pt2M skin alloys (Pt2M alloy covered by a monolayer of Pt) under high O coverage conditions, with M being mainly 3d and 4d metals. These skin alloys were created by replacing 1/3 Pt atoms from two to five layers in a six-layer Pt(111) slab (e.g. 2 Pt atoms replaced by M per layer in a (3 × 3) unit cell). Initially, the O coverage was fixed at 0.5 ML for all surfaces for the purpose of comparing with Pt, since Pt(111) starts to dissolve above this coverage.32c The skin alloys investigated included the 3d metals: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn, and the 4d metals: Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Cd. It is worth mentioning that the corrosion of Pt metal is kinetically self-accelerated under electrochemical conditions once a defect site on the close-packed (111) surface is created, since the kinetic barrier to surface oxidation is lower at the defect sites.32c While a low density of intrinsic defect sites may be preferentially terminated by specific initial treatment (such as via doping), the close-packed (111), forming the majority of the surface sites, largely dictates the stability of ORR cathode. It is therefore critical to examine the stability of the close-packed (111) surface, as will be addressed below.
In this work, the stability of the surface is measured by the free energy change (ΔGc) of reaction (1), which describes the dissolution/corrosion process of a surface Pt atom, corresponding to the initial step in surface corrosion.32c Ox/Pts/Pt2M Ox/Pts/Pt2M + Pt2+ + 2e (1) During the process, a surface Pt (Ox/Pts/Pt2M) dissolves under the electrochemical conditions, and ends up with a surface vacancy (Ox/Pts/Pt2M) (structure illustrated in ESI Fig. S1). The adsorbates, such as O atoms, if present, will help to stabilize the surface vacancy. It should be mentioned that the standard half-cell potential, E = 1.2 V for the Pt  Pt2+ + 2eequilibrium (this means that below 1.2 V the Pt2+ in solution tends to adsorb and segregate as pure Pt metal at the standard condition), is utilized in calculating ΔGc, as introduced in our previous work.32c Since the exact value of ΔGc depends on the unit cell applied, because the concentration of the final vacancy state is pinned by the unit cell size, a relative value of ΔGc, namely ΔGc*(X) = ΔGc(X)  ΔGc0.5MLO/Pt, is utilized here for comparison in the catalyst screening, which is defined by comparing ΔGc of X to that of Pt(111) at 0.5 ML O coverage in the same unit cell. A positive ΔGc* would imply a better anti-segregation and anti-corrosion ability of the material than Pt. The computed ΔGc*(X) (in a (3 × 3) unit cell) is listed in Fig. 1, together with those of the clean surfaces (at zero O coverage).
Fig. 1 The calculated relative surface stability (ΔGc*) of Pt2M skin alloys (M as x-axis). By definition, ΔGc* of Pt(111) surface at 0.5 ML O coverage is zero.
Fig. 1 clearly shows the relative order of the stabilities of the skin alloys, and demonstrates that the corrosion of alloy metals is significantly facilitated by the presence of O. The trend of ΔGc* across the periodic table for the O covered surfaces is just opposite to that for the clean surfaces. On going from left to right across the periodic table, ΔGc* has a minimum for the Pt2V/Pt2Nb skin alloys for the 0.5 ML O covered surfaces, but it has a maximum for the Pt2Ti/Pt2Nb alloys for the clean surfaces. On clean surfaces, ΔGc* are all positive and it is pure Pt(111) that has the lowest ΔGc*. On the 0.5 ML O covered surface, ΔGc* are all negative, indicating a poorer surface stability for all of the alloying materials compared to Pt at a high O coverage. The results imply that the stability of even skin alloys under electrochemical conditions could be a severe problem for the long-term operation of cathodes, without even mentioning the activity.
The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band,8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve. By contrast, in the presence of adsorbed O atoms the Pt removal is facilitated, because the surface vacancy can be more strongly stabilized by O atoms compared to the initial perfect surface. This can be understood as follows. Firstly, the Pt atoms at the surface vacancy are less coordinated and possess more active d-states, which can more strongly bond with O atoms, compared to terrace Pt atoms. Secondly, with the exposure of the second layer atoms at the surface vacancy, it is possible to form a much stronger OM bond compared to the OPt bond. This is indeed observed in our search for the optimum structure after a Pt removal, which shows that the surface vacancy is preferentially terminated by O atoms that sink to bond with the solute M atoms at the second layer. For example, in Pt2Ti skin alloys, the surface vacancies with a configuration containing OTi bonding are much more stable (by 1.44 eV) than those with only OPt bonding. This is consistent with the fact that the atomic O on metals is anion-like, with a strong tendency to accept electrons, and prefers to form ionic-bonds.
Since the stability of alloys is sensitive to both the alloying element and the coverage of O, it is naturally expected that a considerably lower O coverage at the concerned electrochemical potentials (0.81.2 V) than that on Pt is a prerequisite for a stable ORR catalyst. Theoretically, the thermodynamic equilibrium O coverage under electrochemical potentials can be determined by constructing the surface phase diagram.35,36,32c Therefore, our next step is to select seven representative Pt2M skin alloys (M = 3d: Sc, Ti; 4d: Zr, Nb, Mo, Ag, Pd) to determine their O coverage at around 1 V and examine their stability. At this time, 4d metals are taken as the major candidates because their ΔGc* are generally larger than those of 3d metal alloys in the presence of O (Fig. 1). In this work, only the adsorbed O species is considered in constructing the surface phase diagram since we are mainly concerned with the high potential regimes (e.g. >1 V) of relevance to surface corrosion, when it is the adsorbed O atoms not hydroxyls that dominate.32c It was noticed that at 0.8 V the coexistence of hydroxyls with atomic O is likely on Pt(111).35,36 Our calculated phase diagrams for the seven alloys are shown in Fig. 2. In general, the surface O coverage increases with the increase in potential. At the same potential, the O coverage of the skin alloys is lower than or equal to that of pure Pt. At 1.05 V (dotted line in Fig. 2), Pt2Ti, Pt2Zr, Pt2Mo, Pt2Nb and Pt2Sc have 0.17 ML O coverage, much lower than the 0.5 ML in Pt, and Pt2Pd and Pt2Ag have a 0.33 ML O coverage. The ΔGc* of these alloys at 1.05 V, with the O coverage obtained from Fig. 2, can therefore be computed using the same theoretical approach as above. The ΔGc* of these alloys (in a (3 × 3) unit cell) are found to be 0.25 (Pt2Sc), 0.21 (Pt2Ti), 0.48 (Pt2Zr), 0.15 (Pt2Nb), 0.22 (Pt2Mo), 0.07 (Pt2Ag) and 0.08 (Pt2Pd) eV, respectively. This shows that the stability of the surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr. It reveals that up to the high potential 1.05 V, only Pt2Mo exhibits a higher stability than pure Pt.

With Mo being identified as a promising alloying candidate, we are now in the position to examine the ORR reaction kinetics at 0.80.9 V potentials to ensure that ORR can also occur efficiently on Pt2Mo. To map out the ORR reaction pathway and the free energy profile, we utilized a larger unit cell (3 × 23) to avoid the lateral interaction between reaction intermediates, and the solvation free energy of the reaction intermediates is included by using our recently-developed periodic continuum solvation model.32 For comparison, the ORR on Pt was also studied with the same theoretical approach. According to the refined surface phase diagram in the large unit cell (ESI Fig. S2), the Pt(111) surface is covered by 0.25 ML O at 0.8 V and 0.33 ML at 0.9 V, whilst the O coverage is no more than 0.08 ML for the Pt2Mo skin alloy surface below 0.93 V. Therefore, we took the clean Pt2Mo skin alloy surface (0.8 and 0.9 V), and the 0.25 ML (0.8 V) and 0.33 ML (0.9 V) O-covered Pt(111) surfaces as the model surfaces for investigating ORR kinetics.
In general, the ORR initiates by molecular O2adsorption on the surfaces. It is noted that in the presence of adsorbed O (e.g.Pt at 0.9 V), the surface O may need to rearrange to free sites for O2adsorption (see ΔG0 in Fig. 3) because an O2 molecule adsorption requires at least two Pt atoms. Next, the adsorbed O2 can either hydrogenate to OOH (O2 + H+ + e  OOH), that can later dissociate into adsorbed O and OH, or undergo direct OO bond splitting into adsorbed atomic O. No matter which reaction channel is followed, the final steps are the hydrogenation of O and OH into H2O.3739 Here, both reaction pathways were investigated and the transition states (TSs) for the OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation have been located. We found that these TSs dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The reaction free energy profiles for the OOH pathway on Pt2Mo and Pt surfaces are shown in Fig. 3 and the data is detailed in Table S1 in the ESI. The free energy profile of the direct OO dissociation channel is similar to the OOH channel at 0.8 V (ESI Fig. S3) and thus not discussed here. It should be mentioned that the exact surface phase at 0.8 V, particularly on Pt(111), might be quite complex due to the possible coexistence of surface hydroxyl groups and atomic O from theory35,36,39b (this is also not clear from experiments). The reaction barriers reported here are therefore mainly utilized for the purpose of the activity comparison of Pt and PtMo alloys under the same theoretical framework.
Fig. 3 A schematic free energy profile for the OOH reaction channel of ORR on a Pt(111) surface and a Pt2Mo skin alloy surface at 0.8 V and 0.9 V. The calculated values (eV) of ΔG0, ΔG1, ΔG2, ΔG, ΔG3 and ΔG4 are listed in the inserted table. The solvation free energy of all of the states has been corrected using a periodic continuum solvation model. To allow O2adsorption, surface oxygen atoms may undergo rearrangement to free two atop sites (Sur  Sur*).
The ORR on a Pt2Mo alloy surface follows a similar reaction profile as that on Pt, as shown in Fig. 3. The TS for OOH dissociation dictates the height of the potential profile, and in all systems the overall barrier, ΔG (the free energy difference between the adsorbed O2 and the TS for OOH dissociation), determines the activity. With an increase in potential (0.8 V to 0.9 V), the ORR is retarded due to the increased ΔG. By comparing Pt2Mo with Pt, we can see that the O/OH (ΔG1 + ΔG3 in Fig. 3) and molecular O2 (ΔG1) bind more strongly on the O-covered Pt surface, while the free energy of the OOH state (ΔG1 + ΔG2) and the TS for OOH dissociation (ΔG + ΔG1) are similar for Pt2Mo and Pt. As a result, the overall barrier ΔG is about 0.2 eV lower on Pt2Mo than that on Pt, due to the reduced O2adsorption on the skin alloy surface. For example, at 0.9 V, the ΔG on Pt is 0.63 V, while it is only 0.43 eV on Pt2Mo. From microkinetics, it can be deduced that the overall rate at 0.9 V (under the standard conditions) on the Pt2Mo surface is three orders of magnitude faster than that on Pt provided with the same preexpoential factor.
To understand why Pt2Mo has a lower barrier, we first examined the optimized structure for O2adsorption, and the OOH dissociation TS on Pt2Mo and on Pt, as shown in Fig. 4. The key structural parameters are labelled. These identified structures are similar except that there are precovered O atoms near to the adsorbed O2 and OOH TS on Pt. Due to the lateral interaction, the adsorbed O2 molecule on Pt prefers two atop sites, while it sits over three Pt atoms (bridge-to-atop) on Pt2Mo. We noticed that the OPt bond lengths are generally longer on Pt2Mo compared to those on Pt(111), which is consistent with the fact that the adsorption of O-involved species is always weaker on Pt2Mo under vacuum. Secondly, by analyzing the energetics with and without the solvation effect, we found that the adsorption of the OOH fragment, being close to saturation, is less sensitive to the change of substrate in vacuum, and at the mean time the TS of OOH dissociation experiences a larger solvation on Pt2Mo compared to on Pt (ESI Table S1), which overall yields the similar free energy height in two systems. In fact, the solvation energy contribution to the reaction intermediates (O2 and OOH) on Pt2Mo is generally larger (up to 0.16 eV) than to those on Pt. This is apparently due to the lack of coadsorbed O on the Pt2Mo skin alloy, where the aqueous surroundings can have a stronger electrostatic interaction with the adsorbed intermediates. These results demonstrate that the aqueous environment, together with the in situ O coverage, plays an important role in facilitating the ORR on alloy surfaces.

Large blue ball: subsurface Pt; large Cyan ball: subsurface Mo; small yellow ball: top layer Pt; small red ball: O; small white ball: H. The bond distances labelled are in Å.
Finally, it is interesting to ask whether there is an optimum Pt:Mo ratio in the PtxMo skin alloys. To identify the best ratio, we further considered three skin alloys with varied Pt:Mo ratios (x = 11, 5 and 1), and their activity and stability were then evaluated and compared with those of the Pt2Mo skin alloy. Firstly, the surface diagrams of these PtxMo alloys were constructed to determine the surface coverage of O under the electrochemical conditions (see ESI Fig. S2). Not surprisingly, we found that the increase in Mo content suppresses the coverage of surface O. For example, the O atoms (0.08 ML) start to emerge on Pt(111) at 0.65 V, but do not start to emerge until 0.99 V on the PtMo surface. At 1.05 V, when the O coverage reaches 0.5 ML on Pt, all PtxMo alloys manage to maintain an O coverage below 0.3 ML. Next, with the O coverage determined, we computed the relative surface stability (ΔGc*) at 0.9 and 1.1 V, and also calculated the O2 adsorption state and the TS of OOH dissociation to obtain the key ORR kinetic parameters, ΔG, at 0.9 V. These results are plotted in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5 Calculated stability ΔGc* of Pt and PtxMo skin alloys at 0.9 V and 1.1 V together with the calculated overall free energy barrier ΔG at 0.9 V.
Fig. 5 reveals that the optimum content of Mo in PtxMo skin alloy is 30%. With ΔGc* being always positive, all PtMo alloys are more stable than pure Pt at both 0.9 V and 1.1 V, but Pt2Mo has the highest ΔGc* at 0.9 V and Pt5Mo has the highest ΔGc* at 1.1 V. The stability of the PtxMo alloys drops quickly with increasing potential, which is in line with the rapid increase of surface O coverage for PtxMo surfaces above 0.9 V. As for the activity, the ΔG of Pt2Mo is the lowest (0.43 eV), whilst the ΔGof Pt11Mo, Pt5Mo and PtMo alloys are close to that of Pt (difference within 0.1 eV). We notice that due to the too weak adsorption of O2 and O on PtMo, the dissociation of OOH on PtMo becomes kinetically difficult, which leads to the high overall barrier on PtMo. Therefore, we can conclude that the Pt2Mo skin alloy achieves the best balance of stability and activity. A low Mo content (below 30% e.g.Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, whilst a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g.PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity.
In summary, this work outlines the key quantities affecting the stability and activity of Pt-based ORR catalysts from theory. By analyzing a group of Pt2M skin alloys, we show that the surface stability at high electrochemical potentials is a sensitive measure for a first screening of materials, owing to the fact that the dissolution of surface atoms in alloys is significantly facilitated with the increase of O coverage. The free energy barrier to OOH dissociation, an activity quantity, can serve for the fine tuning of catalyst composition because of the similarity of the ORR mechanisms for Pt-based alloys and Pt. Based on the current theoretical framework, we show that a Pt2Mo skin alloy is a good candidate for a stable and active ORR cathode.
