[1] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band, 8b,33,34 and therefore the surface Pt atoms are more difficult to segregate or dissolve."
[2] "The computed ΔGc*(X) (in a (3 × 3) unit cell) is listed in Fig. 1, together with those of the clean surfaces (at zero O coverage)."
[3] "At 0.8 V the coexistence of hydroxyls with atomic O is likely on Pt(111).35,36 Our calculated phase diagrams for the seven alloys are shown in Fig. 2."
[4] "We found that these TSs dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. The reaction free energy profiles for the OOH pathway on Pt2Mo and Pt surfaces are shown in Fig. 3 and the data is detailed in Table S1 in the ESI."
[5] "The stability of the surfaces follows the order Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr."
[6] "For example, at 0.9 V, the ΔG on Pt is 0.63 V, while it is only 0.43 eV on Pt2Mo."
[7] "Not surprisingly, we found that the increase in Mo content suppresses the coverage of surface O."

1. The stability of clean alloy surfaces can be inferred from the Pt d-band structure, which indicates that alloying stabilizes the Pt d-band, making surface Pt atoms less prone to segregation or dissolution.

2. The relative surface stability (ΔGc*) for Pt2M skin alloys is calculated in a (3 × 3) unit cell, alongside those of clean surfaces (zero O coverage).

3. Hydroxyls and atomic O likely coexist on Pt(111) at 0.8 V. Calculated phase diagrams for the seven alloys are presented in Figure 2.

4. The transition states (TSs) for OOH dissociation and O2 dissociation dictate the highest free energy positions in the reaction pathways. Detailed data is available in Table S1 in the ESI.

5. The order of surface stability for the Pt2M skin alloys is Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr.

6. The overall barrier ΔG is about 0.2 eV lower on Pt2Mo than on Pt, resulting from reduced O2 adsorption on the skin alloy surface.

7. Increasing the Mo content reduces the surface O coverage on the PtxMo skin alloys.

1. 清洁合金表面的稳定性可以通过Pt能带结构推断，合金化导致Pt能带稳定，从而使表面Pt原子不易发生分离或溶解。

2. 在一个（3×3）单元格中计算了Pt2M皮肤合金的相对表面稳定性（ΔGc*），并与零氧覆盖的清洁表面数据一起列出。

3. 在0.8 V时，氢氧基和原子O可能共存于Pt(111)表面。对于七种合金的计算相图在图2中给出。

4. OOH分解和O2分解的过渡状态（TSs）决定了反应路径中的最高自由能位置。详细数据在ESI中的表S1中提供。

5. Pt2M皮肤合金的表面稳定性顺序为：Pt2Mo > Pt > Pt2Ag > Pt2Pd > Pt2Nb > Pt2Ti > Pt2Sc > Pt2Zr。

6. 相对于Pt，Pt2Mo表面的整体势垒ΔG降低了约0.2 eV，这是由于皮肤合金表面上的O2吸附较弱。

7. 随着Mo含量的增加，PtxMo皮肤合金的表面O覆盖率降低。
