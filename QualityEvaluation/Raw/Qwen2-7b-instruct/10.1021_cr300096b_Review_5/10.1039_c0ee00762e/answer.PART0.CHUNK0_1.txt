[1] "The higher stability of clean alloy surfaces can indeed be inferred by the calculated Pt d-band structure, which shows that the alloying generally leads to the stabilization of the Pt d-band."
[2] "By analyzing a group of Pt2M skin alloys, we show that the surface stability at high electrochemical potentials is a sensitive measure for a first screening of materials, owing to the fact that the dissolution of surface atoms in alloys is significantly facilitated with the increase of O coverage."
[3] "The key difficulty in the design of OR cathodes is in fact not to achieve a high activity, but to maintain a high stability of the metal surface under the corrosive cathode conditions."
[4] "We believe that the development of OR cathodes for fuel cell applications can be greatly facilitated with this bottom-up approach."
[5] "A low Mo content (below 30% e.g.Pt5Mo) may achieve a higher stability at high potentials but the activity is not better than Pt at 0.9 V, whilst a high Mo content (above 30%, e.g.PtMo) will start to destabilize the alloy and also reduce the activity."
