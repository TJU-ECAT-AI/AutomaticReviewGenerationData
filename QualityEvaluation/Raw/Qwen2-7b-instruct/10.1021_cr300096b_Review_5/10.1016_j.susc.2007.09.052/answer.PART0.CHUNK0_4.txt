[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys."
[2] "Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure."
[3] "Notably, we have found that a correlation between the Pt surface segregation trend and the displacement of the metal M out of the alloy surface."
[4] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors affect the alloy's overall structure, leading to variations in surface properties. The subsurface atomic structure plays a crucial role in determining the stability and surface segregation patterns of these catalysts. Additionally, the displacement of metal atoms out of the alloy surface can predict surface segregation trends. The electronic structure modification through surface segregation impacts the catalytic properties rather than the surface geometry itself, contributing to the enhanced performance of Pt-skin surfaces in catalytic reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件影响了双金属催化剂，特别是Pt基系统如Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面分离和结构配置。这些因素影响合金的整体结构，导致表面属性的变化。子表面原子结构在决定这些催化剂的稳定性和表面分离模式方面起着关键作用。此外，金属原子偏离合金表面的趋势可以预测表面分离趋势。表面分离通过修改电子结构影响催化性能，而不是表面几何形状本身，这有助于增强Pt皮肤表面在催化反应中的性能。
