[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys."
[2] "However, for Pt3Ti(1 1 1) and Pt3Mn(1 1 1), the model cannot give the correct prediction due to the discrepancy between model and experimental subsurface compositions."
[3] "Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure."
[4] "Notably, we have found that a correlation between the Pt surface segregation trend and the displacement of the metal M out of the alloy surface."
[5] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."

1. Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly impact the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. These conditions affect the distribution of elements across the surface and subsurface layers, influencing the catalyst's overall activity and selectivity in various applications.

2. The model's accuracy in predicting surface segregation varies depending on the specific alloy system. For instance, the model accurately predicts surface segregation for Pt-based alloys except for Pt3Ti(1 1 1) and Pt3Mn(1 1 1), where discrepancies arise due to differences in experimental subsurface compositions compared to the model predictions.

3. Surface segregation in Pt-based catalysts is influenced by multiple factors including atomic size, surface energy, and the subsurface atomic structure. These factors collectively determine whether an element will segregate to the surface or remain within the bulk material.

4. A notable finding is the correlation between the displacement of metal atoms out of the alloy surface and the trend of surface segregation. This correlation provides insight into predicting surface segregation patterns without requiring detailed knowledge of the subsurface segregation structures.

5. Contrary to initial expectations, the surface geometry does not solely govern the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities observed in Pt-skin surfaces of Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1) alloys. Instead, modifications in the electronic structure brought about by surface segregation play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic properties of these materials.

1. 热力学偏好和反应条件对铂基双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面分层配置有重大影响，特别是在铂合金系统中。这些条件会影响表面和亚表面层中元素的分布，从而影响催化剂在各种应用中的活性和选择性。

2. 模型在预测表面分层方面的准确性因不同的合金系统而异。例如，在预测铂基合金的表面分层时，模型准确度除开铂3钛（1 1 1）和铂3锰（1 1 1），其中实验上的亚表面组成与模型预测之间存在差异。

3. 铂基催化剂的表面分层受到原子大小、表面能量以及亚表面原子结构等多因素的影响。这些因素共同决定着某一元素是否会向表面分层或保留在基体材料中。

4. 发现了一个显著的现象：表面分层趋势与金属原子从合金表面移动的趋势之间存在相关性。这一相关性提供了无需深入了解亚表面分层结构即可预测表面分层模式的线索。

5. 令人意外的是，表面几何形状并未单独决定铂皮肤表面（如铂3镍（1 1 1）和铂3钴（1 1 1）合金）中增强的氧还原反应（ORR）活动。相反，表面分层带来的电子结构的改变是提高这些材料催化性能的关键因素。
