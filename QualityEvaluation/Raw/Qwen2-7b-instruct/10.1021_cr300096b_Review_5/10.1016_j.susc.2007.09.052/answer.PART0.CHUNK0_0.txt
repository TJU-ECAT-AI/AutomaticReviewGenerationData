[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys."
[2] "Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure."
[3] "Notably, we have found that a correlation between the Pt surface segregation trend and the displacement of the metal M out of the alloy surface."
[4] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."

1. Various experimental studies have been conducted to explore the surface segregation of platinum alloys. 
2. Surface segregation in platinum alloys is influenced by multiple factors, including atomic size, surface energy, and subsurface atomic structure. 
3. There exists a connection between the trend of platinum surface segregation and the displacement of metal M away from the alloy surface.
4. The surface geometry does not contribute to the increased oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the Pt-skin surfaces of Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1) alloys; rather, the modification of electronic structure is the primary factor affecting catalytic reactions.
