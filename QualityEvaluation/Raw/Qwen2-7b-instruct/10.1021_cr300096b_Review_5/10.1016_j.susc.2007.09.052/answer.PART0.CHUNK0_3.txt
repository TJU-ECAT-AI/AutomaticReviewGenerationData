[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys."
[2] "However, for Pt3Ti(1 1 1) and Pt3Mn(1 1 1), the model cannot give the correct prediction due to the discrepancy between model and experimental subsurface compositions."
[3] "Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure."
[4] "Notably, we have found that a correlation between the Pt surface segregation trend and the displacement of the metal M out of the alloy surface."
[5] "Such displacement can effectively predict surface segregation regardless of the subsurface segregation structures."
[6] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."

1. Experimental studies have been conducted to explore surface segregation in Pt alloys.
2. The model fails to accurately predict surface segregation in Pt3Ti(1 1 1) and Pt3Mn(1 1 1) due to differences between the model and experimental subsurface compositions.
3. Surface segregation in Pt alloys is influenced by factors including atomic size, surface energy magnitude, and subsurface atomic structure.
4. A connection exists between the tendency of Pt surface segregation and the displacement of metal M atoms from the alloy surface.
5. This displacement allows for predicting surface segregation without considering the subsurface segregation structures.
6. The enhanced ORR activity on Pt-skin surfaces of Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1) alloys is not attributed to changes in surface geometry, but rather to modifications in electronic structure.

1. 已对Pt合金的表面同位素进行了大量实验研究。
2. 模型无法准确预测Pt3Ti(1 1 1)和Pt3Mn(1 1 1)的表面同位素分布，原因是模型与实验获得的亚表面组成存在差异。
3. Pt合金的表面同位素分布受到原子大小、表面能大小以及亚表面原子结构等因素的影响。
4. Pt表面同位素趋势与合金中金属M原子偏离表面平面的位移之间存在联系。
5. 这种位移可以用于预测表面同位素分布，而无需考虑亚表面同位素分布结构。
6. Pt3Ni(1 1 1)和Pt3Co(1 1 1)合金的表面皮肤上增强的ORR活性并非由表面几何形状的变化引起，而是电子结构的修改起到了关键作用。
