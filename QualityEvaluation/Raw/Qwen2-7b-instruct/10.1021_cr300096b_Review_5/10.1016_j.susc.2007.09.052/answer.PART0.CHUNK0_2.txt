[1] "Numerous experimental studies have been carried out to investigate surface segregation of Pt alloys."
[2] "The calculations show that the displacement of M atoms at the topmost Pt3M layer can be used to predict the surface segregation trend."
[3] "Our calculations show that surface segregation is determined not only by atomic size and magnitude of the surface energy but also by the subsurface atomic structure."
[4] "Furthermore, this study reveals that the surface geometry is not responsible for the enhanced ORR activity of the Pt-skin surfaces for Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1); instead the modified electronic structure should plays a key role for the catalytic reactions."

1. Various experimental investigations have been conducted to explore the surface segregation phenomena in platinum alloys. 
2. The movement of M atoms at the topmost layer of the Pt3M structure can indicate whether the Pt atoms are likely to segregate to the surface.
3. Surface segregation in Pt3M alloys is influenced by not only the atomic size and surface energy magnitude, but also the arrangement of atoms in the subsurface layers.
4. The surface geometry does not explain the improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity observed in the Pt-skin surfaces of Pt3Ni(1 1 1) and Pt3Co(1 1 1) alloys; instead, the alteration of electronic structures through surface segregation plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic properties.

1. 多项实验研究已经对铂合金的表面同位现象进行了探索。
2. Pt3M结构中顶部层M原子的移动可以预示铂原子是否倾向于向表面聚集。
3. 铂3族金属合金中的表面同位现象不仅受原子大小和表面能量大小的影响，还受到基底层原子排列的影响。
4. Pt3Ni(1 1 1)和Pt3Co(1 1 1)合金的Pt皮肤表面的增强氧还原反应（ORR）活性并非由表面几何形状决定；相反，通过表面同位改变电子结构是提升催化性能的关键因素。
