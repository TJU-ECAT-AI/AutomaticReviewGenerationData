[1] "No matter which method is used, it is difficult to prove that the material synthesized is a doped oxide with the dopant in the surface or the subsurface layer."
[2] "It is more likely that this goal is reached if the preparation method starts with a homogeneous mixture of the precursors and the calcination temperature is low enough to prevent dopant diffusion and aggregation."
[3] "In one example, a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3."
[4] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD."
[5] "For low nominal Ni concentration, the XRD showed only the fluoride structure on CeO2 with no shift."

1. The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating them to high temperatures in oxygen to allow dopant diffusion into the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable, and it starts with two phases. The rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases with smaller particle sizes and higher temperatures. XRD measurements can confirm the formation of a doped oxide by detecting a single-phase structure consistent with substitutional doping.

2. The impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, then dries and heats it in air. This method aims for surface doping rather than a separate phase or submonolayer of dopant oxide on the host oxide. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts were prepared by impregnating ceria with a copper nitrate solution. XRD analysis indicated that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight. However, above this concentration, phase separation was observed, and the material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide.

3. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance in both methods include dopant loading and calcination temperature. In solid-state synthesis, lower calcination temperatures can prevent dopant diffusion and aggregation, enhancing the likelihood of forming a homogeneous doped oxide. For impregnation, the choice of precursors and the calcination conditions affect the distribution of dopants within the oxide matrix, impacting its physical properties and performance.

4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a critical technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. Specific examples include the detection of a single-phase strontium titanate structure in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 and the identification of lattice constant shifts indicating substitutional doping in copper-doped ceria catalysts. XRD can reveal the formation of a doped oxide, the presence of dopant ions within the lattice, and the effectiveness of the doping process.

1. 固相合成方法涉及将主机氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物混合为固体颗粒，然后在氧气中加热到高温，使掺杂剂扩散到主机氧化物中。当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定的相时，这种方法适用。它从两个相开始。随着粒子尺寸更小和温度更高，形成均相相的速率增加。通过X射线衍射（XRD）测量可以确认掺杂氧化物的形成，检测与置换掺杂一致的一相结构。

2. 浸渍法将主机氧化物暴露于含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，然后干燥并加热至空气。该方法旨在实现表面掺杂，而不是氧化物或主机氧化物上的单层掺杂剂。例如，通过将铜硝酸盐溶液浸渍到氧化铈中制备铜掺杂的铈催化剂。XRD分析表明，当铜加载量低于3%时，没有结晶铜氧化物相在XRD中观察到。然而，在高于此浓度的情况下，观察到了相分离，并且材料对CO氧化的活性比未掺杂的氧化物更高。

3. 影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂加载量和煅烧温度。在固相合成中，较低的煅烧温度可以防止掺杂剂扩散和聚集，从而提高形成均相掺杂氧化物的可能性。对于浸渍，选择的前体和煅烧条件会影响氧化物矩阵内掺杂剂的分布，影响其物理性质和性能。

4. X射线衍射（XRD）是一项关键的技术，用于确认成功掺杂并表征形成的材料。具体例子包括Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3中单相钡钛酸盐结构的检测和铜掺杂铈催化剂中晶格常数变化的识别，这表示置换掺杂的存在。XRD可以揭示掺杂氧化物的形成、晶格内掺杂离子的存在以及掺杂过程的有效性。

[3] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
[4] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD."
[5] "The XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."
[6] "Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed. The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature."

The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant, then heating them to allow the dopant to diffuse into the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. Key factors influencing its success include the size of particles and the calcination temperature. For instance, a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared, ball-milled, and then heated to form Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3, showing a single-phase strontium titanate structure with lattice constant shifts indicating substitutional doping.

On the other hand, the impregnation method involves exposing the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, drying, and then heating. The goal is to achieve surface doping or a submonolayer of dopant oxide on the host oxide. In the case of copper-doped ceria, copper nitrate solution was used for impregnation, with XRD analysis suggesting substitutional doping of copper ions in the ceria lattice below 3% loading. However, above this concentration, phase separation occurred, with the amount of copper oxide phase increasing with higher calcination temperatures.

Both methods can influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the doped oxide materials based on factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. Techniques like X-ray diffraction can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For example, XRD measurements showed that substitutional doping occurred in the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 sample, while phase separation was observed in the Ni-doped ceria catalysts with increasing calcination temperature.

固体状态合成方法涉及将主机氧化物和掺杂剂化合物的固体混合物进行加热，使掺杂剂扩散到主机氧化物中。当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定的相时，这种方法是合适的。影响其成功的关键因素包括颗粒的大小和煅烧温度。例如，通过将La2O3、SrCO3、TiO2和Ta2O5混合、研磨和加热，形成了Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3，显示出单相SrTiO3结构，其晶格常数的变化与置换掺杂一致，表明了掺杂的成功。

另一方面，浸渍法涉及将含掺杂剂前体的液体暴露于主机氧化物上，干燥后加热。目标是实现表面掺杂或主机氧化物上的掺杂氧化物的亚单分子层。在铜掺杂铈氧化物的例子中，使用铜硝酸盐溶液进行了浸渍，X射线衍射分析表明，在低于3%负载时，铜离子在铈氧化物晶格中的置换掺杂。然而，当负载量超过这一浓度时，出现了相分离，随着煅烧温度的升高，铜氧化物相的数量增加。

两种方法都可能影响掺杂氧化物材料的结构特性和催化性能，这取决于掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度等因素。X射线衍射等技术可以用于确认掺杂的成功并表征最终材料。例如，X射线衍射测量显示Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3样品中实现了置换掺杂，而在Ni掺杂铈氧化物催化剂中，随着煅烧温度的升高，观察到了相分离现象。

1. The solid-state synthesis method involves mechanically intermixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating them to high temperatures in oxygen to allow dopant diffusion into the host oxide. This method is effective when the doped oxide is the thermodynamically stable phase. The rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases with smaller particle sizes and higher temperatures. An example includes a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 prepared in desired stoichiometry, ball-milled, dried, and calcined at specific temperatures to form a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3.

2. Impregnation methods expose the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor. The mixture is dried and heated in air, aiming for surface doping or submonolayer deposition of dopant oxide on the host oxide. Success in doping is confirmed through techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the case of copper-doped ceria catalysts, copper nitrate solution impregnation resulted in ceria structure with a lattice constant shift, indicating Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed, affecting catalytic performance.

3. Failure in impregnation methods can occur due to inadequate filling of ceria pores with liquid, leading to only fluoride structure on CeO2 without lattice constant shift, suggesting no bulk Ni presence. Despite higher catalytic activity for ethane ODH compared to pure ceria or NiO, the catalyst composition remains uncertain, assumed to consist of NiOx spread on the ceria surface.

1. 固态合成方法涉及将主氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物作为固体颗粒混合，然后在氧气中加热到高温以允许掺杂剂扩散到主氧化物中。当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定相时，这种方法有效。形成均相相的速率随着颗粒尺寸的减小和温度的升高而增加。例如，通过将La2O3、SrCO3、TiO2和Ta2O5混合至所需比例，球磨、干燥并在特定温度下煅烧，形成Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的固溶体。

2. 浸渍方法将主氧化物暴露于含有掺杂剂前体的液体中。混合物干燥并在空气中加热，旨在实现表面掺杂或主氧化物上的掺杂氧化物的亚单层沉积。通过技术如X射线衍射（XRD）确认掺杂的成功。铜掺杂铈催化剂的实例显示，铜硝酸盐溶液浸渍导致具有晶格常数偏移的铈氧化物结构，这表明Cu离子在铈氧化物晶格中取代了Ce离子。当铜负载超过3%时，观察到相分离，并且随煅烧温度升高，氧化铜相量增加，影响催化性能。

3. 浸渍方法的失败可能发生在没有充分填充铈氧化物孔隙的液体情况下，导致只有氟化结构的铈氧化物，没有晶格常数偏移，暗示没有基质Ni存在。尽管NiCeO2系统用于乙烷ODH的催化活性比纯铈氧化物或NiO高得多，但催化剂组成仍不确定，假设由NiOx均匀分布在铈氧化物表面。

Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, both methods aim to incorporate dopants into the host oxide. However, they differ in their approaches. The solid-state synthesis involves mechanical mixing of solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant at high temperatures, allowing dopant diffusion into the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance include dopant loading and calcination temperature. For instance, in the preparation of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, the XRD measurements for various x values confirmed the formation of a single-phase strontium titanate structure, indicating successful doping. On the other hand, the impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, hoping to achieve surface doping. This method typically involves drying and subsequent heating, aiming to cause surface doping or deposition of dopant oxide. In the case of copper-doped ceria catalysts, XRD analysis revealed that at lower copper loadings, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed, suggesting substitutional doping within the ceria lattice. Conversely, at higher loadings, phase separation occurred, affecting the material's structure and catalytic activity.

Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) play a crucial role in confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. XRD can detect shifts in lattice parameters that indicate substitutional doping or the formation of new phases. For example, the XRD analysis of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 materials with varying x values allowed for the identification of a single-phase strontium titanate structure, providing evidence of successful doping. Similarly, the lack of crystalline copper oxide phases at lower copper loadings in copper-doped ceria catalysts indicated substitutional doping within the ceria lattice structure.

In conclusion, while both solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods aim to incorporate dopants into the host oxide, their approaches differ significantly. The choice of method depends on the desired properties of the final material. Techniques such as XRD are essential tools for confirming successful doping and characterizing the structural and catalytic performance of doped oxide materials.

比较固体状态合成方法和浸渍法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料，这两种方法都旨在将掺杂剂引入主氧化物中。然而，它们在方法上有所不同。固体状态合成涉及将主氧化物和掺杂剂的固体化合物通过机械混合并在高温下进行，使掺杂剂扩散到主氧化物中。这种方法适用于当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定的相时。影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度。例如，在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的制备中，不同x值的XRD测量确认了一种单一相的锶钛酸盐结构的存在，这表明了成功掺杂。另一方面，浸渍法通过将含掺杂剂前体的液体暴露于主氧化物上来实现表面掺杂。该方法通常涉及干燥和随后的加热，目的是造成表面掺杂或氧化物的掺杂沉积。在铜掺杂铈氧化催化剂的制备中，XRD分析显示，在较低铜负载下，未观察到结晶铜氧化物相，这表明铜离子在铈氧化物晶格中的置换掺杂。相反，在较高负载下，发生了相分离，这会影响材料的结构和催化活性。

X射线衍射(XRD)技术对于确认成功掺杂并表征最终材料至关重要。XRD可以检测到晶格参数的变化，这表明置换掺杂或新相的形成。例如，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3材料中不同x值的XRD分析允许识别单一相的锶钛酸盐结构，为成功掺杂提供了证据。同样，在铜负载较低的情况下，铜掺杂铈氧化催化剂中未观察到结晶铜氧化物相的存在，表明铜离子在铈氧化物晶格结构中的置换掺杂。

总之，虽然固体状态合成和浸渍法两种方法都旨在将掺杂剂引入主氧化物中，但它们的方法大相径庭。选择方法取决于最终材料所需的特点。诸如XRD这样的技术对于确认成功掺杂并表征结构和催化性能至关重要。
