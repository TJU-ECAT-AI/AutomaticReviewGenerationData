[1] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
[2] "This method is suitable when the doped oxide is the thermodynamically stable phase."
[3] "In one example, (93) a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3."
[4] "Copper-doped ceria catalysts were prepared by impregnating ceria (prepared by calcining ceria nitrate in air) with a copper nitrate solution."
[5] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD."
[6] "The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature."
[7] "The doped material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide."
[8] "This method of preparation is not always successful."
[9] "An example of failure is provided by the following preparation of Ni-doped ceria."
[10] "For low nominal Ni concentration, the XRD showed only the fluoride structure on CeO2 with no shift."

Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, both aim to incorporate dopants into the host oxide structure. However, the solid-state synthesis involves mechanically mixing solid particulates of the host oxide and dopant, then heating to high temperatures to allow dopant diffusion, typically aiming for a thermodynamically stable phase. In contrast, impregnation exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, hoping for surface doping or a submonolayer of dopant oxide. Key factors influencing structural characteristics and catalytic performance include dopant loading and calcination temperature. High loading can lead to phase separation, while lower loading might result in dopant distribution issues. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a critical tool for confirming successful doping and characterizing the materials. For instance, Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 shows lattice constant shifts indicating substitutional doping, while copper-doped ceria catalysts demonstrate improved CO oxidation activity at higher calcination temperatures. Failure cases, like Ni-doped ceria, show discrepancies between XRD and XPS signals, suggesting the presence of NiOx on the surface rather than substitutional doping.

比较固态合成法和浸渍法这两种制备掺杂氧化物材料的方法，两者都旨在将掺杂剂引入主体氧化物结构中。然而，固态合成方法通过将主体氧化物和掺杂剂的固体颗粒混合，然后在高温下加热以允许掺杂剂扩散，通常目标是热力学稳定相。相比之下，浸渍法将主体氧化物暴露于含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，希望实现表面掺杂或氧化物层上的单分子层。影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度。高负载可能导致相分离，而低负载可能引发掺杂分布问题。X射线衍射（XRD）是一种确认成功掺杂并表征材料的重要工具。例如，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3显示出晶格常数的变化，表明存在置换掺杂，而铜掺杂铈氧化物催化剂在更高煅烧温度下的CO氧化活性有所提高。失败案例，如铈氧化镍，显示XRD和XPS信号之间存在差异，这表明表面存在NiOx，而不是置换掺杂的存在。
