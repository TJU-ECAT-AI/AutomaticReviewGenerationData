[1] "While doped oxides are targeted, the preparation method may produce a system whose surface consists of very small oxide clusters of the dopant, supported on the surface of the host oxide."
[2] "If these three preparations have different chemical and physical properties, we are more confident that one of them is a doped oxide."
[3] "Molecular compounds (salts, oxides, etc.) of the host oxide and of the dopant are mechanically intermixed as solid particulates and then heated to high temperature, in oxygen, to allow the dopant to diffuse in the host oxide."
[4] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD."
[5] "The XRD measurements for materials with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 detected a single-phase strontium titanate structure, with a lattice constant shift consistent with substitutional doping."
[6] "Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed. The amount of copper oxide phase increased with the calcination temperature."

The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant, then heating them to allow the dopant to diffuse into the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. Key factors influencing its success include the size of particles and the calcination temperature. For instance, a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared, ball-milled, and then heated to form Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3, showing a single-phase strontium titanate structure with lattice constant shifts indicating substitutional doping.

On the other hand, the impregnation method involves exposing the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, drying, and then heating. The goal is to achieve surface doping or a submonolayer of dopant oxide on the host oxide. In the case of copper-doped ceria, copper nitrate solution was used for impregnation, with XRD analysis suggesting substitutional doping of copper ions in the ceria lattice below 3% loading. However, above this concentration, phase separation occurred, with the amount of copper oxide phase increasing with higher calcination temperatures.

Both methods can influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the doped oxide materials based on factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature. Techniques like X-ray diffraction can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For example, XRD measurements showed that substitutional doping occurred in the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 sample, while phase separation was observed in the Ni-doped ceria catalysts with increasing calcination temperature.

固体状态合成方法涉及将主机氧化物和掺杂剂化合物的固体混合物进行加热，使掺杂剂扩散到主机氧化物中。当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定的相时，这种方法是合适的。影响其成功的关键因素包括颗粒的大小和煅烧温度。例如，通过将La2O3、SrCO3、TiO2和Ta2O5混合、研磨和加热，形成了Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3，显示出单相SrTiO3结构，其晶格常数的变化与置换掺杂一致，表明了掺杂的成功。

另一方面，浸渍法涉及将含掺杂剂前体的液体暴露于主机氧化物上，干燥后加热。目标是实现表面掺杂或主机氧化物上的掺杂氧化物的亚单分子层。在铜掺杂铈氧化物的例子中，使用铜硝酸盐溶液进行了浸渍，X射线衍射分析表明，在低于3%负载时，铜离子在铈氧化物晶格中的置换掺杂。然而，当负载量超过这一浓度时，出现了相分离，随着煅烧温度的升高，铜氧化物相的数量增加。

两种方法都可能影响掺杂氧化物材料的结构特性和催化性能，这取决于掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度等因素。X射线衍射等技术可以用于确认掺杂的成功并表征最终材料。例如，X射线衍射测量显示Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3样品中实现了置换掺杂，而在Ni掺杂铈氧化物催化剂中，随着煅烧温度的升高，观察到了相分离现象。
