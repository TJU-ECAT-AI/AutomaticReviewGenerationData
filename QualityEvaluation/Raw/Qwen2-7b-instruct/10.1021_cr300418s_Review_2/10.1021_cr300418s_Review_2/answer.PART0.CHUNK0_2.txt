[1] "The method starts with two phases, and the rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases when the particles are smaller and the temperature is higher."
[2] "In one example, a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3."
[3] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD. Rietveld analysis determined that the material had ceria structure with a small lattice constant shift, which is considered evidence that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice."
[4] "For low nominal Ni concentration, the XRD showed only the fluoride structure on CeO2 with no shift. This was considered an indication that no Ni is present in the bulk of the particles."

1. The solid-state synthesis method involves mechanically intermixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating them to high temperatures in oxygen to allow dopant diffusion into the host oxide. This method is effective when the doped oxide is the thermodynamically stable phase. The rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases with smaller particle sizes and higher temperatures. An example includes a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 prepared in desired stoichiometry, ball-milled, dried, and calcined at specific temperatures to form a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3.

2. Impregnation methods expose the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor. The mixture is dried and heated in air, aiming for surface doping or submonolayer deposition of dopant oxide on the host oxide. Success in doping is confirmed through techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the case of copper-doped ceria catalysts, copper nitrate solution impregnation resulted in ceria structure with a lattice constant shift, indicating Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the lattice. Above 3% Cu loading, phase separation was observed, affecting catalytic performance.

3. Failure in impregnation methods can occur due to inadequate filling of ceria pores with liquid, leading to only fluoride structure on CeO2 without lattice constant shift, suggesting no bulk Ni presence. Despite higher catalytic activity for ethane ODH compared to pure ceria or NiO, the catalyst composition remains uncertain, assumed to consist of NiOx spread on the ceria surface.

1. 固态合成方法涉及将主氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物作为固体颗粒混合，然后在氧气中加热到高温以允许掺杂剂扩散到主氧化物中。当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定相时，这种方法有效。形成均相相的速率随着颗粒尺寸的减小和温度的升高而增加。例如，通过将La2O3、SrCO3、TiO2和Ta2O5混合至所需比例，球磨、干燥并在特定温度下煅烧，形成Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的固溶体。

2. 浸渍方法将主氧化物暴露于含有掺杂剂前体的液体中。混合物干燥并在空气中加热，旨在实现表面掺杂或主氧化物上的掺杂氧化物的亚单层沉积。通过技术如X射线衍射（XRD）确认掺杂的成功。铜掺杂铈催化剂的实例显示，铜硝酸盐溶液浸渍导致具有晶格常数偏移的铈氧化物结构，这表明Cu离子在铈氧化物晶格中取代了Ce离子。当铜负载超过3%时，观察到相分离，并且随煅烧温度升高，氧化铜相量增加，影响催化性能。

3. 浸渍方法的失败可能发生在没有充分填充铈氧化物孔隙的液体情况下，导致只有氟化结构的铈氧化物，没有晶格常数偏移，暗示没有基质Ni存在。尽管NiCeO2系统用于乙烷ODH的催化活性比纯铈氧化物或NiO高得多，但催化剂组成仍不确定，假设由NiOx均匀分布在铈氧化物表面。
