[1] "No matter which method is used, it is difficult to prove that the material synthesized is a doped oxide with the dopant in the surface or the subsurface layer."
[2] "Being very small, they have physical and chemical properties different from those of the dopants bulk oxide."
[3] "Our preferred strategy, for establishing that a doped oxide was obtained, is to use three methods of preparation: one that aims at making a doped oxide, one that intends to make small dopant-oxide clusters on the host oxide, and one that makes very small metallic clusters of the dopant, supported on the host oxide."
[4] "The method starts with two phases, and the rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases when the particles are smaller and the temperature is higher."
[5] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD."
[6] "For low nominal Ni concentration, the XRD showed only the fluoride structure on CeO2 with no shift."

Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, both methods aim to incorporate dopants into the host oxide. However, they differ in their approaches. The solid-state synthesis involves mechanical mixing of solid compounds of the host oxide and dopant at high temperatures, allowing dopant diffusion into the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance include dopant loading and calcination temperature. For instance, in the preparation of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, the XRD measurements for various x values confirmed the formation of a single-phase strontium titanate structure, indicating successful doping. On the other hand, the impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, hoping to achieve surface doping. This method typically involves drying and subsequent heating, aiming to cause surface doping or deposition of dopant oxide. In the case of copper-doped ceria catalysts, XRD analysis revealed that at lower copper loadings, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed, suggesting substitutional doping within the ceria lattice. Conversely, at higher loadings, phase separation occurred, affecting the material's structure and catalytic activity.

Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) play a crucial role in confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. XRD can detect shifts in lattice parameters that indicate substitutional doping or the formation of new phases. For example, the XRD analysis of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 materials with varying x values allowed for the identification of a single-phase strontium titanate structure, providing evidence of successful doping. Similarly, the lack of crystalline copper oxide phases at lower copper loadings in copper-doped ceria catalysts indicated substitutional doping within the ceria lattice structure.

In conclusion, while both solid-state synthesis and impregnation methods aim to incorporate dopants into the host oxide, their approaches differ significantly. The choice of method depends on the desired properties of the final material. Techniques such as XRD are essential tools for confirming successful doping and characterizing the structural and catalytic performance of doped oxide materials.

比较固体状态合成方法和浸渍法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料，这两种方法都旨在将掺杂剂引入主氧化物中。然而，它们在方法上有所不同。固体状态合成涉及将主氧化物和掺杂剂的固体化合物通过机械混合并在高温下进行，使掺杂剂扩散到主氧化物中。这种方法适用于当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定的相时。影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度。例如，在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的制备中，不同x值的XRD测量确认了一种单一相的锶钛酸盐结构的存在，这表明了成功掺杂。另一方面，浸渍法通过将含掺杂剂前体的液体暴露于主氧化物上来实现表面掺杂。该方法通常涉及干燥和随后的加热，目的是造成表面掺杂或氧化物的掺杂沉积。在铜掺杂铈氧化催化剂的制备中，XRD分析显示，在较低铜负载下，未观察到结晶铜氧化物相，这表明铜离子在铈氧化物晶格中的置换掺杂。相反，在较高负载下，发生了相分离，这会影响材料的结构和催化活性。

X射线衍射(XRD)技术对于确认成功掺杂并表征最终材料至关重要。XRD可以检测到晶格参数的变化，这表明置换掺杂或新相的形成。例如，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3材料中不同x值的XRD分析允许识别单一相的锶钛酸盐结构，为成功掺杂提供了证据。同样，在铜负载较低的情况下，铜掺杂铈氧化催化剂中未观察到结晶铜氧化物相的存在，表明铜离子在铈氧化物晶格结构中的置换掺杂。

总之，虽然固体状态合成和浸渍法两种方法都旨在将掺杂剂引入主氧化物中，但它们的方法大相径庭。选择方法取决于最终材料所需的特点。诸如XRD这样的技术对于确认成功掺杂并表征结构和催化性能至关重要。
