[1] "No matter which method is used, it is difficult to prove that the material synthesized is a doped oxide with the dopant in the surface or the subsurface layer."
[2] "It is more likely that this goal is reached if the preparation method starts with a homogeneous mixture of the precursors and the calcination temperature is low enough to prevent dopant diffusion and aggregation."
[3] "In one example, a mixture of La2O3, SrCO3, TiO2, and Ta2O5 was prepared in the desired stoichiometry, then ball-milled in ethanol with zirconia balls for 12 h. The wet mixture was dried and calcined in air at 1350 C for 6 h. Further ball-milling for 12 h followed by a final heating in air at 1460 C formed a solid solution of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3."
[4] "When the Cu loading was below 3% by weight, no crystalline copper oxide phases were observed in XRD."
[5] "For low nominal Ni concentration, the XRD showed only the fluoride structure on CeO2 with no shift."

1. The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing molecular compounds of the host oxide and dopant as solid particulates, then heating them to high temperatures in oxygen to allow dopant diffusion into the host oxide. This method is suitable when the doped oxide is thermodynamically stable, and it starts with two phases. The rate of forming a homogeneous phase increases with smaller particle sizes and higher temperatures. XRD measurements can confirm the formation of a doped oxide by detecting a single-phase structure consistent with substitutional doping.

2. The impregnation method exposes the host oxide to a liquid containing the dopant precursor, then dries and heats it in air. This method aims for surface doping rather than a separate phase or submonolayer of dopant oxide on the host oxide. For instance, copper-doped ceria catalysts were prepared by impregnating ceria with a copper nitrate solution. XRD analysis indicated that some Cu ions substituted Ce ions in the CeO2 lattice when the Cu loading was below 3% by weight. However, above this concentration, phase separation was observed, and the material was more active for CO oxidation than the undoped oxide.

3. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance in both methods include dopant loading and calcination temperature. In solid-state synthesis, lower calcination temperatures can prevent dopant diffusion and aggregation, enhancing the likelihood of forming a homogeneous doped oxide. For impregnation, the choice of precursors and the calcination conditions affect the distribution of dopants within the oxide matrix, impacting its physical properties and performance.

4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a critical technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. Specific examples include the detection of a single-phase strontium titanate structure in Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 and the identification of lattice constant shifts indicating substitutional doping in copper-doped ceria catalysts. XRD can reveal the formation of a doped oxide, the presence of dopant ions within the lattice, and the effectiveness of the doping process.

1. 固相合成方法涉及将主机氧化物和掺杂剂的分子化合物混合为固体颗粒，然后在氧气中加热到高温，使掺杂剂扩散到主机氧化物中。当掺杂氧化物是热力学稳定的相时，这种方法适用。它从两个相开始。随着粒子尺寸更小和温度更高，形成均相相的速率增加。通过X射线衍射（XRD）测量可以确认掺杂氧化物的形成，检测与置换掺杂一致的一相结构。

2. 浸渍法将主机氧化物暴露于含有掺杂剂前体的液体中，然后干燥并加热至空气。该方法旨在实现表面掺杂，而不是氧化物或主机氧化物上的单层掺杂剂。例如，通过将铜硝酸盐溶液浸渍到氧化铈中制备铜掺杂的铈催化剂。XRD分析表明，当铜加载量低于3%时，没有结晶铜氧化物相在XRD中观察到。然而，在高于此浓度的情况下，观察到了相分离，并且材料对CO氧化的活性比未掺杂的氧化物更高。

3. 影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂加载量和煅烧温度。在固相合成中，较低的煅烧温度可以防止掺杂剂扩散和聚集，从而提高形成均相掺杂氧化物的可能性。对于浸渍，选择的前体和煅烧条件会影响氧化物矩阵内掺杂剂的分布，影响其物理性质和性能。

4. X射线衍射（XRD）是一项关键的技术，用于确认成功掺杂并表征形成的材料。具体例子包括Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3中单相钡钛酸盐结构的检测和铜掺杂铈催化剂中晶格常数变化的识别，这表示置换掺杂的存在。XRD可以揭示掺杂氧化物的形成、晶格内掺杂离子的存在以及掺杂过程的有效性。
