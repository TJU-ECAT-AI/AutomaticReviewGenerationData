3.5. CATALYST DESIGN
"Catalyst design involves selecting candidates for further testing and optimization. These may be very close to the final form if based on previously proven catalysts. For novel designs, however, considerable adjustment lies ahead."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Catalyst design starts by selecting candidates for further testing and optimization. Designs based on proven catalysts are closer to the final form, while novel designs require substantial adjustments.

3.6. CATALYST TESTING
"Allied with design and preparation, catalyst testing is the exploratory screening of candidate catalysts. This phase does not yield either kinetics or process variables but merely ranks performance."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Catalyst testing, alongside design and preparation, serves as an exploratory screening of candidate catalysts. This phase does not provide kinetics or process variables but merely ranks the performance of the catalysts.

3.7. PILOT UNIT TESTING
"To test commercial-like formulations under process conditions to ensure that design requirements are achieved. These include activity, selectivity, diffusional, and mechanical properties."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Pilot unit testing aims to test commercial-like formulations under process conditions to ensure that design requirements are met. This includes verifying activity, selectivity, diffusional, and mechanical properties.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在过程条件下测试商业级配方以确保满足设计要求。这包括验证活性、选择性、扩散性和机械性能。

3.8. PROCESS DESIGN
"The catalyst development is now ready for incorporation into the overall process design, but the story seldom stops there. After a period of long-term commercial usage, the catalyst may return with a different need encountered, and a new round of research, design, testing, and piloting begins."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Catalyst development is ready for integration into the overall process design, but the process doesn't end there. After long-term commercial use, catalysts may encounter new needs, leading to a new cycle of research, design, testing, and pilot studies.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
催化剂开发已经准备好融入整体工艺设计，但故事通常不会就此结束。在长期商业使用后，催化剂可能会遇到新的需求，从而启动新一轮的研究、设计、测试和试点研究。
