[1] "This book focuses on the important problem of understanding how the selectivity of fast competing reactions in low-viscosity liquids can be predicted when the reactions occur on the time scale of liquid mixing transients."
[2] "Chapters 4-6 deal with turbulence, turbulence modelling, and the application of turbulence theory to mixing and concentration transients, in 380 pages."
[3] "Unfortunately, this part of the book is written in terms which will be almost incomprehensible to most organic chemists."
[4] "Moreover, much of it will be very difficult for most normal chemical engineering graduates without in-depth prior knowledge of the subject."
[5] "In Chapter 10 a number of test reactions are described. These are mainly diazo couplings but are useful models for a range of chemical systems."
[6] "Chapter 12 lists the characteristics of commonly used mixing equipment, and then Chapters 13, 14, and 15 apply some of the concepts from the earlier chapters to precipitation, droplet generation, and floc break-up."

The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials are discussed in the literature. The solid-state synthesis involves the direct reaction of precursor oxides, while the impregnation method involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the dopant. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance include dopant loading and calcination temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For instance, Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation are analyzed using XRD to determine the crystal structure and dopant distribution.

文献中讨论了制备掺杂氧化物材料的固相合成法和浸渍法。固相合成法是直接通过前体氧化物反应，而浸渍法则是将支持材料浸泡在含掺杂剂的溶液中。影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度。X射线衍射(XRD)可用于确认成功掺杂并表征最终材料。例如，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂的铈催化剂用于CO氧化，使用XRD分析确定晶体结构和掺杂剂分布。
