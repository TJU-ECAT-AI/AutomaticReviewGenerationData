[1] "This book focuses on the important problem of understanding how the selectivity of fast competing reactions in low-viscosity liquids can be predicted when the reactions occur on the time scale of liquid mixing transients."
[2] "Chapters 4-6 deal with turbulence, turbulence modelling, and the application of turbulence theory to mixing and concentration transients, in 380 pages."
[3] "Unfortunately, this part of the book is written in terms which will be almost incomprehensible to most organic chemists."
[4] "Moreover, much of it will be very difficult for most normal chemical engineering graduates without in-depth prior knowledge of the subject."
[5] "Chapter 11 and 12 deal with the comparison of the theories with experimental results, in 11 for the micro-mixing regime and in 12 for the meso-mixing regime."
[6] "For the micro-mixing controlled reactions, worked examples show that the simplified engulfment model can be used, although there still seems to be a particular difficulty in knowing a priori what value of the key determining parameter, the local turbulent energy dissipation rate, should be used."
[7] "For the meso-mixing systems, the experimental evidence for the importance of understanding the basic principles is clearly demonstrated, and again the analysis is demonstrated by a number of worked examples."

The book "Turbulent Mixing and Chemical Reactions" discusses the challenge of predicting the selectivity of fast competing reactions in low-viscosity liquids when they happen on the timescale of liquid mixing transients. Chapters 4-6 delve into turbulence theory and its applications to mixing and concentration transients. However, these sections are complex and difficult for organic chemists and normal chemical engineering graduates without extensive prior knowledge. Chapters 11 and 12 compare theoretical models with experimental data for micro- and meso-mixing regimes. For micro-mixing, the simplified engulfment model can be applied, though determining the local turbulent energy dissipation rate requires additional information. In meso-mixing, the significance of understanding basic principles is evident through experimental validation.

该书《湍流混合与化学反应》探讨了在液体混合瞬变时间尺度上预测低粘度液体中快速竞争反应选择性的挑战。第4-6章深入研究了湍流理论及其在混合和浓度瞬变中的应用。然而，这些部分对于有机化学家和普通化学工程师来说非常复杂且难以理解，尤其是没有深入的前期知识。第11和12章比较了微观和介观混合区域的理论模型与实验数据。对于微观混合，简化浸没模型可以应用，但确定局部湍流能量耗散率需要额外的信息。在介观混合中，理解基本原理的重要性通过实验验证得到体现。
