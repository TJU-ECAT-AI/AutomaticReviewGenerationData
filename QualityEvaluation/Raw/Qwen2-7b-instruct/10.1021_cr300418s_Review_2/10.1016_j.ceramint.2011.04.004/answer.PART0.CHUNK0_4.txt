The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing the starting materials and then subjecting them to a process that converts the mixture into the desired material. In the context of this study, the authors used a conventional solid-state reaction technique to prepare the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramic samples. This method typically includes grinding the raw materials into fine particles, followed by pressing and sintering the pellets under controlled conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For instance, the samples were found to have a cubic perovskite structure, indicating the presence of tantalum in the lattice. The thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity, and power factor were measured to assess the thermoelectric properties of the materials. The doping of tantalum affects these properties, leading to changes in the materials' performance.

固相合成方法涉及将起始材料混合，然后将其转化为所需材料的过程。在此研究中，作者使用了常规固相反应技术来制备Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3陶瓷样品。这种方法通常包括将原材料磨成细粉，随后压制并用氩气和5摩尔%氢气在控制条件下烧结颗粒。X射线衍射（XRD）用于确认成功掺杂并表征最终材料。例如，样本被发现具有立方铅化物结构，这表明镧的存在。通过测量热导率、电阻率和功率因数来评估材料的热电性能。掺杂钽对这些属性有影响，导致材料性能的变化。
