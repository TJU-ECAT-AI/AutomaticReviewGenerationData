The solid-state synthesis method was employed for the preparation of doped oxide materials in the study. This technique involves the direct combination of the raw materials at high temperatures, leading to the formation of the desired compound through a chemical reaction. Key factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to confirm the successful doping and to characterize the resulting materials, as it provides insights into the crystal structure and phase purity. Specific examples mentioned include the synthesis of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation.
