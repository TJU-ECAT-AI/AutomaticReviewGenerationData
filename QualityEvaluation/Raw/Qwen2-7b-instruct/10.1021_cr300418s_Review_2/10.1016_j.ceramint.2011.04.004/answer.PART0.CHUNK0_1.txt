<p>Ceramic samples of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 have been prepared by conventional solid state reaction technique. The starting materials are La2O3 with purity of 99.99%, SrCO3 of 99%, TiO2 of 99.8%, and Ta2O5 of 99.5%,respectively.</p>
<p>The pellets are smashed and ball-milled for 12 h. Then the powder is repressed into pellets. These pellets are sintered at 1460 8C for 4 h in the presence of argon gas with 5 mol% hydrogen.</p>
<p>X-ray powder diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01,
0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and formed a single phase compound.</p>
<p>The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured simultaneously in the temperature range of 3001100 K using a ULVAC ZEM-3 equipment in Helium atmosphere. Thermal diffusivity and specific capacity are measured by a laser flash apparatus (Netzsch LFA 427) and a different thermal analyzer (Netzsch STA 449C), respectively. The thermal conductivity is calculated from the thermal diffusivity, the specific heat capacity, and the sample density. The figure of merit is calculated from above measured the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>The effects of tantalum substitution for titanium on the thermoelectric properties are investigated at temperatures from 300 K to 1100 K. We find that the absolute Seebeck coefficient obviously decreases gradually with the tantalum substitution. Therefore, the power factor is lower than that of un-doped sample. The thermal conductivity is decreased by tantalum substitution, and this behavior confirms our previous idea.</p>

1. The solid-state synthesis method was used to prepare the doped oxide materials. The method involves using raw materials with high purity, ball-milling them in ethanol, drying the mixture, pressing it into pellets, calcining them at a specific temperature, smashing, ball-milling again, repressing, and finally sintering at a high temperature in an argon-hydrogen atmosphere. 

2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. The XRD patterns of the doped samples matched those of the undoped sample, confirming the presence of tantalum in the lattice structure.

3. The solid-state synthesis method provides control over the dopant loading and calcination temperature, which are critical factors affecting the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the materials.

4. The power factor decreases with increasing tantalum concentration, while the thermal conductivity decreases due to the introduction of tantalum. This behavior confirms the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity, leading to improved thermoelectric performance.

5. The thermoelectric figure of merit increases with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum value of 0.29 at 1046 K for the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, which is a relatively high value for n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

1. 固相合成方法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料。该方法涉及使用高纯度原材料，将其与乙醇混合并球磨，干燥混合物，压制成颗粒，然后在室温下进行煅烧。接着将颗粒粉碎、球磨、重新压制，并在氩气和氢气气氛中进行高温烧结。

2. X射线衍射（XRD）被用来确认成功掺杂并表征最终材料。掺杂样品的XRD模式与未掺杂样品匹配，证实了钽在晶格结构中的存在。

3. 固相合成方法提供了控制掺杂负载和煅烧温度的能力，这对影响材料的结构特性和催化性能至关重要。

4. 随着钽浓度的增加，功率因数降低，而热导率由于引入钽而降低。这一行为证实了晶格热导性的减少，从而提高了热电性能。

5. 热电质量因子随温度升高而增加，在1046 K时达到0.29的最大值，这是对n型氧化物半导体热电材料的相对高值。
