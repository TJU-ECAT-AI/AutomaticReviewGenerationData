The solid-state synthesis method was employed for the preparation of doped oxide materials, specifically Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with various tantalum concentrations. This method involves a series of steps including mixing of raw materials, ball-milling, drying, pressing, calcination, and sintering under specific conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the successful doping and characterized the resulting materials, revealing that the lattice parameters increased with the addition of tantalum. The study focused on the thermoelectric properties of these materials across a temperature range from 300 K to 1100 K. It was observed that the absolute Seebeck coefficient decreased with increasing tantalum substitution, leading to a decline in power factor. Moreover, the thermal conductivity was reduced by the introduction of tantalum, aligning with the anticipated outcome.

采用固相合成法制备了掺杂氧化物材料Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3，其中包含不同的钽浓度。该方法包括原料混合、球磨、干燥、压制、煅烧和在特定条件下烧结等步骤。X射线衍射(XRD)分析证实了掺杂的成功并表征了所得材料，结果显示随着钽的增加，晶格参数也随之增大。研究重点在于这些材料在300 K至1100 K温度范围内的热电性质。发现绝对塞贝克系数随着钽掺杂量的增加而逐渐下降，导致功率因数降低。此外，通过引入钽，热导率得到了降低，这与预期的结果一致。
