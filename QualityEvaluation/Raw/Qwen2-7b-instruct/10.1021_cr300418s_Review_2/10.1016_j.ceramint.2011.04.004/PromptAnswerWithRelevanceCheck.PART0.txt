The solid-state synthesis method was employed for the preparation of doped oxide materials, specifically Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 with various tantalum concentrations. This method involves a series of steps including mixing of raw materials, ball-milling, drying, pressing, calcination, and sintering under specific conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the successful doping and characterized the resulting materials, revealing that the lattice parameters increased with the addition of tantalum. The study focused on the thermoelectric properties of these materials across a temperature range from 300 K to 1100 K. It was observed that the absolute Seebeck coefficient decreased with increasing tantalum substitution, leading to a decline in power factor. Moreover, the thermal conductivity was reduced by the introduction of tantalum, aligning with the anticipated outcome.

1. The solid-state synthesis method was used to prepare the doped oxide materials. The method involves using raw materials with high purity, ball-milling them in ethanol, drying the mixture, pressing it into pellets, calcining them at a specific temperature, smashing, ball-milling again, repressing, and finally sintering at a high temperature in an argon-hydrogen atmosphere. 

2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. The XRD patterns of the doped samples matched those of the undoped sample, confirming the presence of tantalum in the lattice structure.

3. The solid-state synthesis method provides control over the dopant loading and calcination temperature, which are critical factors affecting the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the materials.

4. The power factor decreases with increasing tantalum concentration, while the thermal conductivity decreases due to the introduction of tantalum. This behavior confirms the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity, leading to improved thermoelectric performance.

5. The thermoelectric figure of merit increases with increasing temperature, reaching a maximum value of 0.29 at 1046 K for the Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, which is a relatively high value for n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

The solid-state synthesis method involves the use of starting materials, which are weighed in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for a certain period. The raw mixtures are then dried, pressed into pellets, calcined at a specific temperature for a given duration, and sintered under a particular condition. 

The impregnation method typically involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the dopant, allowing the dopant to diffuse through the pores of the support, and then drying and pyrolyzing the impregnated material.

XRD patterns indicate that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and forming a single phase compound. 

For Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics, the electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample. Negative Seebeck coefficients have been obtained for all samples, which means conduction mechanism being n-type. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration. 

The power factor decreases with increasing of tantalum substitution. Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit still observes in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaches 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively higher value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

The solid-state synthesis method uses a combination of weighing, mixing, drying, pressing, calcining, and sintering steps to prepare doped oxide materials. In contrast, the impregnation method involves soaking the support material in a dopant solution, allowing diffusion, and then drying and pyrolyzing the impregnated material. XRD patterns confirm successful doping by showing consistent phases across different tantalum concentrations. The electrical resistivity decreases with tantalum content, while the Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing tantalum concentration. The power factor declines with tantalum substitution, leading to a reduction in thermal conductivity. Small amounts of tantalum doping can lower thermal conductivity, achieving the lowest value of 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K for x = 0.03. The thermoelectric figure of merit remains highest in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaching 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a notable value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

固相合成法采用称重、混合、干燥、压制、煅烧和烧结等步骤来制备掺杂氧化物材料。而浸渍法则是将支撑材料浸泡在含掺杂剂的溶液中，让掺杂剂通过材料的孔隙扩散，然后进行干燥和热解。X射线衍射图谱显示，不同钽含量的陶瓷样品具有相同的晶相特征，表明钽元素成功地掺入到Sr0.9La0.1TiO3晶格中形成单相化合物。随着钽含量的增加，电导率下降，而塞贝克系数随钽浓度增加而减小。功率因子因钽掺杂量增加而下降，导致热导率降低。少量钽掺杂可以降低热导率，实现最低值2.9 W/mK，对应于x = 0.03时的温度为1074 K。在n型氧化物热电材料中，Sr0.9La0.1TiO3的热电性能最优，其最大品质因数达到0.29，出现在1046 K的温度下，这是一个相当高的数值。

The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing the starting materials and then subjecting them to a process that converts the mixture into the desired material. In the context of this study, the authors used a conventional solid-state reaction technique to prepare the Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramic samples. This method typically includes grinding the raw materials into fine particles, followed by pressing and sintering the pellets under controlled conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to confirm the successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For instance, the samples were found to have a cubic perovskite structure, indicating the presence of tantalum in the lattice. The thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity, and power factor were measured to assess the thermoelectric properties of the materials. The doping of tantalum affects these properties, leading to changes in the materials' performance.
