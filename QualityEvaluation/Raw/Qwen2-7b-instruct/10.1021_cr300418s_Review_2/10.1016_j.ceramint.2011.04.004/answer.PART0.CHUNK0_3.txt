The solid-state synthesis method involves the use of starting materials, which are weighed in stoichiometric proportions, and mixed by ball-milling in ethanol with zirconia balls for a certain period. The raw mixtures are then dried, pressed into pellets, calcined at a specific temperature for a given duration, and sintered under a particular condition. 

The impregnation method typically involves soaking the support material in a solution containing the dopant, allowing the dopant to diffuse through the pores of the support, and then drying and pyrolyzing the impregnated material.

XRD patterns indicate that the XRD patterns of the ceramics with x = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 are the same as that of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 sample, indicative of tantalum element being doped into the lattice of Sr0.9La0.1TiO3 and forming a single phase compound. 

For Sr0.9La0.1Ti1xTaxO3 ceramics, the electrical resistivity decreases with the increasing of tantalum content except for x = 0.05 sample. Negative Seebeck coefficients have been obtained for all samples, which means conduction mechanism being n-type. The absolute Seebeck coefficient decreases with the increase of tantalum concentration. 

The power factor decreases with increasing of tantalum substitution. Small amount tantalum doping can reduce the thermal conductivity. The lowest thermal conductivity obtained is 2.9 W/mK for x = 0.03 at 1074 K. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit still observes in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaches 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a relatively higher value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

The solid-state synthesis method uses a combination of weighing, mixing, drying, pressing, calcining, and sintering steps to prepare doped oxide materials. In contrast, the impregnation method involves soaking the support material in a dopant solution, allowing diffusion, and then drying and pyrolyzing the impregnated material. XRD patterns confirm successful doping by showing consistent phases across different tantalum concentrations. The electrical resistivity decreases with tantalum content, while the Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing tantalum concentration. The power factor declines with tantalum substitution, leading to a reduction in thermal conductivity. Small amounts of tantalum doping can lower thermal conductivity, achieving the lowest value of 2.9 W/mK at 1074 K for x = 0.03. The thermoelectric figure of merit remains highest in Sr0.9La0.1TiO3, reaching 0.29 at 1046 K, which is a notable value in n-type oxide thermoelectric materials.

固相合成法采用称重、混合、干燥、压制、煅烧和烧结等步骤来制备掺杂氧化物材料。而浸渍法则是将支撑材料浸泡在含掺杂剂的溶液中，让掺杂剂通过材料的孔隙扩散，然后进行干燥和热解。X射线衍射图谱显示，不同钽含量的陶瓷样品具有相同的晶相特征，表明钽元素成功地掺入到Sr0.9La0.1TiO3晶格中形成单相化合物。随着钽含量的增加，电导率下降，而塞贝克系数随钽浓度增加而减小。功率因子因钽掺杂量增加而下降，导致热导率降低。少量钽掺杂可以降低热导率，实现最低值2.9 W/mK，对应于x = 0.03时的温度为1074 K。在n型氧化物热电材料中，Sr0.9La0.1TiO3的热电性能最优，其最大品质因数达到0.29，出现在1046 K的温度下，这是一个相当高的数值。
