Recent conceptual advances in the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials Israel E. Wachs* Operando Molecular Spectroscopy and Catalysis Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015, USA Available online 18 January 2005 Abstract The catalysis science of mixed metal oxides (supported metal oxides, molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxides) has undergone dramatic paradigm changes over the past 25 years as new characterization techniques became available (X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS/XANES/soft XANES), Raman, solid-state NMR, HR-TEM, UVvis DRS and LEISS) to catalysis researchers. The major advantages offered by these spectroscopic improvements are that (1) they can detect XRD inactive amorphous surface metal oxide phases as well as crystalline nanophases and (2) their ability to collect information under various environmental conditions. Application of these spectroscopic techniques to the investigation of mixed metal oxide catalysts have provided new fundamental insights into the electronic and molecular structures of mixed metal oxide catalytic active sites and how they control the catalytic activity and selectivity characteristics. The most significant discovery has been that amorphous metal oxide phases are always present and are the catalytic active sites for many applications of mixed metal oxide catalysts. This has resulted in a significant paradigm shift as to how mixed metal oxide catalytic materials function for different applications. This article reviews the instrumental advances and the resulting conceptual advances that have evolved over the past 25 years in the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalysts.

1. Introduction
The catalysis science of metal-based catalysts, bulk as well as supported, was significantly advanced in the 1970s by (1) introduction of selective chemisorption methods to determine the number of exposed metal sites, (2) transmis- sion electron microscopy (TEM) for imaging the structure and morphology of the metallic components, (3) X-ray diffraction (XRD) for determining the volume average particle dimensions, (4) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS/XANES) for determining local coordination, and (5) UHV model single crystal studies [15]. This allowed for the successful quantitative comparison of reaction rates between different catalysis laboratories as well as supported metal catalysts and model large single crystals [13]. In contrast, the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalysts was not sufficiently developed in the 1970s and significantly lagged the rapid advances being achieved in the catalysis science of metal catalysts [6,7]. The major reasons for the much slower development of the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalysts are (1) that mixed metal oxide catalysts are significantly more complex than metal-based catalysts (e.g., possible presence of multiple oxidation states, variable local coordination, coexisting bulk and surface phases as well as different surface termination functionalities such as MOH, M=O, or MOM) and (2) the need for the development of new spectroscopic methods that can determine such fundamental electronic and molecular structural details. The objective of this article is to review the growth of mixed metal oxide catalysis science over the past three decades and to assess the current status of this important area of catalysis. Zeolitic materials will not be discussed in this article since by definition their structures are made up from Al and Si TO4 units that are not metal oxides [8].

2. Development of spectroscopic instrumentation
2.1. 1950s1970s
The past three decades has seen a revolution in the development of spectroscopic catalyst characterization techniques and many of these instrumental advances have had significant impacts on the challenging catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials. These spectro- scopic instruments serve are our eyes into the sub- nanometer molecular world of catalytic metal oxide surfaces and their novel surface chemistry with different molecules.
Consequently, not surprisingly, many of the recent advances in catalysis science have paralleled the development of new spectroscopic instrumentation during this rapidly expanding period. There were several events prior to the past three decades that set the stage for the advances that occurred in this time period. Mapes and Eischens reported the first successful demonstration of in situ infrared (IR) spectro- scopic measurements of chemisorbed molecules on catalytic metals and zeolites in 1954 [11]. These groundbreaking studies showed that with IR spectroscopy it was possible to discriminate between surface Lewis and Bronsted acids by chemisorption of NH3 and measure the vibrational spectrum of NH3(ads) and NH4(ads) +, respectively. Lunsford and Kazasky were among the first catalysis researchers that were active in the 1960s in developing electron proton resonance (EPR) techniques for characterization of catalytic materials and surface intermediates [12]. It was shown by these and other researchers that were active in this area at the time that EPR can provide information about the presence and local coordination of paramagnetic species (e.g., Mo+5, V+4, Cr+5, Cr+3, etc.). Siegbahn also developed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the late 1950s and 1960s that allows determination of the surface region of catalytic materials [13]. These exciting developments in XPS led to the introduction of commercial XPS units in the 1970s [14].
Solid-state magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) and intense monochro- matic lasers were just being developed in the late 1960s.
However, the discovery of XRD at the beginning of the 20th century to determine long range order of crystalline phases dominated the available catalyst characterization arsenal due to its sound scientific development over the century.
This was the status of the spectroscopic characterization methods available to catalysis researchers 30 years ago.
These spectroscopic capabilities, however, were not developed enough to significantly advance the catalysis science of catalytic mixed metal oxide materials with the exception of XRD. Although IR provided information about chemisorbed molecules on oxide surfaces, it was not able to provide fundamental molecular structural information about the metal oxide catalytic active sites on surfaces because such vibrations are typically obscured by the strong bulk or oxide support vibrations in the region of interest, usually appearing below 1000 cm1, and many of the chemical probe molecules developed for metals only adsorbed with extreme difficulty on metal oxide surfaces (e.g., O2, H2, CO,etc.). The full potential of XPS was not fully tapped at that moment and EPR spectroscopy is only able to provide information about paramagnetic species that only represent a very small fraction, 1/100, of the total catalytic sites.
Furthermore, the small signals detected with EPR may not even be kinetically relevant in many cases or associated with the presence of impurities. It should also be noted that the escape depth of conventional XPS is typically 35 nm,which means that many layers of the mixed metal oxide material are simultaneously being sampled by this spectro- scopic technique and the surface component of the signal becomes diluted by the signal from the underlying layers.
Thus, catalysis scientists were not equipped at that point in time to fundamentally address the molecular nature of the catalytic active sites, especially surface sites that do not possess long range order, present in mixed metal oxide catalysts and the influence of different environments on their electronic and molecular structures.
2.2. 1970s1990s
This situation began to rapidly change during the 1970s and 1980s as several new electronic and molecular structural characterization techniques became available and were further advanced (intense monochromatic laser sources and faster detectors for Raman spectroscopy, high energy synchrotron X-ray sources for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), stronger magnetic fields for solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) and commercial instruments to measure UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) spectra. In contrast to XRD that requires long range order for signal detection, these spectroscopic techniques do not require long range order for signal detection and provide local electronic and molecular structural information.
Although these characterization techniques are bulk techni- ques that sample the entire sample volume rather than the surface, they are able to also yield surface information when the catalytic active component is highly dispersed (molecular sieves and supported metal oxides) in the catalyst sample. For example, the active metal oxide component is typically 100% dispersed throughout the sample volume in molecular sieves,either inframework orasextra-frameworksites[8], andonthe surface of supported metal oxide catalysts [7]. Recent advances, to be discussed below, have further extended these bulk characterization techniques to also provide surface information about bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials.
It cannot be overemphasized, even in the beginning of the 21st century, that heterogeneous catalysis is a surface
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
80 phenomenon between molecules and exposed catalytic active sites, rather than sites imbedded within bulk structures.
Consequently, fundamental knowledge about the catalytic events at exposed catalytic active sites, on solid surfaces in contact with either gas or liquid phases, is critical to understanding catalytic events. It is, however, also important to determine if the nature of the surface catalytic active sites is also being influenced by the underlying bulk oxide material.
In all cases, fundamental catalytic surface electronic and molecular structural information is of paramount importance for understanding and advancing catalysis science.
2.3. Raman spectroscopy
Advances in Raman spectroscopy, intense monochro- matic laser excitation sources with improved monochro- mators and detectors, allowed for the first time, to be confirmed a few years later by Chan et al. [15], the detection of surface metal oxide species for supported MoO3 [16], WO3 [17], V2O5 [18,19], and Re2O7 [20] catalysts during the latter part of the 1970s. This was rapidly followed by reports of in situ Raman studies in the early 1980s where the environment of metal oxide catalytic materials could be controlled (gas phase composition, pressure and tempera- ture) [15,2124]. The pioneering in situ Raman publication of Chan et al. in 1984 [15] conclusively demonstrated that surface metal oxide species are indeed being detected since they are reversibly changing their structures when exposed to hydrated and dehydrated conditions.
2.4. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
The theory of XAS was in a state of confusion from 1920 to 1970 [25]. The groundbreaking theoretical paper by Sayers et al. [26] changed everything showing that the Fourier transform of the EXAFS with respect to the photoelectron wave number should peak at distances corresponding to nearest neighbor coordination shells of atoms.
The accessibility of more intense X-rays at synchrotron radiation sources, three or more orders of magnitude, was greatly enhanced several years after the potential of EXAFS was first shown [27]. The development of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) techniques, such as XANES and EXAFS, to characterize catalytic materials followed these early developments. The emphasis of the early studies, however, was on supported metal catalysts and not on metal oxide catalytic materials [26]. Several XANES and EXAFS publications began to appear in the catalysis literature for metal oxide catalytic materials during the mid-1980s and early 1990s (see discussion on supported metal oxide catalysts). XANES provides local coordination symmetry and oxidation states of metal oxides and EXAFS provides more detailed local structural information (MO bond lengths and coordination sphere of the cations). These structural details nicely complement the Raman and IR vibrational spectroscopic structural information already available at the time and allowed for surface metal oxide molecular structural assignments.
The past few years have again seen significant advances in XAS with the development of soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy [2830]. Soft XAS allows tuning of the electron kinetic energy and the corresponding sampling depth down to 0.5 nm, which is a dramatic improvement of the 35 nm escape depth of conventional XPS instrumenta- tion. In fact, the information from different sample depths can be changed by changing the photon energy. Similar to XPS, soft XAS provides electronic structural information,however, pressures of several Torr are only feasible and allow measurement under very mild reaction conditions.
The unique surface sensitivity, variable sample depth analysis and in situ capability at mild pressures of soft
XAS
assures that this new catalyst characterization technique will be vigorously developed and make significant contributions in the coming years.
2.5. Solid-state NMR
Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was also being developed during the 1980s, and still continues to be advanced with new methodologies, as a catalyst structural characterization technique to provide local structural details about cations in metal oxide catalytic systems and more recently the surface reaction intermediates [31]. Solid-state NMR can only detect nuclei that are diamagnetic and the presence of paramagnetic cations (Fe+3, Mo+5, Cr+5, Mo+5, W+5, V+4, Cr+3, etc.) interferes with the measurement of NMR signals from diamagnetic cations (7Li, 11B, 23Na, 27Al,29Si, 31P, 51V, 67Zn, 71Ga, 95Mo, 133Cs, as well as 1H, 13C,15N and 17O). Most of the emphasis of solid-state NMR during this period was on zeolitic materials because of the intense activity in this area of oxide catalysis [8]. However,throughout the 1980s and 1990s the application of solid- state
NMR
characterization was continuously being expanded. Solid-state 51V measurements were first reported for bulk mixed metal vanadates by the Russian Boreskov Institute group [3234] and first reported by Eckert and Wachs [35,36] for supported vanadium oxide catalysts under in situ conditions. During the 1990s, solid-state NMR studies were further expanded to other NMR active nuclei of supported metal oxide catalysts 31P [37], 95Mo [38], 29Si [39], molecular sieves [40] and bulk mixed metal oxides [41,42].
2.6. UVvis DRS
UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was also being discovered by catalysis researchers in the 1970s and several early reviews appear in the literature [4345]. It was not until the 1980s and mid-1990s, however, that UVvis DRS of metal oxides started to be intensively developed by catalysis researchers involved with metal oxide catalytic
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
81 materials [46,47]. Che and co-workers demonstrated that the UVvis absorption spectrum of MoOx species changes with the number of Mo species in an oxide cluster [48]. Weber extended these findings to quantitatively determine the Mo oxide cluster band gap, Eg, and demonstrated that it correlates inversely with the number of bridging MoOMo bonds of the Mo cations [49]. In addition, UVvis can also monitor the extent of reduction of fully oxidized cations due to ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) and the appearance of reduced cations arising from dd transitions [50]. It was not until the mid-1990s, however, that UVvis DRS spectra of metal oxide could be quantitatively analyzed within a theoretical framework.
2.7. High resolution-transmission electron microscopy
Significant advances in high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were also occurring during this period and provided atomic resolution images of catalytic active sites under controlled environments (<10 torr) [51,52] Most recently, Hansen and co-workers were further expanding such studies to a wide range of catalytic materials and reaction conditions [5355]. Most of the HR-TEM studies focused on supported metal catalysts and supported metal sulfide catalysts because of the strong contrast between the metallic component and the oxide support [56]. Several attempts were made in the early 1990s to image the two-dimensional surface metal oxide species present in supported metal oxide catalysts, but the lack of long range order in the surface metal oxide monolayers, and the lack of contrast between the surface metal oxide phase and the underlying oxide support has still not allowed for the imaging of the amorphous surface metal oxide monolayers.Furthermore, it was discovered with HR-TEM in 1995 that the surface of the bulk VPO catalyst possesses an amorphous skin [57], and more recent HR-TEM studies have revealed that similar situations also take place on the surface of other bulk mixed metal oxide catalysts [58].
2.8. Chemical probe molecules and reactions
Smart chemical probe molecules should be able to (1) quantitatively determine the number of exposed catalytic active sites, (2) discriminate among the different type of surface catalytic active sites (redox, acidic and basic), and (3) provide quantitative information about the relative reaction rates on the different type of surface catalytic sites.
Furthermore, it is also important to be able to (4) discriminate between the surface Lewis and Bronsted sites and (5) rank the strength or catalytic rates of the different acidic and basic sites. Although one universal smart chemical probe molecule does not exist, the desired information can usually be obtained by the use of at least two chemical probe molecules. For example, methanol oxidation over oxide surfaces primarily forms H2CO over the surface redox sites, dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3) over surface acidic sites and primarily COx and some H2CO over surface basic sites. Furthermore, methyl formate (MF, CH3OOCH) forms on adjacent surface redoxbasic sites and dimethoxy methane (DMM, (CH3O)2CH2) on adjacent surface redoxacidic sites. Additional surface chemical details can be obtained by basic chemical probe molecules that discriminate between surface Lewis and Bronsted acid sites as well as their corresponding surface basic sites. The CH3OH chemical probe molecule, however, appears to be emerging as the smart chemical probe molecule for metal oxide surfaces since it can readily provide information about items 13 [59].
2.9. Summary
The tremendous advances in spectroscopic characteriza- tion instrumentation and data analysis over the past three decades have allowed catalysis researchers to monitor many more fundamental catalytic details that have led to new concepts, as well as to question old concepts, for catalysis of mixed metal oxides. The discussion below will emphasize the surface electronic and structural aspects of different mixed metal oxide catalytic systems. The one component metal oxide phases, supported metal oxides, and molecular sieves and bulk mixed metal oxide systems will only be discussed because of the authors active involvement in these catalysis research areas during this dynamic period in catalysis science development of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials. Consequently, many of the selected examples will come from the authors own research experience with mixed metal oxide catalysts over the past 25 years (19792004).
3. One component metal oxide phases
It is important to initially discuss one component metal oxide phases before addressing the more complex mixed metal oxide catalytic materials. One component metal oxides can crystallize with different morphologies (iso- tropic,anisotropic or remain amorphous) and local coordination. All one component metal oxide phases will crystallize at elevated temperatures (provide XRD detect- able crystalline phases), but many phases may remain amorphous at modest calcination temperatures (e,g., SiO2, Al2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, etc.). The majority of one component metal oxides crystallize with an isotropic morphology (without preferential orientation) [60], and surface terminate with MOH, MOM, M=O or M-[ ] functionalities where M-[ ] represents an oxygen vacancy [6164].
Bulk crystalline structures are usually determined with XRD and the surface functionalities are typically deter- mined with vibrational spectroscopic methods such as IR and more recently also by Raman. For example, amorphous isotropic SiO2 terminates with isolated SiOH, hydroxyl pairs of (SiOH)2 and Si(OH)2, and bridging SiOSi
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
82 bonds [65] and isotropic Nb2O5, crystalline as well as amorphous, terminates with NbOH, NbONb and Nb=O bonds [61]. In the case of crystalline isotropic Cr2O3, both surface Cr+3 and Cr+6 oxidation states are present and the surface terminates with CrOH, CrOCr and Cr=O functionalities [63]. Surfaces that terminate with M=O bonds typically possess M+7, M+6 and M+5 cations, and surfaces with M+4, M+3, M+2 and M+1 cations typically do not possess enough electrons to form terminal M=O bonds and terminate with MOH or MOM bonds. Furthermore,most low valent oxides typically only exhibit surface Lewis acidity and most high valent oxides typically contain both surface Lewis and Bronsted acidity [66,67].
It is important to emphasize that these various surface functionalities usually possess different surface reactivity properties. For example, when metal oxides and molecules are adsorbed on the SiO2 surface the anchoring sites are the more reactive isolated surface SiOH groups and not the less reactive bridging SiOSi and adjacent hydrogen bonded surface hydroxls [68]. In the case of Al2O3, multiple surface hydroxyls are present as well as oxygen vacancies or defects [69,70]. The different surface hydroxyls vary by the number of Al sites and Al coordination, which determine their surface chemistry characteristics [65]. The isolated AlOH sites are the most basic and the bridging AlOHAl sites are the most acidic. As for SiO2, the isolated AlOH sites are the most reactive when metal oxides or molecules are adsorbed on the alumina surface. The Al-[ ] surface defects possess Lewis acidity character [71]. Furthermore, the Cr+6 terminal Cr=O bonds on the surface of crystalline Cr2O3 undergo redox processes in reactive environments because of the ability of such sites to readily become reduced to lower oxidation states and lose their O atoms to reducing reactants.
Some metal oxides crystallize with an anisotropic morphology such as platelets [60,64]. For example, both crystalline MoO3 and V2O5 crystallize with the platelet morphology where the terminal M=O and bridging MOM functionalities are present on the basal planes, and the terminal MOH predominates on the edge plains [64,72].
Sleight and co-workers nicely demonstrated that the MoO3 basal plane containing the terminal Mo=O and bridging Mo OMo bonds do not chemisorb CH3OH and that the surface MoOH sites on the edges react with CH3OH to form surface MoOCH3 and H2O [73]. The same platelet morphology and relative activity pattern was also found for crystalline V2O5 and ZnO when exposed to CH3OH [74 76].
For platelet morphology, consequently, the number of catalytic active sites of such materials tends to only be a small fraction of the total surface metal oxide sites. These findings reflect the structure sensitivity of metal oxide active sites to different crystalline planes, and the specific surface functionalities present on the different planes. For example,the surface M=O functionality present in crystalline MoO3 and V2O5 is catalytically relatively inactive relative to the surface MOH functionality in these catalysts. Theoretical calculations on crystalline V2O5 have also confirmed that the surface M=O functionality is too stable relative to other surface functionalities for catalytic reactions [77].
As can be concluded from the above discussion, catalytic metal oxides are much more complex than the correspond- ing metal-based catalysts because they can terminate with multiple surface functionalities and exhibit several cation oxidation states.
4. Supported metal oxide systems
4.1. Surface metal oxide phases
Supported metal oxide catalysts are created when an active metal oxide component is deposited on an oxide support [7]. The active acidic metal oxides (e.g., ReOx, CrOx, MoOx, WOx, VOx, NbOx, TaOx, etc.) usually anchor to the oxide substrate by preferentially titrating the basic surface hydroxls of oxide supports [78]. The active basic metal oxides (FeOx, NiOx, CoOx, etc.), however, usually anchor to the oxide substrate by preferentially titrating the surface Lewis acid sites, such as surface M-[ ] vacancies, of the oxide support [79]. For many supported metal oxide systems, the active component is usually present as a 100% dispersed surface metal oxide phase (typically when Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 are used as the oxide supports) below monolayer surface coverage. Less than 100% dispersion is usually obtained for metal oxides on the SiO2 support because of the lower reactivity and more acidic character of its surface hydroxyls [80]. In addition, some active basic metal oxide components do not interact strongly with the different oxide functionalities present on oxide supports and, consequently, do not disperse very well to form nanocrystalline phases (e.g., MnOx, CeOx, etc.) [81].
The electronic and molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species that are present on oxide supports have received enormous attention over the past three decades because of (1) their industrial significance as catalysts for numerous applications [82] and (2) their ability to serve as model mixed metal oxide catalytic system due to the essentially completely dispersed state.
4.2. Molecular structures of dehydrated surface vanadium
oxide species The supported vanadium oxide catalytic systems have probably received the most attention in the catalysis literature during this period because of intense interest in their multiple industrial applications and will be the focus of this section for brevity. The surface nature of the supported VOx catalysts was clearly revealed by the application of several ground breaking in situ spectroscopic investigations during the 1980s: Raman [15], XANES/EXAFS [83], solid- state 51V NMR [35,36] and IR [84]. Both the solid-state 51V NMR and the XANES/EXAFS measurements revealed VO4
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
83 coordination for the dehydrated surface VOx species. The coincidence of the Raman and IR bands from the terminal V=O bond could only occur if only one terminal bond was present for the dehydrated surface VOx species, and was further confirmed by 18O216O2 studies as well as IR studies in the overtone region [72]. The presence of bridging VO V bonds was readily detected with Raman [85] and the polymeric nature of the dehydrated surface species were confirmed by complementary UVvis measurements [86].
The dehydrated surface VOx species are usually exclusively present as isolated surface O=V(OS)3 species at low surface coverage and the extent of polymerization increases with surface VOx coverage that can reach as much as 100% polymerized species at monolayer surface coverage [87].
Above monolayer surface coverage, crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles form on top of the surface vanadia monolayer because all the exposed and reactive support surface hydroxyls have been consumed in anchoring the two- dimensional surface vanadia phase [78]. The local coordina- tion present in bulk V2O5 is made of a polymeric VO5 unit with monooxo terminal V=O bond [60]. The platelet morphology and inactive basal planes of crystalline V2O5 result in very few new catalytic active sites and actually tend to decrease the number of exposed surface VOx by covering them. Thus, the spectroscopic studies revealed that there are three distinct dehydrated surface vanadia sites on supported vanadia catalysts as a function of surface coverage: isolated VO4, polymeric VO4 and V2O5 nanocrystals (see Fig. 1).
4.3. Surface chemistry of supported vanadium oxide
species The surface chemistry of the different supported vanadia species were chemically probed by CH3OH oxidation to H2CO [88,89]. The catalytic results were quantified per surface vanadia species as turnover frequencies (TOF = - number of H2CO molecules formed/surface V/s) because the surface vanadia species were 100% dispersed (con- firmed with Raman). The methanol oxidation catalytic results showed that the surface vanadia species exclusively behaved as redox sites since they yielded redox products.
Furthermore, the catalytic contribution of the nanocrystal- line V2O5 phase was minimal primarily because of the low number of active surface edge sites present and that the overall catalytic performance was dominated by the surface vanadia phase. The TOF values for the isolated and polymeric surface VO4 species, however, were essentially identical since the TOF value did not change with surface vanadia coverage and showed that only one surface VO4 unit was required for the reaction. In subsequent years, this was also shown to be the case for oxidation reactions requiring only one O atom or two electrons: SO2 oxidation to SO3 [90], C2H6 oxidation to C2H4 [91] and C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 [90,92,93] as shown in Fig. 2 below.
Oxidation reactions requiring more than one O atom or two

84 Fig. 1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts consist of (a) isolated, (b) polymeric surface mono-oxo VO4 species and (c) crystalline V2O5 nano- particles.
Fig. 2. (a) Isolated and polymeric surface mono-oxo VO4 species present at low and high surface coverage, respectively, exhibit the same specific catalytic activity, TOF, for two electron reactions that involve one O atom.
(b) Oxidation reactions requiring more than one O atom or two electrons, or multiple surface VO4 sites, exhibit increasing specific catalytic activity, TOF, with surface coverage. electrons, however, require multiple surface VO4 sites and the TOF increases with increasing surface VO4 coverage as shown below: NH3 SCR of NO to N2 [94], n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [95], and C3H6 oxidation to acrolein [96].
4.4. Oxidation states of surface vanadium oxide species
In situ Raman and UVvis measurements during these oxidation reactions revealed that the surface VO4 species are almost entirely present in the oxidized V+5 state during these differing reaction conditions and, consequently, only trace amounts of reduced surface V+4/V+3 species are present [92,97]. The relative catalytic contributions of the different surface vanadia oxidation states for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde were examined by Vohs and co- workers [98101]. By controlling the extent of reduction of the surface phase, the following trend was observed: V+5 > V+4  V+3. Thus, the catalytic active site is the fully oxidized surface VO4 sites and not the reduced surface vanadia sites. This conclusion is contrary to what has repeatedly been proposed in the catalysis literature by many researchers over the years.
4.5. Reaction kinetics and mechanism
Most of the oxidation reactions over the supported vanadia species occur via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism,where the participating oxygen comes from the catalyst, the surface vanadia species in this case, and not from gas phase molecular O2 (LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism) [102].
In other words, the only kinetic function of gas phase molecular O2 is to rapidly oxidize the reduced surface V+4 and V+3 sites back to V+5. This was demonstrated for CH3OH oxidation to H2CO, requiring only one oxygen atom to proceed, by performing CH3OH-temperature programmed surface reaction (TPSR) spectroscopy experi- ments where identical results were obtained both in the presence and absence of gas phase O2 [103]. This was also shown to occur for oxidation of CH3SH to H2CO and SO2 that requires three surface oxygen atoms to proceed [103].
When the experiments were extended to the more demanding oxidation reaction of thiophene oxidation to maleic anhydride and SO2, requiring six oxygen atoms, the maleic anhydride was not formed in the absence of gas phase molecular O2 [104]. This reveals that thiophene oxidation to maleic anhydride requires more oxygen than can be provided by the surface vanadia monolayer and that additional gas phase O2 is also required to complete this demanding oxidation reaction. Thus, thiophene oxidation to maleic anhydride and SO2 proceeds by a combined Mars van Krevelen and LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism because of the high oxygen requirement for this reaction to proceed over the surface vanadia monolayer. Although Mars and van Krevelen originally only applied their kinetics to oxidation reactions over bulk metal oxide catalysts supplying bulk lattice oxygen, the current studies with supported vanadium oxide catalysts demonstrate that a surface Marsvan Krevelen mechanism can also operates for supported redox metal oxide catalysts supplying oxygen from surface metal oxide species.
4.6. Catalytic active oxygen species
The catalytically active surface VO4 species possess three different functionalities (terminal V=O, bridging VOV and bridging VO-support bonds) and their relative catalytic contributions for oxidation reactions were examined for methanol oxidation [89]. The bridging VOV bonds are not kinetically critical since the catalytic TOF value does not increase with increasing surface coverage. In addition, in situ UVvis DRS measurements reveal that there is a slight preference for reduction of the polymeric surface VO4 species over the isolated surface VO4 species during steady- state oxidation reaction conditions [92]. Although the terminal V=O bond of the dehydrated surface vanadia species slightly shifted to higher wavenumbers with increasing surface coverage due to lateral interactions and polymerization, the corresponding catalytic TOF values were essentially identical. Thus, the invariance of the TOF value with surface vanadia coverage shows that the bridging VOV bonds and the terminal V=O bonds are not involved in the kinetically relevant rate-determing-step, and impli- cates the bridging VO-support bond as the catalytic active site. This observation is a general one since similar trends are also observed for numerous oxidation reactions over supported vanadium oxide catalysts: C2H6 oxidation to C2H4 [91], C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 [92,93], SO2 oxidation to SO3 [90]. This conclusion is contrary to what has been repeatedly proposed in the catalysis literature for the past three decades and is consistent with the inactivity of the crystalline V2O5 basal plane for methanol oxidation that contains both the terminal V=O and bridging VOV bonds [74,75].
The contribution of the bridging VO-support bond to methanol oxidation was examined by varying the specific oxide support for the surface vanadia phase [89]. Essentially,the same isolated and polymeric surface VO4 species were present on the different oxide supports, with the exception of SiO2 that only contained isolated surface VO4 species due to the low surface vanadia coverage achievable on this surface [105]. It was found that the steady-state catalytic TOF value increased by a factor of 103 as the oxide support was varied: SiO2  Al2O3  Nb2O5/Ta2O5 < TiO2 < ZrO2 < CeO2. This trend was found to inversely correlate with the electronegativity of the different support cations: higher TOF values corresponded to lower support cation electro- negativity. This dramatic trend suggests that a lower electronegativity of the support cation results in a higher electron density on the bridging VO-support bond, which enhances the specific rate of the redox cycle of this catalytic active site (Fig. 3) [106].

4.7. Influence of the oxide support structure
It is of great fundamental and applied interest to determine if the specific oxide support phase affects the molecular structure and catalytic performance of surface vanadia species. To investigate this important issue,supported vanadia catalysts were synthesized on different TiO2 phases: rutile, anatase, brookite and B [107]. The TiO2 supports were laboratory synthesized and their surfaces were analyzed with XPS to confirm that their surfaces were free of any significant impurities. Both Raman and solid- state 51V NMR characterization studies revealed that the same dehydrated surface VO4 species are present on the different titania support structures, which were synthesized by an identical method (incipient wetness impregnation of a V-triisopropoxide/isopropanol solution in an N2 environ- ment, dried in an N2 environment at RT overnight, dried in an N2 environment at 100 8C overnight, calcined in N2 at 350 8C and subsequently calcined in air at 450 8C for 2 h).
The catalytic properties were chemically probed by the redox methanol oxidation reaction and the TOF values for the different TiO2 supported vanadia catalysts were essentially invariant and not dependent on the specific titania structure.
The above findings are in contrast to many claims in the catalysis literature over the past 30 years that specific oxide support structures impart enhanced catalytic properties to the catalytic active surface vanadia sites. The reason for this confusion is that commercial oxide supports are synthesized by different processes, which might introduce different surface oxide additives. For example, TiO2(anatase) is produced by a low temperature sulfate process and its surface is subsequently covered with significant amounts of surface KOx and POx species to retard its photocatalysis activity when applied as a pigment [108]. TiO2(rutile) is produced by a high temperature process involving the combustion of TiCl4 and 1% AlCl3 is added to accelerate the anatase to rutile transformation kinetics. The solubility of AlOx in the TiO2(rutile) lattice, however, is only 1/2% and the residual AlOx segregates to the surface of TiO2(rutile) particle. Thus, pigment grade commercial TiO2(anatase) and TiO2(rutile) possess very different compositions and surface properties. This is the origin for the many contradictory claims in the catalysis literature over the years with regard to the unique characteristics of a specific oxide support phase.
4.8. Influence of the oxide support dimension
The effect of the oxide support size upon the molecular structure of the surface VO4 species and its catalytic performance was examined for the supported V2O5/ TiO2(anatase) system [109]. The standard TiO2(anatase) support material possessed 30 nm particles, 55 m2/g, and the small TiO2(anatase) nanoparticles were synthesized in an inert silica matrix to retard the growth of the titania phase during calcination. HR-TEM analysis showed that the dimension of the resulting TiO2(anatase) nanoparticles varied between 2 and 8 nm as a function of the titania content for the TiO2/SiO2 materials.
The electronic structure, the band gap (Eg), of the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were determined with UVvis DRS measurements that showed that the TiO2(anatase) band gap was slightly enhanced for the smallest TiO2(a- natase) nanoparticles [110]. These different sized TiO2(a- natase) supports were subsequently impregnated with a vanadia precursor to synthesize the supported V2O5/ TiO2(anatase) catalysts [109]. The inert nature of the SiO2 support assured that all the vanadia was coordinated to the more active TiO2(anatase) surfaces. This was confirmed by in situ Raman measurements of the final calcined supported V2O5/TiO2(anatase) catalysts that revealed that the vanadia component was 100% dispersed, no crystalline V2O5 present, and that the surface VO4 species were indeed exclusively coordinated to the TiO2(anatase) nanoparticles in the TiO2/SiO2 catalyst system. The Raman band for the surface vanadia on TiO2 occurs 1031 cm1 and that for surface vanadia on SiO2 is found at 1041 cm1, and typical resolution is 12 cm1. The relatively constant Raman band at 1031 cm1 revealed that the surface VO4 species possessed the same molecular structure on the different TiO2(anatase) particles and was independent of particle size.
For the 1% V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 catalyst samples, the surface VO4 species are essentially present as isolated species. The catalytic TOF values of the isolated surface VO4 species on the different sized TiO2(anatase) particles were found to slightly decrease with decreasing TiO2(anatase) particle size. There may have also been a minor contribution to the TOF values for the larger TiO2 particles from some heat transfer limitations since the amount of inert SiO2 deceased in the samples as the TiO2 content and particle size was increased. Nevertheless, these fundamental experiments with molecularly engineered model supported metal oxide
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
86 Fig. 3. The catalytic activity per surface vanadia site varies inversely with the support cation electronegativity. catalysts demonstrate that the catalytic activity of surface redox sites are not enhanced as the oxide support dimension is reduced to the nanoscale size. These significant findings demonstrate, for the first time, that catalytic redox reactions are not enhanced at the nanoscale relative to their larger conventional counterparts. The reason for this finding is that as the TiO2 particle size becomes very small, 13 nm, the titania band gap slightly increases [70], which decreases electron delocalization on the titania support and to the catalytically active surface VO4 sites that require electrons for the redox process.
4.9. Molecularly engineered model supported metal oxide
catalysts The above catalytic trend was further examined by molecularly engineering model well-defined bilayered catalysts on a catalytic relatively inert SiO2 support [109,111,112]. The first layer of the model bilayered catalysts was synthesized by grafting two-dimensional surface oxide phases of TiOx, ZrOx or AlOx onto the silica support. The second layer of surface VOx was then grafted onto the first oxide layers.
Raman characterization confirmed that crystalline phases of TiO2, ZrO2 or V2O5 were not present in any of the catalysts and that all the components were present as two-dimensional amorphous phases. Solid-state 27Al NMR confirmed that the surface AlOx species possessed AlO4 coordination as in zeolites [113]. XANES confirmed that the surface TiOx monolayer consisted of polymeric TiO5 coordinated units that transformed to TiO6 coordinated units when the surface VOx was grafted onto the silica supported titania monolayer. The grafting of the surface VOx species onto the surface titania monolayer is reflected in the appearance of new Raman bands associated with bridging VOTi bonds at 650 (vs) and 250 (Greek letter delta) cm1 and the change in the surface titania coordination upon grafting of the surface VOx species onto the surface titania monolayer [109]. Corresponding Raman, UVvis DRS and XANES measurements showed that the surface vanadia species were present as isolated O=V(OS)3 species where
S
represents the underlying oxides (Fig. 4) [109,111,112].
The chemical reactivity of these bilayered supported vanadia catalysts was probed with CH3OH oxidation and the TOF values were found to increase by a factor of 20 in replacing some of the bridging VOSi bonds with bridging VOZr, VOTi or VOAl bonds. These fundamental results with the model well-defined bilayered catalysts clearly confirm the influence of the support cation electronegativity on the reactivity of bridging VO S bond.
4.10. Operando spectroscopy
Additional fundamental insights into this interesting phenomenon were obtained from operando IR-reactivity studies during methanol oxidation [114]. Operando spectro- scopy was recently coined by Miguel A. Banares to describe simultaneous spectroscopic and online activity/selectivity measurements [115]. The advantage provided by operando spectroscopy studies is that molecular events occurring at the catalytic active sites can be directly related to the resultant catalytic activity/selectivity behavior for a given reaction. In addition, operando spectroscopy studies also allow for the direct determination of kinetic and thermo- dynamic parameters that are difficult to extract from conventional steady-state catalytic studies. For example,methanol oxidation to formaldehyde proceeds via two critical kinetic steps [116]dissociative chemisorption of CH3OH, which breaks the OH bond upon adsorption, and decomposition of the resulting surface CH3OV intermedi- ate to H2CO, which breaks a CH bond of the surface methoxy intermediate, as shown: CH3OH  VOS $ CH3OV  HOSKads (1) CH3OV ! H2CO  HVkrds (2) The operando IR-reactivity studies allowed for the independent quantitative determination of the adsorption equilibrium constant, Kads, and the kinetic rate constant for the rate-determining-step, krds, for the surface VO4 species on different oxide supports [114]. It was found that the thermodynamic equilibrium adsorption constant, Kads, was relatively invariant as the oxide support electronegativity was changed. The kinetic rate constant, krds, however, varied significantly as the oxide support electronegativity was changed. Thus, it appears that the dramatic variation in the TOF for methanol oxidation over different supported vanadia catalysts is primarily related to changes in the kinetic krds rate constant and not changes in the thermo- dynamic Kads equilibrium adsorption constant.
4.11. Catalytic promoters
Secondary metal oxides are many times added to supported metal oxide catalysts to further enhance the performance, activity or selectivity, of the catalytic active sites. For example, supported V2O5/TiO2 SCR catalysts for NOx reduction with NH3 to innocuous N2 and H2O are typically promoted with WO3 [94,117,118]. Raman and IR studies showed that both the vanadia and tungsten oxide components are present as surface VOx and WOx species on the TiO2 support below monolayer surface coverage [119].
Methanol oxidation over the unpromoted and tungsten oxide
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
87 Fig. 4. Schematic of bilayered V2O5/SOx/SiO2 catalysts where S=Zr, Ti or Al. promoted V2O5/TiO2 catalysts revealed that the redox TOF for the surface vanadia species is not affected by the presence of the acidic surface WOx species (as shown in Fig. 5). The NO and NH3 SCR reaction, however, is significantly enhanced in the presence of the acidic surface WOx species as shown. The different response of the methanol oxidation redox reaction and the SCR reaction is related to the different surface chemical requirements of each reaction. CH3OH oxidation to H2CO requires only one surface redox sites while two sites are required for the adsorption of NH3 and NO in the bimolecular SCR reaction:a surface acid site to adsorb the basic ammonia and to reduce an adjacent redox site to generate the vacancy required for the adsorption of NO since NO will not chemisorb on a fully oxidized redox site. Consequently, the presence of an acidic surface WOx site does not affect the unimolecular CH3OH oxidation redox reaction and does promote the bimolecular NO and NH3 SCR reaction. Additional studies with molecularly designed model catalysts revealed that surface Bronsted acid sites are more effective promoters for the SCR reaction than surface Lewis acid sites, which also promote the SCR reaction [94,117,120]. The unimolecular SO2 oxidation to SO3 was also found to behave similarly to the methanol redox oxidation reaction over the same catalysts [90]. These fundamental studies revealed that (1) the surface VO4 species supported on TiO2 possess the same redox surface chemistry in the presence and absence of secondary acidic surface metal oxide promoters, and (2) the secondary surface metal oxide additive only becomes a promoter depending on the special chemical requirements of a given catalytic reaction. In addition, these fundamental studies also demonstrate the enormous potential of molecularly engineered supported metal oxide catalyst systems to determine, on a molecular level, the nature of the catalytic active sites for specific catalytic reactions over mixed metal oxide catalysts.
4.12. Catalytic poisons
In industrial environments, metal oxide catalytic materi- als are exposed to impurities that may adversely impact their catalytic performance. A typical catalyst poison for certain oxidation catalytic reactions (e.g., CH3OH oxidation to H2CO and SCR of NO with NH3) is potassium oxide.
Characterization studies have shown that potassium oxide directly interacts with the surface vanadia species present in supported vanadia catalysts by altering the bond lengths of the surface VO4 species [89,121,122]. The direct interaction of the basic surface KOx species with the surface VO4 species results in more stable and less reducible oxygen species [89,122]. Consequently, the TOF values for all redox reactions over mixed metal oxide catalysts become significantly diminished in the presence of basic potassium oxide. For some catalytic redox reactions over mixed metal oxides, however, the basic surface KOx species may also titrate the strong acid sites that are responsible for undesirable side reactions. Thus, similar to the addition of acidic surface metal oxides, basic surface metal oxide additives can be viewed as either promoters or poisons for a specific mixed metal oxide catalytic system depending on the special chemical requirements of a given catalytic reaction.
4.13. Spontaneous dispersion of metal oxides
It was demonstrated in the early 1980s that one crystalline metal oxide component may thermally spread as a surface MOx species over a secondary metal oxide substrate above the Tammann temperature
(TTAM   1
2TMP where TMP is the metal oxide melting point) of the spreading metal oxide component [123126].
This was nicely illustrated by Knozinger and co-workers with in situ Raman experiments following the thermal spreading of MoOx onto different oxide supports [127]. The driving force for this surface wetting of metal oxides is the lower surface free energy of the final supported metal oxide system. The hydroxylated oxide support surface possesses a much higher surface free energy than the terminal M=O bonds formed in the surface metal oxide monolayer. The kinetics of this spreading, however, is controlled by the mobility or surface diffusion of the spreading metal oxide component [125]. It was subsequently discovered that metal oxides can also become dispersed onto oxide supports at temperatures much lower than even the Tammann tempera- ture by interaction with reactive molecules that may be present under reaction conditions, and this has been referred to as reaction induced dispersion [128]. The metal oxides that have relatively low Tammann temperatures and,consequently, disperse at typical catalyst synthesis and reaction temperatures, 100600 8C, follow this trend with increasing TTAM temperature: CrO3 < Re2O7 < V2O5 < MoO3 < WO3. Thus, it is much easier to disperse CrO3 than WO3 on oxide supports and also accounts for the
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
88 Fig. 5. The addition of acidic surface WOx species to supported V2O5/TiO2 promotes the SCR reaction, but not the redox CH3OH oxidation reaction. presence of crystalline WO3 nanoparticles typically present before monolayer surface coverage is reached [129]. Metal oxides, however, will not disperse on SiO2 because of the low reactivity of its surface. Although crystalline Cr2O3 has a very high TTAM, it is also found to readily disperse at modest temperatures because of the presence of mobile surface Cr+6 species on this Cr+3 crystalline solid [128].
Metal oxides with TTAM > 600 8C can also disperse at temperatures greater than their Tammann temperature, but such elevated temperatures can also adversely affect the BET of the oxide support.
4.14. Thermal stabilization of oxide supports
Some commercial catalytic applications operate at extremely elevated temperatures of 7001000 8C (e.g.,reforming and partial oxidation reactions to generate synthesis gas, catalytic combustion, automotive catalytic converters, etc.) where stabilization of the oxide support BET surface area is critical to the economic viability of the catalytic technology. In such circumstances, it is critical to be able to stabilize the oxide support against thermal sintering and loss of BET surface area during the lifetime of the catalyst. It has been discovered over the years that the addition of certain surface oxide species to oxide supports can dramatically retard the thermal sintering of oxide supports. Interestingly, the effective surface oxide additives tend to be those oxides that possess very high Tammann temperatures and surface oxide additives that exhibit low Tammann temperatures tend to accelerate the sintering of the oxide support [130]. These fundamental findings suggest that (1) the sintering process initiates at oxide surfaces, (2) less mobile surface oxide additives retard the sintering process by titrating the surface sites responsible for initiating sintering, and (3) more mobile surface oxide additives enhance the sintering process by accelerating the condensa- tion of surface hydroxyls and/or reactions of oxide defects.
Thus, oxide sintering is initiated by surface phenomena and,consequently, can be moderated by the addition of surface oxide additives.
4.15. Catalyst synthesis methods
A significant portion of mixed metal oxide catalysis literature has been devoted to different catalyst preparation methods and, on occasion, the proposed unique surface metal oxide species that result from specific synthesis methods. Such conclusions are, however, at odds with the discovery of spontaneous dispersion of metal oxides that reveals that the final surface metal oxide species are the thermodynamically stable state and can even be formed when beginning from physical mixtures of the crystalline metal oxide and the oxide support [123,125,126]. To further investigate this issue, a series of supported MoO3/TiO2 and V2O5/TiO2 catalysts were prepared via all the different methods found in the literature as well as from many international laboratories [107]. The molecular structures of all the supported metal oxide catalysts were analyzed with Raman spectroscopy and found to be independent of the preparation method and even the different support types.
These same findings were also made with supported surface MoOx species on SiO2 that were made by different synthesis methods with SiO2 materials [131]. Differences in the surface MoOx structure were only observed when impurities were present in the starting oxide support material [132].
Thus, the molecular structures of surface metal oxide species on oxide supports are independent of the synthesis methods,which is counter to what has been proposed in the literature for too many years.
Although the final surface metal oxide structures on SiO2 are also independent of the particular catalyst synthesis method, aqueous versus non-aqueous and precursor salt, the partitioning between the surface MOx species and their corresponding crystalline MOx nanoparticles is significantly affected by the specific preparation methods [80,86,110 112,133,134]. This difference is related to the number and reactivity of the surface hydroxyls on the SiO2 support as well as the low pH at point of zero charge of the SiO2 support in aqueous environments (pH 23). In aqueous preparation conditions above the pH at PZC, the SiO2 support is negatively charged and repulses the negatively charged metal oxide anions. In aqueous synthesis conditions below the pH at PZC, the SiO2 support is positively charged and readily reacts with the metal oxide anions. The very low pH requirements to disperse surface metal oxides on SiO2 is responsible for the different partitioning between surface MOx species and crystalline MOx nanoparticles on SiO2 supports typically observed in the catalysis literature.
4.16. Summary
The fundamental spectroscopic studies over the past three decades with supported metal oxide catalysts have allowed for the detection and determination of the molecular structures of surface metal oxide catalytic active sites as well as the influence of different environments on their structures. Corresponding catalytic investigations have begun to establish molecular structure-activity/selectivity relationships for many different catalytic reactions over supported mixed metal oxides. These significant advances have been accelerated by the ability to molecular engineer model well-defined supported metal oxide catalytic materi- als that have allowed systematic variation of the various functionalities in supported metal oxide catalytic materials.
5. Molecular sieves
As various transition metal oxide-containing molecular sieve materials began to be synthesized in the late 1980s and 1990s, it became of interest to compare their molecular structures and catalytic properties with their corresponding
I.E. Wachs / Catalysis Today 100 (2005) 7994
89 supported transition metal oxides on amorphous SiO2 catalysts. Transition metal oxide silicate molecular sieves typically possess low levels of isolated transition metal oxide in silicate structures [8]. Almost the same isolated structures are found to also be present for the supported transition metal oxides on amorphous SiO2 catalysts [40,135,136]. Furthermore, when chemically probed for CH3OH oxidation to H2CO, the crystalline and amorphous analogs yield essentially the same TOF and selectivity values. The results for supported 1% V2O5/SiO2 and V- silicalite are shown in Table 1: The methanol oxidation TOF values between both types of catalysts are essentially indistinguishable within experi- mental error as are the H2CO and COx selectivity values.
These findings further suggest that the local bridging VO Si bond controls the catalytic activity and selectivity of the amorphous and crystalline V2O5SiO2 systems, and not the long range order of the silica matrix. This is analogous to the supported V2O5/TiO2 catalytic system with different bulk titania phases discussed above. In addition, the model supported surface metal oxides on amorphous silica catalysts allow quantitative prediction of the catalytic surface chemistry for transition metal oxides in siliceous molecular sieves (silicalites, MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA, etc.) for such gas phase reactions.
5.1. Summary
The isolated transition metal oxides present in siliceous crystalline molecular sieves and on the surface of amorphous SiO2 possess similar molecular structures and catalytic surface chemistry for vapor phase reactions. Consequently,it is now possible to predict the vapor phase catalytic activity, at least for oxidation reactions, for crystalline transition metal oxide silicate materials even prior to the successful synthesis of such catalytic materials.
6. Bulk mixed metal oxides
Bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials consist of large crystalline phases possessing low surface area (typically 110 m2 g1). The nature of the catalytic active sites present on the surfaces of bulk mixed metal oxide catalysts employed for selective oxidation reactions has eluded catalyst researchers over the years [6,137]. This situation is a consequence of the bulk spectroscopic techniques (XRD, Raman, IR, HR-TEM, solid-state NMR and XAS) usually used to characterize the bulk crystalline structures and the low dispersion state of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials. The bulk nature of these characterization techniques generally allows the signals from the bulk lattice to dominate the resulting spectra because of the significantly higher number of atoms in the bulk lattice than on the surface. In a few cases of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials, however, surface information has also recently been reported in the catalysis literature.
Guliants et al. obtained HR-TEM images of the layered vanadyl pyrophosphate, (VO2)2P2O7, catalyst and observed that the layered structure terminates with an amorphous layer rather than the crystalline lattice [57]. Consistent with this early conclusion, are the recent soft EXAFS studies by Schlogel et al. that the surface oxidation states and surface composition are different than that of the bulk lattice and are a strong function of environmental conditions [29,30]. In another recent investigation, Schlogl et al. also reported HR- TEM images of bulk mixed MoVTeNbO oxides showing the presence of crystalline nanoparticles at the surface of this mixed metal oxide catalyst [58]. In situ Raman measurements of bulk mixed VNbO and MoNb O oxides were able to detect the surface MOx species present in such mixed metal oxide catalytic materials [93].
The in situ Raman spectra for the bulk mixed VNbO oxide formed by coprecipitation is shown in Fig. 6 as a function of vanadium oxide content. In the absence of vanadia, the Raman spectrum is dominated by a Raman band at 700 cm1 originating from the bulk NbO vibration of

Fig. 6. Raman spectra of dehydrated coprecipitated bulk mixed VNbO oxides as a function of V2O5 content: (a) band slightly above 1000 cm1 arises from surface VOx species, (b) band slightly below 1000 cm1 originates from bulk VOx in the mixed VNbO oxide bulk lattice, (c) bands at 1000 and 700 cm1 characteristic of crystalline V2O5 nanopar- ticles, and (d) bands 700 cm1 come from bulk NbO vibrations. the Nb2O5 [61]. As the vanadia content is increased, this Raman band shifts towards 740 cm1 because of the distortion of the bulk lattice by the incorporation of vanadia into the bulk lattice and several new vanadia bands appear in the 1000 cm1 region. The initial vanadia Raman band below 1000 cm1 is associated with a bulk vanadia species since it does not change its band position upon hydration and dehydration. The vanadia band above 1000 cm1, however,does change its position upon hydration and dehydration indicating that it is associated with a surface species. The Raman band position of the dehydrated surface VOx species for the mixed VNbO oxide is similar to that previously found for the surface VO4 species present for dehydrated supported vanadium oxide catalysts. This suggests similar surface VO4 structures for catalytic sites in both supported vanadia catalysts and mixed metal oxide catalytic materials.
At the highest vanadia content, crystalline V2O5 bands are also present in the Raman spectrum, labeled with an asterisk,indicating that all the bulk and surface sites capable of interacting with vanadia are saturated. Essentially similar results were found for the mixed MoNbO oxide system.
This series of Raman characterization studies reveals that (1) secondary cations tend to be initially incorporated into the bulk lattice of the host oxide, (2) when the bulk lattice sites are saturated, the secondary cations become concentrated at the surface of the mixed metal oxide, and (3) crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles form when all the surface sites are saturated. The success of Raman spectroscopy in detecting the surface VOx species is a consequence of the absence of strong Raman bands from the bulk lattice of the VNbO and MoNbO oxide phases. Corresponding propane ODH catalytic studies clearly demonstrated that the surface VO4 species, and not the bulk vanadia or crystalline V2O5 components are the catalytic active sites for the mixed V NbO oxide catalyst system (similarly for the mixed Mo NbO catalyst system).
The presence of the same elements in the bulk crystalline lattice and on the surface and in the bulk lattice does not allow many surface analytical techniques to discriminate between the bulk and surface cations of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials because of the 35 nm sampling depth of typical electron spectroscopic techniques (e.g., XPS,
AES,
etc.).
Low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS), however, employs noble gas ions, such as He+,that only scatter from the outer surface and can provide elemental information about the outermost surface layer.
This has been employed by Gruenert et al. to characterize the surfaces of a series of bulk mixed metal vanadates [138]. It was surprisingly discovered that all the examined bulk mixed metal vanadates possess an amorphous surface VOx monolayer on the crystalline lattice substrate. This conclu- sion was reached because the LEISS signals for the secondary metal oxide components could not be detected.
The surfaces of these mixed metal vanadates were chemically probed with CH3OHTPSR and methanol oxidation steady-state studies. The CH3OHTPSR spectrum for bulk AlVO4 did not exhibit the formation of DME from acidic surface Al sites and only exhibited the H2CO product from surface redox sites of surface vanadia [139].
Furthermore, the H2CO Tp temperature coincided with that observed for formaldehyde formation from supported V2O5/ Al2O3 catalysts indicating that the surface VOx layer present on the bulk AlVO4 phase is also influenced by the underlying Al cations. These conclusions are consistent with the steady- state methanol oxidation studies over the mixed metal vanadate catalysts that demonstrated the surface chemistry of only vanadia sites [75].
The above recent findings about the surface nature of bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials are very exciting and creating a paradigm shift in the fundamental understanding of how such mixed metal oxides function as selective oxidation catalysts. For the past 30 years, research on bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials focused on the crystalline phases and their relationships to their character- istics as selective oxidation reactions [6,137]. The recent findings about the surface nature of mixed metal oxide catalysts suggest that the most important aspect of such catalytic materials was completely overlooked: the catalytic active sites present on the outermost surface layer. Only oxygen anions can be transported between the bulk lattice and the outermost surface layer, and the influence of the crystalline structure and phase on this phenomenon is not fully understood at present. Nevertheless, whether the oxygen participating comes from the bulk lattice or gas phase, it is reacting with the reactant molecule at the surface catalytic sites. Thus, much more research will be taking place in coming years on the surface nature of bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials and their surface chemistry characteristics.
6.1. Summary
Recent characterization studies have revealed that bulk mixed metal oxide catalytic materials contain surface metal oxide phases that can possess electronic and molecular structures that are different than in the bulk lattice. This new finding has major ramifications for the models of how bulk mixed metal oxides function as selective oxidation catalysts.
7. Conclusions
The catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials has undergone a significant evolution, or paradigm shift, over the past three decades due to development of advanced characterization techniques that are allowing more fundamental insights to be monitored. Initially, only crystalline metal oxide phases were determined by XRD characterization and all the catalytic models were based on this bulk structural information. This situation began to change 30 years ago as more powerful characterization

91 techniques became available that could provide information about amorphous metal oxide phases, as well as crystalline nanophases, under different environmental conditions. The first major breakthrough was the discovery and subsequent confirmation that amorphous surface species exist for supported metal oxide catalysts, which opened up an entirely new area of catalysis research. More recent studies demonstrated that the same metal oxide catalytic active sites are present for crystalline siliceous molecular sieves and their corresponding amorphous SiO2-supported metal oxide analogs. Furthermore, the same catalytic properties are exhibited by both the crystalline molecular sieves and the amorphous SiO2-based catalysts revealing the importance of local environment over long range order in mixed metal oxides. Most recently, the discovery of the presence of amorphous surface species on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxide materials is having a significant impact on how catalysis researchers think about such catalytic materials.
Thus, the presence of amorphous surface species and phases in mixed metal oxide catalytic materials and their electronic/ molecular structurescatalytic activity/selectivity relation- ships are now at the forefront of the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide materials. This new research paradigm will have significant impact on the catalysis models of mixed metal oxides in the coming years. In summary, the more complex catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalysts is finally catching up to the catalysis science of metal catalysts.
