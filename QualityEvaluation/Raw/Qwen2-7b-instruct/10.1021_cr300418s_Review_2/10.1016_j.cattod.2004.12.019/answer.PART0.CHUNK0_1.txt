[1] "The catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalytic materials has undergone a significant evolution, or paradigm shift, over the past three decades due to development of advanced characterization techniques that are allowing more fundamental insights to be monitored."
[2] "Initially, only crystalline metal oxide phases were determined by XRD characterization and all the catalytic models were based on this bulk structural information."
[3] "This situation began to change 30 years ago as more powerful characterization techniques became available that could provide information about amorphous metal oxide phases, as well as crystalline nanophases, under different environmental conditions."
[4] "The first major breakthrough was the discovery and subsequent confirmation that amorphous surface species exist for supported metal oxide catalysts, which opened up an entirely new area of catalysis research."
[5] "More recent studies demonstrated that the same metal oxide catalytic active sites are present for crystalline siliceous molecular sieves and their corresponding amorphous SiO2-supported metal oxide analogs. Furthermore, the same catalytic properties are exhibited by both the crystalline molecular sieves and the amorphous SiO2-based catalysts revealing the importance of local environment over long range order in mixed metal oxides."
[6] "Most recently, the discovery of the presence of amorphous surface species on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxide materials is having a significant impact on how catalysis researchers think about such catalytic materials."
[7] "Thus, the presence of amorphous surface species and phases in mixed metal oxide catalytic materials and their electronic/molecular structures-catalytic activity/selectivity relationships are now at the forefront of the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide materials."

Comparing and contrasting the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, the key factors influencing their structural characteristics and catalytic performance are the dopant loading and calcination temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques can confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials.

In solid-state synthesis, materials are synthesized without any liquid medium, leading to better control over the particle size and morphology. This method is often used for synthesizing compounds with complex stoichiometries. The dopant loading determines the amount of dopant in the final material, affecting its electronic properties and catalytic activity. Calcination temperature plays a crucial role in stabilizing the structure, removing unwanted impurities, and enhancing the crystallinity of the material.

Impregnation involves soaking the support material in a solution of the dopant precursor, allowing for a more homogeneous distribution of the dopant. This method is typically used for doping oxide supports. The dopant loading and calcination temperature can also significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance in this context. XRD can effectively confirm the presence and distribution of the dopant within the material, providing insights into its crystalline structure and phase composition.

As an example, Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 is a doped oxide material that exhibits enhanced catalytic properties compared to its undoped counterpart. The addition of La and Ta dopants influences the electronic structure and conductivity, potentially improving the material's performance in oxidation reactions. Similarly, copper-doped ceria catalysts show improved catalytic activity for CO oxidation due to the synergistic effect between the ceria support and copper dopant, altering the oxygen evolution and adsorption mechanisms.

The presence of amorphous surface species in mixed metal oxide catalytic materials is a recent finding that has reshaped the paradigm of how such materials function. The discovery of amorphous phases on the surface of bulk mixed metal oxides has introduced a new area of research focusing on the electronic/molecular structures and their catalytic activity/selectivity relationships. This finding emphasizes the importance of surface characteristics in determining the overall catalytic performance of mixed metal oxides, rather than relying solely on the bulk lattice structure.

混合金属氧化物催化剂材料的催化科学在过去三十年中经历了显著的演变，或范式转变，这得益于高级表征技术的发展，这些技术使我们能够监测到更基本的见解。最初，只有晶态金属氧化物相通过X射线衍射（XRD）表征确定，并且所有催化模型都是基于这种宏观结构信息。

这种情况在大约30年前开始改变，当时出现了更强大的表征技术，可以提供关于无定形金属氧化物相以及在不同环境条件下存在的纳米相的信息。首次重大突破是确认支持型金属氧化物催化剂上存在无定形表面物种，这开辟了一个全新的催化研究领域。最近的研究证明了结晶硅酸盐分子筛和它们相应的无定形SiO2基金属氧化物类似物中存在相同的金属氧化物催化活性位点。进一步地，这两种类型的催化剂表现出相同的催化性质，揭示了局部环境比长程有序对混合金属氧化物的重要性。

最近发现，混合金属氧化物催化剂表面上存在无定形物种对催化材料的结构有着重大影响，以及它们的电子/分子结构与催化活性/选择性关系现在成为了混合金属氧化物催化材料催化科学的前沿领域。这一新的研究范式在未来几年将对混合金属氧化物的催化模型产生重大影响。

比较和对比固体状态合成方法和浸渍法准备掺杂氧化物材料，影响其结构特性和催化性能的关键因素是掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度。X射线衍射（XRD）技术可以证实成功掺杂并表征最终材料。

在固体状态合成中，材料是在没有液体介质的情况下合成的，这有利于控制颗粒尺寸和形态。这种方法常用于合成具有复杂化学式的化合物。掺杂剂负载决定了最终材料中的掺杂剂量，影响其电学性质和催化活性。煅烧温度在稳定结构、去除不需要的杂质和提高材料结晶度方面起着关键作用。

浸渍涉及将支持材料浸泡在掺杂剂前体溶液中，从而实现掺杂剂在材料中的均匀分布。这种方法通常用于氧化物支持的掺杂。掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度也会影响结构特性和催化性能。XRD可以有效证实掺杂剂在材料中的存在及其分布，提供有关其晶体结构和相组成的信息。

例如，Sr0.9La0.1Ti1-xTaxO3是一种掺杂氧化物材料，与未掺杂的材料相比，其表现出增强的催化性能。La和Ta掺杂剂改变了电子结构和导电性，可能提高了材料在氧化反应中的性能。同样，铜掺杂铈催化剂显示出改善的CO氧化催化活性，由于铈支持与铜掺杂剂之间的协同效应，改变了氧的释放和吸附机制。

混合金属氧化物催化剂表面上存在的无定形物种的最新发现对催化材料的功能方式产生了重塑。表面物种的存在揭示了混合金属氧化物催化剂的重要特性，而不仅仅是依赖于晶格结构。这一发现强调了表面特征在决定混合金属氧化物整体催化性能中的重要性，而不是仅仅依赖于晶格结构。
