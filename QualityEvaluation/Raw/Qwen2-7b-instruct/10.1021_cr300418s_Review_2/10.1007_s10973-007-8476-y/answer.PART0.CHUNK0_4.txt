The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method are two common strategies for preparing doped oxide materials. The solid-state synthesis method typically involves the direct incorporation of dopants into the oxide lattice, while the impregnation method often involves the adsorption of dopants onto the oxide surface. The key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of these materials are dopant loading and calcination temperature. High dopant loading can alter the crystal structure, leading to changes in the material's surface area, porosity, and electronic properties. Calcination temperature is crucial as it affects the formation and stability of the dopant within the oxide matrix. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) are employed to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials. Specific examples include Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, where doping with different amounts of Ta influences the material's properties, and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, where the copper loading and calcination conditions determine the catalyst's efficiency in converting CO to CO2.

固体合成法和浸渍法是制备掺杂氧化物材料的两种常见策略。固体合成法通常涉及直接将掺杂剂融入氧化物晶格中，而浸渍法则往往涉及到在氧化物表面吸附掺杂剂。影响这些材料结构特性和催化性能的关键因素是掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度。高掺杂剂负载量可以改变晶体结构，导致材料的比表面积、孔隙率和电子性质发生变化。煅烧温度对于形成和稳定氧化物矩阵中的掺杂剂至关重要。使用如X射线衍射（XRD）等技术来确认成功掺杂并表征材料。具体例子包括Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，其中不同含量的Ta掺杂会影响材料的性质，以及用于CO氧化的铜掺杂铈催化剂，其中铜负载量和煅烧条件决定了催化剂在将CO转化为CO2时的效率。
