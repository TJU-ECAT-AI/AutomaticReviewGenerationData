Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, the solid-state synthesis method typically involves the direct preparation of the catalyst by various types of reactions, such as precipitation. This method relies on achieving perfect homogeneity, which is only possible if an oxoanion reacts with a cation to produce the precipitate. The stoichiometry is determined by the chemistry of this reaction, offering limited flexibility. In contrast, the impregnation method involves depositing a solution of the dopant onto a support material, followed by drying and calcination. This method allows for more control over the dopant loading and distribution. Factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the materials. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be employed to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For instance, XRD analysis of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts can reveal the presence and distribution of dopants within the oxide matrix, confirming their successful incorporation and providing insights into the resulting material's structure and potential catalytic activity.

比较固体合成方法和浸渍法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料。固体合成方法通常涉及通过各种类型的反应直接制备催化剂，如沉淀。这种方法依赖于实现完全均一性，仅在氧化物阴离子与阳离子反应生成沉淀物时才有可能。该反应的化学性质决定了其比例，提供了有限的灵活性。相比之下，浸渍法涉及将掺杂剂溶液沉积到支撑材料上，随后进行干燥和煅烧。此方法允许对掺杂剂负载和分布进行更多控制。因素如掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度显著影响材料的结构特性和催化性能。技术如X射线衍射（XRD）可以用来验证掺杂的成功并表征最终材料。例如，通过XRD分析Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂铈氧化物催化剂，可以揭示掺杂剂在氧化物矩阵中的存在及其分布，确认其成功整合，并提供有关最终材料结构及其潜在催化活性的见解。
