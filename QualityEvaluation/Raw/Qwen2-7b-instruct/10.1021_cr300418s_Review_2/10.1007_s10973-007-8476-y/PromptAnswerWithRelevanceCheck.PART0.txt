[1] "The most common method for mixed-oxide catalyst preparation is crystallization or precipitation or coprecipitation in solution of a precursor form (hydroxide, oxide, insoluble salt) of the catalyst."
[2] "In the past, catalysts for the styrene process were generally prepared in this way from KOH and oxides of Fe and Cr and other (proprietary) promoter components."
[3] "Ammonia synthesis catalysts which are prepared by mixing the components in the molten state do not pertain to this section, strictly speaking."
[4] "One of the most studied cases was that of hydroxo-carbonates used for preparing catalysts containing copper and zinc or chromium with additional elements (e.g. Co or Al)."
[5] "Precipitation (or simple crystallization) involves two main steps, nucleation and growth."
[6] "At the nucleation stage, very small crystals of the solid phase are formed; these have a high specific surface area and high surface energy, and hence are unstable."
[7] "Above this critical size, the solid particles can grow."
[8] "An overview is given in"

1. The solid-state synthesis method for preparing doped oxide materials typically involves the crystallization or precipitation of a precursor in solution, often involving hydroxides, oxides, or insoluble salts. This contrasts with the impregnation method, which involves soaking the oxide support with a solution of the dopant, followed by drying and calcination.

2. The key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance in solid-state synthesis are the dopant loading and the calcination temperature. High dopant loading can lead to more effective doping, enhancing the catalytic activity. However, excessive loading can also result in phase segregation or alteration of the oxide's structure, negatively impacting performance. Calcination temperature is crucial for achieving the desired phase purity and crystal structure, while excessively high temperatures can cause sintering, reducing surface area and increasing particle size.

3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful technique for confirming successful doping and characterizing the resulting materials. It can identify the presence of dopants within the matrix and determine the crystalline structure. For instance, in the case of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, XRD can reveal the presence of titanium and tantalum dopants and their distribution within the strontium-lanthanum-titanium oxide structure. Similarly, for copper-doped ceria catalysts used in CO oxidation, XRD can show the incorporation of copper ions into the ceria lattice, affecting the oxygen storage capacity and promoting efficient CO oxidation.

1. 制备掺杂氧化物材料的固态合成方法通常涉及溶液中催化剂前体的结晶或沉淀，经常使用氢氧化物、氧化物或不溶盐。与浸渍法相比，浸渍法涉及到将氧化物载体浸泡在掺杂剂溶液中，随后干燥和煅烧。

2. 影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度。高掺杂剂负载可以提高有效掺杂，增强催化活性。然而，过高的负载也可能导致相分离或氧化物结构的改变，从而负面影响性能。煅烧温度对于实现所需相纯度和晶体结构至关重要，而过高的温度可能导致烧结，减少比表面积并增加颗粒尺寸。

3. X射线衍射（XRD）是确认成功掺杂并表征最终材料的强大技术。它可以识别掺杂剂在基质中的存在，并确定晶体结构。例如，在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3的情况下，XRD可以揭示钛和钽掺杂剂的存在及其在锶镧钛氧化物结构中的分布。同样，对于用于CO氧化的铈基铜催化剂，XRD可以显示铈晶格中铜离子的引入，影响氧储存能力并促进高效的CO氧化。

Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, the solid-state synthesis method typically involves the direct preparation of the catalyst by various types of reactions, such as precipitation. This method relies on achieving perfect homogeneity, which is only possible if an oxoanion reacts with a cation to produce the precipitate. The stoichiometry is determined by the chemistry of this reaction, offering limited flexibility. In contrast, the impregnation method involves depositing a solution of the dopant onto a support material, followed by drying and calcination. This method allows for more control over the dopant loading and distribution. Factors such as dopant loading and calcination temperature significantly influence the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of the materials. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be employed to confirm successful doping and characterize the resulting materials. For instance, XRD analysis of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts can reveal the presence and distribution of dopants within the oxide matrix, confirming their successful incorporation and providing insights into the resulting material's structure and potential catalytic activity.

比较固体合成方法和浸渍法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料。固体合成方法通常涉及通过各种类型的反应直接制备催化剂，如沉淀。这种方法依赖于实现完全均一性，仅在氧化物阴离子与阳离子反应生成沉淀物时才有可能。该反应的化学性质决定了其比例，提供了有限的灵活性。相比之下，浸渍法涉及将掺杂剂溶液沉积到支撑材料上，随后进行干燥和煅烧。此方法允许对掺杂剂负载和分布进行更多控制。因素如掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度显著影响材料的结构特性和催化性能。技术如X射线衍射（XRD）可以用来验证掺杂的成功并表征最终材料。例如，通过XRD分析Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂铈氧化物催化剂，可以揭示掺杂剂在氧化物矩阵中的存在及其分布，确认其成功整合，并提供有关最终材料结构及其潜在催化活性的见解。

The solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method are two common strategies for preparing doped oxide materials. The solid-state synthesis method typically involves the direct incorporation of dopants into the oxide lattice, while the impregnation method often involves the adsorption of dopants onto the oxide surface. The key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of these materials are dopant loading and calcination temperature. High dopant loading can alter the crystal structure, leading to changes in the material's surface area, porosity, and electronic properties. Calcination temperature is crucial as it affects the formation and stability of the dopant within the oxide matrix. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) are employed to confirm successful doping and characterize the materials. Specific examples include Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3, where doping with different amounts of Ta influences the material's properties, and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, where the copper loading and calcination conditions determine the catalyst's efficiency in converting CO to CO2.

固体合成法和浸渍法是制备掺杂氧化物材料的两种常见策略。固体合成法通常涉及直接将掺杂剂融入氧化物晶格中，而浸渍法则往往涉及到在氧化物表面吸附掺杂剂。影响这些材料结构特性和催化性能的关键因素是掺杂剂负载量和煅烧温度。高掺杂剂负载量可以改变晶体结构，导致材料的比表面积、孔隙率和电子性质发生变化。煅烧温度对于形成和稳定氧化物矩阵中的掺杂剂至关重要。使用如X射线衍射（XRD）等技术来确认成功掺杂并表征材料。具体例子包括Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3，其中不同含量的Ta掺杂会影响材料的性质，以及用于CO氧化的铜掺杂铈催化剂，其中铜负载量和煅烧条件决定了催化剂在将CO转化为CO2时的效率。
