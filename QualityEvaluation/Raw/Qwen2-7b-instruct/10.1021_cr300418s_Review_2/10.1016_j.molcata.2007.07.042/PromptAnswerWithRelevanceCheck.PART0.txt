The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing the reactants at room temperature, whereas the impregnation method starts by producing a gel with the iron nitrate solution before impregnating it with the chromium nitrate solution. FTIR analysis confirms the presence of acetate groups in the samples. The TPR profiles reveal reduction peaks related to the formation of iron species. The specific surface area measurements indicate that the impregnation method produces catalysts with higher specific surface areas. The core-level spectra show the distribution of iron and chromium species on the catalyst surface. The M ossbauer spectra of pure magnetite consist of two sextets representing different iron oxidation states. The activity of the catalysts over time demonstrates their stability.

The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing iron and chromium salts in aqueous solution and then precipitating the resulting compound. Impregnation, on the other hand, involves soaking the iron salt in an aqueous solution containing the chromium salt. Key factors influencing the synthesis include the concentration of the chromium salt, the calcination temperature, and the duration of the impregnation process. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction can be used to confirm the successful doping of the material and characterize its structure. For example, Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts were successfully synthesized using these methods for CO oxidation applications.

<p>It is well-known [1] that the preparation method of the cata- lysts has a strong influence on their final properties. In addition,the reactivity of the solids largely depends on the nature and on the concentration of the imperfections that can be gener- ated during their preparation.</p>

The precipitation and impregnation methods yield chromium-doped magnetite catalysts with distinct textural and catalytic properties. Chromium helps maintain specific surface areas during the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) and delays metallic iron production, irrespective of the preparation technique. Chromium introduces a decrease in activity per area, influenced by the preparation method, by hindering the production of Fe2+ species, thus diminishing catalytic site activity. The impregnation method yields the most active catalyst, featuring high total chromium content and a substantial specific surface area. Chromium is thought to exert its effects both within the material's bulk and on its surface, preventing sintering. Moreover, the catalysts can be prepared in an active state, bypassing the reduction step.

沉淀和浸渍方法产生具有不同结构和催化性能的铬掺杂磁铁催化剂。铬能够在WGSR过程中保持特定表面积并延迟金属铁的生成，与制备方法无关。铬通过阻碍Fe2+物种的产生导致活性面积下降，进而降低催化位点的活性。浸渍方法可获得最活跃的催化剂，其总铬含量高且具有显著的特定表面积。人们认为铬在材料的主体和表面都起作用，防止结块。此外，催化剂可以在不进行还原步骤的情况下被制备成活性状态。

Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, the solid-state synthesis method typically involves mixing the reactants at high temperatures, leading to direct solid-to-solid reactions. This method allows for a controlled introduction of dopants into the material structure. Impregnation, on the other hand, involves soaking the precursor material in a solution containing the dopant, allowing for a more controlled and localized introduction of dopants. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance include the dopant loading and calcination temperature. High dopant loading can lead to increased surface area and potentially improved catalytic activity, but may also result in a decrease in activity per unit area due to the complexity of the dopant-host interactions. Calcination temperature is crucial for the crystallinity and stability of the material. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping by identifying characteristic peaks corresponding to the dopant phase and monitoring changes in the lattice parameters. For example, in the case of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, XRD analysis would show the presence of the dopant phase alongside the host material, indicating successful doping. The impregnation method can offer advantages in terms of controlling dopant distribution and achieving a high surface area, which is beneficial for catalytic applications. Avoiding the reduction step during preparation ensures the catalysts are in the active phase, preserving their structural integrity and enhancing their catalytic performance.

比较固体合成法和浸渍法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料时，固体合成法通常涉及在高温下混合反应物，导致直接的固态到固态反应。这种方法允许对材料结构进行可控的掺杂引入。浸渍法则涉及将前体材料浸泡在含掺杂剂的溶液中，从而实现对掺杂剂分布的更精确控制。影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度。高掺杂剂负载可能导致表面面积增加，并可能提高催化活性，但也可能由于掺杂剂-载体相互作用的复杂性导致单位面积活性下降。煅烧温度对于材料的结晶性和稳定性至关重要。例如，在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铈基催化剂的CO氧化应用中，X射线衍射（XRD）分析会显示掺杂相与主体材料对应的特征峰，监测晶格参数的变化，以确认成功掺杂。浸渍法在控制掺杂剂分布和实现高表面积方面具有优势，这对于催化应用非常有利。避免准备过程中还原步骤确保催化剂处于活性状态，保持其结构完整性并增强其催化性能。
