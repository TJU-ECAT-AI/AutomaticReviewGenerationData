2.1. Sample preparation
In the precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solu- tion (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample.

In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample).

2.2. Catalyst characterization
The catalysts were characterized by chemical analy- sis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area measurements,temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Mossbauer spectroscopy.

2.3. Catalysts evaluation
The catalysts were evaluated using 0.2 cm3 of powder 100 mesh size and a fixed bed microreactor operating at 643 K, 1 atm and WHSV = 12,000 h−1, for 6 h.

The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing iron and chromium salts in aqueous solution and then precipitating the resulting compound. Impregnation, on the other hand, involves soaking the iron salt in an aqueous solution containing the chromium salt. Key factors influencing the synthesis include the concentration of the chromium salt, the calcination temperature, and the duration of the impregnation process. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction can be used to confirm the successful doping of the material and characterize its structure. For example, Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts were successfully synthesized using these methods for CO oxidation applications.

固体态合成方法涉及将铁和铬盐混合在水溶液中，然后沉淀生成的化合物。浸渍法则是将铁盐浸泡在含有铬盐的水溶液中。影响合成的关键因素包括铬盐的浓度、煅烧温度以及浸渍过程的持续时间。例如，通过X射线衍射技术可以验证材料的掺杂成功并表征其结构。Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铜掺杂的铈催化剂就是使用这些方法成功合成的，用于CO氧化应用。
