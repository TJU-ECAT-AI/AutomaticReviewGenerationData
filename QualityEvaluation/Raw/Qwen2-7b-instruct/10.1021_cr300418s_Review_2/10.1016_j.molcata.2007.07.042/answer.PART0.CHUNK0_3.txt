<p>The use of the precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite leads to catalysts with different textural and catalytic properties towards the water gas shift reaction. However, chromium is able to preserve the spe- cific surface areas during WGSR and to delay the metallic iron production, regardless the preparation method.</p>
<p>Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method. This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction.</p>
<p>The most active catalyst can be obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which leads to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area is produced. Chromium is believed to act both in the bulk and on the surface preventing sintering.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was confirmed that it is possible to prepare the catalysts in the active phase avoiding the reduction step.</p>

The precipitation and impregnation methods yield chromium-doped magnetite catalysts with distinct textural and catalytic properties. Chromium helps maintain specific surface areas during the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) and delays metallic iron production, irrespective of the preparation technique. Chromium introduces a decrease in activity per area, influenced by the preparation method, by hindering the production of Fe2+ species, thus diminishing catalytic site activity. The impregnation method yields the most active catalyst, featuring high total chromium content and a substantial specific surface area. Chromium is thought to exert its effects both within the material's bulk and on its surface, preventing sintering. Moreover, the catalysts can be prepared in an active state, bypassing the reduction step.

沉淀和浸渍方法产生具有不同结构和催化性能的铬掺杂磁铁催化剂。铬能够在WGSR过程中保持特定表面积并延迟金属铁的生成，与制备方法无关。铬通过阻碍Fe2+物种的产生导致活性面积下降，进而降低催化位点的活性。浸渍方法可获得最活跃的催化剂，其总铬含量高且具有显著的特定表面积。人们认为铬在材料的主体和表面都起作用，防止结块。此外，催化剂可以在不进行还原步骤的情况下被制备成活性状态。
