[1] "The use of the precipitation and impregnation methods for preparing chromium-doped magnetite leads to catalysts with different textural and catalytic properties towards the water gas shift reaction."
[2] "Regardless the preparation method and the presence of chromium, as shown in Fig. 2(a)."
[3] "Chromium-doped samples showed specific surface areas higher than magnetite, regardless the preparation method, showing the role of chromium as textural promoter."
[4] "However, chromium is able to preserve the specific surface areas during WGSR and to delay the metallic iron production, regardless the preparation method."
[5] "Chromium also causes a decrease in activity per area, depending on the preparation method."
[6] "This fact can be assigned to its ability in making the production of Fe2+ species more difficult and then decreasing the activity of the catalytic sites, during the redox cycle of the reaction."
[7] "The most active catalyst can be obtained by adding chromium by impregnation, which leads to a large amount of total chromium in the solid and then a catalyst with high specific surface area is produced."
[8] "Moreover, it was confirmed that it is possible to prepare the catalysts in the active phase avoiding the reduction step."

Comparing the solid-state synthesis method and impregnation method for preparing doped oxide materials, the solid-state synthesis method typically involves mixing the reactants at high temperatures, leading to direct solid-to-solid reactions. This method allows for a controlled introduction of dopants into the material structure. Impregnation, on the other hand, involves soaking the precursor material in a solution containing the dopant, allowing for a more controlled and localized introduction of dopants. Key factors influencing the structural characteristics and catalytic performance include the dopant loading and calcination temperature. High dopant loading can lead to increased surface area and potentially improved catalytic activity, but may also result in a decrease in activity per unit area due to the complexity of the dopant-host interactions. Calcination temperature is crucial for the crystallinity and stability of the material. Techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) can be used to confirm successful doping by identifying characteristic peaks corresponding to the dopant phase and monitoring changes in the lattice parameters. For example, in the case of Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3 and copper-doped ceria catalysts for CO oxidation, XRD analysis would show the presence of the dopant phase alongside the host material, indicating successful doping. The impregnation method can offer advantages in terms of controlling dopant distribution and achieving a high surface area, which is beneficial for catalytic applications. Avoiding the reduction step during preparation ensures the catalysts are in the active phase, preserving their structural integrity and enhancing their catalytic performance.

比较固体合成法和浸渍法用于制备掺杂氧化物材料时，固体合成法通常涉及在高温下混合反应物，导致直接的固态到固态反应。这种方法允许对材料结构进行可控的掺杂引入。浸渍法则涉及将前体材料浸泡在含掺杂剂的溶液中，从而实现对掺杂剂分布的更精确控制。影响结构特性和催化性能的关键因素包括掺杂剂负载和煅烧温度。高掺杂剂负载可能导致表面面积增加，并可能提高催化活性，但也可能由于掺杂剂-载体相互作用的复杂性导致单位面积活性下降。煅烧温度对于材料的结晶性和稳定性至关重要。例如，在Sr0.9La0.1Ti1–xTaxO3和铈基催化剂的CO氧化应用中，X射线衍射（XRD）分析会显示掺杂相与主体材料对应的特征峰，监测晶格参数的变化，以确认成功掺杂。浸渍法在控制掺杂剂分布和实现高表面积方面具有优势，这对于催化应用非常有利。避免准备过程中还原步骤确保催化剂处于活性状态，保持其结构完整性并增强其催化性能。
