<p>It is well-known [1] that the preparation method of the cata- lysts has a strong influence on their final properties. In addition,the reactivity of the solids largely depends on the nature and on the concentration of the imperfections that can be gener- ated during their preparation.</p>
<p>In recent years, the WGSR has attracted increasing interest mainly because of its application in fuel cells [4]. By WGSR,the hydrogen production from steam reforming is increased and,most importantly, the hydrogen stream is purified by the removal of carbon monoxide which often poisons most of metallic cata- lysts, including the platinum electrocatalyst for fuel cells [4,5].</p>
<p>The precipitation method, an ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, m/v) was slowly added by a pump, at room temperature, to an iron nitrate (1 M) and chromium nitrate (0.1 M) solutions, previously mixed, to get the MCP sample.</p>
<p>In the impregnation method, the ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the iron nitrate solution to produce a gel which was further impregnated with the chromium nitrate solution, for 24 h (MCI sample).</p>
<p>The FTIR spectra of the samples before heating, shown in Fig.1(a),confirmedthepresenceofacetategroupsbytheabsorp- tion bands at 1550 and 1430 cm1 [12].</p>
<p>The TPR of pure iron oxide showed a curve with two small reduction peaks between 543 and 673 K (Fig. 3).</p>
<p>The results of the specific surface area measurements of the solids are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>The M ossbauer spectrum of pure magnetite (Fig. 5(a)) was fitted with two sextets whose hyperfine parameters correspond to Fe3+ in tetrahedral sites (A sites) and Fe2.5+ in octahedral sites (B sites) of Fe3O4 (Tables 4 and 5).</p>
<p>Chromium increased the activity of the catalysts as shown in Table 3.</p>
