The solid-state synthesis method involves mixing the reactants at room temperature, whereas the impregnation method starts by producing a gel with the iron nitrate solution before impregnating it with the chromium nitrate solution. FTIR analysis confirms the presence of acetate groups in the samples. The TPR profiles reveal reduction peaks related to the formation of iron species. The specific surface area measurements indicate that the impregnation method produces catalysts with higher specific surface areas. The core-level spectra show the distribution of iron and chromium species on the catalyst surface. The M ossbauer spectra of pure magnetite consist of two sextets representing different iron oxidation states. The activity of the catalysts over time demonstrates their stability.

固体合成方法是将反应物在室温下混合，而浸渍法则是先用铁硝酸盐溶液制备凝胶，再将其浸渍于铬硝酸盐溶液中。FTIR分析证实样品中存在乙酸根团簇。TPR曲线显示与铁物种形成相关的还原峰。特定表面面积测量表明，浸渍法产生的催化剂具有更高的特定表面积。核心能级谱显示催化剂表面上铁和铬物种的分布。纯磁铁的M ossbauer光谱由代表不同氧化态铁的两个六重体组成。催化剂随时间的活性示出了其稳定性。
