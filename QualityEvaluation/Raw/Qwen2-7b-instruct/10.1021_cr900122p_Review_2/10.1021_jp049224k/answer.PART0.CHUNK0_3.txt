[1] "In this connection, in addition to the commonly used low-frequency shifts, we suggest the use of the high intensities of most strongly perturbed IR bands as a criterion of chemical activation of adsorbed molecules in acid catalysis."
[2] "Therefore, polarization of chemical bonds plays the central role in the acid or acidbase catalysis."
[3] "At elevated temperatures, such polarization results in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane."
[4] "The reason for heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane is the anisotropy of its polarization by zinc cations."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations by affecting the polarization of chemical bonds. In the context of acid-catalyzed reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ethane, the high intensities of the most strongly perturbed infrared (IR) bands serve as a criterion for chemical activation of adsorbed molecules. This polarization plays a central role in acid or base catalysis, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane at elevated temperatures. The anisotropy of the polarization of ethane by zinc cations is the reason for its heterolytic dissociative adsorption.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，通过影响化学键的极化，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。在酸催化反应中，如乙烷的脱氢，最强烈扰动的红外（IR）谱带的高强度作为吸附分子化学激活的判据。这种极化在酸或碱催化中起着核心作用，导致乙烷在高温下的异裂吸附和脱氢。锌离子的极化各向异性是乙烷异裂吸附的原因。
