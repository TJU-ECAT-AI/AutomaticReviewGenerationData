<p>Indeed, according to classical electrodynamics any motion of an atomic system that is connected with a change of its dipole moment leads to emission or absorption of radiation. Therefore, the intensities of the stretching IR bands are proportional to the squares of the first derivatives of the dipole moments created by the normal stretching vibrations over normal coordinates of these vibrations:17 In other words, intensities of the stretching bands are directly related to the polarizability of chemical bonds induced by interaction with the active sites.</p>
<p>In this connection, in addition to the commonly used low-frequency shifts, we suggest the use of the high intensities of most strongly perturbed IR bands as a criterion of chemical activation of adsorbed molecules in acid catalysis. Unlike low-frequency shifts of stretching vibrations that are proportional to the force constants of the ground states of chemical bonds, intensities of vibrational IR bands are directly connected with polarization of chemical bonds. Therefore, they better reflect the ability of adsorbed molecules for subsequent activation via polarization. In the case of acidbase catalysis, this is the main source of chemical activation.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations by affecting the ability of adsorbed molecules to become polarized. This polarization, reflected in the intensities of infrared (IR) stretching bands, serves as a criterion for chemical activation in acid catalysis. High intensities of these bands indicate strong activation, which leads to subsequent steps like dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane. The efficiency of these catalysts is thus tied to their ability to selectively polarize specific chemical bonds within adsorbed molecules, providing a unique opportunity for discussion of the selectivity of heterogeneous acid catalysis at the molecular level.

<p>The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations. For this purpose, we used HZSM-5 zeolites modified with zinc either by wet ion exchange or by high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor.</p>
<p>Adsorption of ethane at high equilibrium pressures by both hydrogen and zinc forms of ZSM-5 results in the appearance of four IR bands from the weakly adsorbed species instead of only two bands for gaseous ethane. The positions of the bands with maxima at 2974 and 2941 cm-1 are very close to those for the ν7 and ν10 CH stretching bands of gaseous ethane.</p>
<p>The most amazing feature of the stronger form of molecular ethane adsorption by zinc cations is the appearance of a very strongly low-frequency shifted very intense broad band with a maximum at 2734 cm-1. Due to the very strong change in the symmetry of the adsorbed species, the assignment of this band to the definite normal vibration is difficult.</p>
<p>In other words, interaction of ethane with zinc cations mainly results in selective activation of the CH stretching mode that corresponds to the most intense and most strongly low-frequency shifted broad IR band.</p>
<p>Therefore, polarization of chemical bonds plays the central role in the acid or acid-base catalysis.</p>
<p>Results of the present study provide the next example of this kind for the stronger molecular form of ethane adsorption connected with selective polarization of the most strongly perturbed CH stretching mode. At elevated temperatures, such polarization results in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane.</p>

The research focuses on the DRIFT study of ethane adsorption by zinc cations in ZSM-5 zeolites, both through wet ion exchange and high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor. The study reveals unusual spectra of adsorbed ethane species, characterized by weakly perturbed narrow bands in the region of CH stretching vibrations and a very intense broad IR band with a frequency significantly lower than those of gaseous or physically adsorbed ethane. This high-intensity band indicates strong polarization of the corresponding vibrational mode, which is closely connected to the subsequent heterolytic dissociation of ethane at moderate temperatures, forming acidic hydroxyl groups and zinc ethyl fragments. At higher temperatures, the zinc ethyl fragments decompose, leading to the formation of zinc hydrides and ethylene. The unusual DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorption by zinc cations represents a new explanation for the anisotropy of polarizability of adsorbed molecules, suggesting the use of the relative intensities of IR bands as a reactivity index that correlates with the polarization of adsorbed molecules by active sites, thus affecting their chemical activation.

研究主要关注通过湿离子交换和高温与锌蒸汽反应在ZSM-5沸石中锌离子对乙烷吸附的DRIFT研究。研究揭示了吸附乙烷的异常光谱，包括弱扰动的窄带以及频率远低于气体或物理吸附乙烷的非常强的宽红外带。这种高度集中的带表明了对应振动模式的强烈极化，这与随后在适中的温度下乙烷的异裂性吸附紧密相关，形成酸性羟基团和锌乙基碎片。在较高温度下，锌乙基碎片分解，导致形成锌氢化物和乙烯。乙烷吸附于锌离子的非典型DRIFT光谱代表了吸附分子极化的各向异性，提出使用红外伸缩带相对强度作为活性位点极化吸附分子的反应性指数，从而影响它们的化学激活的新解释。

The research aimed to investigate the activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane using zinc cations in a zeolite catalyst. Spectral measurements were conducted on granulated zeolites with specific dimensions. The study revealed that only acidic protons were replaced during the preparation process, indicating hydrogen bonding with the framework oxygen. Similar DRIFT bands were observed for ethane adsorption whether the catalyst was prepared by reacting with zinc vapor or through conventional ion exchange. After evacuating ethane at room temperature, three new bands appeared in the CH stretching vibration region. The strongest feature of the stronger ethane adsorption was the emergence of a highly intense, broad band with a significantly low frequency shift. According to classical electrodynamics, any motion affecting a molecule's dipole moment results in the emission or absorption of radiation.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations by affecting the polarization of chemical bonds. In the context of acid-catalyzed reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ethane, the high intensities of the most strongly perturbed infrared (IR) bands serve as a criterion for chemical activation of adsorbed molecules. This polarization plays a central role in acid or base catalysis, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane at elevated temperatures. The anisotropy of the polarization of ethane by zinc cations is the reason for its heterolytic dissociative adsorption.

<p>The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations. For this purpose, we used HZSM-5 zeolites modified with zinc either by wet ion exchange or by high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor.</p>
<p>The solid line in Figure 1 shows the DRIFT spectrum of OH stretching bands of HZSM-5 preevacuated at 770 K. In agreement with our previously published results,9 this spectrum contains a narrow band at 3610 cm-1 from the isolated acidic hydroxyl groups and a much weaker band from the silanol groups with a maximum at 3740 cm-1. A very broad band with a maximum at  29003600 cm-1 also belongs to the acidic OH groups that are hydrogen-bonded to the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Reaction with zinc vapor at 770 K resulted in almost complete disappearance of both the narrow and the broad bands (the dashed line in Figure 1).</p>
<p>Adsorption of ethane by the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 at room temperature resulted in the appearance of four CH stretching bands at 2878, 2920, 2941, and 2974 cm-1 (Figure 2). Upon lowering the ethane pressure, all of the bands decreased in parallel and were completely eliminated by evacuation at room temperature. Subsequent adsorption of ethane regenerated the initial spectrum. This indicated a weak and reversible adsorption of ethane by the hydrogen form of the zeolite.</p>
<p>As follows from comparison of Figure 2 with Figure 3 a and b, the similar DRIFT bands were also observed after ethane adsorption by the zinc-modified HZSM-5 prepared either by reaction with zinc vapor or by conventional ion exchange. However, in addition to the narrow bands, DRIFT spectra of both zinc-modified zeolites also contained a very broad and a very strongly low-frequency-shifted band with a maximum at 2738 cm-1.</p>
<p>Our results also indicated that heating of both ZnZSM-5(vap) and ZnZSM-5(ex) at 423 K in an ethane atmosphere at 533 Pa resulted in diminishing of the intensities of all bands from the stronger form of ethane adsorption (Figure 5).</p>
<p>After evacuation of ethane at room temperature, three new bands with maxima at 2874, 2910, and 2958 cm-1 remained visible in the region of the CH stretching vibrations (the dotted line in Figure 5).</p>
<p>For better understanding of the mechanism of ethane dissociative adsorption and of ethane dehydrogenation, we also studied DRIFT spectra of the strongly adsorbed molecular species after heating at higher temperatures. As follows from Figure 6, after heating of the sample at temperatures up to 463 K at a very low ethane pressure of 0.7 Pa, the intensities of the bands of the stronger molecular form of ethane adsorption decreased.</p>

The study focuses on the DRIFT analysis of ethane adsorption by zinc cations in ZSM-5 zeolite, exploring the activation and dissociative adsorption processes. The research highlights the differences in DRIFT spectra between ethane adsorption by hydrogen form and zinc-modified forms of the zeolite. The authors observe unusual DRIFT bands indicative of strong polarization and subsequent chemical activation of ethane molecules upon adsorption by zinc cations, leading to ethane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. The use of relative intensities of IR stretching bands as a criterion for chemical activation is proposed as a novel approach to understand the mechanisms of heterogeneous acid-catalyzed reactions.
