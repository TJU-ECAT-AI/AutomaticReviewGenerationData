<p>The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations. For this purpose, we used HZSM-5 zeolites modified with zinc either by wet ion exchange or by high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor.</p>
<p>The solid line in Figure 1 shows the DRIFT spectrum of OH stretching bands of HZSM-5 preevacuated at 770 K. In agreement with our previously published results,9 this spectrum contains a narrow band at 3610 cm-1 from the isolated acidic hydroxyl groups and a much weaker band from the silanol groups with a maximum at 3740 cm-1. A very broad band with a maximum at  29003600 cm-1 also belongs to the acidic OH groups that are hydrogen-bonded to the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Reaction with zinc vapor at 770 K resulted in almost complete disappearance of both the narrow and the broad bands (the dashed line in Figure 1).</p>
<p>Adsorption of ethane by the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 at room temperature resulted in the appearance of four CH stretching bands at 2878, 2920, 2941, and 2974 cm-1 (Figure 2). Upon lowering the ethane pressure, all of the bands decreased in parallel and were completely eliminated by evacuation at room temperature. Subsequent adsorption of ethane regenerated the initial spectrum. This indicated a weak and reversible adsorption of ethane by the hydrogen form of the zeolite.</p>
<p>As follows from comparison of Figure 2 with Figure 3 a and b, the similar DRIFT bands were also observed after ethane adsorption by the zinc-modified HZSM-5 prepared either by reaction with zinc vapor or by conventional ion exchange. However, in addition to the narrow bands, DRIFT spectra of both zinc-modified zeolites also contained a very broad and a very strongly low-frequency-shifted band with a maximum at 2738 cm-1.</p>
<p>Our results also indicated that heating of both ZnZSM-5(vap) and ZnZSM-5(ex) at 423 K in an ethane atmosphere at 533 Pa resulted in diminishing of the intensities of all bands from the stronger form of ethane adsorption (Figure 5).</p>
<p>After evacuation of ethane at room temperature, three new bands with maxima at 2874, 2910, and 2958 cm-1 remained visible in the region of the CH stretching vibrations (the dotted line in Figure 5).</p>
<p>For better understanding of the mechanism of ethane dissociative adsorption and of ethane dehydrogenation, we also studied DRIFT spectra of the strongly adsorbed molecular species after heating at higher temperatures. As follows from Figure 6, after heating of the sample at temperatures up to 463 K at a very low ethane pressure of 0.7 Pa, the intensities of the bands of the stronger molecular form of ethane adsorption decreased.</p>

The study focuses on the DRIFT analysis of ethane adsorption by zinc cations in ZSM-5 zeolite, exploring the activation and dissociative adsorption processes. The research highlights the differences in DRIFT spectra between ethane adsorption by hydrogen form and zinc-modified forms of the zeolite. The authors observe unusual DRIFT bands indicative of strong polarization and subsequent chemical activation of ethane molecules upon adsorption by zinc cations, leading to ethane dehydrogenation at elevated temperatures. The use of relative intensities of IR stretching bands as a criterion for chemical activation is proposed as a novel approach to understand the mechanisms of heterogeneous acid-catalyzed reactions.
