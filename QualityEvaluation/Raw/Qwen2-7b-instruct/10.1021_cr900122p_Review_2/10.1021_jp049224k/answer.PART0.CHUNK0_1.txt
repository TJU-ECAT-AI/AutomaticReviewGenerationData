<p>The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations. For this purpose, we used HZSM-5 zeolites modified with zinc either by wet ion exchange or by high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor.</p>
<p>Adsorption of ethane at high equilibrium pressures by both hydrogen and zinc forms of ZSM-5 results in the appearance of four IR bands from the weakly adsorbed species instead of only two bands for gaseous ethane. The positions of the bands with maxima at 2974 and 2941 cm-1 are very close to those for the ν7 and ν10 CH stretching bands of gaseous ethane.</p>
<p>The most amazing feature of the stronger form of molecular ethane adsorption by zinc cations is the appearance of a very strongly low-frequency shifted very intense broad band with a maximum at 2734 cm-1. Due to the very strong change in the symmetry of the adsorbed species, the assignment of this band to the definite normal vibration is difficult.</p>
<p>In other words, interaction of ethane with zinc cations mainly results in selective activation of the CH stretching mode that corresponds to the most intense and most strongly low-frequency shifted broad IR band.</p>
<p>Therefore, polarization of chemical bonds plays the central role in the acid or acid-base catalysis.</p>
<p>Results of the present study provide the next example of this kind for the stronger molecular form of ethane adsorption connected with selective polarization of the most strongly perturbed CH stretching mode. At elevated temperatures, such polarization results in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane.</p>

The research focuses on the DRIFT study of ethane adsorption by zinc cations in ZSM-5 zeolites, both through wet ion exchange and high-temperature reaction with zinc vapor. The study reveals unusual spectra of adsorbed ethane species, characterized by weakly perturbed narrow bands in the region of CH stretching vibrations and a very intense broad IR band with a frequency significantly lower than those of gaseous or physically adsorbed ethane. This high-intensity band indicates strong polarization of the corresponding vibrational mode, which is closely connected to the subsequent heterolytic dissociation of ethane at moderate temperatures, forming acidic hydroxyl groups and zinc ethyl fragments. At higher temperatures, the zinc ethyl fragments decompose, leading to the formation of zinc hydrides and ethylene. The unusual DRIFT spectrum of ethane adsorption by zinc cations represents a new explanation for the anisotropy of polarizability of adsorbed molecules, suggesting the use of the relative intensities of IR bands as a reactivity index that correlates with the polarization of adsorbed molecules by active sites, thus affecting their chemical activation.

研究主要关注通过湿离子交换和高温与锌蒸汽反应在ZSM-5沸石中锌离子对乙烷吸附的DRIFT研究。研究揭示了吸附乙烷的异常光谱，包括弱扰动的窄带以及频率远低于气体或物理吸附乙烷的非常强的宽红外带。这种高度集中的带表明了对应振动模式的强烈极化，这与随后在适中的温度下乙烷的异裂性吸附紧密相关，形成酸性羟基团和锌乙基碎片。在较高温度下，锌乙基碎片分解，导致形成锌氢化物和乙烯。乙烷吸附于锌离子的非典型DRIFT光谱代表了吸附分子极化的各向异性，提出使用红外伸缩带相对强度作为活性位点极化吸附分子的反应性指数，从而影响它们的化学激活的新解释。
