<p>The main goal of the present work was a Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transforming (DRIFT) study of activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane by the above-noted zinc cations.</p>
<p>For spectral measurements, the granulated zeolites with particle dimensions of 0.51 mm were transferred into another part of the optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window.</p>
<p>In contrast, the intensity of the band from the silanol groups did not change. This indicates that replacement of only acidic protons by this preparation method included those hydrogen-bonded by the framework oxygen.</p>
<p>As follows from comparison of Figure 2 with Figure 3 a and b, the similar DRIFT bands were also observed after ethane adsorption by the zinc-modified HZSM-5 prepared either by reaction with zinc vapor or by conventional ion exchange.</p>
<p>After evacuation of ethane at room temperature, three new bands with maxima at 2874, 2910, and 2958 cm-1 remained visible in the region of the CH stretching vibrations (the dotted line in Figure 5).</p>
<p>The most amazing feature of the stronger form of molecular ethane adsorption by zinc cations is the appearance of a very strongly low-frequency shifted very intense broad band with a maximum at 2734 cm-1.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to classical electrodynamics any motion of an atomic system that is connected with a change of its dipole moment leads to emission or absorption of radiation.</p>

The research aimed to investigate the activation and dissociative adsorption of ethane using zinc cations in a zeolite catalyst. Spectral measurements were conducted on granulated zeolites with specific dimensions. The study revealed that only acidic protons were replaced during the preparation process, indicating hydrogen bonding with the framework oxygen. Similar DRIFT bands were observed for ethane adsorption whether the catalyst was prepared by reacting with zinc vapor or through conventional ion exchange. After evacuating ethane at room temperature, three new bands appeared in the CH stretching vibration region. The strongest feature of the stronger ethane adsorption was the emergence of a highly intense, broad band with a significantly low frequency shift. According to classical electrodynamics, any motion affecting a molecule's dipole moment results in the emission or absorption of radiation.

研究旨在通过锌离子在沸石催化剂中的作用，研究乙烷的活化和离解吸附。进行了特定尺寸颗粒状沸石的光谱测量。研究显示，仅酸性氢被替换，在准备过程中，这些氢与框架氧形成氢键。对于由锌蒸汽反应或通过常规离子交换制备的催化剂，观察到了相似的DRIFT带。在室温下抽真空后，CH伸缩振动区域出现了三个新的带。最强的特点是更强的乙烷吸附出现了一个高度强烈的宽带，具有显著的低频率偏移。根据经典电磁动力学，任何影响分子偶极矩的运动都会导致辐射的发射或吸收。
