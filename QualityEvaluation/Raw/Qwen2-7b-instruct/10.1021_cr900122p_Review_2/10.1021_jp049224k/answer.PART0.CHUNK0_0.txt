<p>Indeed, according to classical electrodynamics any motion of an atomic system that is connected with a change of its dipole moment leads to emission or absorption of radiation. Therefore, the intensities of the stretching IR bands are proportional to the squares of the first derivatives of the dipole moments created by the normal stretching vibrations over normal coordinates of these vibrations:17 In other words, intensities of the stretching bands are directly related to the polarizability of chemical bonds induced by interaction with the active sites.</p>
<p>In this connection, in addition to the commonly used low-frequency shifts, we suggest the use of the high intensities of most strongly perturbed IR bands as a criterion of chemical activation of adsorbed molecules in acid catalysis. Unlike low-frequency shifts of stretching vibrations that are proportional to the force constants of the ground states of chemical bonds, intensities of vibrational IR bands are directly connected with polarization of chemical bonds. Therefore, they better reflect the ability of adsorbed molecules for subsequent activation via polarization. In the case of acidbase catalysis, this is the main source of chemical activation.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations by affecting the ability of adsorbed molecules to become polarized. This polarization, reflected in the intensities of infrared (IR) stretching bands, serves as a criterion for chemical activation in acid catalysis. High intensities of these bands indicate strong activation, which leads to subsequent steps like dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane. The efficiency of these catalysts is thus tied to their ability to selectively polarize specific chemical bonds within adsorbed molecules, providing a unique opportunity for discussion of the selectivity of heterogeneous acid catalysis at the molecular level.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件通过影响吸附分子的极化能力，从而影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。这种极化，体现在红外（IR）拉伸谱带的强度上，作为酸催化中化学激活的指标。高强度的这些谱带表明了强烈的激活，进而导致后续步骤，如乙烷的解离吸附和脱氢。这些催化剂的效率与其能够选择性地极化吸附分子内特定化学键的能力密切相关，为在分子水平上讨论异相酸催化选择性的独特机会提供了可能性。
