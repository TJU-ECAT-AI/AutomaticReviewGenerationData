[1] "FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that form under thermal activation (called a-centers [7]) is able to perform single- turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide (N20) is the source of oxygen."
[2] "This system may be considered as a first successful model of MMO."
[3] "Low reaction temperature, high selectivity and high kinetic isotope effect reveal similar mechanistic features of both enzymatic and chemical methane oxidation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The use of nitrous oxide as the source of oxygen enables selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature, demonstrating high selectivity and kinetic isotope effect, similar to enzymatic methane oxidation. This system acts as a successful model of methane monooxygenase (MMO).

金属基催化剂，包括含铁复合物的FeZSM-5沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率产生了重大影响，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。使用氮氧化物作为氧源使甲烷在室温下选择性氧化为甲醇成为可能，展现出高选择性和同位素效应，与酶促甲烷氧化相似。这个系统可以被视为甲烷单加氧酶（MMO）的一个成功模型。
