<b>INTRODUCTION</b>: "Taking into account the well-known inertness of methane, which resists all traditional approaches to its selective oxidation by man-made catalysts, chemists focus their growing attention on understanding the mechanism of MMO catalysis to employ it for solving this most challenging problem of modern chemistry."
<b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>: "FeZSM-5 zeolite (SiOz/A1203 = 72, iron content 0.56 wt.%) active for methane hydroxylation was prepared via a conventional procedure of hydrothermal synthesis."
<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b>: "At temperatures lower than 573 K, N20 decomposition on a-centers quantitatively follows reaction (1): N2O + ( )c = (O)c + N2,(1) loading the active centers with co-oxygen [7]."
<b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>: "A control experiment showed that an "empty" surface of the zeolite was inert to methane: only an insignificant CH4 adsorption occurred upon contacting with the surface at room temperature."
<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b>: "in this case, methane is irreversibly consumed after opening of the microreactor at room temperature due to the reaction with a-oxygen."
<b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>: "We employed the following three-stage experimental scheme:"
<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b>: "To exclude any accidental source of methanol, we performed two experiments using L3C and 'SO isotopes."
<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b>: "These high values mean that the rate-determining step of methane oxidation by o-oxygen involves C-H bond cleavage similar to the MMO oxidation mechanism with its high KIE value."
<b>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</b>: "According to a quantum-chemical model [13], x-centers are binuclear iron complexes stabilized in the intracrystalline pore space of the zeolite matrix."
<b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>: "Results obtained by Mossbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted in favor of the FeZSM-5 similarity to MMO, Mossbauer technique is one of the most efficient tools for studying states of iron."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving iron complexes in zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations significantly. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites play crucial roles in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions due to their unique properties. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively transform alkanes into valuable products, high efficiency, and the potential for large-scale production. The presence of iron complexes in zeolites allows for the selective oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature, demonstrating a model of methane monooxygenase. The use of nitrogen oxide as an oxygen source in these reactions highlights the adaptability of these catalysts under various conditions. The quantum-chemical model suggests that these iron complexes might be binuclear, further supporting their resemblance to the active sites of natural methane monooxygenases. Mossbauer spectroscopy provides insights into the oxidation states of iron within these complexes, indicating similarities to the active sites of MMOs. The kinetic isotope effect observed in the reactions demonstrates that the rate-determining step involves C-H bond cleavage, similar to the MMO mechanism. The ability of these systems to perform single-turnover cycles at room temperature and the high selectivity suggest they are promising models for the development of industrial catalysts for alkane transformations.
