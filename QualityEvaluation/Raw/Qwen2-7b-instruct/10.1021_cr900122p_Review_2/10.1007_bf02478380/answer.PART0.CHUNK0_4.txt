[1] "FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that form under thermal activation (called a-centers [7]) is able to perform single- turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide (N20) is the source of oxygen."
[2] "The origin of carbon and oxygen in the product methanol was traced using 3C and SO isotopes."
[3] "This system may be considered as a first successful model of MMO."
[4] "Low reaction temperature, high selectivity and high kinetic isotope effect reveal similar mechanistic features of both enzymatic and chemical methane oxidation."

This research demonstrates that FeZSM-5 zeolite, with iron complexes forming under thermal activation, can selectively oxidize methane to methanol at room temperature using nitrous oxide as the oxygen source. The process is modeled as a successful representation of methane monooxygenase (MMO) activity, characterized by low reaction temperatures, high selectivity, and a high kinetic isotope effect, mirroring enzymatic methane oxidation mechanisms.

这项研究证明，经过热激活形成的铁复合物存在于沸石ZSM-5中，能够以室温下的氮氧化物作为氧气来源，选择性地将甲烷氧化为甲醇。该过程被视为成功的甲烷单氧酶（MMO）模型，其特征为较低的反应温度、高选择性和高的同位素效应，与酶促甲烷氧化机制具有相似性。
