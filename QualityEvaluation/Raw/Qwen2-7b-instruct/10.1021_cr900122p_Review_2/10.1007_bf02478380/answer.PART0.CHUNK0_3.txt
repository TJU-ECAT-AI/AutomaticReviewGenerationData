[1] "FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that form under thermal activation (called a-centers [7]) is able to perform single- turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide (N20) is the source of oxygen."
[2] "This system may be considered as a first successful model of MMO."
[3] "Low reaction temperature, high selectivity and high kinetic isotope effect reveal similar mechanistic features of both enzymatic and chemical methane oxidation."

The iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix, acting as a-center catalysts, enable the selective oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using nitrous oxide as the oxygen source. This system represents a pioneering model of methane monooxygenase, characterized by low reaction temperatures, high selectivity, and a high kinetic isotope effect, which mirrors the enzymatic methane oxidation process.

ZSM-5沸石矩阵中的铁络合物，作为a中心催化剂，在室温下通过使用一氧化二氮作为氧源实现甲烷的选择性氧化为甲醇。这个系统可以被视为成功的甲烷单加氧酶模型，其特征为较低的反应温度、高选择性和高的同位素效应，这与酶促甲烷氧化过程类似。
