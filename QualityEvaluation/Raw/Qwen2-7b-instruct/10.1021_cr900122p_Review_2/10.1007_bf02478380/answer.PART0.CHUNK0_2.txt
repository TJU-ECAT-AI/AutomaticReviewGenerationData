FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that form under thermal activation (called a-centers [7]) is able to perform single- turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide (N20) is the source of oxygen. This system may be considered as a first successful model of MMO.
