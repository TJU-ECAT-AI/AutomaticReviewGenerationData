The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the presence of surface hydride complexes of titanium (Ti) and zirconium (Zr) in reduced catalysts plays a crucial role. These complexes are formed upon treatment with hydrogen at specific temperatures, as evidenced by thermodesorption data. The amount of hydride complexes correlates with the catalyst's activity in hydrogenation reactions. For instance, the specific activity of Ti/SiOz catalysts towards benzene hydrogenation at 423 K is comparable to that of supported palladium (Pd) catalysts under similar conditions. Similarly, the Zr/SiO2 catalyst shows higher activity than Pd/SiO2 in benzene hydrogenation. The formation of Ti and Zr hydride complexes can be described by the schemes provided in the literature, involving the reduction of the metal ions and the formation of hydride bonds with the support surface. These findings highlight the importance of these catalysts in industrial applications due to their high activity and specificity in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。特别是，还原催化剂表面的钛（Ti）和锆（Zr）氢化物复合物在决定烷烃转化过程中的作用至关重要。这些复合物是在特定温度下通过与氢气处理形成的，这一点通过热脱附数据得到了证实。这些复合物的数量与催化剂在氢化反应中的活性成正比。例如，Ti/SiOz催化剂在423 K时对苯的氢化活性与在相似条件下支持的钯（Pd）催化剂相当。同样地，Zr/SiO2催化剂在苯的氢化活性上高于Pd/SiO2。Ti和Zr氢化物复合物的形成可以通过文献中提供的方案来描述，涉及金属离子的还原以及与支撑表面形成氢化物键的过程。这些发现强调了这些催化剂在工业应用中的重要性，因为它们在烷烃转化过程中具有高活性和特异性。
