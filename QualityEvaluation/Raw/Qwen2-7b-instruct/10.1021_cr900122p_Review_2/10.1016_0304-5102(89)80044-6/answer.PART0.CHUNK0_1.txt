The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. In the context of this study, the catalysts Ti/SiOz and Zr/SiOz showed high activity in hydrogenation reactions, with the specific activity being commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals. The high activity was attributed to the presence of anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, which could be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen. A correlation was found between the specific activity of the catalysts in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts. The catalysts reduced at 423 K contained approximately 1.5 - 2 atoms of hydrogen per ion of Ti or Zr, and the mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr was determined to be 3 and 4, respectively. The catalysts were found to be very active in benzene hydrogenation, with a specific activity close to that of supported Pd/SiOz catalysts. However, the specific activity tended to fall drastically with increasing reduction temperature. Despite this, the catalysts were highly active in cyclohexene hydrogenation, with Zr/SiOz showing a specific activity one order of magnitude smaller than Ti/SiOz under the same conditions. The high activity of these catalysts in alkane hydrogenation suggests their potential industrial significance in chemical processes.

在金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件的影响下，烷烃转化过程中的机制和效率得到了显著改善，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。在本研究中，Ti/SiOz 和 Zr/SiOz 催化剂在氢化反应中的活性非常高，其特定活性与支持的第VIII族金属相当。这种高活性归因于Ti和Zr的锚定氢化物复合物的存在，其含量可以通过改变氢处理温度进行控制。催化剂的特定活性与氢化反应中复合物的含量之间存在相关性。在423 K下还原的催化剂中含有大约1.5至2个氢原子/钛或锌离子，Ti和Zr的平均氧化数被确定为3和4。这些催化剂在苯氢化反应中表现出很高的活性，其特定活性接近支持的Pd/SiOz催化剂。然而，随着还原温度的升高，特定活性急剧下降。尽管如此，在环己烯氢化反应中，Zr/SiOz在相同条件下对特定活性的贡献比Ti/SiOz小一个数量级。这些催化剂在烷烃氢化方面的高活性表明它们在化学过程中的工业潜力。
