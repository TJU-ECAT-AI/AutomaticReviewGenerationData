[1] "Catalysts obtained by interacting Ti(CH₂CsH₅)₄ or Zr(A⁻⁻H₆)₄ with the surface of SiO₂ and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with respect to hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. This activity is commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals."
[2] "The catalysts were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen."
[3] "A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts."
[4] "The amount of desorbed hydrogen agrees within an accuracy of 20% with the amount of hydrogen in Ti/SiO₂ determined by the method of deuterium exchange."
[5] "The EXAFS data for Zr/SiO₂ catalysts reduced with H₂ at 423 - 873 K show a peak at (R - Si) = 1.48 ± 0.02 A, which has been attributed to the Zr-H distance in the surface Zr complex."
[6] "The specific activity of the Zr/SiO₂ catalyst, reduced with hydrogen at 423 K, with respect to benzene hydrogenation at 363 K is 0.02 s⁻¹ (to be compared with 3.3 × 10³ s⁻¹ for Pd/SiO₂ under the same conditions)."
[7] "In contrast, in cyclohexene hydrogenation the specific activity of Zr/SiO₂ reduced at 423 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that of Ti/SiO₂."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, specifically those involving titanium and zirconium complexes anchored onto silica surfaces, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. High activity in hydrogenation processes, comparable to that of Group VIII metals, is achieved by controlling the temperature during hydrogen treatment. This activity correlates quantitatively with the content of hydride complexes present on the catalyst surfaces. The EXAFS analysis reveals the presence of anchored hydride complexes on the catalysts, and the thermodesorption data confirm the amount of hydrogen attached to the catalyst surface. The specific activities of the catalysts for hydrogenation reactions are directly related to the content of these hydride complexes. For instance, the benzene hydrogenation activity of catalysts derived from titanium and zirconium shows high efficiency, especially when the treatment temperature is adjusted to control the hydride complex content. In contrast, the activities for cyclohexene hydrogenation vary depending on the metal used, with zirconium showing lower activity compared to titanium.
