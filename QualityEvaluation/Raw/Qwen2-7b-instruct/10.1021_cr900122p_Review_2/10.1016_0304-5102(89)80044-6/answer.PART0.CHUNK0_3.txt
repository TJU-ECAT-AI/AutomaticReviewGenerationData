[1] "Catalysts obtained by interacting Ti(CH₂CsH₅)₄ or Zr(A⁻⁻H)₄ with the surface of SiO₂ and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with respect to hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene."
[2] "This activity is commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals."
[3] "The catalysts were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen."
[4] "A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts."
[5] "In order to determine the nature of the active sites in EIV/SiO₂ catalysts (Elv = Ti or Zr) that are responsible for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenations, we compared the rates of these reactions with the content of Elv-H bonds in the catalysts."
[6] "The Ti/SiO₂ catalysts reduced at 423 K had a specific activity of 0.02 s⁻¹ for benzene hydrogenation, close to the specific activity of the supported Pd/SiO₂ catalyst under identical conditions."
[7] "The specific activity of the Zr/SiO₂ catalyst, reduced with hydrogen at 423 K, with respect to benzene hydrogenation at 363 K is 0.02 s⁻¹, six times more active than Pd/SiO₂ under the same conditions."
[8] "In cyclohexene hydrogenation, the specific activity of Zr/SiO₂ is one order of magnitude smaller than that of Ti/SiO₂."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Ti and Zr attached to SiO₂ surfaces and treated with hydrogen, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The high activity of these catalysts towards hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene is comparable to that of supported Group VIII metals. Controlling the content of anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr by adjusting the hydrogen treatment temperature leads to a quantitative correlation between the catalyst's specific activity in hydrogenation reactions and the hydride complex content. The active sites responsible for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenations are determined by comparing reaction rates with the content of Elv-H bonds in the catalysts. For instance, the Ti/SiO₂ catalyst shows a specific activity of 0.02 s⁻¹ for benzene hydrogenation at 423 K, closely matching that of a supported Pd/SiO₂ catalyst under similar conditions. The Zr/SiO₂ catalyst is notably more active than Pd/SiO₂ for benzene hydrogenation at 363 K, with a specific activity of 0.02 s⁻¹, but displays a much lower activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation compared to Ti/SiO₂.

金属基催化剂，如Ti和Zr附着在SiO₂表面并通过氢气处理，其组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转换的机制和效率有显著影响。这些催化剂在苯和环己烯氢化方面的高活性与支持的第Ⅷ族金属相当。通过调整氢处理温度控制Ti和Zr的锚定氢化物复合物含量，导致催化剂在氢化反应中的特定活性与氢化物复合物含量之间存在定量相关性。通过比较反应速率与催化剂中Elv-H键含量来确定负责苯和环己烯氢化的活性位点。例如，当Ti/SiO₂催化剂在423 K下氢化苯时显示出0.02 s⁻¹的特定活性，这与在相似条件下支持的Pd/SiO₂催化剂相当。相比之下，Zr/SiO₂催化剂在363 K下用于苯氢化时的特定活性为0.02 s⁻¹，比Pd/SiO₂在相同条件下更活跃，但在环己烯氢化方面显示出了远低于Ti/SiO₂的活性。
