[1] "Catalysts obtained by interacting Ti(CH&,H,)4 or Zr(A-&H& with the surface of SiOz and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with respect to hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. This activity is commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals."
[2] "The catalysts were studied by chemisorption, thermodesorption and EXAFS methods, and were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen."
[3] "A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts."
[4] "The Ti/SiOz catalysts were found to be very active with respect to benzene hydrogenation. When reduced with hydrogen at 423 K, the catalyst had a specific activity of 0.02 s-l. This value is close to the specific activity of the supported Pd/SiOs catalyst, which is about 0.1 s-l under identical conditions."
[5] "In contrast, in cyclohexene hydrogenation the specific activity of Zr/SiO, reduced at 423 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that of Ti/SiOz."
[6] "The presence of surface Ti-H and Zr-H complexes in reduced Eiv/ SiOz catalysts was shown earlier by means of IR spectroscopy."
[7] "The mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr in these samples determined from Oz adsorption is n = 3, 4."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Factors that contribute to their industrial significance include the presence of anchored hydride complexes of titanium (Ti) and zirconium (Zr) on the surface of silica (SiOz), which can be controlled by varying the temperature of treatment with hydrogen. A direct correlation exists between the specific activity of these catalysts in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes present. For instance, Ti/SiOz catalysts exhibit high activity in benzene hydrogenation, with specific activities comparable to supported Group VIII metals, whereas Zr/SiO catalysts show less activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation despite higher activity in benzene hydrogenation. The role of hydride complexes in the catalytic process is further substantiated by the presence of Ti-H and Zr-H complexes, as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. The mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr in the catalysts, determined through ozonation studies, provides insight into the electronic state of these metals and their contribution to the catalytic activity.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，在组成、结构和反应条件下的特性显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。这些因素对工业应用的贡献包括在二氧化硅（SiOz）表面上锚定的钛（Ti）和锆（Zr）氢化物复合物的存在，其活性可以通过改变与氢的处理温度来控制。催化剂在氢化反应中的特定活性与其氢化物复合物含量之间存在直接相关性。例如，Ti/SiOz催化剂在苯氢化反应中表现出高活性，其特定活性与支持的第VIII组金属相当；而Zr/SiO催化剂在环己烯氢化反应中的活性则较低，尽管在苯氢化反应中活性较高。通过红外光谱法进一步证实了氢化物复合物在催化过程中的作用。通过臭氧化研究确定的Ti和Zr的平均氧化态提供了有关这些金属电子状态及其对催化活性贡献的信息。
