[1] "Catalysts obtained by interacting Ti(CH₂CsH₅)₄ or Zr(A⁻⁻H₆)₄ with the surface of SiO₂ and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with respect to hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. This activity is commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals."
[2] "The catalysts were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen."
[3] "A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts."
[4] "The amount of desorbed hydrogen agrees within an accuracy of 20% with the amount of hydrogen in Ti/SiO₂ determined by the method of deuterium exchange."
[5] "The EXAFS data for Zr/SiO₂ catalysts reduced with H₂ at 423 - 873 K show a peak at (R - Si) = 1.48 ± 0.02 A, which has been attributed to the Zr-H distance in the surface Zr complex."
[6] "The specific activity of the Zr/SiO₂ catalyst, reduced with hydrogen at 423 K, with respect to benzene hydrogenation at 363 K is 0.02 s⁻¹ (to be compared with 3.3 × 10³ s⁻¹ for Pd/SiO₂ under the same conditions)."
[7] "In contrast, in cyclohexene hydrogenation the specific activity of Zr/SiO₂ reduced at 423 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that of Ti/SiO₂."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, specifically those involving titanium and zirconium complexes anchored onto silica surfaces, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. High activity in hydrogenation processes, comparable to that of Group VIII metals, is achieved by controlling the temperature during hydrogen treatment. This activity correlates quantitatively with the content of hydride complexes present on the catalyst surfaces. The EXAFS analysis reveals the presence of anchored hydride complexes on the catalysts, and the thermodesorption data confirm the amount of hydrogen attached to the catalyst surface. The specific activities of the catalysts for hydrogenation reactions are directly related to the content of these hydride complexes. For instance, the benzene hydrogenation activity of catalysts derived from titanium and zirconium shows high efficiency, especially when the treatment temperature is adjusted to control the hydride complex content. In contrast, the activities for cyclohexene hydrogenation vary depending on the metal used, with zirconium showing lower activity compared to titanium.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. In the context of this study, the catalysts Ti/SiOz and Zr/SiOz showed high activity in hydrogenation reactions, with the specific activity being commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals. The high activity was attributed to the presence of anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, which could be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment with hydrogen. A correlation was found between the specific activity of the catalysts in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes in these catalysts. The catalysts reduced at 423 K contained approximately 1.5 - 2 atoms of hydrogen per ion of Ti or Zr, and the mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr was determined to be 3 and 4, respectively. The catalysts were found to be very active in benzene hydrogenation, with a specific activity close to that of supported Pd/SiOz catalysts. However, the specific activity tended to fall drastically with increasing reduction temperature. Despite this, the catalysts were highly active in cyclohexene hydrogenation, with Zr/SiOz showing a specific activity one order of magnitude smaller than Ti/SiOz under the same conditions. The high activity of these catalysts in alkane hydrogenation suggests their potential industrial significance in chemical processes.

在金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件的影响下，烷烃转化过程中的机制和效率得到了显著改善，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。在本研究中，Ti/SiOz 和 Zr/SiOz 催化剂在氢化反应中的活性非常高，其特定活性与支持的第VIII族金属相当。这种高活性归因于Ti和Zr的锚定氢化物复合物的存在，其含量可以通过改变氢处理温度进行控制。催化剂的特定活性与氢化反应中复合物的含量之间存在相关性。在423 K下还原的催化剂中含有大约1.5至2个氢原子/钛或锌离子，Ti和Zr的平均氧化数被确定为3和4。这些催化剂在苯氢化反应中表现出很高的活性，其特定活性接近支持的Pd/SiOz催化剂。然而，随着还原温度的升高，特定活性急剧下降。尽管如此，在环己烯氢化反应中，Zr/SiOz在相同条件下对特定活性的贡献比Ti/SiOz小一个数量级。这些催化剂在烷烃氢化方面的高活性表明它们在化学过程中的工业潜力。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Factors that contribute to their industrial significance include the presence of anchored hydride complexes of titanium (Ti) and zirconium (Zr) on the surface of silica (SiOz), which can be controlled by varying the temperature of treatment with hydrogen. A direct correlation exists between the specific activity of these catalysts in hydrogenation reactions and the content of hydride complexes present. For instance, Ti/SiOz catalysts exhibit high activity in benzene hydrogenation, with specific activities comparable to supported Group VIII metals, whereas Zr/SiO catalysts show less activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation despite higher activity in benzene hydrogenation. The role of hydride complexes in the catalytic process is further substantiated by the presence of Ti-H and Zr-H complexes, as evidenced by IR spectroscopy. The mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr in the catalysts, determined through ozonation studies, provides insight into the electronic state of these metals and their contribution to the catalytic activity.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as Ti and Zr attached to SiO₂ surfaces and treated with hydrogen, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The high activity of these catalysts towards hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene is comparable to that of supported Group VIII metals. Controlling the content of anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr by adjusting the hydrogen treatment temperature leads to a quantitative correlation between the catalyst's specific activity in hydrogenation reactions and the hydride complex content. The active sites responsible for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenations are determined by comparing reaction rates with the content of Elv-H bonds in the catalysts. For instance, the Ti/SiO₂ catalyst shows a specific activity of 0.02 s⁻¹ for benzene hydrogenation at 423 K, closely matching that of a supported Pd/SiO₂ catalyst under similar conditions. The Zr/SiO₂ catalyst is notably more active than Pd/SiO₂ for benzene hydrogenation at 363 K, with a specific activity of 0.02 s⁻¹, but displays a much lower activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation compared to Ti/SiO₂.

金属基催化剂，如Ti和Zr附着在SiO₂表面并通过氢气处理，其组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转换的机制和效率有显著影响。这些催化剂在苯和环己烯氢化方面的高活性与支持的第Ⅷ族金属相当。通过调整氢处理温度控制Ti和Zr的锚定氢化物复合物含量，导致催化剂在氢化反应中的特定活性与氢化物复合物含量之间存在定量相关性。通过比较反应速率与催化剂中Elv-H键含量来确定负责苯和环己烯氢化的活性位点。例如，当Ti/SiO₂催化剂在423 K下氢化苯时显示出0.02 s⁻¹的特定活性，这与在相似条件下支持的Pd/SiO₂催化剂相当。相比之下，Zr/SiO₂催化剂在363 K下用于苯氢化时的特定活性为0.02 s⁻¹，比Pd/SiO₂在相同条件下更活跃，但在环己烯氢化方面显示出了远低于Ti/SiO₂的活性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the presence of surface hydride complexes of titanium (Ti) and zirconium (Zr) in reduced catalysts plays a crucial role. These complexes are formed upon treatment with hydrogen at specific temperatures, as evidenced by thermodesorption data. The amount of hydride complexes correlates with the catalyst's activity in hydrogenation reactions. For instance, the specific activity of Ti/SiOz catalysts towards benzene hydrogenation at 423 K is comparable to that of supported palladium (Pd) catalysts under similar conditions. Similarly, the Zr/SiO2 catalyst shows higher activity than Pd/SiO2 in benzene hydrogenation. The formation of Ti and Zr hydride complexes can be described by the schemes provided in the literature, involving the reduction of the metal ions and the formation of hydride bonds with the support surface. These findings highlight the importance of these catalysts in industrial applications due to their high activity and specificity in alkane transformations.
