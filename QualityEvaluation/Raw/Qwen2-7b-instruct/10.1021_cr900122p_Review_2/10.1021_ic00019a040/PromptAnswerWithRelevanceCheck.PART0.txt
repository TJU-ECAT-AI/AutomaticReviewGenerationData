It is apparent from the results presented in this paper that the crystallization of salts using large countercations may be successful even when the VJV, ratio falls to ca. 0.20, because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number. The size effect may play an important role in the isolation process, however, if the cation is highly polarizing and is capable of forming a binary compound with a high lattice energy. For example, Li+ salts of [MX,]" anions are thermodynamically unstable6 because of the high lattice ( I  I )  Mingos, D. M. P.; Rohl, A. L. To be published.

The size of the cation relative to the anion plays a crucial role in determining the success of crystallization. Even with a low volume ratio (VJV), salts can still be successfully crystallized if the structure achieves a close-packed arrangement through variation in coordination number. However, the size effect becomes more significant when the cation is highly polarizing and capable of forming a compound with a high lattice energy, as seen with Li+ salts of [MX,]" anions, which are thermodynamically unstable due to the high lattice energy.

从本文中呈现的结果可以看出，使用大阴离子结晶盐时，即使体积比（VJV）降至约0.20，也可能成功结晶，因为在固态结构可以通过改变配位数实现紧密排列。然而，在当阳离子极化性高且能够形成高晶格能化合物时，尺寸效应可能扮演着重要角色。例如，由于高晶格能，Li+盐类的[MX,]"阴离子是热力学不稳定的，因为其晶格能很高。</ChineseVersionAnswer>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The ability to stabilize unusual anionic coordination compounds often depends on the volume ratio between the cation and anion. Contrary to previous suggestions, there is no strict requirement for the cation and anion sizes to match precisely; in fact, the cation volume can exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6. The variation in coordination number might not be crucial for characterization but can significantly affect the magnetic, conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound. Additionally, the thermodynamic driving force for forming compounds is less critical when the molecular cation has a volume greater than or equal to the anion, due to the significant contribution of van der Waals forces to the lattice energy.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件可以显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机制和效率，如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。稳定异常配位化合物的能力通常取决于阴离子和阳离子的体积比。与以往的建议相反，并不需要严格匹配阴离子和阳离子的大小；实际上，阳离子体积可以超过阴离子体积的6倍。协调数的变化可能对表征不那么重要，但可以显著影响化合物的磁性、导电性和非线性光学性质。此外，在分子阳离子体积大于等于阴离子时，形成化合物的热力学驱动力会因为范德华力对晶格能的显著贡献而降低。

The crystallization of salts using large countercations can be successful even when the volume ratio (Vu/ V,) is as low as 0.20. This is because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number. For molecular cations with a volume equal to or greater than the anion, the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X- is less critical due to the significant contribution from van der Waals forces. The variation in coordination number might not be crucial for characterization purposes but can significantly impact the magnetic, conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound. Moments of inertia calculations offer objective criteria for assessing the shape characteristics of cations and anions.

It appears from the calculated anion to cation volume ratios given in Table Ill that the stabilization of unusual anionic coordination compounds may be achieved if the volume of the cation is greater than or equal to that of the anion. For example, in the series [NMe4I2[NiCI4],[NEt,],- [NiCI4], and [Ph3AsMeI2[NiCI4] the volume of the cation increases by a factor of 3 relative to that of the anion. The largest anion/cation volume ratio for the salts isolated as solids and listed in Table Ill is 1.10, and the smallest is 0.16. Therefore, contrary to previous suggestions, it is not necessary to match the cation and anion sizes with any great precision in order to stabilize unusual coordination environments and the cation volume may exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6. However, an anion with an unusual coordination environment is not likely to be isolated if Vu/ V, greatly exceeds 1.0. For example, the calculated Vu/ V, ratios for Li2NiC14 and K2NiCI4, which cannot be isolated, are 50 and 10, respectively.
These results have encouraged us to develop a set of "radius ratio rules" for interpreting the structures of molecular salts, and these results will be described in subsequent publications.

The crystallization of salts using large countercations may be successful even when the volume ratio (Va/Vc) falls to approximately 0.20, because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number. The size effect may play an important role in the isolation process, especially if the cation is highly polarizing and capable of forming a binary compound with a high lattice energy. For molecular cations M+ with a volume greater than or equal to that of the anion, there is a significant contribution to the lattice energy from van der Waals forces, reducing the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X-.

The variation in coordination number might not be crucial for characterization purposes but could significantly impact the magnetic, conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound. The moments of inertia calculated for cations and anions offer objective criteria for evaluating their shape characteristics. For instance, while [dienH3I3+] has a cylindrical shape and [Cr(NH3)6]3+ is effectively spherical, only the chromium complex stabilizes the [CuCI5I3-] ion due to their similar volumes but differing stabilities. The complex [Pt(NH3)4] [CuC14] exemplifies size and shape matching, with equal volumes of the cation and anion, suggesting discoidal geometries for better packing efficiency.

The size and shape factors provided in Tables I and II should inspire further studies on systems where the coordination geometry is influenced by the shape of the cation. Additionally, the complementary problem of stabilizing unusual cation geometries through selecting appropriate counteranions could also be addressed using the data provided.

在固体状态中，通过调整配位数可以实现紧密排列结构，即使体积比(Va/Vc)下降到约0.20，使用大阳离子结晶盐也可能成功。在这种情况下，尺寸效应可能在隔离过程中扮演重要角色，尤其是当阳离子高度极化并能够形成具有高晶格能的二元化合物时。对于体积大于或等于阴离子的分子阳离子M+，范德瓦尔斯力对晶格能有显著贡献，降低了形成M+X-的热力学驱动力。

配位数的变化可能对表征目的不那么关键，但可能显著影响化合物的磁性、导电性和非线性光学性质。计算出的阳离子和阴离子的惯量为评估它们的形状特征提供了客观标准。例如，虽然[dienH3I3+]具有柱状形状，而[Cr(NH3)6]3+是有效的球形，只有铬复合物稳定了[CuCI5I3-]离子，因为它们具有相似的体积但稳定性不同。复合物[Pt(NH3)4] [CuC14]是大小和形状匹配的一个特别有趣的例子，其中阳离子和阴离子的体积相等，暗示碟状几何形状可以提高[CuCI4]2-离子的包装效率。

提供的表格I和II中的大小和形状因素应该鼓励对系统进行进一步研究，这些系统中，配合物几何形状受到阳离子形状的影响。此外，可以通过选择合适的反离子来稳定异常阳离子几何形状的问题也可以使用提供的数据进行探讨。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts often rely on the precise matching of cation and anion sizes to stabilize unusual coordination environments. However, the document suggests that this matching does not always dominate the crystallization process. Instead, ions with significantly different volumes can efficiently pack within a crystal by adjusting their coordination numbers. This flexibility allows for the successful crystallization of salts even when the volume ratio (VJV) between cations and anions deviates considerably, such as falling to approximately 0.20. This indicates that the structure in the solid state can still achieve a close-packed arrangement, enabling effective alkane transformations under varying conditions.

The factors contributing to the industrial significance of these catalysts include their ability to handle alkane transformations efficiently, adaptability to different volume ratios, and the potential for stabilizing unusual coordination environments. The precise matching of cation and anion sizes is not a strict requirement, providing a broader scope for optimizing catalyst performance and efficiency in various industrial applications.

金属基催化剂，包括支持态钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件可以显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。这些催化剂通常依赖于阴离子和阳离子尺寸的精确匹配来稳定异常的配位环境。然而，文献表明，这种匹配在结晶过程中并不总是决定性的因素。相反，具有显著不同体积的离子可以通过调整它们的配位数在晶体中高效地排列。这种灵活性允许在VJV比率显著偏离的情况下成功结晶盐，如降至约0.20。这表明，在固体状态中仍然可以实现紧密堆积的结构，从而有效地进行烷烃转化，并且在不同的条件下。

这些催化剂在工业上的重要意义在于它们能够高效处理烷烃转化，适应不同的体积比，并有可能稳定异常的配位环境。精确匹配阴离子和阳离子的大小并非严格要求，为优化催化剂性能和效率提供了更广泛的范围，适用于各种工业应用。
