[1] "For example, Li2NiC14 and K2NiCI4, which cannot be isolated, have Vu/ V, ratios of 50 and 10, respectively."
[2] "Therefore, optimum conditions for crystallization are achieved when the cation is approximately equal to or larger in volume than the anion."
[3] "It is apparent from the results presented in this paper that the crystallization of salts using large countercations may be successful even when the VJV, ratio falls to ca. 0.20, because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number."
[4] "For molecular cations M+ with a volume greater than or equal to that of the anion, there is a significant contribution to the lattice energy from van der Waals forces and the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X- is less critical."

The crystallization of salts using large countercations can be successful even when the volume ratio (Vu/ V,) is as low as 0.20. This is because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number. For molecular cations with a volume equal to or greater than the anion, the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X- is less critical due to the significant contribution from van der Waals forces. The variation in coordination number might not be crucial for characterization purposes but can significantly impact the magnetic, conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound. Moments of inertia calculations offer objective criteria for assessing the shape characteristics of cations and anions.

当体积比（Vu/ V,）低至0.20时，使用大阴离子的盐结晶仍然可以成功。这是因为固体状态可以通过改变配位数来实现紧密排列结构。对于与阴离子体积相等或更大的分子阳离子，形成M+X-的动力学驱动力由于范德华力的显著贡献而不再那么关键。配位数的变化可能对表征目的并不重要，但可以显著影响化合物的磁性、导电性和非线性光学性质。通过计算离子的转动惯量，可以客观地评估它们的形状特性。
