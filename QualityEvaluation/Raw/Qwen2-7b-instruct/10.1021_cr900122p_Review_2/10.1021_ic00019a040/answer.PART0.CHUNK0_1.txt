[1] "It appears from the calculated anion to cation volume ratios given in Table Ill that the stabilization of unusual anionic coordination compounds may be achieved if the volume of the cation is greater than or equal to that of the anion."
[2] "Therefore, contrary to previous suggestions, it is not necessary to match the cation and anion sizes with any great precision in order to stabilize unusual coordination environments and the cation volume may exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6."
[3] "The variation in coordination number may not be important for characterizational purposes but could influence the magnetic,conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound significantly."
[4] "For molecular cations M+ with a volume greater than or equal to that of the anion, there is a significant contribution to the lattice energy from van der Waals forces and the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X- is less critical."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The ability to stabilize unusual anionic coordination compounds often depends on the volume ratio between the cation and anion. Contrary to previous suggestions, there is no strict requirement for the cation and anion sizes to match precisely; in fact, the cation volume can exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6. The variation in coordination number might not be crucial for characterization but can significantly affect the magnetic, conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound. Additionally, the thermodynamic driving force for forming compounds is less critical when the molecular cation has a volume greater than or equal to the anion, due to the significant contribution of van der Waals forces to the lattice energy.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件可以显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机制和效率，如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。稳定异常配位化合物的能力通常取决于阴离子和阳离子的体积比。与以往的建议相反，并不需要严格匹配阴离子和阳离子的大小；实际上，阳离子体积可以超过阴离子体积的6倍。协调数的变化可能对表征不那么重要，但可以显著影响化合物的磁性、导电性和非线性光学性质。此外，在分子阳离子体积大于等于阴离子时，形成化合物的热力学驱动力会因为范德华力对晶格能的显著贡献而降低。
