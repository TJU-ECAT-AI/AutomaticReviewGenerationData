[1] "The precise matching of the sizes of the cations and anions in molecular salts is not a dominating consideration in crystallization, since ions with quite different volumes can pack efficiently within a crystal by varying their coordination numbers."
[2] "For example, in the series [NMe4I2[NiCI4],[NEt,],- [NiCI4], and [Ph3AsMeI2[NiCI4] the volume of the cation increases by a factor of 3 relative to that of the anion."
[3] "Therefore, contrary to previous suggestions, it is not necessary to match the cation and anion sizes with any great precision in order to stabilize unusual coordination environments and the cation volume may exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6."
[4] "However, an anion with an unusual coordination environment is not likely to be isolated if Vu/ V, greatly exceeds 1.0."
[5] "It is apparent from the results presented in this paper that the crystallization of salts using large countercations may be successful even when the VJV, ratio falls to ca. 0.20, because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts often rely on the precise matching of cation and anion sizes to stabilize unusual coordination environments. However, the document suggests that this matching does not always dominate the crystallization process. Instead, ions with significantly different volumes can efficiently pack within a crystal by adjusting their coordination numbers. This flexibility allows for the successful crystallization of salts even when the volume ratio (VJV) between cations and anions deviates considerably, such as falling to approximately 0.20. This indicates that the structure in the solid state can still achieve a close-packed arrangement, enabling effective alkane transformations under varying conditions.

The factors contributing to the industrial significance of these catalysts include their ability to handle alkane transformations efficiently, adaptability to different volume ratios, and the potential for stabilizing unusual coordination environments. The precise matching of cation and anion sizes is not a strict requirement, providing a broader scope for optimizing catalyst performance and efficiency in various industrial applications.

金属基催化剂，包括支持态钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件可以显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。这些催化剂通常依赖于阴离子和阳离子尺寸的精确匹配来稳定异常的配位环境。然而，文献表明，这种匹配在结晶过程中并不总是决定性的因素。相反，具有显著不同体积的离子可以通过调整它们的配位数在晶体中高效地排列。这种灵活性允许在VJV比率显著偏离的情况下成功结晶盐，如降至约0.20。这表明，在固体状态中仍然可以实现紧密堆积的结构，从而有效地进行烷烃转化，并且在不同的条件下。

这些催化剂在工业上的重要意义在于它们能够高效处理烷烃转化，适应不同的体积比，并有可能稳定异常的配位环境。精确匹配阴离子和阳离子的大小并非严格要求，为优化催化剂性能和效率提供了更广泛的范围，适用于各种工业应用。
