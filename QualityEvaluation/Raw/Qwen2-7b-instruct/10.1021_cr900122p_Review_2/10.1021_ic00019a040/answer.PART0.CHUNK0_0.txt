It is apparent from the results presented in this paper that the crystallization of salts using large countercations may be successful even when the VJV, ratio falls to ca. 0.20, because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number. The size effect may play an important role in the isolation process, however, if the cation is highly polarizing and is capable of forming a binary compound with a high lattice energy. For example, Li+ salts of [MX,]" anions are thermodynamically unstable6 because of the high lattice ( I  I )  Mingos, D. M. P.; Rohl, A. L. To be published.

The size of the cation relative to the anion plays a crucial role in determining the success of crystallization. Even with a low volume ratio (VJV), salts can still be successfully crystallized if the structure achieves a close-packed arrangement through variation in coordination number. However, the size effect becomes more significant when the cation is highly polarizing and capable of forming a compound with a high lattice energy, as seen with Li+ salts of [MX,]" anions, which are thermodynamically unstable due to the high lattice energy.

从本文中呈现的结果可以看出，使用大阴离子结晶盐时，即使体积比（VJV）降至约0.20，也可能成功结晶，因为在固态结构可以通过改变配位数实现紧密排列。然而，在当阳离子极化性高且能够形成高晶格能化合物时，尺寸效应可能扮演着重要角色。例如，由于高晶格能，Li+盐类的[MX,]"阴离子是热力学不稳定的，因为其晶格能很高。</ChineseVersionAnswer>

Although the ions chosen in the table have relatively spherical geometries, similar considerations apply to ions with less symmetrical geometries.
These results have encouraged us to develop a set of "radius ratio rules" for interpreting the structures of molecular salts, and these results will be described in subsequent publications.
