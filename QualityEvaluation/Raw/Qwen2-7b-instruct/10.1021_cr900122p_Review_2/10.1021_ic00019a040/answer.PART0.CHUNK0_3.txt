It appears from the calculated anion to cation volume ratios given in Table Ill that the stabilization of unusual anionic coordination compounds may be achieved if the volume of the cation is greater than or equal to that of the anion. For example, in the series [NMe4I2[NiCI4],[NEt,],- [NiCI4], and [Ph3AsMeI2[NiCI4] the volume of the cation increases by a factor of 3 relative to that of the anion. The largest anion/cation volume ratio for the salts isolated as solids and listed in Table Ill is 1.10, and the smallest is 0.16. Therefore, contrary to previous suggestions, it is not necessary to match the cation and anion sizes with any great precision in order to stabilize unusual coordination environments and the cation volume may exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6. However, an anion with an unusual coordination environment is not likely to be isolated if Vu/ V, greatly exceeds 1.0. For example, the calculated Vu/ V, ratios for Li2NiC14 and K2NiCI4, which cannot be isolated, are 50 and 10, respectively.
These results have encouraged us to develop a set of "radius ratio rules" for interpreting the structures of molecular salts, and these results will be described in subsequent publications.

The crystallization of salts using large countercations may be successful even when the volume ratio (Va/Vc) falls to approximately 0.20, because the structure in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by varying the coordination number. The size effect may play an important role in the isolation process, especially if the cation is highly polarizing and capable of forming a binary compound with a high lattice energy. For molecular cations M+ with a volume greater than or equal to that of the anion, there is a significant contribution to the lattice energy from van der Waals forces, reducing the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X-.

The variation in coordination number might not be crucial for characterization purposes but could significantly impact the magnetic, conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound. The moments of inertia calculated for cations and anions offer objective criteria for evaluating their shape characteristics. For instance, while [dienH3I3+] has a cylindrical shape and [Cr(NH3)6]3+ is effectively spherical, only the chromium complex stabilizes the [CuCI5I3-] ion due to their similar volumes but differing stabilities. The complex [Pt(NH3)4] [CuC14] exemplifies size and shape matching, with equal volumes of the cation and anion, suggesting discoidal geometries for better packing efficiency.

The size and shape factors provided in Tables I and II should inspire further studies on systems where the coordination geometry is influenced by the shape of the cation. Additionally, the complementary problem of stabilizing unusual cation geometries through selecting appropriate counteranions could also be addressed using the data provided.

在固体状态中，通过调整配位数可以实现紧密排列结构，即使体积比(Va/Vc)下降到约0.20，使用大阳离子结晶盐也可能成功。在这种情况下，尺寸效应可能在隔离过程中扮演重要角色，尤其是当阳离子高度极化并能够形成具有高晶格能的二元化合物时。对于体积大于或等于阴离子的分子阳离子M+，范德瓦尔斯力对晶格能有显著贡献，降低了形成M+X-的热力学驱动力。

配位数的变化可能对表征目的不那么关键，但可能显著影响化合物的磁性、导电性和非线性光学性质。计算出的阳离子和阴离子的惯量为评估它们的形状特征提供了客观标准。例如，虽然[dienH3I3+]具有柱状形状，而[Cr(NH3)6]3+是有效的球形，只有铬复合物稳定了[CuCI5I3-]离子，因为它们具有相似的体积但稳定性不同。复合物[Pt(NH3)4] [CuC14]是大小和形状匹配的一个特别有趣的例子，其中阳离子和阴离子的体积相等，暗示碟状几何形状可以提高[CuCI4]2-离子的包装效率。

提供的表格I和II中的大小和形状因素应该鼓励对系统进行进一步研究，这些系统中，配合物几何形状受到阳离子形状的影响。此外，可以通过选择合适的反离子来稳定异常阳离子几何形状的问题也可以使用提供的数据进行探讨。
