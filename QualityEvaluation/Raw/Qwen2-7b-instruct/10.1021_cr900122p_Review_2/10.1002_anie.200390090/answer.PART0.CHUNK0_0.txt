[1] "The cover picture shows the linking position of surface organometallic chemistry between the two traditional areas of catalysis."
[2] "The transfer of the concepts and tools of molecular organometallic chemistry to surfaces leads to the generation of well-defined surface species."
[3] "The success of this approach results from understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support."
[4] "More about this field can be found in the review by Copret, Basset, et al. on page 156ff."
