          Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support material is crucial for the success of surface organometallic chemistry in catalysis. This knowledge enables the generation of well-defined surface species, which significantly influences the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

          The success of using metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, in alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, is largely attributed to the understanding of how organometallic complexes interact with the support material. For more detailed insights, refer to the review article by Copret, Basset, et al., starting from page 156.
