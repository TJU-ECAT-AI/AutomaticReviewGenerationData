The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to generate well-defined surface species through the application of molecular organometallic chemistry principles. Understanding how these organometallic complexes react with the support material is essential for achieving successful catalytic processes. Detailed insights into this field can be found in the review article authored by Copret, Basset, et al., which is located on pages 156ff.
