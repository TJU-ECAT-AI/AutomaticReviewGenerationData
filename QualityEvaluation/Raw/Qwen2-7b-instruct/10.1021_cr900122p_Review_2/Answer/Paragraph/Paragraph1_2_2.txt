Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/cr00083a003], [10.1016/0304-5102(80)80085-x], [10.1016/0926-860x(96)00120-2], [10.1021/cr00083a003], [10.1002/anie.200390090], [10.1021/jp071409e], [10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5], [10.1021/jp065911v], [10.1039/b103147n], [10.1021/ja0493547], [10.1006/jcat.1997.1712], [10.1021/jp072110z], [10.1021/jp056228w], [10.1016/s0926-860x(98)00114-8], [10.1002/anie.200702463], [10.1016/0926-860x(92)80336-b].

        The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. Hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments enhance catalyst activity and selectivity, with H2 promoting dispersion and O2 anchoring dispersed metal species. Gallium species' dispersion improves catalytic performance, combining with Brönsted acid sites from zeolites. Oxygen treatment stabilizes these dispersed species, optimizing catalytic activity. Propane aromatization benefits from the evolution of aromatisation selectivity and the average H/C ratio, demonstrating the industrial significance of these catalysts in petrochemical processes.

        The industrial significance of these catalysts is rooted in their ability to efficiently transform alkanes under controlled conditions, enhancing yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes. Challenges like achieving selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems underscore the field's complexity. The ongoing research aims to overcome these challenges, making tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization more feasible.

        Metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. For instance, a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound is utilized in the mild, aqueous, aerobic catalytic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and acetaldehyde, demonstrating the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformations.

        Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700°C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo, suggesting Mo2C as the active center for methane activation. Post-steady state, about 60-80% of Mo species are Mo2C, while 20-30% remain as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and are not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for many hours. The formation of Mo2C correlates with the benzene production phase, indicating its active role. Notably, a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be responsible for the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

        The study investigates ethane dehydrogenation over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite, focusing on activation mechanisms. Activation occurs via heterolytic dissociation or oxidation by extralattice oxygen, both favored thermodynamically and kinetically over reduced gallium species. However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult. Key side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed.

        Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favors the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties. Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors like catalyst composition and structure, along with reaction conditions, determine efficiency.

        In studying partial methane oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts, three types of tungsten species were identified, differing in dispersion based on tungsten loading. This dispersion impacts catalyst activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. Key findings reveal the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The quotes highlight the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, and WO3 crystallites, their relative amounts varying with tungsten loading, and their role in the catalytic conversion process.

        The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium complexes compared to mononuclear gallium species. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the increased catalytic activity.

        Gallium in metal-based catalysts, specifically in materials like Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates, primarily boosts rates of alkene, diene, and cycloalkene dehydrogenation. Its dispersion and oxidation state within zeolite channels significantly influence the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio indicating these rates. Challenges in propane aromatization, characterized by the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics and coking, highlight the complexities in catalyst design.

        Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. Ethane adsorption results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, leading to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide. It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

        The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption.

        金属基催化剂，尤其是支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转换机制和效率产生显著影响，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程中。氢（H2）和氧气（O2）预处理增强催化剂活性和选择性，H2促进分散，O2锚定分散金属物种。镓物种的分散改善了催化性能，结合了沸石中的布隆斯特酸位点。氧气处理稳定这些分散物种，优化催化活性。丙烷芳香化得益于芳香化选择性和平均H/C比率的演变，这表明这些催化剂在石油化工过程中的工业重要性。

        这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够在控制条件下高效地转化烷烃，提高合成化学和石油化学过程中的产率和选择性。实现选择性的碳氢化合物功能化和解决机制问题揭示了该领域的复杂性。正在进行的研究旨在克服这些挑战，使可调的选择性碳氢化合物功能化更加可行。

        金属基催化剂，包括支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转换机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。例如，一种支持的双吡啶基铂聚氧钼酸盐杂合化合物用于温和、水性、有氧催化氧化甲烷以生成甲醇和乙醛，这证明了这些催化剂在烷烃转换中的工业重要性。

        2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 催化剂暴露于 CH4 或 CH4/H2 在 700°C 下会导致 Mo 离子还原为 Mo2C，而不是金属 Mo，暗示 Mo2C 是甲烷活化的作用中心。在稳态后，大约 60-80% 的 Mo 物种是 Mo2C，而 20-30% 保持为 Mo4+ 和 Mo5+ 并且即使在 CH4 或 CH4/H2 中处理数小时也不被还原。Mo2C 形成与苯生产阶段相关，表明其活跃作用。值得注意的是，焦炭修饰的 Mo2C 表面可能是形成作为反应中间体的乙烯的真正活性物种。

        研究了等温下 W/HZSM-5 催化剂上部分甲烷氧化至甲醛的过程，发现了三种不同的钨物种，根据钨负载量差异。这种分散影响催化剂活性和甲醛生产的选择性。关键发现揭示了 HCOH、CO、CO2 和 H2O 的形成。从高频率的低频偏移可以看出，吸附分子受到 Cu+ 离子在 CuZSM-5 中的一部分的强烈扰动。当乙烷吸附时，吸附分子受到非常强烈的扰动，导致 CH 拉伸带的非常大的红移，这是以前在任何阳离子形式的沸石或氧化物上吸附的乙烷从未观察到的现象。结论是，吸附在交换的一价铜离子上的 C2H6 分子的这种不寻常性质是由形成相当强的 s 型吸附复合物的结果。

        总结了上述讨论的实验数据，显示了独立于制备方法，Cu+ 含量的 ZSM-5 硅铝酸盐具有非常相似的吸附特性。Cu+ 离子在 CuZSM-5 中的部分吸附导致吸附分子的非常强的扰动，从相应的 HH 拉伸频率的非常强的低频偏移中明显可见。还表明 Cu+ 离子吸附的分子数量略少于强 N2 吸附的位点数量。
