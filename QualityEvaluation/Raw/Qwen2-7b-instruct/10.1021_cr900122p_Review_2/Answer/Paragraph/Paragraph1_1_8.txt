        Metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides, play a pivotal role in alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation, facilitated by the initial hydrogen abstraction step at vanadyl sites, forming a diradical intermediate. Propene production follows via sequential hydrogen abstractions, with the first step being rate-limiting. The mechanism aligns with experimental data, indicating higher activity of bulk vanadia sites compared to monomers on silica surfaces. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in determining efficiency and industrial significance.
        
        Similarly, the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound exemplifies the effectiveness of these catalysts in converting methane to methanol and acetaldehyde, underscoring their industrial significance. Under conditions such as mildness, aqueous medium, and aerobic environment, catalyst efficiency is enhanced. The comparative analysis of both turnover frequency (TOF) and activation energies demonstrates the compatibility of the suggested mechanism with known observations.

        Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts exhibit reversible deactivation under certain conditions but become more selective at the end of the catalytic bed due to increased oxidation. The redox properties of the feed significantly affect the catalyst's surface oxidation state, impacting product formation. Factors like oxygen concentration, vanadium(V) species, and phosphorus content control catalyst efficiency in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation. Enhanced selectivity and product formation are observed with optimized catalyst conditions, highlighting the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts.

        Recent advancements have elucidated the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in metal oxide catalysts, revealing insights into their reactivity during hydrocarbon oxidation. Key findings highlight the critical role of bond types—terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support—on the turnover frequency (TOF), with the latter being the most influential. The oxide support's phase and preparation method do not significantly impact the surface vanadia species' structure or reactivity. The number of vanadia sites required varies based on the specific reactant molecule, emphasizing the importance of site quantity in alkane transformations.

        This study investigates the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and deuteration using silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts. Faster reaction rates for primary C-H bonds compared to secondary ones, a degenerate activation mechanism, and high selectivity indicating a thermally equilibrated mixture of compounds are key findings. The absence of a kinetic isotope effect during mass spectrometry suggests a straightforward activation process. The deuteration of propane after 7 turnovers in 72 hours at 120°C showcases the catalyst's efficiency, underscoring the industrial relevance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

        Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations, notably in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. Their industrial significance stems from their ability to convert alkanes into higher-value products efficiently. Key factors affecting their performance include catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, and selectivity, which are optimized through tailored compositions and structures. Supported vanadium oxides excel in oxidative dehydrogenation due to their active sites, while metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity, enhancing product yield and selectivity.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest due to its importance in industrial catalysis. Our calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia. The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method, Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties, and adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 leads to significant perturbations in adsorbed molecules, indicated by shifts in HH stretching frequencies.

        Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit consistent adsorption properties across different preparation methods, and ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, a novel observation attributed to the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations. These findings underscore the pivotal role of Cu+ ions in modulating adsorption dynamics, impacting the efficiency of alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

        The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity.

        The addition of steam to the feed strongly increases the activity, with the main product remaining propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom.

        The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme 1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

        Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%. Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites.

        The success of this approach results from understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support, and understanding these reactions is crucial for the success of this approach. It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C.

        The transfer of the concepts and tools of molecular organometallic chemistry to surfaces leads to the generation of well-defined surface species, understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support leads to the creation of defined surface species, and the success of this approach results from understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support. Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support is fundamental for alkane transformation efficiency, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes.

        Gallium in extra-framework positions accelerates alkene, diene, and cycloalkene dehydrogenation. Its dispersion and oxidation state within zeolite channels significantly influence alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking rates, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio indicating these rates. Challenges in propane aromatization and the formation of secondary products like Cα aromatics indicate issues with coking. Gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction, but the most active catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

        Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature. Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane.

        Demand for maleic anhydride, crucial in manufacturing unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, is set to grow over the next five years, driven by new applications. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites act as catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases transform into (VO)2P207 upon interaction with hydrocarbons. Enhanced Vv formation at the catalyst bed's end is attributed to a more oxidizing environment.

        Several factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts, including high activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for chemical production. Their resilience against degradation and recyclability add to their industrial value.

        Current challenges are discussed, including a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization that is still out of reach and resolving mechanistic problems that have proved particularly challenging. Resolving these challenges could lead to more efficient and versatile catalysts, further enhancing their industrial significance.

        A comprehensive DFT study on the activation of light alkanes over zinc species stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability under diverse conditions, as supported by studies and quotes.

        The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) models oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite sites. Initial activation pathways include heterolytic dissociation and oxidation by extralattice oxygen, favored over reduced gallium species. Regeneration of GaO+ is challenging, and side reactions involving ethanol conversion occur. Key factors influencing catalyst efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes include activation mechanisms, regeneration difficulties, and the role of side reactions.

        Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700°C results in the formation of Mo2C, not metallic Mo. Approximately 60-80% of Mo species exist as Mo2C post-reaction stabilization, with the remaining 20-30% as Mo4+ and Mo5+. Mo2C's formation aligns with the activation of methane for benzene production, suggesting it acts as an active center. However, a coke-modified Mo2C surface might be the actual active species in forming ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

        These insights into the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, contribute to a comprehensive understanding of their roles in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. This knowledge is foundational for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, driving innovation in the petrochemical and chemical industries.
