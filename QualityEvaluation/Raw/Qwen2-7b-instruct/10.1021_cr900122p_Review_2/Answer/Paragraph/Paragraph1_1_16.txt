            Metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation, facilitated by the initial hydrogen abstraction step at vanadyl sites, forming a diradical intermediate. Propene production follows via sequential hydrogen abstractions, with the first step being rate-limiting. The mechanism aligns with experimental data, indicating higher activity of bulk vanadia sites compared to monomers on silica surfaces. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in determining efficiency and industrial significance.

            Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts exhibit reversible deactivation under certain conditions but become more selective at the end of the catalytic bed due to increased oxidation. The redox properties of the feed significantly affect the catalyst's surface oxidation state, impacting product formation. Factors like oxygen concentration, vanadium(V) species, and phosphorus content control catalyst efficiency in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation. Enhanced selectivity and product formation are observed with optimized catalyst conditions, highlighting the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts.

            Recent advancements have elucidated the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in metal oxide catalysts, revealing insights into their reactivity during hydrocarbon oxidation. Key findings highlight the critical role of bond types—terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support—on the turnover frequency (TOF), with the latter being the most influential. The oxide support's phase and preparation method do not significantly impact the surface vanadia species' structure or reactivity. The number of vanadia sites required varies based on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions necessitating multiple vanadia sites are highly sensitive to surface coverage and additive presence. Acidic and basic additives affect selectivity, though the impact is reaction-specific. Vanadia bond characteristics and site quantity significantly influence the efficiency of alkane transformations through processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, underscoring the industrial significance of these catalysts.

            This study investigates the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and deuteration using silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts. Key findings include faster reaction rates for primary C-H bonds compared to secondary ones, a degenerate activation mechanism, and a high selectivity indicating a thermally equilibrated mixture of compounds. The absence of a kinetic isotope effect during mass spectrometry suggests a straightforward activation process. The deuteration of propane after 7 turnovers in 72 hours at 120°C showcases the catalyst's efficiency. These insights underscore the industrial relevance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

            Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations' mechanisms and efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. Their industrial significance stems from their ability to convert alkanes into higher-value products efficiently. Key factors affecting their performance include catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, and selectivity, which are optimized through tailored compositions and structures. Supported vanadium oxides excel in oxidative dehydrogenation due to their active sites, while metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity, enhancing product yield and selectivity. Research continues to enhance catalyst performance, aiming to improve stability and reduce energy consumption, thereby sustaining their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

            The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Key to the mechanism is the enhanced conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes, attributed to the exothermic water dissociation leading to formation of structureII containing [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ions. The EXAFS analysis supports the structure of Ga+/ZSM-5, with averaged distances and coordination numbers. The catalytic cycle initiates with desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form GaO+ ions, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of gallium-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

            The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with varying tungsten loadings, revealing distinct tungsten species that influence catalyst activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction forms HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O, with the nature of supported tungsten species varying significantly with loading. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition and structure in alkane transformation processes, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, emphasizing the industrial significance of optimized catalyst design.

            Understanding the reactions between organometallic complexes and catalyst supports is fundamental for alkane transformation efficiency, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. This knowledge enables the creation of well-defined surface species, crucial for mechanism and efficiency. Quotes underscore the pivotal role of understanding these interactions in achieving successful catalyst performance, highlighting its industrial significance.

            Gallium in extra-framework positions accelerates alkene, diene, and cycloalkene dehydrogenation. Its dispersion and oxidation state within zeolite channels significantly influence alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking rates, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio indicating these rates. Challenges in propane aromatization and the formation of secondary products like Cα aromatics indicate issues with coking. Gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction, but the most active catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. Differences in catalytic performance among MFI materials, especially in selectivities to aromatics and methane, are pronounced. The redox cycle of gallium-exchanged materials is reproduced in DSC analysis, showing the drying/reduction phase. Challenges include incomplete reduction and oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen, impacting catalyst performance.

            Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature. Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane. Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures. Although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, polymerization of these olefins was not observed. We propose a mechanism to account for the catalytic activity shown by supported species, involving supported dialkyl species. When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation to butane was complete within 30 h. Catalyst lifetime is shorter under hydrogenation conditions than that observed in isomerization experiments.

            Demand for maleic anhydride, crucial in manufacturing unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, is set to grow over the next five years, driven by new applications. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites act as catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases transform into (VO)2P207 upon interaction with hydrocarbons. Enhanced Vv formation at the catalyst bed's end is attributed to a more oxidizing environment. Kinetic studies by Buchanan, Sundaresan, and Lerou confirm minimal dependency on hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio changes. An increase in oxygen concentration boosts Vv formation and maleic anhydride production rate, highlighting the efficiency of these catalysts in alkane transformations.

            A comprehensive DFT study on the activation of light alkanes over zinc species stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability under diverse conditions, as supported by studies and quotes.

            The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases are transformed to (VO)2P207 by reaction with the hydrocarbon mixture. These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present. The kinetics results of Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou fit catalysts of this type. They show very little dependence of the catalytic behavior on a change of the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio. An increase in the oxygen concentration results in an increase in the amount of Vv and of the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

            Current challenges are discussed. Resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging. Tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach.

            Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties.
