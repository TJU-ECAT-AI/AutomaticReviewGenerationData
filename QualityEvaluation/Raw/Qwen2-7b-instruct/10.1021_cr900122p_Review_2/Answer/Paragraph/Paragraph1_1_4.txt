        Metal-based catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Their industrial importance stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into higher-value products. Key factors include catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, and product selectivity. Studies reveal that supported vanadium oxides are effective due to their high surface area, enabling active sites for desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity for optimized reaction conditions. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving stepwise adsorption and desorption, highlights the efficiency of these catalysts. Challenges include lowering reaction barriers, which can be influenced by interactions with support materials and concerted reactions with oxygen. Research continues to enhance catalyst performance, aiming to improve selectivity, stability, and energy efficiency, crucial for industrial applications and environmental impact mitigation.

        Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials. The calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia.

        Under these conditions, as in the case of bubl-ene, the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deactivates, but becomes more selective. It is thus worthwhile to analyze the variations in the catalyst surface as a function of position in the catalytic bed. These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present. On equilibrated catalysts, this effect is much less evident, due to the reduced rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv.

        Mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst. In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation, or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst.

        The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond, the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude.

        The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites.

        Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts' behavior in alkane transformations, notably oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, is influenced by conditions like oxygen concentration, vanadium(V) species presence, and feed's redox properties. Catalysts exhibit irreversible deactivation, enhanced selectivity at the end of the catalytic bed, and form partial oxidation products under low oxygen conditions. Phosphorus content affects the catalyst's oxidation and reduction rates, correlating with its redox properties and catalytic behavior.

        In studying the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts, three types of supported tungsten species were identified, showing significant variation with tungsten loading. These species affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction results in HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O, with the mechanism widely explored. The dispersion of tungsten influences the catalyst's performance, highlighting its role in the conversion efficiency.

        Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations' mechanisms and efficiency, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Understanding the interactions between organometallic complexes and support materials is crucial for generating well-defined surface species, which enhances catalytic activity. This approach's success hinges on comprehending how organometallic complexes react with the support, as highlighted by quotes emphasizing the pivotal role of such reactions in surface organometallic chemistry for catalysis.

        Density functional theory elucidates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, focusing on vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane models. Key steps include hydrogen abstraction forming a diradical intermediate, with a propyl radical binding to a HOVIV site. Propene is directly produced through subsequent hydrogen abstraction. At 750 K, the activation energy for the first step aligns with experiments, supporting the proposed mechanism. Calculations indicate that bulk vanadia sites are more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation compared to monomers on silica. This mechanism, validated by its alignment with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, underscores the importance of surface chemistry in catalysis.

        The study examines the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as models for oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. Initial activation can occur through heterolytic dissociation or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom, forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. These pathways are favored over activation over reduced gallium species. However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult. In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are discussed.

        Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature. Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane. Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures. Although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, polymerization of these olefins was not observed. We propose a mechanism to account for the catalytic activity shown by supported species, involving supported dialkyl species.

        When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation to butane was complete within 30 h. Catalyst lifetime is shorter under hydrogenation conditions than that observed in isomerization experiments.

        Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach. Resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging.

        The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption. The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data. It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide. It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

        Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity. The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment. Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity. These physical and chemical transformations of gallium species are responsible for the activity-selectivity changes in the initial reaction-regeneration cycles of propane aromatisation at 823 K. The enhancement in catalytic performance is mostly due to Ga redispersion as evidenced by RBS data. As seen from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3, the improvement in activity is much more drastic for Z356 SL1 than for Z234 SL2 after the first H2-O2 treatment. The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity and average H/C ratio are consistent with the view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BriSnsted sites favour propane activation and aromatisation whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. Ga2O3, at the outer surface of the crystallites is mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) the need for carbon chain growth via acid-catalysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisation. Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties.

        It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600°C. Therefore, the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking; the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems. Secondary products such as Ca+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and therefore coking is also a problem. The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction; and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. For this probe reaction, differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced [12,131. We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs. The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/reduction portion shown in Fig. 6. Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen; however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor.

        The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

        Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700°C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (20-30%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for many hours. The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane. Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

        A comprehensive DFT study on the activation of light alkanes over zinc species stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts play a crucial role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites have been extensively studied for their potential in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Several factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts, including high activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions.

        金属基催化剂，特别是支持的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石，显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。它们的工业重要性源于它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为更高价值的产品。关键因素包括催化剂稳定性、成本效益和产物选择性。研究表明，支持的钒氧化物因其高比表面积而有效，这使得活性位点适合所需的化学转换。金属交换的沸石提供了可定制的酸性和碱性以优化反应条件。火星-范克里夫机制，涉及分步吸附和脱附，突出了这些催化剂的效率。降低反应势能表面的障碍，包括与支撑材料的钒氧化物簇的相互作用和与氧的协同反应，是讨论的重点。研究继续提高催化剂性能，旨在提高选择性、稳定性和能源效率，这对于工业应用和环境影响减少至关重要。

        可能降低潜在能量表面障碍的因素，包括与支撑材料的钒氧化物簇的相互作用和与氧的协同反应，是讨论的重点。这项研究为支持的钒催化剂的活性提供洞察，并为这些材料的未来计算调查提供了基础。计算表明，V2O5的(010)表面对丙烷ODH不利，其他因素，如支撑材料的影响，才是实验观察到的范德催化剂活性的原因。

        在这些条件下，正如在bubl-ene的情况下，vanadyl磷酸盐催化剂迅速且不可逆地失活，但变得更为选择性。因此，分析催化剂表面随催化床位置的变化是值得的。这些结果表明，在催化剂床尾部形成增强的Vv直接归因于更氧化的气氛存在。在平衡催化剂上，这种效应在减少的范德氧化到Vv的速率下变得不那么明显。

        在温和、水性、有氧、催化氧化甲烷生成甲醇和乙醛的过程中，使用了支持的二吡啶基铂聚氧化物杂合化合物作为催化剂。在丁烷和丁-1-烯的氧化中，低氧浓度下，少量的钒(V)物种存在于催化剂表面上时，可以观察到部分氧化产物（丁-2-烯在丁-1-烯氧化中的产生或丁烯和丁-2-烯在丁烷氧化中的产生）。

        终端V=O键似乎不会在烃氧化反应期间的表面范德亚物种的关键反应性质。桥接V-O-V键也影响许多氧化反应，但对于可能受此桥接键影响的那些反应，TOF仅可能增加一个数量级。桥接V-O支持键，然而，似乎是最重要的键，因为其性质可以改变氢碳氧化反应的TOF高达四数量级。

        氧化物支持的特定相以及特定准备方法似乎不影响表面范德亚物种的分子结构或反应性。烷烃氧化反应所需的表面范德亚物种的数量取决于特定反应分子。仅需要一个表面范德亚物种的氧化反应通常不依赖于表面范德亚物种的覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在。需要多个表面范德亚物种的氧化反应对表面范德亚物种的覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在非常敏感。但是，相互作用的添加剂影响所有烷烃氧化反应，因为它们修改了表面范德亚物种。

        钨在金属基催化剂中，特别是在沸石中，通过增强乙烯、二烯或环烯的脱氢作用来显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率。高表面面积Gaz03和蒸汽处理的高尔洛硅酸盐本身可以在500-600°C的温度范围内显著地使直链二烯、1-己烯和环己烯芳香化。因此，镓在沸石通道中的分散和氧化状态应该大大影响烷烃脱氢和裂化之间的相对速率；芳烃/甲烷选择性比率应该是这些相对速率的良好指标。作为Ga-沸石催化剂测试反应的丙烷芳香化存在一些问题。副产品如Ca+芳香族化合物很容易形成[5,6,9-111]，因此焦炭也是一个问题。本文工作的目标是：（1）获得证据表明，含镓材料也符合我们关于镓还原的定量理论；（2）证明虽然镓&的还原是分散镓在沸石中的必要步骤，但最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂形式并不是由作为框架离子的还原镓+产生的。对于这个探针反应，不同制备的MFI材料的催化性能差异很大，尤其是它们对芳烃和甲烷的选择性。我们得出结论，初始还原不完全，重新氧化（样本B）没有再生结晶的&GazOs。样本B的氧化还原周期也在DSC中被复制，干燥/还原部分如图6所示。超过计算的还原热的部分热量过剩来自于吸附氢的氧化；然而，整个过剩不可能归因于这个一个因素。

        添加蒸汽到烃流中显著增强了丙烷脱氢过Ga/ZSM-5，导致稳态氢羟化反应中间体浓度的增加。这种改进归因于在双核氧桥接Ga3+复合物中氢重组的有利条件与单核GaO+离子相比。水的存在促进了活性部分水化的镓物种的形成，从而提高了催化剂活性。实验上观察到的Ga+物种在ZSM-5上的活性的增加归因于形成gallyl（GaO+）离子。向流体中添加水强烈增加了活性。主要产物仍然是丙烯，尽管随着水含量的增加，甲烷和乙烯的形成量略有增加。水促进的效果归因于活性部分水化的镓物种的形成。氢原子与氧原子相连的氢原子的极低酸性导致氢重组在镓二聚体上的能量壁垒过高（305kJmol−1）。对于单核镓站点，催化循环由从[Ga3+(H)(OH)]+脱除H2开始，形成GaO+离子。在簇I处水的分解是放热的（ΔE=102kJmol−1），并导致形成结构II，其中的[Ga3+(H)(OH)]+离子中的羟基协调到相邻的Ga+离子。强减少H2在Ga双体上的重组的能量是由于OH组的酸性的增加。EXAFS分析提供了Ga+/ZSM-5的平均结构数据，显示四个氧原子在1.84 Å的距离，Ga-Ga协调在2.98 Å，协调数接近一，以及Ga-Al散射器在2.72 Å的距离，协调数为1.1。烷烃在Ga2O2二聚体上的脱氢通过由Ga3+和额外框架氧原子形成的路易斯酸对初始异裂开始，随后是烯烃脱除和氢重组。

        2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂暴露于CH4或CH4/H2在700°C下导致Mo离子还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo。反应达到稳态后，约60%至80%的Mo物种以Mo2C的形式存在，但部分Mo（20%-30%）保持存在作为Mo4+和Mo5+，即使催化剂在CH4或CH4/H2中处理700°C数小时也不会还原。Mo2C的形成与生产苯的时间一致，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷激活的活性中心。由于在催化剂上预先形成Mo2C，而没有焦炭沉积，完全消除诱导期是不可能的，因此相信清洁的Mo2C表面太活泼以形成更高碳氢化合物，并且，实际活性物种可能是形成作为反应中间体的乙烯的Mo2C表面的焦炭修饰。

        对轻烷烃在ZSM-5沸石中稳定化的锌物种进行了全面的密度泛函理论研究。金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件在烷烃转换的机制和效率中起着至关重要的作用。支持的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石在烷烃转换，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应方面进行了广泛研究。几个因素对这些催化剂的工业意义有贡献，包括高活性、选择性和在各种反应条件下的稳定性。
