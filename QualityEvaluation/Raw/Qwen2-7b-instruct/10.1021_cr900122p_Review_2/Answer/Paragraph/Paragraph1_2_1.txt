        Metal-based catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts play a crucial role in determining the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments enhance catalyst activity and selectivity, with H2 promoting dispersion and O2 anchoring the dispersed metal species. Gallium species' dispersion improves catalytic performance, combining with Brönsted acid sites from zeolites. Oxygen treatment stabilizes these dispersed species, optimizing catalytic activity. Propane aromatization benefits from the evolution of aromatisation selectivity and the average H/C ratio, demonstrating the industrial significance of these catalysts in petrochemical processes.

        The demand for maleic anhydride, primarily for unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow over the next five years due to new applications. Supported vanadium oxides convert VOPO4 to (VO)2P207 with hydrocarbon interaction, enhancing Vv formation in a more oxidizing environment. Catalyst behavior shows minimal dependence on hydrocarbon/oxygen ratios, but increased oxygen concentration boosts Vv and maleic anhydride formation. Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity for olefin isomerization under mild conditions, with rates decreasing for hydrogenation compared to isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than isomerization, and higher temperatures enhance isomerization rates. The efficiency of these catalysts is crucial for industrial applications due to their ability to convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities, despite their susceptibility to degradation under harsh conditions.

        Studies have investigated the selectivity of propane carbon-hydrogen bond activation and the deuteration of propane, highlighting the importance of catalysts in alkane transformations. Key findings include a 7x faster reaction rate for primary bonds and a selectivity indicating thermally equilibrated compound mixtures. The research employs silica-supported zirconium hydride for activation, demonstrating a 200 turnover half-life at room temperature. The study of the stoichiometric reaction of silica-supported zirconium hydride with propane confirms the activation of propane's C-H bonds, highlighting a stoichiometric reaction leading to propane deuteration.

        Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts significantly influence alkane transformation mechanisms through their redox properties and surface oxidation states, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation. Conditions such as oxygen concentration and the presence of vanadium(V) species affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Enhanced selectivity at the catalyst bed's end is attributed to a more oxidizing atmosphere. Phosphorus content impacts the catalyst's oxidation and reduction rates, correlating with its performance in n-butane oxidation. Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support leads to the creation of defined surface species, which is crucial for optimizing alkane transformations.

        Density functional theory elucidates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported vanadium oxides, revealing hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom forms a diradical intermediate, where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Direct propene production follows, with the first hydrogen abstraction being rate-limiting. Calculations show close agreement with experimental activation energies, validating the mechanism's efficiency and applicability in industrial processes.

        Recent advancements have elucidated the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in supported metal oxide catalysts, revealing insights into their reactivity properties during hydrocarbon oxidation. Key findings include the minor influence of terminal and bridging V-O bonds, with the bridging V-O-support bond being the most critical, affecting the reaction rate up to four orders of magnitude. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Acidic and basic additives influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific.

        Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly affect alkane transformation mechanisms and efficiency, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Challenges like achieving selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems underscore the field's complexity. Industrial significance lies in their ability to efficiently transform alkanes under controlled conditions, enhancing yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes. The ongoing research aims to overcome these challenges, making tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization more feasible.

        For instance, a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound is utilized in the mild, aqueous, aerobic catalytic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and acetaldehyde, demonstrating the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformations. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700°C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo, suggesting Mo2C as the active center for methane activation. The formation of Mo2C correlates with the benzene production phase, indicating its active role in the catalytic process.

        The study investigates ethane dehydrogenation over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite active sites, focusing on activation mechanisms. Activation occurs via heterolytic dissociation or oxidation by extralattice oxygen, both favored thermodynamically and kinetically over reduced gallium species. Key side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest due to its industrial relevance. A hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5 reveals the surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving stepwise adsorption of the propane at an oxygen site followed by desorption of a water molecule and propene, is pivotal for the conversion of alkanes to higher-value products. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials.

        Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as an oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%. Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites. The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen over silica-supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated.

        The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium complexes compared to mononuclear gallium species. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered as candidate active sites. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. The promoting effect of water is due to its role in forming reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

        The primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C. Therefore, the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking; the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems, such as the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics and the issue of coking. The redox cycle of sample B, reproducible through DSC analysis, underscores the importance of understanding catalyst behavior under various conditions for optimizing performance.

        Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit very similar adsorption properties, independently of the preparation method. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption. DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allows more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data. Adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, leading to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide.

        In summary, the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. These catalysts offer high activity, selectivity, and stability under various conditions, making them indispensable in industrial applications for the production of valuable products. Ongoing research aims to optimize catalyst performance and address challenges in alkane transformations, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable chemical synthesis processes.

        由于新应用的需求，甲酸酐的市场需求在未来五年内预计将增长，主要用于不饱和聚酯树脂、农业化学品、食品添加剂、润滑油添加剂和制药。支持的五氧化二钒将VOPO4转化为（VO）2P207与烃类相互作用，通过在更氧化环境中增强Vv形成来增强活性。催化剂行为显示出对烃/氧比的最小依赖性，但增加氧气浓度可增加Vv和甲酸酐的形成。二氧化硅支持的锆氢化合物在温和条件下表现出高活性的烯烃异构化，异构化速率降低，而氢化速率高于异构化。催化剂寿命较短，用于氢化而非异构化，且随着温度升高，异构化速率增加。这些催化剂的效率对于工业应用至关重要，因为它们能够在受控条件下高效地将烷烃转化为高产率和选择性的产品，尽管它们在恶劣条件下容易降解。

        研究已经探讨了丙烷碳-氢键激活的选择性和丙烷的去氘化，强调了催化剂在烷烃转化中的重要性。关键发现包括主链速率提高7倍以及热力学平衡产物混合物的选择性。研究使用二氧化硅支持的锆氢化合物进行激活，表明室温下具有200轮半衰期。对石英支持的锆氢化合物与丙烷的等摩尔反应进行的实验确认了丙烷C-H键的激活，表明存在一个等摩尔反应导致丙烷去氘化。

        钴酸磷酸盐催化剂显著影响烷烃转化机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程中。实现选择性碳氢化合物功能化和解决机制问题证明了该领域的复杂性。工业意义在于它们能够在受控条件下有效地转换烷烃，提高合成化学和石油化学过程中的产率和选择性。正在进行的研究旨在克服这些挑战，使可调可控的碳氢化合物功能化变得更加可行。

        例如，一种支持的二吡啶基铂多氧化钨杂合化合物在温和、水性、有氧条件下催化甲烷氧化生产甲醇和乙醛，这证明了这些催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。将2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂暴露于CH4或CH4/H2在700°C下，Mo离子被还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo，表明Mo2C是甲烷活化的关键中心。Mo2C与苯的生成阶段相吻合，表明其在催化过程中的作用。

        对于乙烷脱氢的研究使用了作为氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石活性位点模型的gallyl离子（GaO+），重点研究了激活机制。激活要么通过异裂性分解或由外层氧原子氧化，两者在热力学和动力学上均优于还原Ga物种。关键的副反应涉及乙醇在GaO+位点的转化。虽然在Ga2O2二聚体上预期发生多个催化循环，涉及额外乙烷分子的一步转化，通过稳定的初级脱氢路径的中间体，但这些位点无法负责氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石的相对稳定的催化活性。

        丙烷脱氢在支持的钒催化剂上的研究是工业关注的焦点。基于密度泛函理论的混合方法研究了丙烷在V2O5（010）表面的氧化脱氢机制，在表面使用了范德华氧化物簇和周期性片。Mars-van Krevelen机制，涉及在氧位点吸附丙烷，随后水分子脱附和丙烯释放，对于烷烃转化为高价值产品的转换至关重要。这项研究为支持的钒催化剂的活动性提供了洞察，并为这些材料的未来计算调查奠定了基础。

        使用W/HZSM-5催化剂研究了0.3%至11.9%的钨加载下部分氧化甲烷到甲醛的过程。三种不同类型的支撑物种被检测：四面体单核物种、八面体聚合物种和WO3晶体。每种类型的相对量随钨负载变化显著。支撑物种的性质可以是四面体配合的W(VI)物种、八面体配合的聚钨酸盐物种或WO3晶体。甲烷与分子氧的局部氧化在二氧化硅支持的氧化物催化剂上的反应已被广泛研究。

        将蒸汽添加到烃类流体中可以显着增强丙烷脱氢在Ga/ZSM-5中的效率，导致稳态氢羟基化反应中间体浓度的增加。这种改进归因于在双核氧桥接Ga3+复合物中氢再结合的有利条件，相对于单一核GaO+离子。水的存在促进了部分水解Ga物种的形成，从而提高了催化活性。考虑的候选活性位点包括各种单核Ga含氢离子（Ga+、GaH2+、GaH2+、GaO+）。实验观察到的在ZSM-5上氧化至473K时由硝酸氧化引起的活性增加归因于GaO+离子的形成。水的促进效果归因于其在形成部分水解Ga物种中的作用。乙烷在Ga2O2二聚体上的脱氢通过初始异裂由Ga3+和附加的额外框架氧原子形成的Lewis酸对产生，随后是烯烃脱附和氢再结合。

        额外的镓在这些材料中的主要作用是加快乙烯、二烯或环烯烃的脱氢速率。高表面面积Gaz03和蒸煮镓硅酸盐自身可以在500-600 C的温度范围内以显著速率异构化1-己烯、环己烯和直链二烯。因此，镓在沸石通道中的分散和氧化状态应大大影响烷烃脱氢和裂解的相对速率；芳烃/甲烷选择性比率应是这些相对速率的良好指标。丙烷异构化作为Ga-沸石催化剂的测试反应面临一些问题，如Ca+芳香族副产品的形成和结焦的问题。DSC分析可重复的样本B的红/黑周期强调了在各种条件下理解催化剂行为的重要性，以优化性能。

        Cu+包含的ZSM-5沸石显示出非常相似的吸附特性，无论准备方法如何。Cu+离子的部分吸附导致吸附分子的强烈扰动，从相应的HH伸缩频率的非常强的低频偏移中可以看出。吸附的Cu+离子的数量略少于强烈吸附N2吸附的站点数量。基于密度泛函理论的H2吸附由ZSM-5沸石上的Cu+离子的a位点允许更令人信服的实验IR数据的分配。乙烷在修改为Cu+离子的ZSM-5沸石上的吸附导致吸附分子的强烈扰动，导致CH伸缩带的非常大的红色偏移，这是以前从未在任何阳离子形式的沸石或氧化物上观察到的。

        总之，金属基催化剂，特别是支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转化机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程中。这些催化剂提供高活性、选择性和稳定性，在各种条件下，使它们成为工业应用中生产有价值产品的不可或缺的工具。正在进行的研究旨在优化催化剂性能并解决烷烃转化中的挑战，为更高效的可持续化学合成技术铺平道路。

        未来展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进步和发现，有机会探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来研究可能集中在开发更选择性的催化剂，能够高效地将烷烃转化为特定产品，减少副产品的形成并提高整体效率。此外，深入研究金属-载体相互作用和催化剂形态对烷烃转化机制的影响，可能发现具有优越性能的新催化剂设计。进一步利用先进的计算方法，如量子化学模拟和机器学习算法，可以帮助在合理设计催化剂方面发挥作用，预测其在不同条件下的性能，并指导反应参数的优化。结合多种催化剂或利用多功能催化剂系统，同时执行多个转换，也可能提高烷烃处理技术的灵活性和效率。未来的研究还可以深入研究在较温和条件下运行的催化剂，降低能耗和环境影响，同时保持或提高产物产率和选择性。最后，探索超传统金属和沸石之外的替代材料，如金属有机框架（MOFs）或石墨烯基催化剂，可能发现具有独特特性和增强催化活性的新催化剂架构。
