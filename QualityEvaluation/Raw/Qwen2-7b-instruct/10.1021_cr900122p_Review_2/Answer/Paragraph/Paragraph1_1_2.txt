Understanding the reactions between organometallic complexes and catalyst supports is fundamental for alkane transformation efficiency, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. This knowledge enables the creation of well-defined surface species, crucial for mechanism and efficiency. Metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides, influence alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation, facilitated by the initial hydrogen abstraction step at vanadyl sites, forming a diradical intermediate. Propene production follows via sequential hydrogen abstractions, with the first step being rate-limiting. The mechanism aligns with experimental data, indicating higher activity of bulk vanadia sites compared to monomers on silica surfaces. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in determining efficiency and industrial significance. 

            Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, are pivotal in alkane transformations through processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Conditions such as mildness, aqueous medium, and aerobic environment enhance efficiency. The use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound exemplifies the effectiveness of these catalysts in converting methane to methanol and acetaldehyde, highlighting their industrial significance.

            Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts exhibit reversible deactivation under certain conditions but become more selective at the end of the catalytic bed due to increased oxidation. The redox properties of the feed significantly affect the catalyst's surface oxidation state, impacting product formation. Factors like oxygen concentration, vanadium(V) species, and phosphorus content control catalyst efficiency in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation. Enhanced selectivity and product formation are observed with optimized catalyst conditions, highlighting the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts.

            Recent advancements have elucidated the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in metal oxide catalysts, revealing insights into their reactivity during hydrocarbon oxidation. Key findings highlight the critical role of bond types—terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support—on the turnover frequency (TOF), with the latter being the most influential. The oxide support's phase and preparation method do not significantly impact the surface vanadia species' structure or reactivity. The number of vanadia sites required varies based on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions necessitating multiple vanadia sites are highly sensitive to surface coverage and additive presence. Acidic and basic additives affect selectivity, though the impact is reaction-specific. Vanadia bond characteristics and site quantity significantly influence the efficiency of alkane transformations through processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, underscoring the industrial significance of these catalysts.

            This study investigates the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and deuteration using silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts. Key findings include faster reaction rates for primary C-H bonds compared to secondary ones, a degenerate activation mechanism, and a high selectivity indicating a thermally equilibrated mixture of compounds. The absence of a kinetic isotope effect during mass spectrometry suggests a straightforward activation process. The deuteration of propane after 7 turnovers in 72 hours at 120°C showcases the catalyst's efficiency. These insights underscore the industrial relevance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

            Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations' mechanisms and efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. A DFT study on zinc species in ZSM-5 zeolite highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability under diverse conditions, as supported by studies and quotes.
            
            The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis. We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab. We have investigated a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism that involves stepwise adsorption of the propane at an oxygen site followed by desorption of a water molecule and propene. The highest energy on the potential energy surface at the B3LYP/6-31G(*) level of theory is about 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants and corresponds to formation of an oxygen vacancy after water elimination. The barriers for propane adsorption and propene elimination are 4560 kcal/mol. Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials.
            
            Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit consistent adsorption properties across different preparation methods. Adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 leads to significant perturbations in adsorbed molecules, indicated by shifts in HH stretching frequencies. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, a novel observation attributed to the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations. These findings underscore the pivotal role of Cu+ ions in modulating adsorption dynamics, impacting the efficiency of alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

            The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species.

            Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%. Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. It was found that supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen over W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2 and H2O. The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen over silica supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated.

            It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C. Therefore, the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking; the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems. Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and therefore coking is also a problem. The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction; and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. For this probe reaction, differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced [12,131. We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs. The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/reduction portion shown in Fig. 6. Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen; however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor.

            Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature. Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane. Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures. Although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, polymerization of these olefins was not observed. We propose a mechanism to account for the catalytic activity shown by supported species, involving supported dialkyl species. When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation to butane was complete within 30 h. Catalyst lifetime is shorter under hydrogenation conditions than that observed in isomerization experiments.

            Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach. Resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging.

            The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption. The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data. It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide. It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

            The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

            Demand for maleic anhydride, crucial in manufacturing unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, is set to grow over the next five years, driven by new applications. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites act as catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases transform into (VO)2P207 upon interaction with hydrocarbons. Enhanced Vv formation at the catalyst bed's end is attributed to a more oxidizing environment. Kinetic studies by Buchanan, Sundaresan, and Lerou confirm minimal dependency on hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio changes. An increase in oxygen concentration boosts Vv formation and maleic anhydride production rate, highlighting the efficiency of these catalysts in alkane transformations.

            The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species. However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult. In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were discussed. Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

            Exposition of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700°C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (20-30%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for many hours. The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane. Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

            二氧化钒磷磷酸盐催化剂在某些条件下可逆地失活，但在催化床的末段由于氧化增加而变得更加选择性。流体的还原性性质显著影响催化剂的表面氧化状态，从而影响产物形成。氧气浓度、钒(V)物种和磷含量控制着烷烃转化过程中的催化剂效率，特别是氧化脱氢。增强的选择性和产物形成是在优化催化剂条件下观察到的，这突显了这些金属基催化剂在工业应用中的重要性。

            最近的研究揭示了金属氧化物催化剂表面上钒亚物种的分子结构，提供了关于它们在烃氧化反应期间的反应性的见解。关键发现指出，终端V=O、桥接V-O-V和桥接V-O-支持键对转率频率（TOF）的影响，其中桥接V-O-支持键的影响最大。氧化物支持的相态和制备方法对表面钒亚物种的结构或反应性没有明显影响。烷烃转化所需的表面钒亚物种数量取决于特定反应分子。需要多个钒亚物种的氧化反应对表面覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在非常敏感。酸性和碱性添加剂也会影响烷烃氧化反应的选择性，但其影响似乎具有反应特异性，并且基于当前可用的有限数据无法普遍化。钒键特性及其位点数量显著影响烷烃转化过程的效率，特别是通过氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程，这强化了这些催化剂在工业应用中的重要性。

            这项研究调查了在ZSM-5沸石上用铜离子改性的丙烷的催化激活和去氘化。关键发现包括主碳氢键的较快反应速率与次级碳氢键相比，一种退化的激活机制，以及热力学平衡的混合物中的高选择性。在没有动力学同位素效应的情况下进行的质谱研究表明，激活过程是直接的。在120°C下经过72小时后，去氘化达到7个周转，显示催化剂的效率。这些见解突出了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业相关性。

            氧化脱氢（ODH）的丙烷在支持的二氧化钒催化剂上的重要性在于其在工业催化中的作用。我们进行了混合密度泛函研究，研究了在V2O5(010)表面的丙烷氧化脱氢机制。表面使用了范德瓦尔斯氧化物簇和周期性片层进行建模。我们调查了一种火星-范克里夫机制，该机制涉及在氧位点上分步吸附丙烷，随后水分子的脱除和丙烯的释放。理论能量表面最高值约为80 kcal/mol高于反应物的能量，对应于水消除后形成的氧空位。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒分别为4560 kcal/mol。可能降低势能面上壁垒的因素包括与支撑材料的相互作用和与O2的协同反应，均进行了讨论。这项研究为支持的二氧化钒催化剂的活性提供洞察，并为这些材料的未来计算研究提供了基础。

            铜离子（Cu+）包含在ZSM-5沸石中显示出一致的吸附性质，无论准备方法如何。通过CuZSM-5中的一部分Cu+离子吸附氢气导致吸附分子发生非常强烈的扰动，这从相应的HH伸缩频率的非常强的低频偏移中可以明显看出。还发现强烈吸附分子氢的Cu+离子的数量略少于强N2吸附的位点数量。DFT模型通过Cu+阳离子在ZSM-5沸石上的a位点吸附氢气允许更令人信服的实验IR数据分配。还发现乙烷通过ZSM-5沸石与Cu+离子修饰的乙烷吸附导致吸附分子发生非常强烈的扰动，导致CH伸缩带的非常大的红移，这是在任何阳离子形式的沸石或氧化物上观察到的乙烷吸附从未有过的现象。结论是，吸附的C2H6分子的这种异常性质是由与交换的一价铜离子形成的相对较强的s型吸附复合物引起的。

            向烃燃料添加蒸汽显著提高了GA/ZSM-5的丙烷脱氢活性，导致羟基化反应中间体稳态浓度的增加。这种改进归因于在二核氧桥接Ga3+复合体中比单核GaO+离子更容易实现氢再组合的条件。水的存在促进了部分水解的镓物种的形成，从而增加了催化剂活性。作为活性位点的候选者，考虑了各种单核镓含有的阳离子（Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+）。实验观察到的在ZSM-5上氧化至473K时由硝酸氧化产生的gallyl（GaO+）离子的活性的增加被归因于gallyl（GaO+）离子的形成。向燃料添加水强烈增加了活性。主要产品仍然是丙烯，尽管随着水含量的增加，少量增加了甲烷和乙烯的形成。水分促进作用的原因是形成了活性部分水解的镓物种。

            甲烷在分子氧作为氧化剂下的部分氧化研究在W/HZSM-5催化剂上进行，钨负载范围从0.3%到11.9%。检测到了三种不同的支持物种：四面体单体物种、八面体聚合物种、八面体聚合物种和WO3晶粒。每种一个的比例随钨负载显著变化。发现支持的钨氧化物相具有部分氧化甲烷生成甲醛的活性中心。支持物种的性质可能是四面体协调的W(VI)物种、八面体协调的聚钨酸盐物种或WO3晶粒。每种一个的比例随钨负载显著变化。甲烷部分氧化与分子氧在硅酸盐支持氧化物催化剂上的反应机制已被广泛研究。

            广泛同意额外框架镓在这些材料中的主要作用是加速烯烃、二烯或环烯烃的脱氢。具有高表面积的Gaz03和蒸煮的镓硅酸盐自身可以在500-600°C的温度范围内以显著速率芳香化脂肪二烯、1-己烯和环己烯。因此，镓在沸石通道中的分散和氧化状态应极大地影响烷烃脱氢和裂解的相对速率；芳烃/甲烷选择性比率应是这些相对速率的良好指标。作为测试反应，丙烷的芳香化对镓-沸石催化剂的催化性能提出了一些问题。副产品如Ca+芳香族化合物很容易形成[5,6,9-111，因此焦炭也是一个问题。论文工作的目标是：（1）获得证据表明镓交换材料也符合我们的镓还原理论；（2）证明虽然镓的还原是分散镓在沸石内的必要条件，但最有效的和选择性的生产芳香族化合物的催化剂形式并不包括作为框架离子的还原Ga+。

            目前面临的挑战包括：实现可控、选择性的碳氢化合物功能化仍然遥不可及；解决机制问题尤其具有挑战性。

            上述讨论的实验数据总结表明，独立于准备方法，Cu+包含在ZSM-5沸石中表现出非常相似的吸附性质。通过CuZSM-5的一部分Cu+离子吸附氢气导致吸附分子发生非常强烈的扰动，这可以从对应的HH伸缩频率的非常强的低频偏移中明显看出。还发现吸附的分子氢的Cu+离子的数量略少于强N2吸附的位点数量。DFT模型通过Cu+阳离子在ZSM-5沸石上的a位点吸附氢气允许更令人信服的实验IR数据分配。还发现乙烷通过ZSM-5沸石与Cu+离子修饰的乙烷吸附导致吸附分子发生非常强烈的扰动，导致CH伸缩带的非常大的红移，这是在任何阳离子形式的沸石或氧化物上观察到的乙烷吸附从未有过的现象。结论是，吸附的C2H6分子的这种异常性质是由与交换的一价铜离子形成的相对较强的s型吸附复合物引起的。

            氧化脱氢（ODH）的丙烷在支持的二氧化钒催化剂上的重要性在于其在工业催化中的作用。我们进行了混合密度泛函研究，研究了在V2O5(010)表面的丙烷氧化脱氢机制。表面使用了范德瓦尔斯氧化物簇和周期性片层进行建模。我们调查了一种火星-范克里夫机制，该机制涉及在氧位点上分步吸附丙烷，随后水分子的脱除和丙烯的释放。理论能量表面最高值约为80 kcal/mol高于反应物的能量，对应于水消除后形成的氧空位。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒分别为4560 kcal/mol。可能降低势能面上壁垒的因素包括与支撑材料的相互作用和与O2的协同反应，均进行了讨论。这项研究为支持的二氧化钒催化剂的活性提供洞察，并为这些材料的未来计算研究提供了基础。

            现在面临的挑战包括实现可控、选择性的碳氢化合物功能化仍然难以实现；解决机制问题特别具有挑战性。

            丁烷在GA/ZSM-5上的氧化脱氢受到蒸汽添加的显著增强，导致稳态羟基化反应中间体浓度的增加。这种改善归因于在二核氧桥接Ga3+复合体中比单核GaO+离子更容易实现的氢再组合条件。水的存在促进了部分水解的镓物种的形成，从而增加了催化剂活性。作为活性位点的候选者，考虑了各种单核镓含有的阳离子（Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+）。实验观察到的在ZSM-5上氧化至473K时由硝酸氧化产生的gallyl（GaO+）离子的活性的增加被归因于gallyl（GaO+）离子的形成。向燃料添加水强烈增加了活性。主要产品仍然是丙烯，尽管随着水含量的增加，少量增加了甲烷和乙烯的形成。水分促进作用的原因是形成了活性部分水解的镓物种。氢再组合的能垒为305kJmol−1，这是由于附接到氧原子的氢原子的极低酸性造成的。对于单核镓位点，催化循环由从[HGa3+(H)(OH)]+脱除H2开始，形成GaO+离子。在簇I处的水解是放热的（ΔE=102kJmol−1），导致形成结构II，其中[HGa3+(H)(OH)]+离子的羟基与相邻的Ga+离子配位。Ga dimer上H2再组合的能垒的显著减少是由于OH组分的酸性增加。对Ga+/ZSM-5的EXAFS分析提供了平均结构数据，指示四个氧原子在1.84 Å的距离，Ga-Ga协调在2.98 Å与接近1的协调数，以及Ga-Al散射器在2.72 Å的距离与1.1的协调数。烷烃通过Ga2O2二聚体的脱氢化通过由Ga3+和额外框架氧原子形成的Lewis酸对初始异裂开始，随后是烯烃脱附和氢再组合的过程。

            对于用于制造不饱和聚酯树脂、农业化学品、食品添加剂、润滑油添加剂和药物的极其重要的化学物质的需求预计在未来五年内增长，这得益于新用途的应用。支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石充当氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程中的催化剂。与氢化合物的相互作用导致磷酸盐（VOPO4）相转变为（VO）2P207。增强的Vv在催化剂床末端的形成归因于更氧化的环境。布坎南、苏丹纳森和勒罗进行的动态研究证实了氢化合物/氧气比例变化的微小依赖性。氧气浓度的增加导致Vv形成和马尔酸酐形成速率的增加，这突出了这些催化剂在烷烃转化中的高效性。

            以gallyl（GaO+）离子作为氧化化Ga/ZSM-5催化剂活性位点的模型，通过密度泛函理论簇建模方法研究了乙烷的催化脱氢。初始激活过程可以通过过乙烷分子在gallyl离子上的异裂遵循烷基机制或通过外层氧原子的氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子来实现。这两种途径在动力学和热力学上都优于在减少的镓物种上的初始CH激活。然而，gallyl离子的再生是非常困难的。此外，讨论了可能涉及乙醇在GaO+位点的转化的副反应。尽管预期在gallyl离子上可以发生多个催化循环，通过涉及在主要脱氢路径的稳定中间体上进一步转化额外的乙烷分子来实现，但这些位点不能负责氧化化Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的相对稳定的催化活性。

            将2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂暴露于CH4或CH4/H2在700°C下会导致Mo离子还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo。在反应达到稳态后，约60%至80%的Mo物种以Mo2C的形式存在，但Mo（20-30%）仍保持为Mo4+和Mo5+，即使催化剂在700°C下用CH4或CH4/H2处理数小时也不被还原。Mo2C的形成与苯的初始激活期时间吻合良好，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的作用中心。由于在催化剂上预先形成Mo2C，而不沉积焦炭，完全消除诱导期并不能消除，认为清洁的Mo2C表面可能过于活跃，无法形成更高碳氢化合物，因此，焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面可能是形成乙烷作为反应中间体的乙烯的实际活性物种。

            金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化机制和效率产生重大影响，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程。温和条件、水介质和好氧环境增强了效率。使用支持的双吡啶二氨铂多氧化物杂化化合物展示了这些催化剂在将甲烷转化为甲醇和乙醛的有效性，突出了它们的工业重要性。

            在考虑文件中讨论的进展和发现之后，存在机会探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来研究的努力可能集中在利用机器学习算法预测催化剂性能的基础结构-性质关系，优化催化剂设计以适应特定烷烃转化，以及探索结合多种金属基催化剂以提高整体效率的可能性。此外，研究表面修改和缺陷工程的作用可能会导致开发具有改进稳定性和选择性的催化剂。结合可再生能源，如太阳能或风能，在催化剂的激活和再生过程中使用，是未来探索的一个令人兴奋的途径，旨在减少工业烷烃转化过程的环境足迹。
