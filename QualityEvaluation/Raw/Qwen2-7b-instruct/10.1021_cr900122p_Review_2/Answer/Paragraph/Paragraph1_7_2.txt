            <p>From the study of reference \[10.1021/jp072110z\], detailed analysis was established on the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. The density functional theory cluster modeling approach was utilized to examine the initial activation of ethane, which occurs either through heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in the formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. Both these pathways are thermodynamically and kinetically favored over the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species, yet the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion proves difficult. Moreover, side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were also discussed. Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites are insufficient for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>
            <p>Building upon references \[10.1021/jp065911v\] and \[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00120-2\], a comprehensive understanding of metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations emerged. These catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a critical role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Their industrial significance is underlined by their high activity, selectivity, and stability under varied reaction conditions.</p>
            <p>As per reference \[10.1016/s0926-860x(98)00114-8\], the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as an oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with varying tungsten loadings, revealing three types of tungsten species that influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The relative amount of each species varies significantly with the tungsten loading, with the supported tungsten oxide phase possessing active sites for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites, each affecting the reaction mechanism differently.</p>
            <p>As per reference \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00015-6\], hydrogen and oxygen pretreatments are pivotal in modifying catalyst activity and selectivity. H2 treatment enhances metal dispersion, boosting the number of active sites that synergize with zeolite Brönsted acid sites, while O2 treatment stabilizes and reoxidizes these dispersed metals to the +3 state, optimizing catalytic performance. The synergy between these treatments facilitates the efficient conversion of alkanes into aromatic compounds, highlighting the catalysts' industrial significance in petrochemical processes like propane aromatization.</p>
            <p>According to reference \[10.1021/cr00083a003\], the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great industrial interest. Hybrid density functional studies of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5 indicate that the highest energy on the potential energy surface is about 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, corresponding to the formation of an oxygen vacancy after water elimination. The barriers for propane adsorption and propene elimination are 4560 kcal/mol. Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed.</p>
            <p>From reference \[10.1016/0304-5102(80)80085-x\], the study examines ethane dehydrogenation over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite active sites. Activation primarily occurs through heterolytic dissociation or oxidation by extralattice oxygen, forming adsorbed ethanol. Thermodynamically and kinetically favored over reduced gallium, these pathways lead to initial activation but struggle with gallyl ion regeneration. Side reactions involving ethanol conversion over GaO+ sites are also considered. While catalytic cycles occur, gallyl ions are insufficient for the stable activity observed in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>
            <p>As outlined in reference \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5\], recent advancements have elucidated the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in metal oxide catalysts, revealing that the terminal V=O bond's impact on hydrocarbon oxidation is minimal. The bridging V-O-V bond affects reactions by increasing the turnover frequency (TOF) by an order of magnitude, whereas the bridging V-O-support bond significantly alters TOF for reactions by up to four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support and preparation method do not influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction depends on the specific reactant molecule, with single-site reactions generally insensitive to vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives, while multi-site reactions are highly sensitive.</p>
            <p>As stated in reference \[10.1006/jcat.1997.1712\], exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (20-30%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for many hours. The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane. Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in reference \[10.1039/b103147n\], current challenges in the field include the pursuit of selective hydrocarbon functionalization and the resolution of mechanistic problems. Despite ongoing research efforts, these challenges remain unresolved, underscoring the complexity of the field. The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts lies in their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations, enhancing yield and selectivity.</p>
            <p>As per reference \[10.1016/s0926-860x(98)00114-8\], the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts reveals that the relative amount of different tungsten species varies significantly with the tungsten loading. The supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, with the nature of the supported species (tetrahedrally or octahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, or WO3 crystallites) affecting the reaction mechanism differently. The study highlights the importance of tungsten loading in determining the presence of active sites and the effectiveness of the catalyst in the conversion process.</p>
            <p>As detailed in reference \[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00015-6\], hydrogen and oxygen pretreatments play a crucial role in modifying catalyst activity and selectivity. H2 treatment enhances metal dispersion, boosting the number of active sites that synergize with zeolite Brönsted acid sites, while O2 treatment stabilizes and reoxidizes these dispersed metals to the +3 state, optimizing catalytic performance. The synergy between these treatments facilitates the efficient conversion of alkanes into aromatic compounds, underscoring the catalysts' industrial significance in petrochemical processes like propane aromatization.</p>
            <p>As explained in reference \[10.1021/cr00083a003\], the demand for maleic anhydride, a crucial chemical used in diverse industries, is anticipated to grow over the next five years due to its novel applications. Catalysts, like (VO)2P207 formed from VOPO4, are pivotal in alkane transformations, with enhanced Vv formation at the catalyst bed's end indicative of a more oxidizing atmosphere's impact. Buchanan et al.'s findings confirm minimal hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio dependence for catalysts of this type, and an increase in oxygen concentration results in an increase in the amount of Vv and the rate of maleic anhydride formation.</p>
            <p>As discussed in reference \[10.1002/anie.200390090\], the transfer of concepts and tools of molecular organometallic chemistry to surfaces leads to the generation of well-defined surface species. Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support material is crucial for the success of surface organometallic chemistry in catalysis, making metal-based catalysts industrially significant in alkane transformations.</p>
            <p>As elaborated in reference \[10.1016/0926-860x(92)80336-b\], the addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Gallium species, particularly Ga+ and gallyl (GaO+) ions, are considered as active sites for alkane activation, and the experimental increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl ions. The presence of water significantly increases activity, with the main product remaining propylene, although with increasing water content, slight increases in methane and ethylene are observed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The catalytic cycle involves heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.</p>

            <p>\[10.1021/jp072110z\]参考文献中的深入分析表明，使用密度泛函理论簇建模方法研究了乙烷在氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石中的镓离子（GaO+）模型活性位点上的催化脱氢过程。初步激活步骤主要通过镓离子异裂或通过外层氧原子的氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子来完成，这一过程在热力学和动力学上均优于还原镓物种。然而，镓离子的再生过程非常困难。此外，还讨论了乙醇在GaO+位点上的转化反应。尽管可以预期发生一系列催化循环，其中涉及在稳定中间体路径下通过一步转化额外的乙烷分子，但由于活性中心的存在，gallyl离子不足以维持氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石的稳定活性。</p>
            <p>\[10.1021/jp065911v\]和\[\[10.1016/0926-860x(96)00120-2\]中综合理解了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的机制、应用及其效率对氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程的影响。这些催化剂，尤其是支持的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石，对于烷烃转化的机制和效率具有关键作用。它们在工业上的重要性体现在其高活性、选择性和在各种反应条件下的稳定性。</p>
            <p>\[10.1016/s0926-860x(98)00114-8\]中，通过对含不同钨负载的W/HZSM-5催化剂的研究，揭示了三种不同的钨物种影响催化剂的活性和甲醛生产的选择性。相对而言，每种物种的数量随着钨负载的变化而显著变化。受支持的钨氧化物相具有甲烷部分氧化为甲醛的活性位点。支持的钨物种的性质可以是四面体配合的W(VI)物种、八面体配合的聚钨酸物种或WO3晶粒，每种物种对反应机制的影响不同。</p>
            <p>\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00015-6\]中指出，氢气和氧气预处理对于修改催化剂活性和选择性至关重要。氢气处理增强了金属的分散度，提高了与沸石布隆斯特酸位点协同工作的活性位点数量，而氧气处理稳定并重新氧化这些分散的金属至+3状态，优化了催化性能。这些处理之间的协同作用促进了烷烃向芳香族化合物的高效转化，突显了催化剂在石油化学过程中如丙烷芳构化的重要工业意义。</p>
            <p>\[10.1021/cr00083a003\]中阐述了氧化脱氢丙烷过程的详细机制，利用混合密度泛函研究了在V2O5(010)表面的活性位点。最高能量位于势能面上约80 kcal/mol以上，对应于水消除后形成的氧空位。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒分别为4560 kcal/mol。降低势能面上障碍的因素包括范德华氧化物簇与支撑材料的相互作用和与O2的协同反应，这些因素被讨论。</p>
            <p>\[10.1016/0304-5102(80)80085-x\]中，关于在700°C下将CH4或CH4/H2暴露于2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂上的研究显示，Mo离子被还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo。在反应达到稳态后，大约60%到80%的Mo物种以Mo2C的形式存在，但部分Mo（20-30%）以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在，并且即使在700°C下用CH4或CH4/H2处理催化剂数小时也不会被还原。Mo2C的形成与苯的初始激活时间一致，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的关键中心。由于在催化剂上预先形成Mo2C，没有焦炭沉积，无法完全消除诱导期，认为清洁的Mo2C表面可能过于活跃，难以形成更高阶的碳氢化合物，因此可能存在一种被焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面作为形成乙烷作为反应中间体的实际活性物种。</p>
            <p>\[10.1039/b103147n\]中提出，当前的挑战包括选择性氢化物功能化和机制问题的解决。尽管正在进行持续的研究努力，但这些问题仍未得到解决，这反映了该领域的复杂性。金属基催化剂在促进烷烃转化方面的工业意义在于能够提高产量和选择性。</p>
            <p>\[10.1016/s0926-860x(98)00114-8\]中指出，甲烷部分氧化为甲醛的研究显示，不同钨物种的相对量随钨负载变化显著。受支持的钨氧化物相具有甲烷部分氧化为甲醛的活性位点，支持的钨物种的性质（四面体或八面体配合的W(VI)物种或WO3晶粒）影响反应机制。研究强调了钨负载在确定活性位点和催化剂转化过程的有效性方面的重要性。</p>
            <p>\[10.1016/s0920-5861(96)00015-6\]中解释了氢气和氧气预处理对于修改催化剂活性和选择性的重要性。氢气处理增强了金属的分散度，提高了与沸石布隆斯特酸位点协同工作的活性位点数量，而氧气处理稳定并重新氧化这些分散的金属至+3状态，优化了催化性能。这些处理之间的协同作用促进了烷烃向芳香族化合物的高效转化，突显了催化剂在石油化学过程中如丙烷芳构化的重要工业意义。</p>
            <p>\[10.1021/cr00083a003\]中提到，由于新型应用的需求，未来五年对马来酸酐的需求预计将增长，主要用于不饱和聚酯树脂、农业化学品、食品添加剂、润滑油添加剂和制药。催化剂，如从VOPO4形成的(VO)2P207，对于烷烃转化至关重要，增强的Vv形成在催化剂床的末端表明存在一个更氧化环境的影响。Buchanan等人提出的发现确认了这种类型的催化剂对氢碳比变化的依赖性极小，增加氧气浓度导致Vv和马来酸酐形成速率增加。</p>
            <p>\[10.1002/anie.200390090\]中指出，将分子有机金属化学的概念和工具转移到表面上导致生成了定义明确的表面物种。理解有机金属复合物与支持物的反应有助于创建定义明确的表面物种，使表面有机金属化学在催化领域取得成功，使得金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中具有工业重要性。</p>
            <p>\[10.1016/0926-860x(92)80336-b\]中描述了将蒸汽添加到烃类原料中显著提高了丙烷在Ga/ZSM-5上的脱氢作用，导致稳态条件下羟基化反应中间体浓度的增加。这一改进归因于二核氧桥接Ga3+复合物中氢再结合条件的有利性，与单核GaO+离子相比。水的存在促进了部分水合镓物种的形成，从而提高了催化剂的活性。作为活性位点的镓物种，特别是Ga+和gallyl（GaO+）离子，被认为是烷烃激活的关键，实验上观察到在473K时，通过硝酸氧化对ZSM-5氧化的Ga+物种的活性增加归因于gallyl离子的形成。随着水含量的增加，活性显著提高，主要产物仍为丙烯，虽然随着水含量的增加，甲烷和乙烯的形成量略有增加。水的促进效果归因于部分水合镓物种的形成。催化循环涉及由Ga3+和额外框架氧原子形成的Lewis酸对进行异裂，随后是烯烃脱附和氢再结合。</p>
