Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/jp056228w\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/cr00083a003\], \[10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5\], and \[10.1021/jp071409e\]. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over supported vanadium oxides is of paramount industrial interest due to its catalytic importance. Studies have revealed that supported vanadium oxides are effective catalysts for propane ODH, thanks to their high surface area that facilitates active sites for desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites, on the other hand, offer tailored acidity and basicity for optimized reaction conditions. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving stepwise adsorption and desorption, showcases the efficiency of these catalysts. Challenges include minimizing reaction barriers, which can be influenced by interactions with support materials and concerted reactions with oxygen. Ongoing research endeavors aim to enhance catalyst performance by improving selectivity, stability, and energy efficiency, critical for industrial applications and environmental impact mitigation.
