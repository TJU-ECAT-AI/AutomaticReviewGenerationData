            The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis. The hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5 highlights the role of the catalyst surface and interactions with support materials in determining activity. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites have been extensively studied for their potential in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Several factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts, including high activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions. Research focuses on enhancing catalyst performance, aiming to improve selectivity, stability, and energy efficiency.
            The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with varying tungsten loadings, revealing three types of supported tungsten species. These species' dispersion impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction forms HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. Three distinct species—tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI), octahedrally coordinated polytungstate, and WO3 crystallites—differ significantly in amount with tungsten loading, contributing to the catalyst's performance.
            The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule. Both these pathways are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species. However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult.
            Vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts exhibit irreversible deactivation and enhanced selectivity under specific conditions, notably influenced by oxygen concentration and redox properties of the feed. Partial oxidation products emerge at low oxygen concentrations, indicating the pivotal role of vanadium(V) species on the catalyst surface. Phosphorus content impacts the catalyst's oxidation and reduction rates, affecting product formation. The redox properties correlate with catalytic behavior, with the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and kinetic performance significantly influenced by the balance of redox potential, oxidation rate, and reduction rate.
            Maleic anhydride demand, primarily for unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, etc., is expected to grow, driven by novel applications. Catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, when interacting with hydrocarbons, transform into (VO)2P207, indicating enhanced Vv formation in a more oxidizing environment. Kinetic studies show minimal catalyst behavior dependence on hydrocarbon/oxygen ratios, with increased oxygen concentration boosting Vv formation and maleic anhydride production.
            Adding steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. The improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity.
            Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions, with hydrogenation of 1-butene also observed but at lower rates. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature, with rates controlled by steric hindrance.
            Mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst, highlighting the role and application of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation.
            Recent advancements elucidate the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in supported metal oxides, revealing that while the terminal V=O bond's influence is negligible, the bridging V-O-support bond significantly affects hydrocarbon oxidation reactions' turnover frequency (TOF), potentially changing it by four orders of magnitude. The number of required vanadia sites varies depending on the reactant molecule.
            Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites demonstrate similar adsorption properties, affecting hydrogen and ethane adsorption with significant perturbations. DFT modeling elucidates the unique adsorption behavior, attributing the large red-shift in CH stretching bands upon ethane adsorption to the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with copper cations.
            Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60-80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane.
            It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C. Therefore, the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking; the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates.
            Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity. The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment. Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity. These physical and chemical transformations of gallium species are responsible for the activity-selectivity changes in the initial reaction-regeneration cycles of propane aromatisation at 823 K.
            We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Similarly to other catalysts with transition metal oxo bonds, the initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site. Propene is also directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate. Generation of surface propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments.
            Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica.
            The mechanistic details suggested are compatible with known observations, showing that the first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites. The mechanism is compatible with turnover frequencies and activation energies available, while other suggestions (CH addition onto the metal oxo bond) are not supported by the calculations.
            Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties.
            The promotion of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over supported vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, and other metal-based catalysts is a key area of research. Future work might focus on developing more selective catalysts with improved stability and energy efficiency, as well as exploring the use of novel materials and operating conditions to further enhance the conversion of alkanes into higher-value products.

                    氧化脱氢（ODH）丙烷在支持的钒氧化物催化剂上的重要性在于工业催化。对在V2O5的（010）表面上的丙烷氧化脱氢机制的混合密度功能研究强调了催化剂表面及其与支撑材料的相互作用在确定活性方面的作用。支持的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石已经广泛研究了烷烃转换的潜力，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程。这些催化剂的工业意义包括高活性、选择性和在各种反应条件下的稳定性。研究重点是提高催化剂性能，旨在改善选择性、稳定性和能量效率。
                    研究了在不同钨负载下使用W/HZSM-5催化剂的甲烷部分氧化以产生甲醛，揭示了三种支持的钨物种。这些物种的分散影响催化剂的甲醛生产率和选择性。反应形成了HCOH、CO、CO2和H2O。三种不同的物种——四面体配合的W(VI)、八面体配合的聚钨酸盐和WO3晶粒——在钨负载量上差异显著，这有助于催化剂的性能。
                    通过gallyl离子（GaO+）作为氧化化镓/5沸石中的活性位点的模型，对乙烷的催化脱氢进行了研究，使用密度泛函理论簇建模方法。初始激活的乙烷要么通过异裂或通过外层氧原子的氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子。这两种路径在热力学和动力学上都是有利的，与在还原镓物种上的初始CH激活相比。然而，后续的gallyl离子再生是非常困难的。
                    支持的二价钼/ZSM-5催化剂在700°C下暴露于CH4或CH4/H2时，钼离子被还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo。在反应达到稳态后，约有60-80%的钼物种以Mo2C的形式存在，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。
                    高表面区域的Gaz03和蒸煮的高铝硅酸盐本身就可以在500-600°C的温度范围内显著地异构化芳香族二烯，因此，镓在沸石通道中的分布和氧化状态应该极大地影响烷烃脱氢和裂解的相对速率；芳香族/甲烷选择性比率应该是这些相对速率的良好指标。
                    氢处理增加了活性和芳烃选择性，同时减少了甲烷的生成。随后的氧气处理进一步提高了活性和芳烃选择性，并对甲烷选择性几乎没有影响。当催化剂受到氢前处理时，丙烷的转化和芳烃选择性显著增加。有趣的是，第一次氢处理降低了甲烷的选择性，但第一次氧气处理没有降低，而两种第一次氢处理和氧气处理都增加了芳烃选择性。这些镓物种的物理和化学转变是最初反应-再生周期中丙烷异构化在823 K时活动选择性的变化的原因。
                    我们利用密度泛函理论探讨了丙烷氧化脱氢的可能机制。与其他含过渡金属氧基键的催化剂类似，初始的CH键活化步骤是氧原子（OVV）组的氢抽象，产生一个在HOVIV位点上结合有丙基自由基的双自由基中间体。丙烯也可以直接由双自由基中间体的第二个氢抽象获得。表面丙基自由基的生成由第一个氢抽象成为速率限制步骤。在750 K时，显见的活化能为123 ± 5 kJ/mol，速率常数约为0.26 s-1，与实验数据一致。
                    与最近对V2O5(001)晶体表面的DFT计算进行比较表明，如果它们是整体表面的一部分而不是在硅酸盐上作为单体存在，则范德瓦尔斯站点在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中可能更为活跃。
                    建议的机制与已知观察结果兼容，显示第一个氢抽象仅在OVV站点发生，而第二个氢抽象也可以在VOSi桥接氧站点发生。该机制与可获得的周转频率和活化能兼容，而其他建议（CH添加至金属氧基键）不被计算支持。
                    我们的成果确认了先前的发现，即HE预处理有利于形成分散的Ga物种，这些物种具有脱氢和氢释放的性质。
                    促进丙烷氧化脱氢的支撑的钒氧化物、金属交换的沸石和其他金属基催化剂是研究的关键领域。未来的工作可能集中在开发更选择性的催化剂，改善稳定性和能量效率，以及探索使用新型材料和操作条件来进一步增强烷烃转化为更高价值产品的转化。
