        Metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation, facilitated by the initial hydrogen abstraction step at vanadyl sites, forming a diradical intermediate. Propene production follows via sequential hydrogen abstractions, with the first step being rate-limiting. The mechanism aligns with experimental data, indicating higher activity of bulk vanadia sites compared to monomers on silica surfaces. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in determining efficiency and industrial significance. 

        Recent advancements have elucidated the molecular structures of surface vanadia species in metal oxide catalysts, revealing insights into their reactivity during hydrocarbon oxidation. Key findings highlight the critical role of bond types—terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V, and bridging V-O-support—on the turnover frequency (TOF), with the latter being the most influential. The oxide support's phase and preparation method do not significantly impact the surface vanadia species' structure or reactivity. The number of vanadia sites required varies based on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions necessitating multiple vanadia sites are highly sensitive to surface coverage and additive presence. Acidic and basic additives affect selectivity, though the impact is reaction-specific.

        This study investigates the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and deuteration using silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts. Key findings include faster reaction rates for primary C-H bonds compared to secondary ones, a degenerate activation mechanism, and a high selectivity indicating a thermally equilibrated mixture of compounds. The absence of a kinetic isotope effect during mass spectrometry suggests a straightforward activation process. The deuteration of propane after 7 turnovers in 72 hours at 120°C showcases the catalyst's efficiency.

        Metal-based catalysts significantly influence alkane transformations, notably in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. Their industrial significance stems from their ability to convert alkanes into higher-value products efficiently. Key factors affecting their performance include catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, and selectivity, which are optimized through tailored compositions and structures. Supported vanadium oxides excel in oxidative dehydrogenation due to their active sites, while metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity, enhancing product yield and selectivity. Research continues to enhance catalyst performance, aiming to improve stability and reduce energy consumption, thereby sustaining their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

        The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with varying tungsten loadings, revealing distinct tungsten species that influence catalyst activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction forms HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O, with the nature of supported tungsten species varying significantly with loading. This highlights the importance of catalyst composition and structure in alkane transformation processes, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, emphasizing the industrial significance of optimized catalyst design.

        Understanding the reactions between organometallic complexes and catalyst supports is fundamental for alkane transformation efficiency, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. This knowledge enables the creation of well-defined surface species, crucial for mechanism and efficiency. Quotes underscore the pivotal role of understanding these interactions in achieving successful catalyst performance, highlighting its industrial significance.

        Gallium in extra-framework positions accelerates alkene, diene, and cycloalkene dehydrogenation. Its dispersion and oxidation state within zeolite channels significantly influence alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking rates, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio indicating these rates. Challenges in propane aromatization and the formation of secondary products like Cα aromatics indicate issues with coking. Gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction, but the most active catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations.

        Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature. Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane. Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures.

        Demand for maleic anhydride, crucial in manufacturing unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, is set to grow over the next five years, driven by new applications. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites act as catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases transform into (VO)2P207 upon interaction with hydrocarbons. Enhanced Vv formation at the catalyst bed's end is attributed to a more oxidizing environment. Kinetic studies confirm minimal dependency on hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio changes. An increase in oxygen concentration boosts Vv formation and maleic anhydride production rate, highlighting the efficiency of these catalysts in alkane transformations.

        The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) models oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite sites. Initial activation pathways include heterolytic dissociation and oxidation by extralattice oxygen, favored over reduced gallium species. Regeneration of GaO+ is challenging, and side reactions involving ethanol conversion occur. Key factors influencing catalyst efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes include activation mechanisms, regeneration difficulties, and the role of side reactions.

        Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700°C results in the formation of Mo2C, not metallic Mo. Approximately 60-80% of Mo species exist as Mo2C post-reaction stabilization, with the remaining 20-30% as Mo4+ and Mo5+. Mo2C's formation aligns with the activation of methane for benzene production, suggesting it acts as an active center. However, a coke-modified Mo2C surface might be the actual active species in forming ethylene, indicating its reactivity in the reaction pathway. These findings highlight the importance of Mo2C's role in alkane transformation processes, contributing to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts.

        The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, a novel observation attributed to the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

        As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis. We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab. We have investigated a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism that involves stepwise adsorption of the propane at an oxygen site followed by desorption of a water molecule and propene. The highest energy on the potential energy surface at the B3LYP/6-31G(*) level of theory is about 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants and corresponds to formation of an oxygen vacancy after water elimination. The barriers for propane adsorption and propene elimination are 4560 kcal/mol.

        The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity.

        The kinetic results of Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou fit catalysts of this type. They show very little dependence of the catalytic behavior on a change of the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio. An increase in the oxygen concentration results in an increase in the amount of Vv and of the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

        The demand for this industrially important chemical, used principally in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow over the next 5 years, due in part to new uses for this highly functionalized molecule. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases are transformed to (VO)2P207 by reaction with the hydrocarbon mixture. These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present. The kinetics results of Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou confirm minimal dependence of the catalytic behavior on a change of the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio. An increase in the oxygen concentration results in an increase in the amount of Vv and of the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

        Current challenges are discussed. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach. Resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging.
        
        Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties.
