This improvement stems from more favorable hydrogen recombination conditions in binuclear Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions, facilitated by water's role in forming reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. Experimentally, Ga+ species in ZSM-5 exhibit enhanced activity upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide, attributed to gallyl (GaO+) ion formation. Water's addition increases activity, primarily yielding propylene but also slightly more methane and ethylene under higher water content.
