            Metal-based catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Their industrial importance stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into higher-value products. Key factors include catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, and product selectivity. Studies reveal that supported vanadium oxides are effective due to their high surface area, enabling active sites for desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity for optimized reaction conditions. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving stepwise adsorption and desorption, highlights the efficiency of these catalysts. Challenges include lowering reaction barriers, which can be influenced by interactions with support materials and concerted reactions with oxygen. Research continues to enhance catalyst performance, aiming to improve selectivity, stability, and energy efficiency, crucial for industrial applications and environmental impact mitigation.

            Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials. The calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia.

            The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis. We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab. We have investigated a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism that involves stepwise adsorption of the propane at an oxygen site followed by desorption of a water molecule and propene. The highest energy on the potential energy surface at the B3LYP/6-31G(*) level of theory is about 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants and corresponds to formation of an oxygen vacancy after water elimination. The barriers for propane adsorption and propene elimination are 4560 kcal/mol. Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials.

            Metal-based catalysts, notably supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence alkane transformations through their composition, structure, and reaction conditions, impacting oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. Current challenges in achieving tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems underscore the complexity of this field. Their industrial significance lies in facilitating efficient alkane transformations under controlled conditions, enhancing yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes.

            Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature. Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane. Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures. Although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, polymerization of these olefins was not observed.

            The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption. The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data. It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide.

            Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity. The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment. Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity. These physical and chemical transformations of gallium species are responsible for the activity-selectivity changes in the initial reaction-regeneration cycles of propane aromatisation at 823 K. The enhancement in catalytic performance is mostly due to Ga redispersion as evidenced by RBS data.

            It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C. Therefore, the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking; the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates.

            The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered.

            Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours. The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane. Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

            A comprehensive DFT study on the activation of light alkanes over zinc species stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts play a crucial role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites have been extensively studied for their potential in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Several factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts, including high activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions.

            金属催化剂，尤其是支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转换过程，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。它们在工业中的重要性在于能够高效地将烷烃转化为高价值产品。关键因素包括催化剂的稳定性和成本效益，以及产品的选择性。研究表明，支持的五氧化二钒由于其高表面积而有效，从而为所需化学转换提供了活性位点。金属交换沸石提供了可定制的酸性和碱性以优化反应条件。火星-范克雷威尔机制，涉及分步吸附丙烷至氧位并随后脱除水分子和丙烯，突出了这些催化剂的效率。降低反应势能表面的障碍，包括五氧化二钒簇与支撑材料的相互作用和与氧气的协同反应，是研究的重点。研究继续提高催化剂性能，旨在改善选择性、稳定性和能源效率，对于工业应用和环境影响缓解至关重要。

            降低潜在能量表面势垒的因素可能包括五氧化二钒簇与支撑材料的相互作用和与氧气的协同反应。这项研究的结果为支持的五氧化二钒催化剂的活性提供见解，并为这些材料的未来计算研究奠定了基础。计算表明，V2O5的（010）表面对丙烷ODH不利，其他因素，如支撑材料的影响，负责实验观察到的钒催化剂的催化活性。

            丙烷通过支持的五氧化二钒催化剂的氧化脱氢（ODH）非常重要，因为它在工业催化中的重要性。我们进行了混合密度泛函研究，探讨了丙烷在V2O5（010）表面的氧化脱氢机制。表面使用了五氧化二钒簇和周期性晶片建模。我们调查了涉及在氧位分步吸附丙烷，随后脱除水分子和丙烯的火星-范克雷威尔机制。在B3LYP/6-31G(*)理论水平上，最高能量约为80 kcal/mol高于反应物的能量，对应于水消除后形成氧空位。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒分别为4560 kcal/mol。可能降低潜在能量表面势垒的因素包括五氧化二钒簇与支撑材料的相互作用和与氧气的协同反应。这项研究的结果为支持的五氧化二钒催化剂的活性提供了见解，并为这些材料的未来计算研究奠定了基础。

            金属催化剂，特别是支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，通过其组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转换过程，影响氧化脱氢和沸石催化过程。当前面临的挑战在于实现可调、选择性的烃功能化和解决机制问题，这突显了该领域的复杂性。它们在工业中的重要意义在于在受控条件下促进高效的烷烃转换，提高合成化学和石油化学过程的产率和选择性。

            硅酸盐支持的锆氢化物表现出在温和条件下对烯烃异构化的高活性。1-丁烯的氢化也在这些条件下观察到，但速率低于异构化。催化剂寿命在烯烃异构化比氢化时较短。1-丁烯和1-己烯在室温下很容易异构化为它们各自的热力学混合物。异构化的速率受到立体位阻的控制，在顺序为1-丁烯 > 1-己烯 > 亚甲基苯乙烯 > 甲基环己烷。在较高温度下可以获得更高的异构化速率。虽然描述的催化剂是有效的乙烯聚合催化剂，但没有观察到这些烯烃的聚合。

            上述讨论的实验数据的总结显示，独立于制备方法，含Cu+的ZSM-5沸石表现出非常相似的吸附性质。Cu+离子部分吸附到CuZSM-5上的H2会导致吸附分子的强烈扰动，这是由相应的HH伸缩频率的非常强烈的低频偏移所证明的。还表明强N2吸附位点上吸附的Cu+离子数量略少于吸附分子的数量。通过ZSM-5沸石中Cu+阳离子在a位点的DFT模型，可以更确信地解释实验IR数据。还表明，ZSM-5沸石中Cu+离子修饰的乙烷导致吸附分子的强烈扰动，导致CH伸缩带的巨大红移，这是之前在任何阴离子形式的沸石或氧化物上观察到的乙烷吸附从未有过的现象。

            氢处理增加了活性和芳香族选择性，同时减少了甲烷的形成。后续氧气处理进一步提高了活性和芳香族选择性，并对甲烷选择性几乎没有影响。当催化剂暴露于H2预处理时，丙烷的转化率和芳香化选择性显著增加。有趣的是，第一次H2处理降低了甲烷的选择性，但第一次O2处理没有，而第一次H2和O2处理都增加了芳香化选择性。这些物理和化学转化的镓物种负责在823 K初始反应-再生循环中丙烷芳香化的活性-选择性变化。增强的催化性能主要是由于镓的重新分散，这从RBS数据中得到证实。

            普遍认为这些材料中额外框架镓的主要作用是加速烯烃、二烯或环烯烃的脱氢。高表面积Gaz03和蒸煮的镓硅酸盐自身可以在500-600 C的温度范围内显著催化异构化1-己烯、环己烯和双烯。因此，镓在沸石通道中的分散和氧化状态极大地影响了烷烃脱氢和裂解的相对速率；芳香族/甲烷选择性比率应是这些相对速率的良好指标。

            添加蒸汽到碳氢化合物流体中显著增强了Ga/ZSM-5的丙烷脱氢，导致稳态氢化产物浓度的增加。这种改进归因于在二核氧桥接Ga3+复合物中氢再组合的有利条件，与单核GaO+离子相比。水的存在促进了反应性部分水合镓物种的形成，从而提高了催化剂的活性。作为活性位点的候选物，考虑了各种单核镓含氢离子（Ga+、GaH2+、GaH2+、GaO+）。

            2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂在700C暴露于CH4或CH4/H2时，Mo离子被还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo。在反应达到稳态后，大约60-80%的Mo物种以Mo2C的形式存在，但部分Mo（20-30%）即使在CH4或CH4/H2中长时间加热到700C时仍保持存在，没有被还原。Mo2C的形成与苯的初始激活阶段的时间相吻合，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷激活的活性中心。由于催化剂上预先形成Mo2C而不完全消除诱导期，推测清洁的Mo2C表面可能过于活泼，无法形成更高碳氢化合物，因此可能存在被焦炭修改的Mo2C表面可能是形成作为反应中间体的乙烯的实际活性物种。

            对轻质烷烃在ZSM-5沸石中通过锌物种的全面DFT研究。金属催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件在烷烃转换过程的机制和效率中起着至关重要的作用。支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石已经在烷烃转换，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应方面进行了广泛的研究。几个因素有助于这些催化剂在工业中的重要意义，包括活性高、选择性强和在各种反应条件下的稳定性。

            ※※※
            综合理解和前瞻展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进步和发现，有机会探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来研究努力可能侧重于开发具有特定烷烃转换选择性和稳定性的催化剂，优化反应机制的效率，并探索不同金属组分在催化剂中的协同效应。此外，结合计算方法与实验研究的整合，可以加深对催化过程的理解，并识别新型催化剂设计的机会。未来研究还可以深入探究反应条件的优化，包括温度、压力和共催化剂的存在，以实现更高的产率和选择性。此外，开发更可持续和环保的催化剂，能够在温和条件下运行，将是烷烃转换领域的一个重大进展，可能减少环境影响并提高经济可行性。
