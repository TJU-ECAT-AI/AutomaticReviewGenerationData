Oxygen treatment stabilizes and anchors these dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state. The interplay between these treatments and catalyst properties enables efficient alkane-to-aromatic conversion, making these catalysts crucial in petrochemical industries, such as propane aromatization.
