Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support material is crucial for optimizing alkane transformations through processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, benefit from this knowledge, leading to the generation of well-defined surface species. This approach's success hinges on comprehending the interactions between organometallic complexes and the support, as highlighted by the quotes, which underscore the importance of these reactions for catalytic efficiency.

        The demand for maleic anhydride, primarily for unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, is anticipated to increase over the next five years due to new applications. Supported vanadium oxides convert VOPO4 to (VO)2P207 with hydrocarbon interaction, enhancing Vv formation in a more oxidizing environment. Catalyst behavior shows minimal dependence on hydrocarbon/oxygen ratios, but increased oxygen concentration boosts Vv and maleic anhydride formation. The efficiency of these catalysts is crucial for industrial applications due to their ability to convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities, despite their susceptibility to degradation under harsh conditions.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis. We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving stepwise adsorption of the propane at an oxygen site followed by desorption of a water molecule and propene, is pivotal for the conversion of alkanes to higher-value products. Supported vanadium oxides, due to their high surface area and active sites, are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity, optimizing reaction conditions for maximum product selectivity and yield.

        Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, notably in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed processes. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, involving stepwise adsorption and desorption steps, is pivotal for the conversion of alkanes to higher-value products. Supported vanadium oxides, due to their high surface area and active sites, are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity, optimizing reaction conditions for maximum product selectivity and yield. Industrial significance stems from factors like catalyst stability, cost-effectiveness, and selectivity, making these catalysts indispensable in petrochemical industries for the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Research aims to enhance catalyst performance through improved selectivity and reduced energy consumption, contributing to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation.

        There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond, the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia site are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

        A comprehensive DFT study on the activation of light alkanes over zinc species stabilized in ZSM-5 zeolite reveals the role of catalyst composition and structure in enhancing efficiency. A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach, and resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging. Mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst, demonstrating the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformations. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700Â°C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo, suggesting Mo2C as the active center for methane activation. The formation of Mo2C correlates with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane. Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

        In studying partial methane oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts, three types of tungsten species were identified, differing in dispersion based on tungsten loading. This dispersion impacts catalyst activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. Key findings reveal the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The quotes highlight the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, and WO3 crystallites, their relative amounts varying with tungsten loading, and their role in the catalytic conversion process. The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation over gallium/zeolite catalysts, particularly Ga/ZSM-5. This enhancement is due to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium complexes compared to mononuclear gallium species. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the increased catalytic activity.

        The recent results of maleic anhydride synthesis from C, hydrocarbons indicate the binary vanadium phosphorus oxide system's effectiveness. Literature results align with these conclusions, showing that the change of valence state of vanadium depends upon a balance of three factors: the redox potential of the feed, the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction. The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction. The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ. Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS. In another study of the stoichiometric reaction of the hydride with propane, 800 mg of (= SiO)3Zr-H (0.78 wt.-% Zr) was divided into three reactors. We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane. For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120Â°C.

        The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmolâ1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ÎE=102kJmolâ1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Ã, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Ã with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Ã with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

        The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies. It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption. The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data. It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide. It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

        The integration of the findings discussed in this review section highlights the multifaceted role of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The optimization of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions plays a pivotal role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of these transformations. The insights gained from studying individual catalysts and their mechanisms contribute to the development of more efficient catalysts and processes, aiming to improve the sustainability and economic viability of petrochemical industries. The challenges, such as achieving selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems, point to the need for continued research and innovation in the field. The advancements in understanding the interactions between metal species and the support, as well as the detailed mechanisms of alkane activation and product formation, provide a solid foundation for the future development of catalysts that can address these challenges and pave the way for more sustainable and efficient alkane transformation processes.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with tailored properties for specific alkane transformations, incorporating advanced materials science and nanotechnology to enhance selectivity and efficiency. The exploration of alternative activation mechanisms, such as electrocatalysis or plasma-assisted catalysis, could offer new avenues for more environmentally friendly and economically viable alkane transformation processes. Additionally, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to predict and optimize catalyst performance could revolutionize the design and application of metal-based catalysts. The field is poised to leverage the wealth of knowledge accumulated so far to tackle the remaining challenges and to unlock new possibilities in the realm of alkane transformations, contributing to the advancement of chemical synthesis and petrochemical industries towards more sustainable practices.
