          "Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%."
          "Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites."
          "The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading."
          "It was found that supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."
          "The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites."
          "The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading."
          "The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen over W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2 and H2O."
          "The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen over silica supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated."

          The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loadings, revealing three types of supported tungsten species. These species exhibit varying dispersion and influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction results in the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The mechanism for this process has been widely explored.
