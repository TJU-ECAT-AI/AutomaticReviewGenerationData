The quotes also highlight the direct link between the presence of a more oxidizing atmosphere and the enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed. They discuss the synthesis of maleic anhydride from C, hydrocarbons and emphasize the impact of the redox properties of the feed on the catalyst's surface oxidation state. The redox state of vanadium is influenced by a balance of three factors: the redox potential of the feed, the rate of catalyst oxidation, and the rate of catalyst reduction. The quotes further mention that at low conversion rates, catalysts with a P:V ratio of 0.95 and 1.01 exhibit similar activity, selectivity, and kinetic behavior. An excess of phosphorus affects the rate of oxidation slightly but significantly alters the rate of reduction. To correlate the observed variations in redox properties with the catalytic behavior in n-butane oxidation, the quotes suggest examining the fresh catalyst used by these authors. For vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts, the content of phosphorus below the stoichiometric requirement for P:V = 1.0 primarily influences the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, while catalysts with a higher phosphorus content relative to P:V = 1.0 predominantly impact the rate of maleic anhydride formation. The quotes also note that treating PVO catalysts with a cyclic process involving pure O2 followed by butenes leads to a decrease in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to steady-state behavior. Similar conclusions regarding the effect of phosphorus on the kinetic behavior of PVO catalysts in n-butane oxidation were presented by Wenig and Schrader.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},
