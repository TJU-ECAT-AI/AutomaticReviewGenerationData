An excess of phosphorus affects the rate of oxidation slightly but significantly alters the rate of reduction. To correlate the observed variations in redox properties with the catalytic behavior in n-butane oxidation, the quotes suggest examining the fresh catalyst used by these authors. For vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts, the content of phosphorus below the stoichiometric requirement for P:V = 1.0 primarily influences the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, while catalysts with a higher phosphorus content relative to P:V = 1.0 predominantly impact the rate of maleic anhydride formation. The quotes also note that treating PVO catalysts with a cyclic process involving pure O2 followed by butenes leads to a decrease in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to steady-state behavior. Similar conclusions regarding the effect of phosphorus on the kinetic behavior of PVO catalysts in n-butane oxidation were presented by Wenig and Schrader.", "Chinese": "提供的引文关注了在某些条件下范德酰基磷酸盐催化剂的行为，指出其快速且不可逆失活的结果是增强了选择性。形成马来酸酐在催化床末端的不稳定性在高丁烷转化选择性中起着关键作用。引文还强调了存在更氧化的大气环境与催化床末端形成更多Vv之间的直接联系。引文讨论了从C,烃合成马来酸酐，并强调了喂料的还原性对催化剂表面氧化状态的影响。V的红氧化状态受到三个因素的平衡影响：喂料的还原电势、催化剂氧化速率和催化剂还原速率。此外，引文提到在低转化率下，具有P:V比0.95和1.01的催化剂表现出一致的活性、选择性和动力学行为。过量的磷对氧化速率的影响较小，但显著影响还原速率。为了将观察到的红氧化性质变化与n-丁烷氧化中新鲜催化剂的催化行为相关联，引文建议检查这些作者使用的催化剂。对于范德酰基磷酸盐催化剂，磷含量低于P:V = 1.0的化学计量要求主要影响马来酸酐连续氧化的速率，而与P:V = 1.0相对的催化剂具有较高磷含量则主要影响马来酸酐的形成速率。最后，引文提到，用纯氧气和异丁烯对PVO催化剂进行周期性处理后，马来酸酐的形成选择性降低，与稳态行为相比。Wenig和Schrader最近的研究结果表明，磷对PVO催化剂在n-丁烷氧化中的动力学行为的影响是类似的。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},
