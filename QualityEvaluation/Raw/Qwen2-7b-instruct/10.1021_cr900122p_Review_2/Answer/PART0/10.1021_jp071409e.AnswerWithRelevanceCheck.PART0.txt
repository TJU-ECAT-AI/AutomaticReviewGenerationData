          [1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory."
          [2] "Similarly to other catalysts with transition metal oxo bonds, the initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."
          [3] "Propene is also directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate."
          [4] "Generation of surface propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting."
          [5] "At 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."
          [6] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."
          [7] "The mechanism suggested is compatible with turnover frequencies and activation energies available, while other suggestions (CH addition onto the metal oxo bond) are not supported by the calculations."
          [8] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."
          [9] "Comparison of both TOF and activation energies shows that the mechanistic details we suggest are compatible with known observations."

          The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings. The mechanism is compatible with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests that vanadia sites on the bulk surface might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation than those supported as monomers on silica. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling.

          本研究利用密度泛函理论探讨了丙烷氧化脱氢的机制。在硅胶上的单核钒氧化物物种通过范德华替换的硅三氧硅酸盐进行建模。初始步骤涉及由范德华氧原子执行的氢原子抽取，形成包含丙基自由基和HOVIV位点的二自由基中间体。从这个中间体的后续氢原子抽取可以直接产生丙烯或通过醇的形成。首次氢原子抽取成为决定性步骤，有助于提高过程的整体效率。在750 K时，首次氢原子抽取的显着活化能约为123 kJ/mol，与实验结果相匹配。该机制与已知的周转频率和活化能相符合，不同于涉及CH键添加到金属氧基团上的替代假设。与V2O5晶面的计算比较表明，如果它们是作为三维颗粒的一部分而不是作为硅胶上的单体存在，则晶面表面的范德亚位点在丙烷氧化脱氢化中的活性可能更高。详细机制为未来实验分析和微动力学建模提供了坚实的基础。

          [1] "Comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces."
          [2] "Unfortunately, the density functional used in ref 9 (PW91) was different from the one we use (B3LYP)."
          [3] "Another critical difference is that the oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, that is, formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here (Table 1), whereas it is strongly exothermic with VO2+."
          [4] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

          Comparisons with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces highlight that vanadia sites might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation if they are part of the bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies might be lower for V2O5 crystallites on surfaces, as only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles. The oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, resulting in the formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here, unlike with VO2+, which exhibits a strong exothermic characteristic. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies for propene formation have been observed to be around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K.

          与V2O5晶格的计算比较表明，如果它们是作为三维颗粒的一部分而不是作为硅胶上的单体存在，则晶面表面的范德亚位点在丙烷氧化脱氢化过程中可能更为活跃。然而，表面物种的显着转换频率可能较低，因为在三维粒子中只有部分位点是可访问的。催化循环的氧化部分导致形成丙烯和H2O·VIII(d2)，对于这里研究的表面物种是吸热的，而与VO2+不同，VO2+表现出强烈的放热特性。对于V2O5/SiO2催化剂，当范德亚覆盖度低于3 V/nm2时，丙烯生成的显着转换频率约为748 K时的0.01 s-1和623 K时的0.3 × 10-3 s-1。
