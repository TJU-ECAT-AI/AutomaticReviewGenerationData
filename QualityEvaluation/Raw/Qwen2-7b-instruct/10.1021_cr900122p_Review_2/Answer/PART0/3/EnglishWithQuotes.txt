The quotes also suggest that the observed variations in redox properties can be correlated with the catalytic behavior in n-butane oxidation on the fresh catalyst. For vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts, the content of phosphorus below the stoichiometric requirement for P:V = 1.0 primarily affects the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, while catalysts with a higher phosphorus content relative to P:V = 1.0 predominantly impact the rate of maleic anhydride formation. Lastly, the quotes mention that treating PVO catalysts with a cyclic process involving pure O2 followed by butenes results in a decrease in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to steady-state behavior. Similar conclusions regarding the effect of phosphorus on the kinetic behavior of PVO catalysts in n-butane oxidation were presented by Wenig and Schrader.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr00083a003"},

The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, with or without additional Ga2O3, can be reduced to Ga+ up to a limit set by the number of anionic framework sites. Reduction results in dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are less active or selective compared to materials that have been substantially reoxidized using air or traces of oxygen in inert gases. Studies involving TGA, DSC, and XRD confirm rapid reoxidation at 550Â°C. The reoxidation does not regenerate Ga2O3 but rather a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+, which seems optimal for producing aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ remains stable under typical ethane dehydrogenation conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen.", "Doi": "10.1016/0926-860x(92)80336-b"},
