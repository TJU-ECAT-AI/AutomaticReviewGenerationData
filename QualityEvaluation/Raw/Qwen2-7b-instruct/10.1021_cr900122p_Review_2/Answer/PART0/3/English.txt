Under specific conditions, the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deactivates but becomes more selective. Analyzing the changes in the catalyst surface along the catalytic bed is essential for understanding its behavior. The increased formation of Vv at the catalyst bed's end is directly connected to the more oxidizing atmosphere present. Balanced catalysts show less noticeable effects because of the decreased rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv. At low oxygen concentrations, partial oxidation products (such as butadiene during but-l-ene oxidation or butenes and butadiene during n-butane oxidation) are observed.

Additional evidence supports the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, with or without additional Ga2O3, can be reduced to Ga+ up to a limit set by the number of anionic framework sites. Reduction results in dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are less active or selective compared to materials that have been substantially reoxidized using air or traces of oxygen in inert gases. Studies involving TGA, DSC, and XRD confirm rapid reoxidation at 550°C. The reoxidation does not regenerate Ga2O3 but rather a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+, which seems optimal for producing aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ remains stable under typical ethane dehydrogenation conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen.

DFT modeling of hydrogen adsorption by Cu+ cations stabilized in three distinct clusters (Fig. 1(ac)) reveals that their geometries resemble those of the a-sites in ZSM-5 zeolite. However, the clusters vary in the localization of aluminum atoms. The optimized CuO bond lengths derived from these calculations are listed in Table 2. As expected, copper cations in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters are positioned closer to aluminum atoms. Consequently, despite the effective coordination number of Cu+ by zeolitic oxygen atoms being 3, the bond lengths involving two oxygen atoms adjacent to aluminum are slightly shorter compared to the third CuO bond. In contrast, the Cu+ZIII cluster has a copper cation that is strongly shielded by surrounding relatively close O4, O5, and O7 atoms.

The quotes discuss the behavior of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts, emphasizing the catalyst's rapid and irreversible deactivation under certain conditions, becoming more selective. The instability of maleic anhydride at the back end of the catalytic bed is identified as a critical factor for high butane conversion selectivity. Enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly linked to the presence of a more oxidizing atmosphere. The quotes also reference the synthesis of maleic anhydride from C, hydrocarbons, highlighting the importance of the redox properties of the feed in influencing the catalyst's surface oxidation state. The redox state of vanadium is shown to depend on a balance of three factors: the redox potential of the feed, the rate of catalyst oxidation, and the rate of catalyst reduction. Furthermore, the quotes indicate that at low conversion, catalysts with a P:V ratio of 0.95 and 1.01 exhibit consistent activity, selectivity, and kinetic behavior. Excess phosphorus affects the rate of oxidation minimally but significantly alters the rate of reduction. The quotes also suggest that the observed variations in redox properties can be correlated with the catalytic behavior in n-butane oxidation on the fresh catalyst. For vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts, the content of phosphorus below the stoichiometric requirement for P:V = 1.0 primarily affects the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, while catalysts with a higher phosphorus content relative to P:V = 1.0 predominantly impact the rate of maleic anhydride formation. Lastly, the quotes mention that treating PVO catalysts with a cyclic process involving pure O2 followed by butenes results in a decrease in maleic anhydride selectivity compared to steady-state behavior. Similar conclusions regarding the effect of phosphorus on the kinetic behavior of PVO catalysts in n-butane oxidation were presented by Wenig and Schrader.
