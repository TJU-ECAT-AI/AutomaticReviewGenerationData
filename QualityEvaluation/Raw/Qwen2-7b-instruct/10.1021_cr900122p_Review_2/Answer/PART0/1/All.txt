The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.", "Chinese": "在过去几年里，已经取得了一些关于支持型金属氧化物催化剂中表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构的显著进展。比较表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构信息与对应的反应性/选择性信息，为我们提供了对表面钒酸盐物种反应性性质的一些见解。终端V=O键在烃氧化反应中对表面钒酸盐物种的反应性影响不大。跨桥V-O-V键可能不会影响许多氧化反应，但对于那些可能受到这种跨桥键影响的反应，TOF仅可能增加一个数量级。然而，跨桥V-O-支持键似乎是最重要的键，因为它可以改变烃氧化反应的TOF高达四个数量级。氧化物支持的特定相以及特定制备方法似乎不影响表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构或反应性。所需表面钒酸盐位点的数量取决于特定的反应物分子。仅需要一个表面钒酸盐位点的氧化反应通常对表面钒酸盐覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在不敏感。需要多个表面钒酸盐位点的氧化反应对表面钒酸盐覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在非常敏感。然而，相互作用的添加剂影响所有烃氧化反应，因为它们修改了表面钒酸盐位点。酸性和碱性添加剂也影响烃氧化反应的选择性，但其影响似乎是反应特异性的，并且由于目前的数据有限，不能进行概括。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5"},

DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provides clearer interpretation of experimental IR data. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.", "Chinese": "上述讨论的实验数据表明，含Cu+的ZSM-5沸石，无论制备方法如何，表现出相似的吸附性质。CuZSM-5中部分Cu+离子吸附氢气时，会引发吸附分子的强烈扰动，这从相应HH拉伸频率的显著低频位移中可以看出。强烈吸附分子氢的Cu+离子数量少于强烈吸附氮分子的数量。对Cu+离子在ZSM-5沸石a位点吸附氢气的DFT模型有助于更准确地解释实验红外（IR）数据。改性后的ZSM-5沸石与Cu+离子结合，吸附乙烷导致吸附分子发生强烈的扰动，引起CH拉伸波段的显著红移，这是在任何其他类型的阳离子沸石或氧化物上观察到的乙烷吸附中从未出现过的现象。吸附乙烷分子的异常性质来源于与交换得到的一价铜离子形成的强s型吸附复合物。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.09.037"},

Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.", "Chinese": "上述讨论的实验数据表明，含Cu+的ZSM-5沸石，无论制备方法如何，表现出相似的吸附性质。CuZSM-5中部分Cu+离子吸附氢气时，会引发吸附分子的强烈扰动，这从相应HH拉伸频率的显著低频位移中可以看出。强烈吸附分子氢的Cu+离子数量少于强烈吸附氮分子的数量。对Cu+离子在ZSM-5沸石a位点吸附氢气的DFT模型有助于更准确地解释实验红外（IR）数据。改性后的ZSM-5沸石与Cu+离子结合，吸附乙烷导致吸附分子发生强烈的扰动，引起CH拉伸波段的显著红移，这是在任何其他类型的阳离子沸石或氧化物上观察到的乙烷吸附中从未出现过的现象。吸附乙烷分子的异常性质来源于与交换得到的一价铜离子形成的强s型吸附复合物。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.09.037"},

Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings. The mechanism is compatible with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests that vanadia sites on the bulk surface might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation than those supported as monomers on silica. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling.", "Chinese": "本研究利用密度泛函理论探讨了丙烷氧化脱氢的机制。在硅胶上的单核钒氧化物物种通过范德华替换的硅三氧硅酸盐进行建模。初始步骤涉及由范德华氧原子执行的氢原子抽取，形成包含丙基自由基和HOVIV位点的二自由基中间体。从这个中间体的后续氢原子抽取可以直接产生丙烯或通过醇的形成。首次氢原子抽取成为决定性步骤，有助于提高过程的整体效率。在750 K时，首次氢原子抽取的显着活化能约为123 kJ/mol，与实验结果相匹配。该机制与已知的周转频率和活化能相符合，不同于涉及CH键添加到金属氧基团上的替代假设。与V2O5晶面的计算比较表明，如果它们是作为三维颗粒的一部分而不是作为硅胶上的单体存在，则晶面表面的范德亚位点在丙烷氧化脱氢化中的活性可能更高。详细机制为未来实验分析和微动力学建模提供了坚实的基础。", "Doi": "10.1021/jp071409e"},
