          [3] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."

          [6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

          <p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
          <p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>

[1] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydrogenation."

          [3] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [4] "Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems."
          [5] "Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
          [6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."
          [7] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."

          <p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
          <p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>

          [4] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."
          [5] "It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide."
          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory."
          [2] "Similarly to other catalysts with transition metal oxo bonds, the initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."

          [3] "These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
          [4] "On equilibrated catalysts, this effect is much less evident,due to the reduced rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv."
          [5] "In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation,or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst."

          [2] "About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
          [3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene,indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
          [4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst,without coke deposition,does not completely eliminate the induction period,it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and,thus,that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

          [2] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules,which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."
          [3] "It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption."
          [4] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."
          [5] "It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide."
          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory."
          [2] "Similarly to other catalysts with transition metal oxo bonds, the initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."
          [3] "Propene is also directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate."
          [4] "Generation of surface propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting."
          [5] "At 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

          [7] "The mechanism suggested is compatible with turnover frequencies and activation energies available, while other suggestions (CH addition onto the metal oxo bond) are not supported by the calculations."
          [8] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."

          [2] "It is thus worthwhile to analyze the variations in the catalyst surface as a function of position in the catalytic bed."
          [3] "These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
          [4] "On equilibrated catalysts, this effect is much less evident,due to the reduced rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv."
          [5] "In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation,or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst."

          [7] "Literature results are in line with these conclusions."
          [8] "The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action."

          [16] "When PVO catalysts were treated in a cyclic fashion with pure O2 followed by butenes, the selectivity in maleic anhydride formation diminished as compared with steady-state behavior."

[1] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C,rather than to metallic Mo."
          [2] "About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
          [3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene,indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
          [4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst,without coke deposition,does not completely eliminate the induction period,it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and,thus,that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

          [4] "The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude."
          [5] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."

          [8] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [9] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [10] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [11] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

[1] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane."
          [2] "Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."
          [3] "The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment."
          [4] "Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity."

          [7] "As seen from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3, the improvement in activity is much more drastic for Z356 SL1 than for Z234 SL2 after the first H2-O2 treatment."
          [8] "The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity and average H/C ratio are consistent with the view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BriSnsted sites favour propane activation and aromatisation whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. Ga2O3, at the outer surface of the crystallites is mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) the need for carbon chain growth via acid-catalysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisation."

"The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity."

          "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
          "The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom."

          "Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion."
          "The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group."
          "The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1."

          "Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed."
          "The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials."
          "Our calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia."

"The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity."

          [5] "Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
          [6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."

          "The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom."
          "For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."
          "Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion."
          "The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group."
          "The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1."

[1] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydrogenation."
          [2] "High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C."
          [3] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [4] "Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems."
          [5] "Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
          [6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."
          [7] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."
          [8] "We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs."
          [9] "The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ reduction portion shown in Fig. 6."
          [10] "Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen;however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor."

<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach.</p>
          <p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
          <p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>
          <p>However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult.</p>
          <p>In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were discussed.</p>
          <p>Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

[1] "The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties."
          [2] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules,which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."
          [3] "It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption."
          [4] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."
          [5] "It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide."
          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory."
          [2] "Similarly to other catalysts with transition metal oxo bonds, the initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."
          [3] "Propene is also directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate."
          [4] "Generation of surface propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting."
          [5] "At 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

          [7] "The mechanism suggested is compatible with turnover frequencies and activation energies available, while other suggestions (CH addition onto the metal oxo bond) are not supported by the calculations."
          [8] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."

          [2] "It is thus worthwhile to analyze the variations in the catalyst surface as a function of position in the catalytic bed."
          [3] "These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
          [4] "On equilibrated catalysts, this effect is much less evident,due to the reduced rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv."
          [5] "In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation,or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst."
          [6] "The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction."
          [7] "Literature results are in line with these conclusions."
          [8] "The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action."

          [16] "When PVO catalysts were treated in a cyclic fashion with pure O2 followed by butenes, the selectivity in maleic anhydride formation diminished as compared with steady-state behavior."

[1] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C,rather than to metallic Mo."
          [2] "About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
          [3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene,indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
          [4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst,without coke deposition,does not completely eliminate the induction period,it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and,thus,that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

          [9] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [10] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [11] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

[1] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane."

          [8] "The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity and average H/C ratio are consistent with the view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BriSnsted sites favour propane activation and aromatisation whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. Ga2O3, at the outer surface of the crystallites is mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) the need for carbon chain growth via acid-catalysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisation."

          "Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures."
          "Although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, polymerization of these olefins was not observed."
          "We propose a mechanism to account for the catalytic activity shown by supported species, involving supported dialkyl species."
          "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation to butane was complete within 30 h."
          "Catalyst lifetime is shorter under hydrogenation conditions than that observed in isomerization experiments."

[1] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydrogenation."
          [2] "High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C."
          [3] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [4] "Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems."
          [5] "Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
          [6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."
          [7] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."
          [8] "We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs."
          [9] "The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ reduction portion shown in Fig. 6."
          [10] "Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen;however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor."

<p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach.</p>
          <p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
          <p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>
          <p>However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult.</p>
          <p>In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were discussed.</p>
          <p>Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

"Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%."
          "Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites."
          "The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading."
          "It was found that supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."
          "The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites."
          "The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading."
          "The reaction of partial oxidation of methane with molecular oxygen over W/HZSM-5 catalyst leads to the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2 and H2O."
          "The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen over silica supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated."

[1] "The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties."
          [2] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules,which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."
          [3] "It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption."
          [4] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."
          [5] "It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide."
          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory."
          [2] "Similarly to other catalysts with transition metal oxo bonds, the initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."
          [3] "Propene is also directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate."
          [4] "Generation of surface propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting."
          [5] "At 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."
          [6] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."
          [7] "The mechanism suggested is compatible with turnover frequencies and activation energies available, while other suggestions (CH addition onto the metal oxo bond) are not supported by the calculations."
          [8] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."
          [9] "Comparison of both TOF and activation energies shows that the mechanistic details we suggest are compatible with known observations."

[1] "Current challenges are discussed."
          [2] "A tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization is still out of reach."
          [3] "Resolving mechanistic problems has proved particularly challenging."
