The demand for maleic anhydride, a chemical primarily utilized in unsaturated polyester resin manufacturing, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is forecasted to expand over the next five years. This growth is partly attributed to the introduction of novel applications for the highly functionalized molecule. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases are converted into (VO)2P207 through interaction with the hydrocarbon mixture. These findings indicate that the enhanced formation of Vv at the catalyst bed's termination is directly linked to the more oxidizing atmosphere present. The kinetic results from Buchanan, Sundaresan, and Lerou are applicable to catalysts of this kind, showing minimal dependence on changes in the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio. Furthermore, an increase in oxygen concentration leads to an increase in the amount of Vv and the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
          3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
          4. Since the preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without coke deposition doesn't fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that a coke-modified Mo2C surface could be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond does not critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The use of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments plays a critical role in modifying the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. H2 treatment enhances the dispersion of metals like gallium, leading to an increase in the number of dual active sites that combine with Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment then stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which is responsible for the catalyst's optimal activity. The interplay between these treatments and the catalyst's properties enables the efficient transformation of alkanes into valuable aromatic compounds, making these catalysts essential components in the petrochemical industry for processes like propane aromatization.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability under diverse conditions.

Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support material is crucial for the success of surface organometallic chemistry in catalysis. This knowledge enables the generation of well-defined surface species, which significantly influences the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst.

The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Mononuclear Ga-containing cations have been considered as potential active sites for alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Adding water to the feed strongly increases the activity, with the main product remaining propylene, though with increasing water content, slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are crucial in industrial applications due to their ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes, and the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Supported vanadium oxides are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and ability to form active sites facilitating the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for optimization of reaction conditions to maximize product selectivity and yield. The industrial importance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Continuous research aims to enhance catalyst performance through improved selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, contributing to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

The study focuses on the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and the deuteration process. It was found that the primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The selectivity of the activation indicates a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism. The model assumes no kinetic isotope effect during the ionization of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer. The selectivity observed may reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of specific compounds. The intensity of the C-H bond is measured as the integrated area of the specified spectral region.

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of alkane conversions, with factors such as selectivity towards desired products, stability under reaction conditions, and resistance to harsh operating environments contributing to their industrial significance. Supported vanadium oxides are highly active in oxidative dehydrogenation, while metal-exchanged zeolites enable controlled kinetics in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The efficiency of these catalysts is further influenced by the reaction conditions, which can affect the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance controls the rates of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins, and higher temperatures can enhance isomerization rates. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers. Their robustness against degradation under harsh conditions and potential for recycling adds to their industrial significance.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts faces challenges due to the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics, which can lead to coking. The work presented aimed to provide evidence that gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and demonstrate that while reduction of Ga& is necessary for dispersing gallium within the zeolite, the most active and selective catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. Differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced. The redox cycle of sample B was reproduced in the DSC analysis, showing the drying/reduction phase depicted in Fig. 6. Some of the excess heat during reoxidation came from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen, but it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this factor alone.

The study investigates the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. These pathways are thermodynamically and kinetically favored over activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Possible side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions, these sites do not account for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loadings, revealing three types of supported tungsten species. These species exhibit varying dispersion and influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction results in the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The mechanism for this process has been widely explored.

The experimental data shows that Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of preparation method, exhibit similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 causes strong perturbations in adsorbed molecules, evident through significant low-frequency shifts in corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is less than those strongly adsorbing N2. DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provides clearer interpretation of experimental IR data. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings. The mechanism is compatible with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests that vanadia sites on the bulk surface might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation than those supported as monomers on silica. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Challenges in achieving tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems highlight the complexity and ongoing research needed in this field. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations under controlled conditions, leading to enhanced yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes.

The provided quotes discuss the behavior of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts in the context of alkane transformations, specifically focusing on the influence of conditions such as oxygen concentration, the presence of vanadium(V) species, and the redox properties of the feed on the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and kinetic behavior. Key points include the catalyst's irreversible deactivation, enhanced selectivity at the end of the catalytic bed due to a more oxidizing atmosphere, the effect of catalyst equilibration on the observed behavior, the observation of partial oxidation products under low oxygen conditions, and the role of phosphorus content in affecting the rate of oxidation and reduction. The quotes also mention the correlation between redox properties and catalytic behavior, the synthesis of maleic anhydride from hydrocarbons, and the importance of phosphorus in controlling the catalyst's performance in n-butane oxidation.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
          3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
          4. Since the preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without coke deposition doesn't fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that a coke-modified Mo2C surface could be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates.

The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Mononuclear Ga-containing cations have been considered as potential active sites for alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Adding water to the feed strongly increases the activity, with the main product remaining propylene, though with increasing water content, slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are crucial in industrial applications due to their ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes, and the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Supported vanadium oxides are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and ability to form active sites facilitating the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for optimization of reaction conditions to maximize product selectivity and yield. The industrial importance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Continuous research aims to enhance catalyst performance through improved selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, contributing to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

The study focuses on the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and the deuteration process. It was found that the primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The selectivity of the activation indicates a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism. The model assumes no kinetic isotope effect during the ionization of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer. The selectivity observed may reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of specific compounds. The intensity of the C-H bond is measured as the integrated area of the specified spectral region.

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of alkane conversions, with factors such as selectivity towards desired products, stability under reaction conditions, and resistance to harsh operating environments contributing to their industrial significance. Supported vanadium oxides are highly active in oxidative dehydrogenation, while metal-exchanged zeolites enable controlled kinetics in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The efficiency of these catalysts is further influenced by the reaction conditions, which can affect the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance controls the rates of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins, and higher temperatures can enhance isomerization rates. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers. Their robustness against degradation under harsh conditions and potential for recycling adds to their industrial significance.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts faces challenges due to the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics, which can lead to coking. The work presented aimed to provide evidence that gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and demonstrate that while reduction of Ga& is necessary for dispersing gallium within the zeolite, the most active and selective catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. Differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced. The redox cycle of sample B was reproduced in the DSC analysis, showing the drying/reduction phase depicted in Fig. 6. Some of the excess heat during reoxidation came from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen, but it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this factor alone.

The study investigates the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. These pathways are thermodynamically and kinetically favored over activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Possible side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions, these sites do not account for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loadings, revealing three types of supported tungsten species. These species exhibit varying dispersion and influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction results in the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The mechanism for this process has been widely explored.

The experimental data shows that Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of preparation method, exhibit similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 causes strong perturbations in adsorbed molecules, evident through significant low-frequency shifts in corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is less than those strongly adsorbing N2. DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provides clearer interpretation of experimental IR data. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings. The mechanism is compatible with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests that vanadia sites on the bulk surface might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation than those supported as monomers on silica. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Challenges in achieving tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems highlight the complexity and ongoing research needed in this field. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations under controlled conditions, leading to enhanced yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes.

The provided quotes discuss the behavior of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts in the context of alkane transformations, specifically focusing on the influence of conditions such as oxygen concentration, the presence of vanadium(V) species, and the redox properties of the feed on the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and kinetic behavior. Key points include the catalyst's irreversible deactivation, enhanced selectivity at the end of the catalytic bed due to a more oxidizing atmosphere, the effect of catalyst equilibration on the observed behavior, the observation of partial oxidation products under low oxygen conditions, and the role of phosphorus content in affecting the rate of oxidation and reduction. The quotes also mention the correlation between redox properties and catalytic behavior, the synthesis of maleic anhydride from hydrocarbons, and the importance of phosphorus in controlling the catalyst's performance in n-butane oxidation.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
          3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
          4. Since the preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without coke deposition doesn't fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that a coke-modified Mo2C surface could be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond does not critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The use of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments plays a critical role in modifying the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. H2 treatment enhances the dispersion of metals like gallium, leading to an increase in the number of dual active sites that combine with Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment then stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which is responsible for the catalyst's optimal activity. The interplay between these treatments and the catalyst's properties enables the efficient transformation of alkanes into valuable aromatic compounds, making these catalysts essential components in the petrochemical industry for processes like propane aromatization.

The mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst.

The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates.

Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.

Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts faces challenges due to the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics, which can lead to coking. The work presented aimed to provide evidence that gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and demonstrate that while reduction of Ga& is necessary for dispersing gallium within the zeolite, the most active and selective catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. Differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced. The redox cycle of sample B was reproduced in the DSC analysis, showing the drying/reduction phase depicted in Fig. 6. Some of the excess heat during reoxidation came from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen, but it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this factor alone.

The study investigates the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. These pathways are thermodynamically and kinetically favored over activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Possible side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions, these sites do not account for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loadings, revealing three types of supported tungsten species. These species exhibit varying dispersion and influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction results in the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The mechanism for this process has been widely explored.

The experimental data shows that Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of preparation method, exhibit similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 causes strong perturbations in adsorbed molecules, evident through significant low-frequency shifts in corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is less than those strongly adsorbing N2. DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provides clearer interpretation of experimental IR data. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings. The mechanism is compatible with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests that vanadia sites on the bulk surface might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation than those supported as monomers on silica. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Challenges in achieving tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems highlight the complexity and ongoing research needed in this field. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations under controlled conditions, leading to enhanced yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes.

The provided quotes discuss the behavior of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts in the context of alkane transformations, specifically focusing on the influence of conditions such as oxygen concentration, the presence of vanadium(V) species, and the redox properties of the feed on the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and kinetic behavior. Key points include the catalyst's irreversible deactivation, enhanced selectivity at the end of the catalytic bed due to a more oxidizing atmosphere, the effect of catalyst equilibration on the observed behavior, the observation of partial oxidation products under low oxygen conditions, and the role of phosphorus content in affecting the rate of oxidation and reduction. The quotes also mention the correlation between redox properties and catalytic behavior, the synthesis of maleic anhydride from hydrocarbons, and the importance of phosphorus in controlling the catalyst's performance in n-butane oxidation.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
          3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
          4. Since the preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without coke deposition doesn't fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that a coke-modified Mo2C surface could be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond does not critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The use of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments plays a critical role in modifying the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. H2 treatment enhances the dispersion of metals like gallium, leading to an increase in the number of dual active sites that combine with Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment then stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which is responsible for the catalyst's optimal activity. The interplay between these treatments and the catalyst's properties enables the efficient transformation of alkanes into valuable aromatic compounds, making these catalysts essential components in the petrochemical industry for processes like propane aromatization.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support material is crucial for the success of surface organometallic chemistry in catalysis.

The mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst.

The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Mononuclear Ga-containing cations have been considered as potential active sites for alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Adding water to the feed strongly increases the activity, with the main product remaining propylene, though with increasing water content, slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are crucial in industrial applications due to their ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes, and the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Supported vanadium oxides are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and ability to form active sites facilitating the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for optimization of reaction conditions to maximize product selectivity and yield. The industrial importance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Continuous research aims to enhance catalyst performance through improved selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, contributing to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

The study focuses on the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and the deuteration process. It was found that the primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The selectivity of the activation indicates a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism. The model assumes no kinetic isotope effect during the ionization of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer. The selectivity observed may reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of specific compounds. The intensity of the C-H bond is measured as the integrated area of the specified spectral region.

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of alkane conversions, with factors such as selectivity towards desired products, stability under reaction conditions, and resistance to harsh operating environments contributing to their industrial significance. Supported vanadium oxides are highly active in oxidative dehydrogenation, while metal-exchanged zeolites enable controlled kinetics in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The efficiency of these catalysts is further influenced by the reaction conditions, which can affect the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance controls the rates of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins, and higher temperatures can enhance isomerization rates. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers. Their robustness against degradation under harsh conditions and potential for recycling adds to their industrial significance.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C.

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
          3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
          4. Since the preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without coke deposition doesn't fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that a coke-modified Mo2C surface could be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species. The terminal V=O bond does not critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude. The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude. The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The use of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments plays a critical role in modifying the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. H2 treatment enhances the dispersion of metals like gallium, leading to an increase in the number of dual active sites that combine with Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment then stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which is responsible for the catalyst's optimal activity. The interplay between these treatments and the catalyst's properties enables the efficient transformation of alkanes into valuable aromatic compounds, making these catalysts essential components in the petrochemical industry for processes like propane aromatization.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their high activity, selectivity, and stability under diverse conditions.

Understanding the reactions of organometallic complexes with the support material is crucial for the success of surface organometallic chemistry in catalysis. This knowledge enables the generation of well-defined surface species, which significantly influences the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

The mild, aqueous, aerobic, catalytic oxidation of methane to produce methanol and acetaldehyde involves the use of a supported bipyrimidinylplatinum polyoxometalate hybrid compound as the catalyst.

The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Mononuclear Ga-containing cations have been considered as potential active sites for alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Adding water to the feed strongly increases the activity, with the main product remaining propylene, though with increasing water content, slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion. The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group. The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are crucial in industrial applications due to their ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes, and the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Supported vanadium oxides are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and ability to form active sites facilitating the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for optimization of reaction conditions to maximize product selectivity and yield. The industrial importance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Continuous research aims to enhance catalyst performance through improved selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, contributing to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

The study focuses on the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and the deuteration process. It was found that the primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The selectivity of the activation indicates a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism. The model assumes no kinetic isotope effect during the ionization of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer. The selectivity observed may reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of specific compounds. The intensity of the C-H bond is measured as the integrated area of the specified spectral region.

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of alkane conversions, with factors such as selectivity towards desired products, stability under reaction conditions, and resistance to harsh operating environments contributing to their industrial significance. Supported vanadium oxides are highly active in oxidative dehydrogenation, while metal-exchanged zeolites enable controlled kinetics in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The efficiency of these catalysts is further influenced by the reaction conditions, which can affect the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance controls the rates of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins, and higher temperatures can enhance isomerization rates. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers. Their robustness against degradation under harsh conditions and potential for recycling adds to their industrial significance.

The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts faces challenges due to the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics, which can lead to coking. The work presented aimed to provide evidence that gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and demonstrate that while reduction of Ga& is necessary for dispersing gallium within the zeolite, the most active and selective catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. Differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced. The redox cycle of sample B was reproduced in the DSC analysis, showing the drying/reduction phase depicted in Fig. 6. Some of the excess heat during reoxidation came from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen, but it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this factor alone.

The study investigates the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. These pathways are thermodynamically and kinetically favored over activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Possible side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions, these sites do not account for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loadings, revealing three types of supported tungsten species. These species exhibit varying dispersion and influence the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production. The reaction results in the formation of HCOH, CO, CO2, and H2O. The mechanism for this process has been widely explored.

The experimental data shows that Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of preparation method, exhibit similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 causes strong perturbations in adsorbed molecules, evident through significant low-frequency shifts in corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is less than those strongly adsorbing N2. DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provides clearer interpretation of experimental IR data. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings. The mechanism is compatible with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests that vanadia sites on the bulk surface might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation than those supported as monomers on silica. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Challenges in achieving tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems highlight the complexity and ongoing research needed in this field. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations under controlled conditions, leading to enhanced yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes.
