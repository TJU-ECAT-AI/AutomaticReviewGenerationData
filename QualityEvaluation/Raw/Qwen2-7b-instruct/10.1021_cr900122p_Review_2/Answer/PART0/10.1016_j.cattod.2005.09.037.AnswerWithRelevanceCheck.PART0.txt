          [1] "The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties."
          [2] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules,which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."
          [3] "It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption."
          [4] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."
          [5] "It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide."
          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

          The experimental data shows that Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites, regardless of preparation method, exhibit similar adsorption properties. Adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 causes strong perturbations in adsorbed molecules, evident through significant low-frequency shifts in corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is less than those strongly adsorbing N2. DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provides clearer interpretation of experimental IR data. Ethane adsorption by Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in strong perturbations of adsorbed molecules, causing a large red-shift in CH stretching bands, an unprecedented observation. Such unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules stem from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

          上述讨论的实验数据表明，含Cu+的ZSM-5沸石，无论制备方法如何，表现出相似的吸附性质。CuZSM-5中部分Cu+离子吸附氢气时，会引发吸附分子的强烈扰动，这从相应HH拉伸频率的显著低频位移中可以看出。强烈吸附分子氢的Cu+离子数量少于强烈吸附氮分子的数量。对Cu+离子在ZSM-5沸石a位点吸附氢气的DFT模型有助于更准确地解释实验红外（IR）数据。改性后的ZSM-5沸石与Cu+离子结合，吸附乙烷导致吸附分子发生强烈的扰动，引起CH拉伸波段的显著红移，这是在任何其他类型的阳离子沸石或氧化物上观察到的乙烷吸附中从未出现过的现象。吸附乙烷分子的异常性质来源于与交换得到的一价铜离子形成的强s型吸附复合物。

          [p] "Despite numerous observations of H2 s-complexes [36,37], no similar series of the stable complexes with transition metals have been previously reported for light alkanes. All of the alkane complexes so far detected are unstable at room temperature and rather specific methods are required for their preparation and detection."  
          [p] "Indeed, the first examples of alkane coordination by transition metals were reported upon application of the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of the d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W) [38,39]. The coordination of alkanes to M(CO)5 fragment has also been observed by transient absorption technique in solution or in the gas phase in refs. [40 42]."  
          [p] "More recently, the coordination of methane by the naked transition metal atoms has been directly observed in the low-temperature matrices. Experiments on the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal complexes also revealed the formation of alkane complexes as reaction intermediates [37,43]."  
          [p] "The complexes with light alkanes have been also subjected to theoretical calculations in refs. [37,44], both as intermediates in CH activation, or as the independent entities. However, direct observation of these species has not been reported yet."

          Despite the numerous observations of hydrogen s-complexes, there have been no previously reported series of stable complexes with transition metals for light alkanes. All detected alkane complexes are unstable at room temperature and require specific methods for preparation and detection. The first examples of alkane coordination by transition metals were reported through the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W). Alkanes coordinating with M(CO)5 fragments have also been observed using transient absorption techniques in solution or gas phase studies. Direct observation of methane coordination by naked transition metal atoms has been made in low-temperature matrices. Experiments on the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal complexes have revealed alkane complexes as reaction intermediates. Theoretical calculations have been applied to light alkane complexes in references [37,44], serving as intermediates in CH activation or independent entities. However, direct observation of these species remains unreported.

          尽管观察到了氢的s复合物，但对于轻烷烃，此前没有报告过稳定过渡金属复合物的系列。所有检测到的烷烃复合物在室温下不稳定，需要特定的方法进行准备和检测。过渡金属与d6 M(CO)6羰基（M Cr, Mo, W）的光化学中的矩阵隔离技术的首次实例进行了烷烃协调的报道。在溶液或气体相研究中，通过瞬态吸收技术也观察到了烷烃与M(CO)5片段的协调。裸露的过渡金属原子直接观察到在低温矩阵中甲烷的协调。过渡金属配合物上的氧化插入和还原消除实验揭示了烷烃作为中间体形成的复合物。参考文献[37,44]中的理论计算应用于轻烷烃复合物，既作为CH活化过程中的中间体，又作为独立实体。然而，这些物种的直接观测仍未被报道。

          [p] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations stabilized in three different clusters (Fig. 1(ac)). Their geometry is similar to that one of a- sites in ZSM-5 zeolite, but the clusters differ in localization of aluminium atoms. The optimized CuO bond lengths obtained by these calculations are summarized in Table 2."  
          [p] "As one could expect, the copper cations are localized in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters more closely to Al atoms."  
          [p] "Therefore, despite of the effective coordination number of Cu+ by the zeolitic oxygen atoms equal to 3, the bond lengths with two oxygen atoms adjacent to the aluminium are somewhat shorter compared with the third CuO bond. In contrast, for the Cu+ZIII cluster the copper cation is very strongly shielded by the surrounding relatively closely located O4, O5 and O7 atoms."

          DFT modeling of hydrogen adsorption by Cu+ cations stabilized in three distinct clusters (Fig. 1(ac)) reveals that their geometries resemble those of the a-sites in ZSM-5 zeolite. However, the clusters vary in the localization of aluminum atoms. The optimized CuO bond lengths derived from these calculations are listed in Table 2. As expected, copper cations in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters are positioned closer to aluminum atoms. Consequently, despite the effective coordination number of Cu+ by zeolitic oxygen atoms being 3, the bond lengths involving two oxygen atoms adjacent to aluminum are slightly shorter compared to the third CuO bond. In contrast, the Cu+ZIII cluster has a copper cation that is strongly shielded by surrounding relatively close O4, O5, and O7 atoms.

          对于Cu+ cations稳定在三个不同簇中的氢吸附进行DFT模拟（图1(ac)），发现其几何形状类似于ZSM-5沸石中的a位点。然而，这些簇在铝原子的位置上有差异。这些计算得出的优化CuO键长总结在表2中。正如预期的那样，Cu+ZI和Cu+ZII簇中的铜离子更靠近铝原子。因此，尽管Cu+由择形氧原子的有效配位数为3，与铝相邻的两个氧原子之间的键长相比，第三CuO键较短。相比之下，Cu+ZIII簇中的铜离子受到周围相对接近的O4、O5和O7原子的强烈屏蔽。

          [p] "One can also emphasize that formation of the [Cu+(h2-H2)] adsorption complexes leads to the significant changes in the geometry of the adsorption sites. For both Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters the Cu+ ion partially leaves the initial cationic site upon hydrogen adsorption, while its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2. In contrast,adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ cation in the Cu+ZIII cluster that is strongly shielded with the surrounding lattice oxygens results neither in any significant perturbation of H2 molecule,nor in the change of the adsorption site geometry (Tables 2 and 3)."  
          [p] "In the similar way, according to the DFT modelling, H2 adsorption by the bivalent copper in Cu2+Z2 (Fig. 11) cluster also does not lead to any significant geometric changes in the adsorption site (Table 2)."

          It is noteworthy that the formation of [Cu+(h2-H2)] adsorption complexes leads to significant changes in the geometry of the adsorption sites. In the Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters, upon hydrogen adsorption, the Cu+ ion partially departs from the initial cationic site, reducing its coordination number to lattice oxygen atoms to 2. In contrast, hydrogen adsorption by the Cu+ cation in the Cu+ZIII cluster, which is strongly shielded by surrounding lattice oxygens, does not result in any significant perturbation of the H2 molecule nor a change in the adsorption site geometry (Tables 2 and 3). Similarly, according to the DFT modeling, hydrogen adsorption by the bivalent copper in the Cu2+Z2 cluster does not lead to any significant geometric changes in the adsorption site (Table 2).

          形成[Cu+(h2-H2)]吸附复合物会导致吸附位点几何结构发生显著变化。对于Cu+ZI和Cu+ZII簇，当氢吸附时，Cu+离子部分离开初始的离子位点，其与晶格氧原子的配位数减少至2。相反，Cu+簇中的Cu+离子吸附氢，该簇由周围晶格氧原子强烈屏蔽，氢吸附既不显著扰动H2分子，也不改变吸附位点的几何结构（表2和3）。类似地，根据DFT模拟，二价铜在Cu2+Z2簇中的氢吸附也不会导致吸附位点的显著几何变化（表2）。
