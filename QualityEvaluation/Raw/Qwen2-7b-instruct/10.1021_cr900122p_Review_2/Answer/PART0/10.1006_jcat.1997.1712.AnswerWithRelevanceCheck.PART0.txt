          [1] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C,rather than to metallic Mo."
          [2] "About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
          [3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene,indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
          [4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst,without coke deposition,does not completely eliminate the induction period,it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and,thus,that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

          1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, not metallic Mo.
          2. About 60 to 80% of Mo species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, while 20-30% of Mo remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+, not being reduced even under treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
          3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
          4. Since the preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without coke deposition doesn't fully eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, suggesting that a coke-modified Mo2C surface could be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

          1. 将2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂暴露于700°C的CH4或CH4/H2中会导致Mo离子还原为Mo2C，而非金属Mo。
          2. 在反应达到稳态后，约60%至80%的Mo物种以Mo2C的形式存在，而约20%至30%的Mo以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在，并且即使在700°C下处理CH4或CH4/H2数小时也不会被还原。
          3. Mo2C的形成与苯生成的初始激活期时间相匹配，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。
          4. 在催化剂上预先形成Mo2C而无焦炭沉积并未完全消除诱导期，因此认为Mo2C的清洁表面可能对更高碳氢化合物的形成过于活跃，暗示带焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面可能是形成乙烯作为反应中间体的真正活性物种。
