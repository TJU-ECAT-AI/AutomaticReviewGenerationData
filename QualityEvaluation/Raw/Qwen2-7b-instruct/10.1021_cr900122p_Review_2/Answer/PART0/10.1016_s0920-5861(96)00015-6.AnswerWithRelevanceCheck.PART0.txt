          [1] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane."
          [2] "Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."
          [3] "The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment."
          [4] "Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity."
          [5] "These physical and chemical transformations of gallium species are responsible for the activity-selectivity changes in the initial reaction-regeneration cycles of propane aromatisation at 823 K."
          [6] "The enhancement in catalytic performance is mostly due to Ga redispersion as evidenced by RBS data."
          [7] "As seen from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3, the improvement in activity is much more drastic for Z356 SL1 than for Z234 SL2 after the first H2-O2 treatment."
          [8] "The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity and average H/C ratio are consistent with the view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BriSnsted sites favour propane activation and aromatisation whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. Ga2O3, at the outer surface of the crystallites is mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) the need for carbon chain growth via acid-catalysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisation."
          [9] "Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The use of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments plays a critical role in modifying the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. H2 treatment enhances the dispersion of metals like gallium, leading to an increase in the number of dual active sites that combine with Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment then stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which is responsible for the catalyst's optimal activity. The interplay between these treatments and the catalyst's properties enables the efficient transformation of alkanes into valuable aromatic compounds, making these catalysts essential components in the petrochemical industry for processes like propane aromatization.

          金属基催化剂，特别是支持的钨氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有着显著的影响，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。氢(H2)和氧(O2)预处理在调整这些催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。H2处理可以增加金属（如镓）的分散度，产生更多的结合了沸石上的Brönsted酸位点的双功能活性位点，从而提高整体催化性能。随后的氧处理则稳定并锚定了这些高度分散的金属物种，并常常将它们氧化回+3价态，这是催化剂达到最佳活性的关键。这些处理方式与催化剂性质之间的相互作用，使得烷烃能够高效地转化为有价值的芳香化合物，使这些催化剂成为石油化工行业不可或缺的组成部分，特别是在丙烷芳香化等过程中的应用。

          [3] "The effect of H2-O 2 pretreatment on the catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used to aromatise propane affects dramatically the catalytic performance, the major effect being observed for the first H2-O 2 cycle."
          [4] "The first treatment in hydrogen increases activity and aromatics selectivity, and reduces methane formation."
          [5] "The subsequent first treatment in oxygen does not affect methane selectivity but boosts further activity and aromatics selectivity."
          [6] "The effect of hydrogen is clearly to increase the dispersion of the gallium modifier, thereby generating more dual active sites combining intimately gallium species [(Ga 3+, 0 2-) ion pairs) and Br/3nsted sites from the zeolite, enhancing overall catalytic performance, and dispersed gallium species acting as portholes to release dihydrogen, thus reducing methane production."
          [7] "The effect of oxygen may be to stabilise and anchor these highly dispersed gallium species, in addition to reoxidising them to the 3 + oxidation state which appears to be responsible for their optimum activity."
          [8] "Pretreating Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites firstly in hydrogen and secondly in oxygen at about 800- 850 K appears as a promising and convenient way to preactivate and stabilise them as catalysts prior to their use in aromatisation units."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, specifically in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The sequential application of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments has a profound impact on the catalytic performance of these catalysts, notably enhancing the conversion of propane and increasing the selectivity towards aromatic products. The first H2 treatment decreases the selectivity towards methane, while the first O2 treatment has no effect on methane selectivity but significantly boosts the aromatization selectivity. This sequential treatment with H2 and O2 affects the catalyst's performance dramatically, particularly during the first cycle of H2-O2 pretreatment. The hydrogen treatment increases the dispersion of the gallium modifier, creating more dual active sites that combine with BrSnsted sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed gallium species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which contributes to the catalyst's optimal activity. This two-step pretreatment method offers a promising and convenient approach to preactivate and stabilize metal-based catalysts prior to their use in alkane transformation processes, such as propane aromatization.

          金属基催化剂，尤其是涉及支持的钨氧化物和金属交换沸石的催化剂，在烷烃转化的机制和效率中发挥着至关重要的作用，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。氢(H2)和氧(O2)预处理的顺序应用对这些催化剂的催化性能产生了深远的影响，显著提高了丙烷的转化率和芳构化产物的选择性。首次H2处理降低了甲烷选择性，而首次O2处理不影响甲烷选择性，但显著提高了芳构化选择性。H2和O2的这种顺序处理对催化剂性能产生了显著影响，尤其是在第一轮H2-O2预处理周期中。氢处理增加了镓修饰剂的分散度，创建了更多结合了沸石中的BrSnsted位点的双功能活性位点，从而提高了整体催化性能。氧处理稳定并锚定了这些高度分散的镓物种，并常常将它们氧化回+3价态，这有助于催化剂达到最佳活性。这种两步预处理方法为预先激活和稳定金属基催化剂提供了有前景且便捷的方式，以便在烷烃转化过程中，如丙烷芳香化，使用这些催化剂。
