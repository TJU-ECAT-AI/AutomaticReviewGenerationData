The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.", "Chinese": "含有表面钒酸盐物种的氧化物支持的钒氧化物催化剂广泛应用于许多烃类氧化反应中。比较分子结构和活性信息提供了关于表面钒酸盐物种在烃类氧化反应中的催化性质的新基础见解：(1) 终端V=O、跨桥V-O-V和跨桥V-O-支持键的作用，(2) 所需的表面钒酸盐位点数量，(3) 金属氧化物添加剂的影响，(4) 表面酸性/碱性位点的影响，(5) 制备方法的影响和(6) 特定氧化物支持相的影响。许多研究者提出，终端V=O键在支持型钒酸盐催化剂上包含参与烃类氧化反应的关键氧。跨桥V-O-支持键似乎与所需的烃类氧化反应关键氧相关联，因为改变特定氧化物支持会显著影响TOF。所需表面钒酸盐位点的数量取决于特定的反应物分子。酸性和碱性添加剂也影响烃类氧化反应的选择性，但其影响似乎是反应特异性的，并且由于目前的数据有限，不能进行概括。", "Doi": "10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5"},
