Under certain conditions, the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deactivates, but it becomes more selective (as depicted in Figure 14b). It is beneficial to examine the variations in the catalyst surface across the catalytic bed. These findings imply that the enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly related to the more oxidizing atmosphere present. On balanced catalysts, this effect is less noticeable due to the reduced rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv. During the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene during but-l-ene oxidation, or butenes and butadiene during n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when there is a very small number of vanadium(V) species on the catalyst surface.

Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase. The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, specifically in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The sequential application of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments has a profound impact on the catalytic performance of these catalysts, notably enhancing the conversion of propane and increasing the selectivity towards aromatic products. The first H2 treatment decreases the selectivity towards methane, while the first O2 treatment has no effect on methane selectivity but significantly boosts the aromatization selectivity. This sequential treatment with H2 and O2 affects the catalyst's performance dramatically, particularly during the first cycle of H2-O2 pretreatment. The hydrogen treatment increases the dispersion of the gallium modifier, creating more dual active sites that combine with BrSnsted sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed gallium species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which contributes to the catalyst's optimal activity. This two-step pretreatment method offers a promising and convenient approach to preactivate and stabilize metal-based catalysts prior to their use in alkane transformation processes, such as propane aromatization.

The success of using metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, in alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, is largely attributed to the understanding of how organometallic complexes interact with the support material. For more detailed insights, refer to the review article by Copret, Basset, et al., starting from page 156.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions play crucial roles in determining the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include high selectivity, good stability, and efficient utilization of reactants under mild conditions.

Recent experimental studies and computational analyses have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The primary product remains propylene, but with an increase in water content, there is a slight increase in the formation of methane and ethylene. The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites starts with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+. StructureIV features a nearly square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively. To sustain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate, continuous water addition is necessary.

The study indicates that the (010) surface of V2O5 is not favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, attributing the observed catalytic activity of vanadia catalysts to the influence of a support material. The highest energy on the potential energy surface is 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, specifically when a water molecule is desorbed, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The barriers for the adsorption of propane and the elimination of propene are estimated at 4560 kcal/mol. Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might help reduce some of the barriers. The energy profiles for reactions at the VOV bridging oxygen site and the VO vanadyl site are comparable.

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The catalysts' activity and selectivity are influenced by factors such as the reaction conditions, which can control the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins. Higher temperatures can increase isomerization rates, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The catalyst lifetime is generally shorter for hydrogenation compared to isomerization of olefins. The ability of these catalysts to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers. Their robustness against degradation under harsh conditions and potential for recycling adds to their industrial significance.

Gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts feature a redox pair of Ga3+/Ga+. Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are created by reducing the gallium with hydrogen to disperse it, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase. A significantly reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- approximately 1) is less active and selective for aromatic formation. TGA reduction studies indicate that [Ga(OH),]+ is the ion involved in the ion-exchange process in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts from aqueous solutions, and these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen.

Formaldehyde selectivity is linked to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is affected by the metal loading. The nature of the supported species is also influenced by the metal loading.

Despite the numerous observations of hydrogen s-complexes, there have been no previously reported series of stable complexes with transition metals for light alkanes. All detected alkane complexes are unstable at room temperature and require specific methods for preparation and detection. The first examples of alkane coordination by transition metals were reported through the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W). Alkanes coordinating with M(CO)5 fragments have also been observed using transient absorption techniques in solution or gas phase studies. Direct observation of methane coordination by naked transition metal atoms has been made in low-temperature matrices. Experiments on the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal complexes have revealed alkane complexes as reaction intermediates. Theoretical calculations have been applied to light alkane complexes in references [37,44], serving as intermediates in CH activation or independent entities. However, direct observation of these species remains unreported.

Comparisons with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces highlight that vanadia sites might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation if they are part of the bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies might be lower for V2O5 crystallites on surfaces, as only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles. The oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, resulting in the formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here, unlike with VO2+, which exhibits a strong exothermic characteristic. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies for propene formation have been observed to be around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K.

The article reviews the main advancements in the field of alkane activation and functionalization using homogeneous transition metal catalysts, focusing on both organometallic and bioinorganic catalysis.

The quotes outline the expected growth in demand for a crucial chemical in various industries over the next five years, due to new applications of this highly functionalized molecule. They describe the transformation of orthophosphate phases (VOPO4) into (VO)2P207 through interaction with hydrocarbon mixtures, resulting in the formation of pairs of V06 octahedra by the loss of oxide anions. The quotes also state that two different methods for determining intermediates in n-butane oxidation reach the same conclusions: vanadium phosphorus oxides can dehydrogenate n-butane into olefins, which further react to form partial oxidation products. Additionally, the kinetics results of researchers Buchanan, Sundaresan, and Lerou are compatible with catalysts of this type, showing minimal dependence on changes in the hydrocarbon-to-oxygen ratio. Lastly, it is mentioned that an increase in oxygen concentration leads to an increase in the amount of Vv and the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

Lastly, it is mentioned that an increase in oxygen concentration leads to an increase in the amount of Vv and the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase. The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF. The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule. Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, specifically in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The sequential application of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) pretreatments has a profound impact on the catalytic performance of these catalysts, notably enhancing the conversion of propane and increasing the selectivity towards aromatic products. The first H2 treatment decreases the selectivity towards methane, while the first O2 treatment has no effect on methane selectivity but significantly boosts the aromatization selectivity. This sequential treatment with H2 and O2 affects the catalyst's performance dramatically, particularly during the first cycle of H2-O2 pretreatment. The hydrogen treatment increases the dispersion of the gallium modifier, creating more dual active sites that combine with BrSnsted sites from the zeolite, thereby improving overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed gallium species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which contributes to the catalyst's optimal activity. This two-step pretreatment method offers a promising and convenient approach to preactivate and stabilize metal-based catalysts prior to their use in alkane transformation processes, such as propane aromatization.

The success of using metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, in alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, is largely attributed to the understanding of how organometallic complexes interact with the support material. For more detailed insights, refer to the review article by Copret, Basset, et al., starting from page 156.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions play crucial roles in determining the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include high selectivity, good stability, and efficient utilization of reactants under mild conditions.

Recent experimental studies and computational analyses have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The primary product remains propylene, but with an increase in water content, there is a slight increase in the formation of methane and ethylene. The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites starts with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+. StructureIV features a nearly square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively. To sustain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate, continuous water addition is necessary.

The study indicates that the (010) surface of V2O5 is not favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, attributing the observed catalytic activity of vanadia catalysts to the influence of a support material. The highest energy on the potential energy surface is 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, specifically when a water molecule is desorbed, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The barriers for the adsorption of propane and the elimination of propene are estimated at 4560 kcal/mol. Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might help reduce some of the barriers. The energy profiles for reactions at the VOV bridging oxygen site and the VO vanadyl site are comparable.

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The catalysts' activity and selectivity are influenced by factors such as the reaction conditions, which can control the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins. Higher temperatures can increase isomerization rates, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The catalyst lifetime is generally shorter for hydrogenation compared to isomerization of olefins. The ability of these catalysts to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers. Their robustness against degradation under harsh conditions and potential for recycling adds to their industrial significance.

Gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts feature a redox pair of Ga3+/Ga+. Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are created by reducing the gallium with hydrogen to disperse it, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase. A significantly reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- approximately 1) is less active and selective for aromatic formation. TGA reduction studies indicate that [Ga(OH),]+ is the ion involved in the ion-exchange process in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts from aqueous solutions, and these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen.

Formaldehyde selectivity is linked to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is affected by the metal loading. The nature of the supported species is also influenced by the metal loading.

Despite the numerous observations of hydrogen s-complexes, there have been no previously reported series of stable complexes with transition metals for light alkanes. All detected alkane complexes are unstable at room temperature and require specific methods for preparation and detection. The first examples of alkane coordination by transition metals were reported through the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W). Alkanes coordinating with M(CO)5 fragments have also been observed using transient absorption techniques in solution or gas phase studies. Direct observation of methane coordination by naked transition metal atoms has been made in low-temperature matrices. Experiments on the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal complexes have revealed alkane complexes as reaction intermediates. Theoretical calculations have been applied to light alkane complexes in references [37,44], serving as intermediates in CH activation or independent entities. However, direct observation of these species remains unreported.

Comparisons with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces highlight that vanadia sites might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation if they are part of the bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies might be lower for V2O5 crystallites on surfaces, as only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles. The oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, resulting in the formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here, unlike with VO2+, which exhibits a strong exothermic characteristic. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies for propene formation have been observed to be around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K.
