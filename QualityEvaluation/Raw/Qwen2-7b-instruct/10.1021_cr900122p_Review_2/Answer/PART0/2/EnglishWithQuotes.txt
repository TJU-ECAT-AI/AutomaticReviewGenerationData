The primary product remains propylene, but with an increase in water content, there is a slight increase in the formation of methane and ethylene. The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites starts with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+. StructureIV features a nearly square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively. To sustain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate, continuous water addition is necessary.", "Doi": "10.1002/anie.200702463"},

The highest energy on the potential energy surface is 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, specifically when a water molecule is desorbed, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The barriers for the adsorption of propane and the elimination of propene are estimated at 4560 kcal/mol. Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might help reduce some of the barriers.

The catalysts' activity and selectivity are influenced by factors such as the reaction conditions, which can control the rates of isomerization and hydrogenation. Steric hindrance plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of isomerization, with different rates observed for various olefins. Higher temperatures can increase isomerization rates, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The catalyst lifetime is generally shorter for hydrogenation compared to isomerization of olefins. The ability of these catalysts to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products with high yields and selectivities is crucial for their industrial application, making them attractive for producing chemicals, fuels, and polymers.
