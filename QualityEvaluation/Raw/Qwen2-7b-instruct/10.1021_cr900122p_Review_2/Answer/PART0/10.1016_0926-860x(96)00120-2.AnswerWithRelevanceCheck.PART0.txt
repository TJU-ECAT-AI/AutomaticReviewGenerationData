          "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."
          "The half-life of this catalytic deuteration was approximately 3 min representing about 200 turnovers."
          "[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."
          "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ."
          "Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS."
          "In another study of the stoichiometric reaction of the hydride with propane,800 mg of (= SiO)3Zr-H (0.78 wt.-% Zr) was divided into three reactors."
          "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."
          "For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C."
          "Several assumptions have been made in the development of the model and the interpretation of the spectra."
          "The v(C-H) intensity shown is the integrated area of the region 3200-2800 cm- 1 of each spectrum shown in Fig. 2 (data for t > 30 min is not shown in Fig. 3 to 1000 8013
          "The v(C-H) intensity shown is the integrated area of the region 3200-2800 cm- 1 of each spectrum shown in Fig. 2 (data for t > 30 min is not shown in Fig. 3 to 1000 8013

          The study focuses on the catalytic activation of propane's carbon-hydrogen bonds and the deuteration process. It was found that the primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The selectivity of the activation indicates a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism. The model assumes no kinetic isotope effect during the ionization of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer. The selectivity observed may reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of specific compounds. The intensity of the C-H bond is measured as the integrated area of the specified spectral region.
