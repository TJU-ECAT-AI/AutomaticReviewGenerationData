[1] "On the basis of the IR-study of polymerization catalysts obtained by the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircop-ium with silica it has been concluded that when treating these catalysts with hydrogen, surface zirconium hydrides are formed. These hydride compounds are direct precursors of the propaga- tion centres for ethylene polymerization."
[2] "As is shown in ref. 1, Zr(C3Hs)4 interacts with surface hydroxyl groups following the scheme ( Si-OH),, + Zr(C3H-) - (- Si-O-),,Zr(C3Hsh_,,+ C3H s (1)"
[3] "When treating the "'initial" catalyst with hydrogen even at 25 C."
[4] "Keeping hydrogen-treated samples in an atmosphere of D2 (curve 3, Fig. l(a)) results in a sharp (3.5 - 4 fold) decrease in the intensity of the band at 1 625 cm i."
[5] "In this case, the catalysts having the maximum activity before their interaction with ethylene contain up to two Zr-H bonds per zirconium ion (e.g., run 4, Table 1 )."

1. Surface zirconium hydrides are formed when treating polymerization catalysts with hydrogen, acting as direct precursors for ethylene polymerization.
2. The interaction of Zr(C3Hs)4 with surface hydroxyl groups follows a specific chemical reaction scheme.
3. Hydrogen treatment of the catalyst occurs even at a low temperature of 25 C.
4. The intensity of the band at 1 625 cm i decreases significantly when hydrogen-treated samples are kept in an atmosphere of D2.
5. Catalysts with the highest activity prior to ethylene interaction typically have up to two Zr-H bonds per zirconium ion.
