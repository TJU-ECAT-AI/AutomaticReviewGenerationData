[2] "It is known [ 1, 2] that upon interaction of organometallic zirconium compounds with oxide carriers, highly-active catalysts for ethylene polymer- ization are formed_"

[3] "On the basis of the IR-study of polymerization catalysts obtained by the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircop-ium with silica it has been concluded that when treating these catalysts with hydrogen, surface zirconium hydrides are formed. These hydride compounds are direct precursors of the propaga- tion centres for ethylene polymerization."

[4] "By using a mass-spectrometric method for catalysts obtained by the interaction of Zr(C3Hs)4 with silica and treated with hydrogen, sur- face zirconium hydrides were found [6]."

[5] "The present paper describes the results of a study of the surface composi- tion of supported organozconium catalysts. These results, obtained mainly by IR-spectroscopy,confirm the data on the formation of zirconium hy- drides in these catalysts and their role as drect precursors of the propa- gation centres of ethylene polymerization."

1. The formation of zirconium hydrides in supported organo-zirconium catalysts is crucial for their role in ethylene polymerization. These hydrides act as direct precursors for the propagation centers involved in the polymerization process.

2. Upon interaction of organometallic zirconium compounds with oxide carriers, highly-active catalysts for ethylene polymerization are formed. This is a fundamental aspect of the mechanism behind catalyst synthesis for polymerization.

3. Surface zirconium hydrides are formed when these catalysts are treated with hydrogen, as deduced from infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies.

4. Mass-spectrometric methods confirm the presence of surface zirconium hydrides on catalysts obtained through the interaction of Zr(C3Hs)4 with silica, followed by hydrogen treatment.

5. The study of the surface composition of supported organo-zirconium catalysts, primarily through infrared spectroscopy, confirms the formation of zirconium hydrides within these catalysts and their direct role as precursors for ethylene polymerization propagation centers.
