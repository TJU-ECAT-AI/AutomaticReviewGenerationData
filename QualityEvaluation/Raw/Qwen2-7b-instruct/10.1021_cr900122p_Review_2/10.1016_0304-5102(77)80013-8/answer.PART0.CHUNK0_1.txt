[1] "Formation OF ZIRCONIUM HYDRIDES IN SUPPORTED ORGANOZIRCONIUM CATALYSTS AND THEIR ROLE IN ETHYLENE POLYMERIZATION"

[2] "On the basis of the IR-study of polymerization catalysts obtained by the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircopium with silica it has been concluded that when treating these catalysts with hydrogen, surface zirconium hydrides are formed."

[3] "These hydride compounds are direct precursors of the propaga- tion centres for ethylene polymerization."

[4] "As is shown in ref. 1, Zr(C3Hs)4 interacts with surface hydroxyl groups following the scheme ( Si-OH),, + Zr(C3H-) - (- Si-O-),,Zr(C3Hsh_,,+ C3H s (1)"

[5] "By using a mass-spectrometric method for catalysts obtained by the interaction of Zr(C3Hs)4 with silica and treated with hydrogen, sur- face zirconium hydrides were found [6]."

[6] "Prelimina_my data were also obtain- ed on the interaction of zirconium hydrides with ethylene and their participation in ethylene polymerization."

[7] "The present paper describes the results of a study of the surface composi- tion of supported organozconium catalysts. These results, obtained mainly by IR-spectroscopy,confirm the data on the formation of zirconium hy- drides in these catalysts and their role as drect precursors of the propa- gation centres of ethylene polymerization."

[8] "Data on the catalyst activity used for comparison with the results of the mass-spectrometric analysis were obtained at ethylene polymerization in hexane at 80 C and a constant pressure of 6 arm."

[9] "The IR-spectrurn of the "'initial" catalyst This is given in Fig. l(a) (curve 1) and in Fig. l(b) (curve 2)."

[10] "Results of isotopic exchange When studying the hydrogen-treated catalysts, experiments were carried out concerned with the isotopic exchange using deuterium (the content of the isotope D being about 907)."

[11] "Water adsorption The adsorption of DzO on hydrogen-treated samples (Fig. 2, curve 3) in a quantity less than stoichiometric (0.5 mole D20/mole Zr) results in a decrease of the intensity of the 1 625 enl"" x bands and in the range 2100 - 2 300 cm- 1."

[12] "Adsorp lion of dienes With the adsorption of allene and butadiene on hydrogen-treated samples (Fig. 3, curves 3, 4), a decrease in the intensity of the 1 625 cm bands and in the range of 2 100 - 2 300 cm z occurs."

[13] "The adsorption of ethylene on a hydrogen-treated catalyst (Fig. 4,curve 4) results in the almost complete disappearance of the 1 625 cm-1. band, some decrease in the intensities of the 2 490 and 2 260 cm- ' bands and the simultaneous formation of a polymer, being characterized by strong absorption due to vibrations in the C-H bonds of the methylene and methyl groups in the range 2 800 - 3 000 cm- I."

[14] "The results of a mass-spectrometlcic analysis of the quantity and isotopic composition of hydrogen evolved when treating catalyst samples differing in their composition and preparation conditions with D20 are given in Table 1."

[15] "The quantity of zirconium hydrides in the catalyst sharply increases when the catalyst is treated with hydrogen (Table 1, Runs 2, 4). The number of the Zr-H bonds in the catalyst decreases by nearly one half after treatment with ethylene under the polymcrization conditions (the absorption of ethylene is mole C2H4 400 (see Table 1))."

[16] "An adequate correlation between the content of the hydrides in the catalyst and its catalytic activity is found for the hydrogen-treated catalyst samples differing in zirconium content, structural features of the carrier,etc."

[17] "The band at 1 625 cm-  may be related to valent vibrations of the Zr-H-Zr bond in a bridge hydride, and the bands in the range 2 100 - 2 300 cm  to valent vibrations of the end Zr-H bonds which might be present in isolated hydride zirconium compounds."

[18] "The presence of the 1 580 cm-  absorption band in the spectra of the deuterium-treated catalyst supports the assumption made on the hydride nature of the bands in the range 2100 - 2 300 cm- 1."

[19] "The results obtained on incompIete isotopic exchange of the 1 625 cm  bands and those in the range 2 100 - 2 300 cm  may be ascribed to several reasons."

[20] "Exchange of hydrogen by deuterium in adsorbed organic compounds in the 2 800 - 3 000 cm- 1 region should result in the occurrence of new bands in the 2 050 - 2 200 cm 1 range; this will markedly hinder interpretation of the bands in the 2 100,2 300 cm  region which appear when treating the catalyst with hydrogen."

[21] "Thus, the data obtained on isotopic exchange, taking into consideration the above limitations, allow us to assume that absorption at 1 625 cm- 1 and in the range 2 100 - 2 300 cm- i is determined by the formation of zirconium hychide compounds."

[22] "It should be noted that for the band at 2 190 cm - ,almost complete disappearance of absorption is observed with excess of D20."

[23] "Similarly, for the 2 260 cm i band the deutero-hydrogen exchange is weak (Fig. l(a)}."

[24] "All these data enable us to assume that the absorption in the region 2 260 cm l is determined largely by the presence of the groups containing no hydride bonds."

[25] "Changes observed in the IR-spectra of hydrogen-treated catalysts with adsorption of allene and butadiene (a decrease in the band intensity at 1 625 cm I and in the region 2 100 - 2 300 cm - x and emergence of the bands characteristic of the allyl ligands (Fig. 3)) may be explained by alkylla- tion of zirconium hydrides followed by the formation of allyl and crotyl complexes according to reactions (3) and (4)"

[26] "The results obtained using an IR-spectroscopy technique when studying the interaction of the catalyst with ethylene, are in agreement with mass-spectrometric data, according to which the content of the hydride bonds decreases upon their interaction with ethylene (Table 1)."

[27] "In this case,the number of zirconium-hydride bonds being alkylated by ethylene should correspond to that of propagation centers."

[28] "Taking into account these Kp values, and the maximum rate of polymerization determin- ed for the catalyst given and being equal to g of poIymer 4 000 (Run 1, Fig. 5),g Zr h arm the maximum number of propagation centers can be calculated to reach 30 - 60% of the total metal content in the catalyst."

[29] "Good agreement observed between the number of Zr-H bonds in catalysts determined mass- spectrometrically,and the catalytic acti-ity (Fig. 5), is a reasonable factor in providing evidence in favour of the participation of zirconium hydrides in the formation of propagation centers."

[30] "First, as was shown earlier [4], at the active center the zirconium ions are bound with not less than two oxygen atoms of the carrier."

[31] "Second, the catalysts having the maximum activity before their interaction with ethylene contain up to two Zr-H bonds per zirconium ion (e.g., run 4, Table 1 )."

[32] "From this it may be concluded that an active component of the catalyst mostly contains Zr(IV) compounds of the composition"

The literature discusses the formation of zirconium hydrides in supported organo-zirconium catalysts and their role in ethylene polymerization. Zirconium hydrides are formed upon treating these catalysts with hydrogen, serving as direct precursors for the propagation centers in ethylene polymerization. The catalyst's activity is closely correlated with the content of zirconium hydrides, as observed through mass-spectrometric analysis. The presence of hydride bonds in the catalyst is decreased upon interaction with ethylene, suggesting these bonds are alkylated during the polymerization process. The number of alkylated hydride bonds correlates with the number of propagation centers, contributing to the catalyst's efficiency. The zirconium hydrides play a crucial role in the formation of active centers, facilitating the propagation of polymer chains during ethylene polymerization. The literature provides insights into the mechanisms of catalyst activity, highlighting the importance of zirconium hydrides in the polymerization process.

文献讨论了支持型有机锆催化剂中锆氢化物的形成及其在乙烯聚合中的作用。当将这些催化剂与氢气处理时，表面会形成锆氢化物，它们是乙烯聚合中引发中心的直接前体。催化剂的活性与其中的锆氢化物含量密切相关，这通过质谱分析观察到。与乙烯相互作用后，催化剂中氢化键的数量减少，表明这些键在聚合过程中被烷基化。氢化键的数量与引发中心的数量成正比，有助于催化剂的效率。锆氢化物在形成活性中心的过程中起着关键作用，促进乙烯聚合过程中的链增长。文献提供了催化剂活性机制的见解，强调了锆氢化物在聚合过程中的重要性。
