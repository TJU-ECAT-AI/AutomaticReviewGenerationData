The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving interactions with hydrogen, play a significant role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of polymerization catalysts, treating catalysts with hydrogen leads to the formation of surface zirconium hydrides, which are direct precursors for the propagation centers in ethylene polymerization. This process involves the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircop-ium with silica, where zirconium ions bind with not less than two oxygen ions from the carrier, forming active components that undergo further reactions to produce propagation centers. The efficiency of these transformations is closely tied to the catalytic activity of the metal-based catalysts, which is influenced by factors such as the type of metal, the carrier material, and the reaction conditions. The role of zirconium hydrides in this process highlights their importance in the formation of active centers that facilitate the propagation of polymer chains during ethylene polymerization. However, the interpretation of the absorption bands in the 2 100 - 2 300 cm - 1 range requires further detailed study due to its complexity. The maximum number of propagation centers in the catalyst can be estimated based on the number of zirconium-hydride bonds alkylated by ethylene, providing insight into the efficiency of the catalyst in promoting polymerization reactions.
