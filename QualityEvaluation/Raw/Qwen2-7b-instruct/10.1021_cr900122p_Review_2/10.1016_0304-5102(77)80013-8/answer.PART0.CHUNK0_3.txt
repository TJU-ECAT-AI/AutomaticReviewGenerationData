[1] "On the basis of the IR-study of polymerization catalysts obtained by the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircop-ium with silica it has been concluded that when treating these catalysts with hydrogen, surface zirconium hydrides are formed."
[2] "These hydride compounds are direct precursors of the propaga- tion centres for ethylene polymerization."
[3] "As is shown in ref. 1, Zr(C3Hs)4 interacts with surface hydroxyl groups following the scheme ( Si-OH),, + Zr(C3H-) - (- Si-O-),,Zr(C3Hsh_,,+ C3H s (1) where n = 1 - 3."
[4] "The formation of zirconium hydrides in supported organozconium catalysts is crucial for their role in ethylene polymerization."
[5] "The zirconium hydride compounds identified in these studies are assumed to contain bridge hydride ions."
[6] "Initiation of polymerization (formation of the propagation centers) may consist in alkylation of the hydride bond by olefin with the formation of an active zirconium-alkyl o-bond."
[7] "The number of zirconium-hydride bonds being alkylated by ethylene should correspond to that of propagation centers."
[8] "Taking into account these Kp values, and the maximum rate of polymerization determin- ed for the catalyst given and being equal to g of poIymer 4 000 (Run 1, Fig. 5),g Zr h arm the maximum number of propagation centers can be calculated to reach 30 - 60% of the total metal content in the catalyst."
[9] "Good agreement observed between the number of Zr-H bonds in catalysts determined mass- spectrometrically, and the catalytic acti-ity (Fig. 5), is a reasonable factor in providing evidence in favour of the participation of zirconium hydrides in the formation of propagation centers."

1. Surface zirconium hydrides are formed when polymerization catalysts obtained by the interaction of tetrakis--allylzircop-ium with silica are treated with hydrogen. These hydrides serve as direct precursors for ethylene polymerization propagation centers.
2. The formation of zirconium hydrides plays a critical role in the effectiveness of organozirconium catalysts for ethylene polymerization.
3. Zirconium hydride compounds in supported organozirconium catalysts are presumed to contain bridge hydride ions.
4. Polymerization initiation involves alkylation of the hydride bond by an olefin, forming an active zirconium-alkyl o-bond.
5. The number of zirconium-hydride bonds alkylated by ethylene corresponds to the number of propagation centers.
6. The calculated maximum number of propagation centers is around 30-60% of the total metal content in the catalyst.
7. There is a good correlation between the number of zirconium-hydride bonds determined by mass spectrometry and the catalyst's activity, supporting the involvement of zirconium hydrides in propagation center formation.
