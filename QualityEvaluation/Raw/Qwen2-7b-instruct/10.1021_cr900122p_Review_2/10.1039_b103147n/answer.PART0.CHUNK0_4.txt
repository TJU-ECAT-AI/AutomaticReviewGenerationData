The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, achieving a tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization remains a significant challenge. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to efficiently convert alkanes under various conditions and the potential for high selectivity in the desired products. Mechanistic understanding of these processes, however, continues to pose challenges, requiring further research to optimize catalyst performance and broaden their applications.
