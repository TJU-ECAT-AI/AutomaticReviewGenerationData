The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Challenges in achieving tunable, selective hydrocarbon functionalization and resolving mechanistic problems highlight the complexity and ongoing research needed in this field. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations under controlled conditions, leading to enhanced yield and selectivity in chemical synthesis and petrochemical processes.
