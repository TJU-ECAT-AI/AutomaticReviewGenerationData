[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxida- tive dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18)."

[4] "The structure and catalytic behavior of these materials depend strongly on VOx surface density."

1. The structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are influenced by the type of support used, specifically Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2. These effects are studied across a broad range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2).

2. The dispersion and structure of supported VOx species are determined by the chemical identity and surface area of the support. Different supports can lead to varying degrees of dispersion and localized structures.

3. At higher vanadium surface densities on ZrO2, polyvanadate species form, providing active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The structure and catalytic performance of the materials are significantly dependent on the vanadium oxide surface density.

5. Optimal oxidative dehydrogenation rates per vanadium atom are achieved on VOx domains of moderate size, balancing the activity of surface VOx species with their accessibility to reactants.

6. The type of VOx structures present at a specific surface density is influenced by the support interactions, but the turnover rates are independent of the support identity when structural variations are considered.

7. The relative rates of oxidative dehydrogenation leading to propene and secondary propene oxidation to COx are not affected by the support identity, VOx surface density, or structure.
