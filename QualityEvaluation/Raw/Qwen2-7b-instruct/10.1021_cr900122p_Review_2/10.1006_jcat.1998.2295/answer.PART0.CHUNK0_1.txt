The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The structure of these catalysts depends on the type of support used, with Al2O3, HfO2, and TiO2 supporting more effective dispersion of vanadium oxides compared to SiO2. The absorption edge energy of vanadium oxides decreases with increasing surface density, indicating larger domain sizes. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to selectively convert alkanes to alkenes with high efficiency, reduce side reactions, and maintain stability over multiple cycles. These catalysts offer improved selectivity and efficiency in alkane transformations, making them valuable in industrial applications.
