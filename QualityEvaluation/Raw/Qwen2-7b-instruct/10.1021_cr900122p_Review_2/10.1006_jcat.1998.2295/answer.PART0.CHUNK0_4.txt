The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways. The extent of dispersion and local structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. Basic metal oxides tend to yield more selective catalysts compared to acidic ones. For instance, polyvanadate species on ZrO2 at specific surface densities provide effective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation. Lower surface densities on supports like SiO2 lead to less selective catalysts due to competing oxidation pathways. The catalytic behavior is closely tied to the surface density of vanadium oxides. Kinetic analysis of reaction rates helps in understanding the pathways involved. Factors such as support type, surface area, and vanadium concentration significantly impact the catalyst's performance in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂，包括支持型五氧化二钒和沸石交换物，在烷烃转化机制和效率方面影响作用多种多样。催化剂的分散程度和局部结构起着关键作用。基本金属氧化物相比酸性物质更倾向于生成更选择性的催化剂。例如，特定表面密度下的ZrO2上的多聚钒酸盐提供有效的氧化脱氢反应位点。SiO2等支撑下较低的表面密度导致更不选择性的催化剂，因为存在竞争氧化途径导致生成CO和CO2等副产品。催化行为与钒氧化物表面密度密切相关。通过反应速率的动力学分析有助于理解涉及的途径。支持类型、表面积和钒浓度等因素显著影响催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的性能。
