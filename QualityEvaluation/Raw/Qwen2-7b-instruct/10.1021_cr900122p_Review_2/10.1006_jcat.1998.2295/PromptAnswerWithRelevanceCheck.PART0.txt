The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the extent of dispersion, local and extended structure of the supported metal oxides, the type of support material, and the surface density of the metal oxide species. For instance, polyvanadate species on ZrO2 at higher surface densities provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation, while lower surface densities can lead to competing oxidation pathways resulting in lower alkene selectivities. The structure and catalytic behavior of these materials are strongly dependent on the VOx surface density, and the identity of the support affects the dispersion and electronic properties of the metal oxide species. Understanding these relationships allows for the optimization of catalyst performance and selectivity in industrial applications.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The structure of these catalysts depends on the type of support used, with Al2O3, HfO2, and TiO2 supporting more effective dispersion of vanadium oxides compared to SiO2. The absorption edge energy of vanadium oxides decreases with increasing surface density, indicating larger domain sizes. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to selectively convert alkanes to alkenes with high efficiency, reduce side reactions, and maintain stability over multiple cycles. These catalysts offer improved selectivity and efficiency in alkane transformations, making them valuable in industrial applications.

This study investigates the effects of support composition, structure, and reaction conditions on the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It highlights the importance of supported vanadium oxides in catalyzing these reactions and discusses the limitations posed by unselective combustion pathways. The study employs various spectroscopic techniques to examine the structure and electronic properties of supported VOx species. It reveals that the extent of dispersion and local structure of these species depend significantly on the support's chemical identity and surface area. Polyvanadate species formed on specific supports like ZrO2 enable efficient oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Lower VOx surface densities result in reduced alkene selectivity due to competing oxidation pathways. The study also notes that the absorption edge energies of VOx species vary depending on the support identity, indicating differences in dispersion and electronic structure.

In summary, the research underscores the intricate relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions, which govern the efficiency and selectivity of alkane transformations. Factors such as support type, surface area, and VOx surface density play crucial roles in determining the performance of supported vanadium oxides in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

The industrial significance of these findings lies in their potential to optimize catalyst design and enhance the economic viability of alkane conversion technologies. By understanding how to tailor catalyst properties to specific reaction conditions, industries can develop more efficient and selective processes for producing valuable chemicals and fuels from hydrocarbons. This could lead to reduced energy consumption, lower costs, and minimized environmental impact, making the process more sustainable and economically competitive.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways. The extent of dispersion and local structure of the catalysts play crucial roles. Basic metal oxides tend to yield more selective catalysts compared to acidic ones. For instance, polyvanadate species on ZrO2 at specific surface densities provide effective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation. Lower surface densities on supports like SiO2 lead to less selective catalysts due to competing oxidation pathways. The catalytic behavior is closely tied to the surface density of vanadium oxides. Kinetic analysis of reaction rates helps in understanding the pathways involved. Factors such as support type, surface area, and vanadium concentration significantly impact the catalyst's performance in alkane transformations.
