[1] "The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxida- tive dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2)."
[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support."
[3] "Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."
[4] "Catalysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2 surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of competing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2 products."
[5] "The structure and catalytic behavior of these materials depend strongly on VOx surface density."
[6] "The identity of the support influences the apparent dispersion and absorption edge energy of VOx species."
[7] "At a given value of surface density, the identity of the support influences the apparent dispersion and absorption edge energy of VOx species."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the extent of dispersion, local and extended structure of the supported metal oxides, the type of support material, and the surface density of the metal oxide species. For instance, polyvanadate species on ZrO2 at higher surface densities provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation, while lower surface densities can lead to competing oxidation pathways resulting in lower alkene selectivities. The structure and catalytic behavior of these materials are strongly dependent on the VOx surface density, and the identity of the support affects the dispersion and electronic properties of the metal oxide species. Understanding these relationships allows for the optimization of catalyst performance and selectivity in industrial applications.

金属基催化剂，包括支持型钒氧化物和沸石交换材料，其组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。影响工业应用显著性的因素包括金属氧化物支持物的分散度、局部和扩展结构、支持材料类型以及金属氧化物种表面密度。例如，在ZrO2上较高表面密度下形成的聚钒酸盐物种提供氧化脱氢的有效和选择性位点，而较低表面密度可能导致竞争氧化途径导致较低的烯烃选择性。这些材料的结构和催化行为强烈依赖于VOx表面密度，而支持物的身份会影响金属氧化物种的分散性和电子性质。了解这些关系允许对催化剂性能和选择性的优化。
