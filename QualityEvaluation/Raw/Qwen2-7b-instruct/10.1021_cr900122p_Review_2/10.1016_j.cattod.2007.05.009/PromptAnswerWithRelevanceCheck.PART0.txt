<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The demand for olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, is anticipated to grow significantly in the upcoming years. Currently, olefins are primarily produced through steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation processes. However, the existing olefin production does not align with the projected market demand. The performance of catalysts, which includes their activity in alkane conversion and selectivity towards desired products, is crucial in determining the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

2. Studies focusing on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane have identified several key factors influencing the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts. These include the degree of aggregation of metal cations, their acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. Each of these factors can individually impact the catalyst's performance.

3. Research has led to the development of catalysts capable of oxidizing alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained from current technologies for olefin production. The use of specialized reactor configurations, such as membrane-type reactors, and unconventional methods for conducting reactions, such as cyclic feeding of reactants, can enhance performance relative to traditional setups.

4. The complexity in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst characteristics that determine performance in alkane ODH stems from the variability in experimental conditions and the lack of a collective interpretation that combines multiple aspects. Factors such as the reaction temperature, pressure, contact time, and the ratio of oxygen to alkane can dynamically modify the catalyst's surface and affect the reaction mechanism.

5. The use of less conventional oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), in alkane ODH has the potential to introduce unique reactive oxygen species or enable in situ control of the active phase properties, leading to significant advancements in the field.

6. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, the most investigated catalysts are based on vanadium oxide or molybdenum oxide. The reactivity of these systems is influenced by various factors, including the vanadium oxide loading, the size of vanadia domains, the surface density of active sites, and the support material. Catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures to avoid homogeneous reactions, tend to exhibit the highest selectivity towards alkene formation.

7. The charts in Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the performance of various catalysts in ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation, respectively. These charts highlight the catalyst types, operating temperatures, and weight-to-flow ratios at which the best olefin yields were achieved, along with the corresponding olefin productivity values.

8. The tables in Tables 1 and 2 compare the performance of different catalysts for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene and olefins, respectively. These tables provide details on the catalyst types, temperatures, and weight-to-flow ratios that yielded the highest olefin yields, as well as the olefin productivity values.

1. 在不久的将来，特别是乙烯和丙烯的需求预计将大幅增长。目前，主要通过蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢等过程生产烯烃。然而，当前的烯烃产量与市场对烯烃的预测需求不符。催化剂的有效性，即烷烃转化率和目标产物的选择性，最终决定了基于烷烃的化学过程的经济吸引力。

2. 对于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）研究，已经确定了一些影响金属氧化物基催化剂性能的关键因素。这些因素包括金属离子的聚集度、它们的酸碱特性、反应条件下的金属价态以及固体的集体电子性质。每个因素都可能单独影响催化剂的性能。

3. 研究已经导致开发出能够以与当前烯烃生产技术相似的产量氧化烷烃为烯烃的催化剂。使用特殊反应器配置，如膜型反应器，以及非传统的反应方法，如反应物循环添加，可以提高相对于传统配置的性能。

4. 在获取烷烃ODH催化剂性能方面的一致理解的复杂性来自于实验条件的变化和缺乏将多个方面结合在一起的综合解释。反应温度、压力、接触时间以及氧气与烷烃的比例等因素可以动态地修改催化剂表面并影响反应机制。

5. 使用不太常规的氧化剂，如二氧化氮（N2O）和二氧化碳（CO2），在烷烃ODH中引入独特的活性氧物种或实现活性相属性的原位控制，有可能带来该领域的重大突破。

6. 在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，最被研究的催化剂是基于钒氧化物或钼氧化物。这些系统的反应性受多种因素影响，包括钒氧化物负载、范德瓦斯域的尺寸、活性位点的表面密度和支持材料。主要由孤立的单钒酸盐物种组成的催化剂，在避免均相反应的高温下操作，通常能表现出最高的烯烃生成选择性。

[9] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[10] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [2225,28,46]."
[11] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[12] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[13] "An outstanding value of ethylene productivity, close to10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide [117]."
[14] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties [125,126]."
[15] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167,168,174,182,270,271]."

1. The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is anticipated to surge in the upcoming years, prompting extensive research to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is due to the potential advantages offered by oxidative dehydrogenation, which includes higher energy efficiency and simpler processes, despite the lack of cost incentive from lower feedstock expenses.

2. The effectiveness of the catalysts, specifically their capability to convert alkanes and selectivity towards desired products, is decisive in determining the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

3. The benefits provided by oxidative dehydrogenation are insufficient to persuade established industries to adopt new technologies unless there is a substantial improvement in yield compared to current practices.

4. Additional exothermal reactions result in greater energy losses and elevated fixed costs, particularly considering the production of carbon dioxide, the main by-product in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. A multitude of reviews on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s.

6. Key factors influencing the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts include their composition, structure, and reaction conditions.

7. Catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide show consistent reactivity patterns involving the dissociation of CH bonds and the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism.

8. The ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane diminishes with increased density of vanadium oxide on titania and zirconia supports.

9. Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide demonstrate both kinetically relevant steps for alkane oxidation and redox mechanisms involving lattice oxygen.

10. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction.

11. The support plays a crucial role in the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

12. In ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites in catalysts like VCoAPO-18 leads to high ethylene selectivity.

13. A VOx-MCM-48 catalyst with 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide exhibits exceptional ethylene productivity, around 10 kg of olefin per kg of catalyst per hour.

14. Alkali metals like cesium, potassium, and lithium affect the structure and properties of molybdenum oxide domains.

15. Most catalysts reported for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation yield ethylene below 20%, with notable exceptions based on nickel oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, and NiO-MgO).
