[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "The study of the dynamic changes introduced in the catalyst as a consequence of reaction conditions was made possible."
[5] "Nevertheless, sometimes the thorough characterization of the catalyst downloaded post-catalytic tests (the spent catalyst) and the comparison of ante-reaction features may be sufficient to understand whether significant changes in catalyst characteristics occurred during catalytic tests."
[6] "This review does not discuss the literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out with oxidants other than O2."
[7] "For reasons of brevity, this review does not discuss the literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out with oxidants other than O2."
[8] "Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture concerning those significant catalyst characteristics that determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the following reasons:"
[9] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[10] "This implies that while in the production of, say,acrylonitrile from propane  a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."
[11] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[12] "A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and ethane ODH."
[13] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[14] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[15] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[16] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [2225,28,46]."
[17] "For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports [26,7779]."
[18] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide [38,59,8492]."
[19] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[20] "An outstanding value of ethylene productivity, close to10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide [117]."
[21] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."
[22] "For reasons of brevity, this review does not discuss the literature published on the ODH of alkanes when carried out with oxidants other than O2."
[23] "Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture concerning those significant catalyst characteristics that determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the following reasons:"
[24] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[25] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:(a) The combination of exothermal alkane combustion with the endothermal dehydrogenation, at temperatures higher than 700 8C."
[26] "Brazdil [2]: The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."

1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, through various factors.
