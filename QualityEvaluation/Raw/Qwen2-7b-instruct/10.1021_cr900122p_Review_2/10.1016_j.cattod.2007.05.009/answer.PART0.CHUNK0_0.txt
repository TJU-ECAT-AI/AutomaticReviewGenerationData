[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "The study of the dynamic changes introduced in the catalyst as a consequence of reaction conditions was made possible."
[5] "Nevertheless, sometimes the thorough characterization of the catalyst downloaded post-catalytic tests (the spent catalyst) and the comparison of ante-reaction features may be sufficient to understand whether significant changes in catalyst characteristics occurred during catalytic tests."
[6] "In general, two different approaches for the ODH of light alkanes with O2 are used:"
[7] "A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and ethane ODH."
[8] "Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these systems are:"
[9] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[10] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[11] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[12] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[13] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[14] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems,including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."
