[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies,carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[5] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[6] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[7] "Some significant points concerning the reactivity of these systems are:"
[8] "In contrast with the above-mentioned findings, the results obtained by Lemonidou and co-workers [27] showed that in titania and zirconia-supported vanadium oxide, the ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane weakens when increasing VOx density."
[9] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[10] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+ [2225,28,46]."
[11] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[12] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[13] "An outstanding value of ethylene productivity, close to10 kg olefin per kg of catalyst per hour, has been reported for a VOx-MCM-48 catalyst containing 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide [117]."
[14] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties [125,126]."
[15] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%. Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO- Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO) [167,168,174,182,270,271]."

1. The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is anticipated to surge in the upcoming years, prompting extensive research to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This is due to the potential advantages offered by oxidative dehydrogenation, which includes higher energy efficiency and simpler processes, despite the lack of cost incentive from lower feedstock expenses.

2. The effectiveness of the catalysts, specifically their capability to convert alkanes and selectivity towards desired products, is decisive in determining the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

3. The benefits provided by oxidative dehydrogenation are insufficient to persuade established industries to adopt new technologies unless there is a substantial improvement in yield compared to current practices.

4. Additional exothermal reactions result in greater energy losses and elevated fixed costs, particularly considering the production of carbon dioxide, the main by-product in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. A multitude of reviews on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s.

6. Key factors influencing the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts include their composition, structure, and reaction conditions.

7. Catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide show consistent reactivity patterns involving the dissociation of CH bonds and the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism.

8. The ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane diminishes with increased density of vanadium oxide on titania and zirconia supports.

9. Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide demonstrate both kinetically relevant steps for alkane oxidation and redox mechanisms involving lattice oxygen.

10. The reduction of vanadium during steady-state oxidative dehydrogenation is significantly less than in stoichiometric reduction.

11. The support plays a crucial role in the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

12. In ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, the presence of both acid sites and redox sites in catalysts like VCoAPO-18 leads to high ethylene selectivity.

13. A VOx-MCM-48 catalyst with 2.8 wt.% vanadium oxide exhibits exceptional ethylene productivity, around 10 kg of olefin per kg of catalyst per hour.

14. Alkali metals like cesium, potassium, and lithium affect the structure and properties of molybdenum oxide domains.

15. Most catalysts reported for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation yield ethylene below 20%, with notable exceptions based on nickel oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, and NiO-MgO).
