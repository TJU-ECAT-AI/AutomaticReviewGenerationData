1. The demand for olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, is anticipated to grow significantly in the upcoming years. Currently, olefins are primarily produced through steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation processes. However, the existing olefin production does not align with the projected market demand. The performance of catalysts, which includes their activity in alkane conversion and selectivity towards desired products, is crucial in determining the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

2. Studies focusing on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane and propane have identified several key factors influencing the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts. These include the degree of aggregation of metal cations, their acid-base characteristics, the valence state of the metal under reaction conditions, and the collective electronic properties of the solid. Each of these factors can individually impact the catalyst's performance.

3. Research has led to the development of catalysts capable of oxidizing alkanes to olefins with yields comparable to those obtained from current technologies for olefin production. The use of specialized reactor configurations, such as membrane-type reactors, and unconventional methods for conducting reactions, such as cyclic feeding of reactants, can enhance performance relative to traditional setups.

4. The complexity in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst characteristics that determine performance in alkane ODH stems from the variability in experimental conditions and the lack of a collective interpretation that combines multiple aspects. Factors such as the reaction temperature, pressure, contact time, and the ratio of oxygen to alkane can dynamically modify the catalyst's surface and affect the reaction mechanism.

5. The use of less conventional oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), in alkane ODH has the potential to introduce unique reactive oxygen species or enable in situ control of the active phase properties, leading to significant advancements in the field.

6. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane, the most investigated catalysts are based on vanadium oxide or molybdenum oxide. The reactivity of these systems is influenced by various factors, including the vanadium oxide loading, the size of vanadia domains, the surface density of active sites, and the support material. Catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures to avoid homogeneous reactions, tend to exhibit the highest selectivity towards alkene formation.

7. The charts in Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the performance of various catalysts in ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation, respectively. These charts highlight the catalyst types, operating temperatures, and weight-to-flow ratios at which the best olefin yields were achieved, along with the corresponding olefin productivity values.

8. The tables in Tables 1 and 2 compare the performance of different catalysts for ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene and olefins, respectively. These tables provide details on the catalyst types, temperatures, and weight-to-flow ratios that yielded the highest olefin yields, as well as the olefin productivity values.
