[1] "In the case of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acid-base characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[2] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[3] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include the degree of metal ion aggregation, acid-base characteristics, metal cation valence state, and collective electronic properties of the solid. The redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen is consistent across various alkane reactions. Additionally, advanced combinatorial/parallel systems have contributed to the discovery of novel catalysts through genetic algorithms and evolutionary approaches.
