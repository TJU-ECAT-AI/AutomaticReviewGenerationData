<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include enhanced selectivity, improved conversion rates, and the ability to operate under milder conditions compared to traditional catalysts.
