The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts enhance the selectivity and yield of desired products, minimize side reactions, and are industrially significant due to their stability under reaction conditions, ease of regeneration, and ability to operate at moderate temperatures.
