The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are crucial due to several factors, including their ability to activate light alkanes through stabilization of zinc species in ZSM-5 zeolite, thereby facilitating the desired transformations. Their industrial significance stems from their effectiveness in these catalytic processes, enhancing the efficiency of alkane transformations and potentially reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.
