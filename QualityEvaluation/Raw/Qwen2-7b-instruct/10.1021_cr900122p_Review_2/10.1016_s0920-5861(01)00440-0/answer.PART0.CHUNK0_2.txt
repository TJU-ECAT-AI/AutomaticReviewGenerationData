</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The templating role of zeolite micropores enhances the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include improved activity, selectivity, and stability achieved through catalyst modification. Metal components like molybdenum and rhenium, along with the zeolite support, play crucial roles in the conversion of methane to benzene and naphthalene. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding carbonaceous deposits and the synergistic effect between metallic sites and zeolite supports. The active species and reaction mechanisms are further elucidated through techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and solid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies.
