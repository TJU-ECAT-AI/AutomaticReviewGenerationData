1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include enhanced activity and stability, improved selectivity, and the ability to suppress the formation of undesirable products like CO and CO2. The use of specific metal components, like molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), iron (Fe), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), and others, can enhance catalyst performance through synergistic effects with zeolite supports. The presence of multiple metal components can further improve catalytic properties, leading to increased efficiency in alkane transformations.

2. The study of catalyst modification in terms of zeolite micropores, along with the addition of second metal components, has led to significant improvements in catalyst activity and stability. Metal-exchanged zeolites, especially those with H-type silica-alumina structures like ZSM-5, ZSM-8, and ZSM-11, have shown promising results in methane aromatization. These modifications allow for better control over the reaction pathways, leading to higher yields of desirable products and reduced formation of unwanted byproducts. Techniques like thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are employed to characterize the catalysts and understand the underlying reaction mechanisms.
