1. The energy supply is transitioning from relying primarily on oil to becoming more gas-based due to declining crude oil reserves. This shift necessitates investigating the conversion of methane from natural gas resources.

2. Methane is the most stable and symmetric organic molecule, characterized by four CH bonds with a bond energy of 435 kJ/mol.

3. Multiple strategies are being developed for the catalytic conversion of methane into more valuable chemicals and fuels, as outlined by Lunsford.

4. The catalytic conversion of methane involves two categories: indirect and direct. Indirect processes involve producing synthesis gas through reforming reactions or partial oxidation, followed by Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Direct conversion routes aim to produce desired products like ethylene, methanol, formaldehyde, and aromatics directly.

5. The splitting of the CH bond occurs through interactions between methane and surface oxygen species, facilitating the conversion process.

6. Mitchell and Wanyhorne reported that methane could be activated over a multi-component catalyst containing metals M, MOn, and MO at 977 K, leading to the formation of benzene or carbon deposits.

7. Belgued et al. demonstrated that methane could be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over a supported platinum catalyst through a two-step process.

8. In 1993, Wang et al. successfully transformed methane into benzene using a flow mode reactor equipped with transition metal ion-supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative conditions.

9. The Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst is recognized as an effective catalyst for methane conversion, as reported by various research teams.

10. Lu et al. validated the internal standard analysis technique using material balance data from a bench-scale reactor.

11. Zhang et al. investigated methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on diverse zeolite types.

1. 随着原油储量的减少，能源供应正在从主要依赖石油转变为更多依赖天然气。这促使我们研究天然气资源中甲烷的转化。

2. 甲烷是稳定的、对称的有机分子，由四个CH键组成，其键能为435 kJ/mol。

3. 多种策略正在开发中，用于催化转化甲烷为更有价值的化学品和燃料，Lunsford对此进行了综述。

4. 甲烷的催化转化分为间接和直接两类。间接过程涉及通过重整反应或部分氧化产生合成气，随后进行Fischer-Tropsch化学反应。直接转化途径旨在直接生产如乙烯、甲醇、甲醛、芳香族化合物等所需的产物。

5. 甲烷裂解发生在甲烷与表面氧物种相互作用时，促进转换过程。

6. Mitchell和Wanyhorne报道，使用包含金属M、MOn和MO的多组分催化剂在977 K条件下激活甲烷，导致生成苯或碳沉积物。

7. Belgued等人证明了在支持有铂的催化剂上，通过两步法可以将甲烷转化为更高碳数的烃类。

8. 1993年，王等人成功使用流动模式反应器中的过渡金属离子支持的HZSM-5催化剂，在无氧化条件下将甲烷转化为苯。

9. Mo/HZSM-5催化剂被公认为有效的甲烷转化催化剂，这一结论得到了多个研究团队的认可。

10. Lu等人通过使用实验室规模反应器的数据验证了内标分析方法。

11. 张等人研究了Mo基催化剂在不同沸石类型上的甲烷芳构化。
