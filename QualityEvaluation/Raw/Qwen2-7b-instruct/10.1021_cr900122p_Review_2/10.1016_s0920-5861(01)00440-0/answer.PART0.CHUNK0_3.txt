[1] "Many processes related with methane conversion, whether direct or indirect route, require the use of oxygen, so the deep oxidation of methane is unavoidable."
[2] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [16-19], Wang et al. [20,21], and Liu et al. [22,23]."
[3] "The improvement in enhancing activity or stability has been obtained by addition with Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and Cu [22,28-31]."
[4] "Some of typical results are listed in Table 1. Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the catalyst's ability to promote desired reactions, such as the conversion of methane to benzene and naphthalene, while suppressing the formation of undesired products like CO and CO2. Metal loading, the type of metal used (e.g., Mo, Re), and the support material (e.g., zeolites like HZSM-5) play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance. Additionally, the addition of secondary metals like Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru, and Cu can enhance activity or stability. The study of these catalysts often involves understanding the formation of carbonaceous deposits and the characterization of active species, as well as exploring the synergetic effects between metal components and zeolite supports. The results of these investigations can lead to the development of catalysts capable of efficiently converting methane into valuable chemical products.
