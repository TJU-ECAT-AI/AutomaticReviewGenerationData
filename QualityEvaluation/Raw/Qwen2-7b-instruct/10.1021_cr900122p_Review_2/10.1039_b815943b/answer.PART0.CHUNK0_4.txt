[1] "Independent of the Al distribution in the mordenite framework, oligomerization of GaO+ species is strongly favored and leads to binuclear Ga2O2 2+ complexes."
[2] "The energetics of these steps for GaO+ site stabilized in the periodic mordenite model II are summarized in Table 3. The data cohere well with those previously computed for a ZSM-5 zeolite model."
[3] "Formation of less stable intermediate products in the catalytic cycle facilitates the regeneration of the active site. Indeed, moderate barriers are calculated for H2 recombination in the catalytic cycle involving [HGa(OH)(O)Ga]2+ species."
[4] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the reactive oxygenated extraframework species."

1. The oligomerization of GaO+ species leads to the formation of binuclear Ga2O2 2+ complexes, regardless of the aluminum distribution in the mordenite framework. 
2. The energetics of reactions involving GaO+ sites in mordenite align well with those in ZSM-5 zeolite models.
3. The formation of less stable intermediate products in the catalytic cycle enables the regeneration of the active site, with moderate barriers for hydrogen recombination in the cycle involving [HGa(OH)(O)Ga]2+ species.
4. Continuous addition of water is essential to keep a high concentration of reactive oxygenated extraframework species in the catalyst.

1. 铝分布不影响莫登石框架中GaO+物种的寡聚化，导致形成二核Ga2O2 2+复合物。
2. mordenite模型中的反应能量数据与ZSM-5沸石模型相一致。
3. 在催化循环中形成较不稳定的中间产物使活性位点再生成为可能，涉及[HGa(OH)(O)Ga]2+物种的氢重新组合具有适中的壁垒。
4. 持续添加水是保持催化剂中高浓度反应性氧掺杂额外框架物种的关键。
