[1] "The stability of isomeric binuclear Ga3+ oxygenated (Ga2O2 2+) extraframework species in various high-silica mordenite models is investigated using periodic DFT calculations. The isolated gallyl ions are unstable in such a zeolite and tend to oligomerize, resulting in oxygen-bridged Ga3+ pairs."
[2] "Independent of the framework aluminium distribution in the zeolite, cyclic Ga2O2 dimers are the most stable cations. The location and stability of such cationic clusters are mainly controlled by the favorable geometric environment of the Ga3+ ions, while the effect of the direct interaction with the framework anionic sites is less important."
[3] "Binuclear galliumoxo cationic species show significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage. Catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O2 proceeds via initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
[4] "The decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in the dimeric species facilitate H2 desorption. However, hydrogenation of the cluster in principle opens a pathway to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites."
[5] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the reactive oxygenated extraframework species."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the use of gallium in zeolites leads to the formation of binuclear Ga2O2 species, which exhibit high stability and reactivity due to their geometric arrangement and interaction with the zeolite framework. These species are capable of facilitating alkane dehydrogenation through heterolytic CH bond cleavage, olefin desorption, and hydrogen recombination. The basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable coordination of gallium ions contribute to the efficiency of the catalytic process. Moreover, the continuous addition of water is necessary to maintain a high concentration of reactive gallium species, enhancing the catalytic activity.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率有重要影响。具体来说，在沸石中使用镓导致形成二核Ga2O2物种，由于其几何排列和与沸石框架的相互作用，这些物种表现出高稳定性和反应性。这些物种能够通过异裂CH键断裂、烯烃脱附和氢化反应促进烷烃脱氢。额外框架氧的基本性和镓离子稳定的配位对催化过程的效率贡献巨大。此外，连续添加水是维持高度活性镓物种浓度的关键，从而增强催化活性。
