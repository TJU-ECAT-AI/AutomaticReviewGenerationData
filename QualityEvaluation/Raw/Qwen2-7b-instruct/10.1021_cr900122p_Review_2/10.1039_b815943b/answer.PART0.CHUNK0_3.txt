[1] "The stability of isomeric binuclear Ga3+ oxygenated (Ga2O2 2+) extraframework species in various high-silica mordenite models is investigated using periodic DFT calculations."
[2] "The isolated gallyl ions are unstable in such a zeolite and tend to oligomerize, resulting in oxygen-bridged Ga3+ pairs."
[3] "Independent of the framework aluminium distribution in the zeolite, cyclic Ga2O2 dimers are the most stable cations."
[4] "Binuclear galliumoxo cationic species show significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage."
[5] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O2 proceeds via initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
[6] "The last two steps may take place in a concerted manner."
[7] "The decreased basicity of the extraframework oxygen and the stable tetrahedral coordination of Ga3+ in the dimeric species facilitate H2 desorption."
[8] "However, hydrogenation of the cluster in principle opens a pathway to its decomposition via water desorption, resulting in less reactive reduced sites."
[9] "Such insight predicts that addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases the steady-state concentration of the binuclear galliumoxo and hydroxo species."
[10] "Catalytic experiments support well this proposal: a substantial increase in the dehydrogenation activity of Ga+/ZSM-5 zeolite is observed upon water co-feeding."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving gallium and zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The gallium species tend to oligomerize into stable binuclear Ga2O2 complexes, which exhibit enhanced reactivity for alkane dehydrogenation. This is due to the decreased basicity of the oxygen atoms and stable tetrahedral coordination of gallium ions in the complexes. Adding water to the feed can increase the concentration of reactive gallium species, thereby enhancing the dehydrogenation activity. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into more valuable products like olefins, contributing to the petrochemical industry.

金属基催化剂，特别是涉及镓和沸石的催化剂，通过影响其组成、结构和反应条件，对烷烃转化的机制和效率产生影响。镓物种倾向于聚合成稳定的双核Ga2O2复合物，这些复合物展现出对烷烃脱氢的增强活性。这是由于氧原子的基本性降低以及镓离子在复合物中的稳定四面体配位。向反应物中添加水可以增加活性镓物种的浓度，从而提高脱氢活性。这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够高效地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品如烯烃，对石油化学工业做出了贡献。
