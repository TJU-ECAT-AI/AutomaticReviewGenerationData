[1] "The stability of isomeric binuclear Ga3+ oxygenated (Ga2O2 2+) extraframework species in various high-silica mordenite models is investigated using periodic DFT calculations."
[2] "Independent of the framework aluminium distribution in the zeolite, cyclic Ga2O2 dimers are the most stable cations."
[3] "Binuclear galliumoxo cationic species show significant reactivity toward heterolytic CH cleavage."
[4] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over the Ga2O2 proceeds via initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acidbase pair formed by the Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."
[5] "Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the reactive oxygenated extraframework species."

1. The stability of various binuclear gallium (Ga) species in high-silica mordenite is studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
2. In high-silica mordenite, cyclic gallium oxide dimers (Ga2O2 2+) are the most stable cations regardless of the aluminum distribution.
3. Binuclear gallium oxo species exhibit significant reactivity towards the cleavage of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds.
4. Over gallium-containing mordenite, the dehydrogenation of ethane occurs through the initial heterolytic dissociation of the molecule, followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.
5. Continuous supply of water is essential to maintain a high concentration of reactive gallium oxo and hydroxo species in the catalyst.
