[25] "Independent of the aluminium distribution in the zeolite framework the stability of cyclic Ga2O2 2+ ions is much higher than that of the isolated GaO+ (gallyl) ions in a high-silica mordenite (Si/Al = 23) model. As to the location of such dimers,favorable tetrahedral coordination environment of Ga dominates over the necessity to compensate the positive extraframework charges directly with proximate negative framework charges. Charge alternation can occur in Ga2O2/MOR models in which positive charges of the cationic complex are separated from the framework anionic sites."

[26] "Independent of the framework aluminium distribution in the zeolite, cyclic Ga2O2 dimers are the most stable cations. The location and stability of such cationic clusters are mainly controlled by the favorable geometric environment of the Ga3+ ions, while the effect of the direct interaction with the framework anionic sites is less important."

[27] "The relative arrangement of the latter [AlO2] framework units corresponded to the above-discussed models II and III,respectively, for I + II and I + III."

[28] "Although the computational results presented so far have been obtained for a single zeolite topology, the results are also relevant for other high-silica zeolites with different topologies such as ZSM-5."

[29] "Formation of this favorable coordination via interaction with basic oxygen anions dominates over direct charge compensation and leads to clustering of the extraframework species."

[30] "The most stable structures in the higher-silica models are those involving a cyclic Ga2O2 dimer stabilized in the side-pocket of mordenite."

[31] "Summarizing, binuclear Ga2O2 cationic complexes should be predominant in oxidized gallium-containing mordenites."

[32] "Independent of the Al distribution in the mordenite frame- work, oligomerization of GaO+ species is strongly favored and leads to binuclear Ga2O2 2+ complexes."

[33] "Formation of two binuclear cations in I + II is only 30 kJ mol1 per Ga ion more favorable than the formation of a cubic cation."

[34] "We argue that formation of this favorable coordination via interaction with basic oxygen anions dominates over direct charge compensation and leads to clustering of the extraframework species."

[35] "In catalysis, the most stable sites often show significantly lower chemical reactivity than their less stable counterparts. To verify whether this could be the case for the Ga2O2 2+ ion,"

[36] "The energetics of these steps for GaO+ site stabilized in the periodic mordenite model II are summarized in Table 3."

[37] "Table 2 lists interatomic distances for the Ga4O4 core in the organometallic complex 3 and in the zeolite matrices."

[38] "For instance, it may be argued that it is relevant to the Fe/ZSM-5 system38 as the driving force to form multinuclear iron oxide complexes should be high and dominate over direct charge compensation to form FeO+ ions."

The literature discusses the impact of composition, structure, and reaction conditions on metal-based catalysts, focusing on supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites. These catalysts play crucial roles in alkane transformations through processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. The stability of binuclear gallium oxide complexes (Ga2O2 2+) is influenced by the zeolite framework's aluminum distribution. In high-silica zeolites, cyclic Ga2O2 dimers are the most stable species, favoring clustering of extraframework gallium species.

2. The stability of these complexes is primarily determined by the geometric arrangement of gallium ions, with direct charge compensation playing a lesser role. Charge alternation occurs when the aluminum ions are too far apart for effective direct compensation.

3. The formation of gallium clusters, especially in high-silica zeolites, provides a favorable path for the regeneration of active sites during alkane dehydrogenation, unlike isolated gallium sites.

4. The reactivity of binuclear gallium sites in catalysis is characterized by efficient heterolytic CH bond cleavage, facilitated by the stable tetrahedral coordination of gallium ions. This contrasts with the high basicity of isolated gallium sites, which hinders regeneration of the active site.

5. The addition of water to the reaction mixture increases the concentration of reactive gallium species, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of gallium-exchanged zeolites. This is attributed to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, which can regenerate the active site.

6. Theoretical studies predict that the presence of water promotes the regeneration of gallium species in zeolite catalysts, potentially improving their performance in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

In summary, the literature highlights how the precise tuning of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions enables efficient alkane transformations, making these catalysts highly valuable in industrial applications.

文献讨论了组成、结构和反应条件对基于金属的催化剂的影响，重点关注支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石。这些催化剂在烷烃转换过程中起着关键作用，涉及如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程。影响其工业重要性的主要因素包括：

1. 在高硅沸石中，二核镓氧化物复合物（Ga2O2 2+）的稳定性受到框架铝分布的影响。循环Ga2O2二聚体是稳定性最高的物种，有利于额外框架镓物种的聚集。

2. 这些复合物的稳定性主要由镓离子的几何排列决定，直接电荷补偿的作用较小。当铝离子距离过远无法有效进行直接补偿时，会出现电荷交替现象。

3. 高硅沸石中的镓簇形成，特别是对于高硅沸石，为烷烃脱氢反应中活性位点的再生提供了有利途径，而孤立的镓位点则不具备这一特性。

4. 在催化反应中，二核镓位点的反应性表现为高效地裂解CH键，得益于镓离子稳定的四面体排列。这与孤立的镓位点的高碱性导致难以再生活性位点形成鲜明对比。

5. 向反应混合物中添加水可以增加反应性镓物种的浓度，从而提高镓交换沸石催化剂的脱氢活性。这是由于形成了部分水化的镓物种，能够再生活性位点。

6. 理论研究表明，水的存在促进了镓物种在沸石催化剂中的再生，可能提高了烷烃脱氢反应的性能。

综上所述，文献强调了精确调整催化剂组成、结构和反应条件如何实现高效的烷烃转换，使这些催化剂在工业应用中具有极高的价值。
