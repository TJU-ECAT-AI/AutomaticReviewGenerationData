Facile C-H Activation by Lutetium-Methyl and Lutetium-Hydride Complexes Patricia L. Watson

Bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)lutetium complexes Lu(75-C5Me5)2R (R = Me, H) react at 20-50°C in hydrocarbon solvents with benzene, pyridine, the ylide CH2PPh3, and tetramethylsilane to give stable, isolatable products of C-H activation, i.e., metallation at a carbon of the reagent with extrusion of R-H.

The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) [VL"H(Nujol) 1345 cm−1] is readily formed by hydrogenolysis of (1) [reaction (i), Scheme 1; pentane solution, 20 °C, 1 atm H,].

As shown in reaction (ii), Scheme 1, exchange with D also occurs in pentane at 20 °C.

A more important non-degenerate intermolecular C-H activation between the hydride (2) and benzene occurs wherein hydrogen is liberated and the phenyl complex (3) is formed [360 MHz 'H n.m.r. of (3) (C,D,) 6 1.84 (s, 30 H, C5Me,), 6.84 (d, JHtl 6.45 Hz, 2H, o-Ph), 6.98 (t, JHH 7.6 Hz, IH, p-Ph), and 7.14 (app.t, J,,,, 7.3 Hz, 2H, rn-Ph); 13C n.m.r. C,DI2 6 10.73 (C5Me5), 118.81 (C,Me,), 125.01 (p-Ph) 126.94, 135.98 (o-Ph, 112-Ph), and 198.54 p.p.m. (phenyl C-Lu)].

Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and formation of (3) plus H is disfavoured thermodynamically.

Co-ordination of Lewis bases to the hydride (2) inevitably results in further activation of the ligand [reactions (v), (vi),and (vii), Schemes I and 21.

Complex (4) is the only doubly metallated isomer formed, presumably for steric reasons.

Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H or CH.

The structure of the product (6) (from X-ray crystallography) shows the o-metallated pyridine ring to lie in the plane between the two q5-C5Me,rings, with both C and N coordinated to the Lu atom.

Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH or H2 respectively at 20 °C in toluene or pentane to give the 5-membered metallacycle, (7).

Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 °C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield.

Intramolecular activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups exists in uranium chemistry.

Organo-lanthanide complexes containing the CH,SiMe3 ligand have been prepared by metathetical routes.

In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points.

Finally, the products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves and not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

I thank R. M. Swiatek for technical assistance and G. W. Parshall for his comments.

1. Lutetium-methyl and lutetium-hydride complexes can activate sp2 C-H bonds in both intra- and inter-molecular reactions, even activating the sp3 bonds of SiMe3. These reactions occur under mild conditions with hydrocarbons of very low acidity.

2. The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) is readily formed by hydrogenolysis of (1). It rapidly undergoes H/D exchange when dissolved in deuterated arenes at 20 °C.

3. Intramolecular activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups exists in uranium chemistry, but this was not covered in the provided text.

4. Organo-lanthanide complexes containing the CH,SiMe3 ligand have been prepared by metathetical routes, as mentioned in the text.

5. The reactions described demonstrate that C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable, show a remarkable level of reactivity.

6. The products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves, and they are not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

1. 镧系甲基和镧系氢化物复合物能够激活sp2 C-H键，无论是在分子内还是分子间反应中，甚至能够激活SiMe3的sp3键。这些反应在低酸性的烃类溶剂下以温和的条件进行。

2. 化合物2（即Lu(q5-C5Me5),H）通过氢解离可以轻易形成。当溶解在氘代芳烃中时，在20 °C条件下，它可以迅速与氘发生交换。

3. 在铀化学中存在对silyl-methyl C-H基团的分子内激活，但这在提供的文本中没有详细讨论。

4. 含有CH,SiMe3配体的有机镧系复合物可以通过过渡性途径制备，这一点在文中被提及。

5. 描述的反应表明，镧系烷基和镧系氢化物中的C-H激活现象是一般性的。这些烷基和氢化物稳定且可分离，表现出显著的反应活性。

6. 这些C-H激活反应的产物本身是有趣的复合物，并且它们通常不是通过其他途径容易制备的。
