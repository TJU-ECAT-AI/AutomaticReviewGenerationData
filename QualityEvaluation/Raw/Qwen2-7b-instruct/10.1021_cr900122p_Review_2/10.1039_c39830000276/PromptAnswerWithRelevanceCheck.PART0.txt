Facile C-H Activation by Lutetium-Methyl and Lutetium-Hydride Complexes Patricia L. Watson

Bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)lutetium complexes Lu(75-C5Me5)2R (R = Me, H) react at 20-50°C in hydrocarbon solvents with benzene, pyridine, the ylide CH2PPh3, and tetramethylsilane to give stable, isolatable products of C-H activation, i.e., metallation at a carbon of the reagent with extrusion of R-H.

The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) [VL"H(Nujol) 1345 cm−1] is readily formed by hydrogenolysis of (1) [reaction (i), Scheme 1; pentane solution, 20 °C, 1 atm H,].

As shown in reaction (ii), Scheme 1, exchange with D also occurs in pentane at 20 °C.

A more important non-degenerate intermolecular C-H activation between the hydride (2) and benzene occurs wherein hydrogen is liberated and the phenyl complex (3) is formed [360 MHz 'H n.m.r. of (3) (C,D,) 6 1.84 (s, 30 H, C5Me,), 6.84 (d, JHtl 6.45 Hz, 2H, o-Ph), 6.98 (t, JHH 7.6 Hz, IH, p-Ph), and 7.14 (app.t, J,,,, 7.3 Hz, 2H, rn-Ph); 13C n.m.r. C,DI2 6 10.73 (C5Me5), 118.81 (C,Me,), 125.01 (p-Ph) 126.94, 135.98 (o-Ph, 112-Ph), and 198.54 p.p.m. (phenyl C-Lu)].

Reaction (iii) is rapidly reversible and formation of (3) plus H is disfavoured thermodynamically.

Co-ordination of Lewis bases to the hydride (2) inevitably results in further activation of the ligand [reactions (v), (vi),and (vii), Schemes I and 21.

Complex (4) is the only doubly metallated isomer formed, presumably for steric reasons.

Co-ordination of pyridine to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (1)mpyridine or (2)vpyridine and is followed by metallation at the 2-position of pyridine with concomitant evolution of H or CH.

The structure of the product (6) (from X-ray crystallography) shows the o-metallated pyridine ring to lie in the plane between the two q5-C5Me,rings, with both C and N coordinated to the Lu atom.

Addition of CH2PPh3 to (1) or (2) gives initial adducts (l)CH,PPh, and (2)CH2PPh3 which then eliminate CH or H2 respectively at 20 °C in toluene or pentane to give the 5-membered metallacycle, (7).

Intermolecular reaction of tetramethylsilane with (1) [reaction (viii), Scheme 2; 40 °C in cyclohexane] again results in metallation and clean elimination of methane (I equiv.) to form complex (8) in high yield.

Intramolecular activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups exists in uranium chemistry.

Organo-lanthanide complexes containing the CH,SiMe3 ligand have been prepared by metathetical routes.

In conclusion, the reactions described demonstrate the following important points.

Finally, the products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves and not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

I thank R. M. Swiatek for technical assistance and G. W. Parshall for his comments.

1. Lutetium-methyl and lutetium-hydride complexes can activate sp2 C-H bonds in both intra- and inter-molecular reactions, even activating the sp3 bonds of SiMe3. These reactions occur under mild conditions with hydrocarbons of very low acidity.

2. The hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) is readily formed by hydrogenolysis of (1). It rapidly undergoes H/D exchange when dissolved in deuterated arenes at 20 °C.

3. Intramolecular activation of silyl-methyl C-H groups exists in uranium chemistry, but this was not covered in the provided text.

4. Organo-lanthanide complexes containing the CH,SiMe3 ligand have been prepared by metathetical routes, as mentioned in the text.

5. The reactions described demonstrate that C-H activation is a general phenomenon for both lanthanide alkyls and lanthanide hydrides. The alkyls and hydrides, while stable and isolatable, show a remarkable level of reactivity.

6. The products of these C-H activation reactions are interesting complexes themselves, and they are not necessarily easily prepared by other routes.

2. 化合物2（即Lu(q5-C5Me5),H）通过氢解离可以轻易形成。当溶解在氘代芳烃中时，在20 °C条件下，它可以迅速与氘发生交换。

3. 在铀化学中存在对silyl-methyl C-H基团的分子内激活，但这在提供的文本中没有详细讨论。

4. 含有CH,SiMe3配体的有机镧系复合物可以通过过渡性途径制备，这一点在文中被提及。

5. 描述的反应表明，镧系烷基和镧系氢化物中的C-H激活现象是一般性的。这些烷基和氢化物稳定且可分离，表现出显著的反应活性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as lutetium complexes in this case, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations through their ability to activate C-H bonds. These catalysts exhibit remarkable reactivity, selectively activating specific bonds within alkyl and hydride compounds to produce stable, isolatable products. The resulting complexes are often unique and may not be easily synthesized through alternative methods.

The document discusses the facile C-H activation by lutetium-methyl and lutetium-hydride complexes. These complexes react at temperatures ranging from 20-50°C in hydrocarbon solvents with various reagents such as benzene, pyridine, ylide CH2PPh3, and tetramethylsilane, resulting in stable, isolatable products of C-H activation. Specifically, the hydride Lu(q5-C5Me5),H (2) can form through hydrogenolysis of its precursor (1) and undergo rapid H/D exchange with deuterated arenes, forming the deuteride Lu(q5-CSMe5),D. An important non-degenerate intermolecular C-H activation between the hydride (2) and benzene occurs, liberating hydrogen and forming the phenyl complex (3).
