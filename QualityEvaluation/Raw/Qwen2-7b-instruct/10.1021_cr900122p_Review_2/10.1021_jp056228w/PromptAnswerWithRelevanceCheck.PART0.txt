How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

<p>Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. These units are assumed to contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (S = Al, Si, Ti, etc.). If the catalyst is prepared with a higher concentration of vanadium oxide, larger V2O7 units are formed. These species appear to have two vertical VO bonds, four bridging VOS linkages, and a new bridging VOV linkage.</p>
<p>Although this mechanism is consistent with most experimental studies, important questions remain to be answered. First, which oxygen atom is removed from the catalyst surface? Does it come from the vertical VO vanadyl bond, as suggested by Oyama, (8) or from one of the bridging linkages (VOS or VOV), as described by Eon et al. (9) and Chen et al.? (10)</p>
<p>Second, what is the rate-limiting step for the ODH reaction?</p>
<p>Third, how does propane interact with the catalyst oxygen atom to form propene and water?</p>
<p>Fourth, how does the support enhance the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide?</p>
<p>There have been a number of computational studies of the electronic structure and bonding properties of clean vanadium oxide surfaces and supported vanadium oxide clusters, (1220) and several computational studies have been reported on propane ODH on metal oxide surfaces with one of these on vanadium oxide.</p>
<p>The related partial oxidation reaction of methanol to formaldehyde has also been studied recently using computational methods. Khaliullin et al. (25) carried out a comparative study of the reaction energetics for a VO4 active site supported on cluster models of the SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 surfaces. They found activation energies that were significantly higher than those found experimentally, and also found little dependence of activation energy on the support material, which is also contrary to experiment.</p>
<p>In the work reported here, we have carried out the first detailed theoretical study of the complete reaction pathway for propane ODH on a vanadium oxide surface following the steps of a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. We considered two possible sites for CH activation of propane based on reactions at both the vanadyl and bridging oxygen sites followed by hydrogen rearrangement on the surface that leads to the formation of propene and the desorption of water. The addition of oxygen to restore the metal oxide surface was also investigated.</p>
<p>The calculations use the hybrid B3LYP density functional method and clusters with up to 10 vanadium atoms. In addition, periodic calculations of some of the points on the reaction surface were used to test the validity of the cluster model results. Our calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products, the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes. Supported vanadium oxides are known to be effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and the ability to form active sites that facilitate the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites, on the other hand, offer the advantage of customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for fine-tuning of the reaction conditions to optimize product selectivity and yield. The industrial significance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Additionally, ongoing research aims to improve catalyst performance through enhanced selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, which collectively contribute to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, such as oxidative dehydrogenation. This study utilized a hybrid density functional approach to analyze the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for propane ODH on the (010) surface of V2O5. The reaction involves stepwise adsorption of propane at an oxygen site, followed by desorption of water and propene. The potential energy surface features substantial barriers, estimated at around 80 kcal/mol above the reactants' energy, which corresponds to the formation of an oxygen vacancy post-water elimination. Propane adsorption and propene elimination barriers are quantified at 4560 kcal/mol. Lowering these barriers might involve interactions with a support material or a concerted reaction with O2. The findings shed light on the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and lay the groundwork for future computational studies. This research indicates that the (010) surface of V2O5 is not optimal for propane ODH, suggesting that other factors, including support material influence, contribute to the observed catalytic activity.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持型钒氧化物，对烷烃转化过程的机制和效率产生影响。这项研究采用混合密度泛函方法分析了Mars-van Krevelen机制在V2O5的(010)表面进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。反应步骤涉及丙烷在氧位的分步吸附，随后水分子和丙烯的释放。潜在能量表面包含显著的壁垒，约为反应物能量之上约80千卡/摩尔，对应于水消除后形成氧空位的情况。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒被估计为4560千卡/摩尔。降低这些壁垒可能需要与支撑材料的相互作用或与O2的协同反应。研究结果揭示了支持型钒氧化物催化剂的活性，并为未来计算研究提供了基础。此研究指出，V2O5的(010)表面对于丙烷氧化脱氢并不理想，这表明其他因素，包括支撑材料的影响，是实验观察到的催化活性的关键。

[1] "Several recent experimental results have contrasted the catalytic properties of pure V2O5 and supported vanadia catalysts for methanol oxidation and ODH of propane."
[2] "This is reflected in a surface density of active sites for supported vanadia catalysts (i.e., V2O5/TiO2) that is twenty times larger than for bulk V2O5."
[3] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."
[4] "We found in the case of the triplet state that the vanadyl oxygens that point down (under the surface) will bend to fill the vacancy being created by the oxygen leaving the surface."
[5] "Thus, assuming that the approximations used in our computations are valid, these results suggest that propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide species differs from that on a clean (010) V2O5 surface."
[6] "Analogous to the stabilization of the triplet state relative to the singlet state when the vanadium oxide surface is reduced by adsorbates (e.g., propanol, propoxide, and OH in Tables 2 and 4), the triplet state of a vanadium oxide cluster may be stabilized relative to the singlet (though not necessarily lower in energy) if anchored such that it is in a reduced state on a support."

1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, supported vanadia catalysts have a higher surface density of active sites, enhancing their catalytic properties compared to pure V2O5. 

2. In contrast, the barriers for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts are experimentally found to be much lower, typically ranging from 20 to 30 kcal/mol, compared to the calculated barriers of about 80 kcal/mol for water elimination in this study.

3. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, can also affect the efficiency of these reactions. Higher temperatures might increase the rate of reactions, but could also lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts. Similarly, the presence of specific support materials can influence the catalytic activity by stabilizing the desired reaction states, as discussed in relation to the stabilization of the triplet state on supported catalysts.

4. The structure of the catalyst, including the arrangement of metal sites and support interactions, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. For example, the reaction pathways on supported vanadium oxide catalysts differ from those on pure metal surfaces due to the influence of the support, which can lower the barriers for key reaction steps.

5. The active sites on supported catalysts are influenced by the adsorption of molecules like propanol, propoxide, and OH, which can stabilize certain reaction states and pathways. This stabilization can lead to a lower overall barrier for the reactions, enhancing their efficiency.

6. The stabilization of the triplet state on supported vanadium oxide clusters, akin to the stabilization observed on surfaces, suggests that anchoring the cluster on a support might reduce the barriers for certain reactions by maintaining the reduced state of the catalyst. This could potentially lead to more efficient alkane transformations, particularly in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 金属基催化剂，如支持的钒氧化物和沸石交换材料，其组成、结构和反应条件可以显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。例如，支持的vanadia催化剂的活性位点密度比纯V2O5高20倍，从而提高了其催化性能。

2. 反应条件，如温度和压力，也会影响这些反应的效率。提高温度可能增加反应速率，但也可能导致形成不希望的副产品。同样，特定支撑材料的存在可以通过稳定所需反应状态来影响催化活性，正如关于在支持催化剂上稳定三重态状态所讨论的那样。

3. 催化剂的结构，包括金属位点的排列和支持相互作用，对确定催化活性起着关键作用。例如，支持的vanadium氧化物催化剂上的反应途径与纯金属表面上的不同，这归因于支持材料的影响，它可以降低关键反应步骤的壁垒。

4. 支持催化剂上的活性位点受吸附分子（如丙醇、丙氧基和OH）的影响，这些分子可以稳定特定的反应状态和路径。这种稳定可能导致某些反应的总体壁垒降低，从而提高其效率。

5. 支持的vanadium氧化物簇上的三重态状态的稳定，类似于在表面上观察到的稳定现象，表明将簇锚定在支撑上可能会通过保持催化剂的还原状态来减少某些反应的壁垒。这可能导致更高效的烷烃转化，特别是在氧化脱氢等过程中。

Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might reduce some of the barriers. The reaction at a VOV bridging oxygen site is energetically similar to that at a VO vanadyl site, indicating that both sites play comparable roles in the reaction mechanism.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持型五氧化二钒和沸石交换材料，通过影响反应机理和效率，对烷烃转化过程如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应产生影响。在V2O5(010)表面进行的丙烷氧化脱氢反应路径上的势能表面发现存在较大的壁垒，约为4580 kcal/mol高于反应物的能量。这些壁垒远高于实验上观测到的在支持型五氧化二钒催化剂上进行的丙烷氧化脱氢反应的值。研究表明，五氧化二钒与支撑材料的相互作用可能降低初始脱附吸附丙烷和丙烯消除步骤的壁垒。然而，初始脱附吸附和丙烯消除步骤的壁垒仍然远高于实验测量值。反应路径上的最高能量对应于水分子脱附时表面形成氧空位的情况。考虑更复杂的反应，例如在水消除过程中吸附O2的协同反应，可能降低某些壁垒。在VOV桥接氧原子位点上的反应与在VO范德华位点上的反应具有相似的能量，表明两个位点在反应机制中扮演着同等的角色。
