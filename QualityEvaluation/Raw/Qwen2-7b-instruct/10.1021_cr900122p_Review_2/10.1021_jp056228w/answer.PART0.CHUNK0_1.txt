The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, such as oxidative dehydrogenation. This study utilized a hybrid density functional approach to analyze the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for propane ODH on the (010) surface of V2O5. The reaction involves stepwise adsorption of propane at an oxygen site, followed by desorption of water and propene. The potential energy surface features substantial barriers, estimated at around 80 kcal/mol above the reactants' energy, which corresponds to the formation of an oxygen vacancy post-water elimination. Propane adsorption and propene elimination barriers are quantified at 4560 kcal/mol. Lowering these barriers might involve interactions with a support material or a concerted reaction with O2. The findings shed light on the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and lay the groundwork for future computational studies. This research indicates that the (010) surface of V2O5 is not optimal for propane ODH, suggesting that other factors, including support material influence, contribute to the observed catalytic activity.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持型钒氧化物，对烷烃转化过程的机制和效率产生影响。这项研究采用混合密度泛函方法分析了Mars-van Krevelen机制在V2O5的(010)表面进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。反应步骤涉及丙烷在氧位的分步吸附，随后水分子和丙烯的释放。潜在能量表面包含显著的壁垒，约为反应物能量之上约80千卡/摩尔，对应于水消除后形成氧空位的情况。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒被估计为4560千卡/摩尔。降低这些壁垒可能需要与支撑材料的相互作用或与O2的协同反应。研究结果揭示了支持型钒氧化物催化剂的活性，并为未来计算研究提供了基础。此研究指出，V2O5的(010)表面对于丙烷氧化脱氢并不理想，这表明其他因素，包括支撑材料的影响，是实验观察到的催化活性的关键。
