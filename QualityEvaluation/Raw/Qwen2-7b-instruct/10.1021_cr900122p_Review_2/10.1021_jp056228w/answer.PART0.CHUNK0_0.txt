<p>Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. These units are assumed to contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (S = Al, Si, Ti, etc.). If the catalyst is prepared with a higher concentration of vanadium oxide, larger V2O7 units are formed. These species appear to have two vertical VO bonds, four bridging VOS linkages, and a new bridging VOV linkage.</p>
<p>Although this mechanism is consistent with most experimental studies, important questions remain to be answered. First, which oxygen atom is removed from the catalyst surface? Does it come from the vertical VO vanadyl bond, as suggested by Oyama, (8) or from one of the bridging linkages (VOS or VOV), as described by Eon et al. (9) and Chen et al.? (10)</p>
<p>Second, what is the rate-limiting step for the ODH reaction?</p>
<p>Third, how does propane interact with the catalyst oxygen atom to form propene and water?</p>
<p>Fourth, how does the support enhance the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide?</p>
<p>There have been a number of computational studies of the electronic structure and bonding properties of clean vanadium oxide surfaces and supported vanadium oxide clusters, (1220) and several computational studies have been reported on propane ODH on metal oxide surfaces with one of these on vanadium oxide.</p>
<p>The related partial oxidation reaction of methanol to formaldehyde has also been studied recently using computational methods. Khaliullin et al. (25) carried out a comparative study of the reaction energetics for a VO4 active site supported on cluster models of the SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 surfaces. They found activation energies that were significantly higher than those found experimentally, and also found little dependence of activation energy on the support material, which is also contrary to experiment.</p>
<p>In the work reported here, we have carried out the first detailed theoretical study of the complete reaction pathway for propane ODH on a vanadium oxide surface following the steps of a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. We considered two possible sites for CH activation of propane based on reactions at both the vanadyl and bridging oxygen sites followed by hydrogen rearrangement on the surface that leads to the formation of propene and the desorption of water. The addition of oxygen to restore the metal oxide surface was also investigated.</p>
<p>The calculations use the hybrid B3LYP density functional method and clusters with up to 10 vanadium atoms. In addition, periodic calculations of some of the points on the reaction surface were used to test the validity of the cluster model results. Our calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia. The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products, the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes. Supported vanadium oxides are known to be effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and the ability to form active sites that facilitate the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites, on the other hand, offer the advantage of customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for fine-tuning of the reaction conditions to optimize product selectivity and yield. The industrial significance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Additionally, ongoing research aims to improve catalyst performance through enhanced selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, which collectively contribute to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.
