          "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis."
          "We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5."
          "The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab."
          "We have investigated a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism that involves stepwise adsorption of the propane at an oxygen site followed by desorption of a water molecule and propene."
          "The highest energy on the potential energy surface at the B3LYP/6-31G(*) level of theory is about 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants and corresponds to formation of an oxygen vacancy after water elimination."
          "The barriers for propane adsorption and propene elimination are 4560 kcal/mol."
          "Factors that may lower the barriers on the potential energy surface, including the interaction of vanadium oxide clusters with a support material and a concerted reaction with O2, are discussed."
          "The results of this study provide insight into questions concerning the activity of supported vanadia catalysts and provide the basis for future computational investigations of these materials."
          "Our calculations suggest that the (010) surface of V2O5 is unfavorable for propane ODH and that other factors, such as the influence of a support material, are responsible for the experimentally observed catalytic activity of vanadia."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are crucial in industrial applications due to their ability to selectively convert alkanes into higher-value products. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the stability and longevity of the catalyst under reaction conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the catalyst preparation and regeneration processes, and the selectivity and yield of the desired products. Supported vanadium oxides are effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation due to their high surface area and ability to form active sites facilitating the desired chemical transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer customizable acidity and basicity profiles, allowing for optimization of reaction conditions to maximize product selectivity and yield. The industrial importance of these catalysts is underscored by their widespread use in petrochemical industries for processes such as the production of aromatics, olefins, and gasoline additives. Continuous research aims to enhance catalyst performance through improved selectivity, increased stability, and reduced energy consumption, contributing to their economic viability and environmental impact mitigation in industrial applications.

          The study indicates that the (010) surface of V2O5 is not favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, attributing the observed catalytic activity of vanadia catalysts to the influence of a support material. The highest energy on the potential energy surface is 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, specifically when a water molecule is desorbed, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The barriers for the adsorption of propane and the elimination of propene are estimated at 4560 kcal/mol. Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might help reduce some of the barriers. The energy profiles for reactions at the VOV bridging oxygen site and the VO vanadyl site are comparable.

          研究表明，V2O5 的(010)表面对于丙烷氧化脱氢不理想，实验观察到的范德亚催化剂活性归因于支撑材料的影响。最高能量在潜在能量表面上方为80 kcal/mol，具体在水分子脱除后，形成氧空位。丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒估计为4560 kcal/mol。考虑更复杂的反应，如在水消除过程中吸附O2的协同反应，可能有助于降低某些壁垒。VOV桥接氧原子位点和VO钒原子位点上的能量剖面相似。
