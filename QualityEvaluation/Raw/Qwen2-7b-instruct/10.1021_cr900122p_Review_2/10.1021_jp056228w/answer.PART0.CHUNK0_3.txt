[1] "The potential energy surface is found to have large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered."
[2] "The barriers on the reaction pathway are 4580 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia."
[3] "Some of the barriers may be reduced by consideration of more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving adsorption of O2 during water elimination."
[4] "The highest energy on the reaction pathway of 80 kcal/mol corresponds to an oxygen vacancy at the O(3) site on the V2O5 surface, which forms when a water molecule is desorbed."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The barriers on the reaction pathway for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5 are found to be large, around 4580 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants. These barriers are significantly higher than those observed experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia catalysts. The study suggests that the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support might lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps. However, the barriers for the initial dissociative adsorption and the propene elimination steps remain much higher than experimentally found values. The highest energy on the reaction pathway corresponds to the formation of an oxygen vacancy when a water molecule is desorbed. Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might reduce some of the barriers. The reaction at a VOV bridging oxygen site is energetically similar to that at a VO vanadyl site, indicating that both sites play comparable roles in the reaction mechanism.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持型五氧化二钒和沸石交换材料，通过影响反应机理和效率，对烷烃转化过程如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应产生影响。在V2O5(010)表面进行的丙烷氧化脱氢反应路径上的势能表面发现存在较大的壁垒，约为4580 kcal/mol高于反应物的能量。这些壁垒远高于实验上观测到的在支持型五氧化二钒催化剂上进行的丙烷氧化脱氢反应的值。研究表明，五氧化二钒与支撑材料的相互作用可能降低初始脱附吸附丙烷和丙烯消除步骤的壁垒。然而，初始脱附吸附和丙烯消除步骤的壁垒仍然远高于实验测量值。反应路径上的最高能量对应于水分子脱附时表面形成氧空位的情况。考虑更复杂的反应，例如在水消除过程中吸附O2的协同反应，可能降低某些壁垒。在VOV桥接氧原子位点上的反应与在VO范德华位点上的反应具有相似的能量，表明两个位点在反应机制中扮演着同等的角色。
