1. The study indicates that the (010) surface of V2O5 is not favorable for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The observed catalytic activity of vanadia catalysts is attributed to the influence of a support material, rather than the surface properties alone.
2. The highest energy on the potential energy surface is 80 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, specifically when a water molecule is desorbed, forming an oxygen vacancy.
3. The barriers for the adsorption of propane and the elimination of propene are estimated at 4560 kcal/mol.
4. The findings from cluster calculations are corroborated by periodic calculations, ensuring reliability.
5. Considering more complex reactions, such as a concerted reaction involving the adsorption of O2 during water elimination, might reduce some of the barriers.
6. The energy profiles for reactions at the VOV bridging oxygen site and the VO vanadyl site are comparable.

1. 研究表明，V2O5 的(010)表面对于丙烷氧化脱氢不理想。实验观察到的范德亚催化剂活性归因于支持材料的影响，而非仅由表面性质决定。
2. 最高能量在潜在能量表面上方为80 kcal/mol，对应于水分子脱除后形成的氧空位。
3. 丙烷吸附和丙烯消除的壁垒估计为4560 kcal/mol。
4. 来自簇计算的结果得到了周期计算的验证，确保了可靠性。
5. 考虑更复杂的反应，如水消除过程中吸附O2的协同反应，可能降低某些壁垒。
6. VOV桥接氧原子位点和VO钒原子位点上的能量剖面相似。
