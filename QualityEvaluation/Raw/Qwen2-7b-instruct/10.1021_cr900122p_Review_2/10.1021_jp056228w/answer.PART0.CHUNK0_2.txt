[1] "Several recent experimental results have contrasted the catalytic properties of pure V2O5 and supported vanadia catalysts for methanol oxidation and ODH of propane."
[2] "This is reflected in a surface density of active sites for supported vanadia catalysts (i.e., V2O5/TiO2) that is twenty times larger than for bulk V2O5."
[3] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."
[4] "We found in the case of the triplet state that the vanadyl oxygens that point down (under the surface) will bend to fill the vacancy being created by the oxygen leaving the surface."
[5] "Thus, assuming that the approximations used in our computations are valid, these results suggest that propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide species differs from that on a clean (010) V2O5 surface."
[6] "Analogous to the stabilization of the triplet state relative to the singlet state when the vanadium oxide surface is reduced by adsorbates (e.g., propanol, propoxide, and OH in Tables 2 and 4), the triplet state of a vanadium oxide cluster may be stabilized relative to the singlet (though not necessarily lower in energy) if anchored such that it is in a reduced state on a support."

1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, can significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, supported vanadia catalysts have a higher surface density of active sites, enhancing their catalytic properties compared to pure V2O5. 

2. In contrast, the barriers for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on supported vanadium oxide catalysts are experimentally found to be much lower, typically ranging from 20 to 30 kcal/mol, compared to the calculated barriers of about 80 kcal/mol for water elimination in this study.

3. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, can also affect the efficiency of these reactions. Higher temperatures might increase the rate of reactions, but could also lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts. Similarly, the presence of specific support materials can influence the catalytic activity by stabilizing the desired reaction states, as discussed in relation to the stabilization of the triplet state on supported catalysts.

4. The structure of the catalyst, including the arrangement of metal sites and support interactions, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. For example, the reaction pathways on supported vanadium oxide catalysts differ from those on pure metal surfaces due to the influence of the support, which can lower the barriers for key reaction steps.

5. The active sites on supported catalysts are influenced by the adsorption of molecules like propanol, propoxide, and OH, which can stabilize certain reaction states and pathways. This stabilization can lead to a lower overall barrier for the reactions, enhancing their efficiency.

6. The stabilization of the triplet state on supported vanadium oxide clusters, akin to the stabilization observed on surfaces, suggests that anchoring the cluster on a support might reduce the barriers for certain reactions by maintaining the reduced state of the catalyst. This could potentially lead to more efficient alkane transformations, particularly in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 金属基催化剂，如支持的钒氧化物和沸石交换材料，其组成、结构和反应条件可以显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。例如，支持的vanadia催化剂的活性位点密度比纯V2O5高20倍，从而提高了其催化性能。

2. 反应条件，如温度和压力，也会影响这些反应的效率。提高温度可能增加反应速率，但也可能导致形成不希望的副产品。同样，特定支撑材料的存在可以通过稳定所需反应状态来影响催化活性，正如关于在支持催化剂上稳定三重态状态所讨论的那样。

3. 催化剂的结构，包括金属位点的排列和支持相互作用，对确定催化活性起着关键作用。例如，支持的vanadium氧化物催化剂上的反应途径与纯金属表面上的不同，这归因于支持材料的影响，它可以降低关键反应步骤的壁垒。

4. 支持催化剂上的活性位点受吸附分子（如丙醇、丙氧基和OH）的影响，这些分子可以稳定特定的反应状态和路径。这种稳定可能导致某些反应的总体壁垒降低，从而提高其效率。

5. 支持的vanadium氧化物簇上的三重态状态的稳定，类似于在表面上观察到的稳定现象，表明将簇锚定在支撑上可能会通过保持催化剂的还原状态来减少某些反应的壁垒。这可能导致更高效的烷烃转化，特别是在氧化脱氢等过程中。
