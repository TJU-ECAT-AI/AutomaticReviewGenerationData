[1] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K of gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolite prepared by incipient wetness impregnation results in complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups."
[2] "The modification of the zeolite with gallium suppresses dealumination of the hydrogen form due to substitution of protons by gallium species."
[3] "When the reduction at 773 K is followed by evacuation, coordinatively unsaturated Ga+ ions are formed."
[4] "Alternatively, these Ga+ ions adsorb molecular hydrogen at lower temperatures resulting in several types of hydride species."
[5] "We propose that the oxidation of gallium upon cooling of reduced samples to room temperature in hydrogen can be attributed to an oxidative addition of H2 resulting in the formation of gallium dihydrides."

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the ability to substitute acidic hydroxyl groups with metal ions, such as gallium in the case of HZSM-5 zeolites, affects the catalytic activity by suppressing dealumination and promoting alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, like the temperature at which reduction occurs, determine the state of the metal ions within the catalyst, leading to the formation of various hydride species or metal oxo-ions upon further treatments. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the ability to reversibly oxidize or reduce the metal ions, which can affect the stability and activity of the catalyst over time.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成和结构，在烷烃转换的机制和效率中起着关键作用。具体来说，通过酸性羟基组分与金属离子（如HZSM-5沸石中的镓）的替代，影响催化活性，抑制了铝流失并促进了烷烃转化。反应条件，例如在何种温度下进行还原，决定了催化剂内部金属离子的状态，导致形成各种氢化物物种或金属氧离子。这些催化剂的效率受到可逆氧化或还原金属离子能力的影响，这可能会影响催化剂的稳定性和活性随时间的变化。
