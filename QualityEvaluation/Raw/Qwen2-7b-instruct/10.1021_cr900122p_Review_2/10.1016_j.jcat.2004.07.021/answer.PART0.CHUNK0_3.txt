The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In particular, in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by metal ions facilitates more complete proton substitution, reducing dealumination. The use of high-temperature hydrogen treatments enhances the mobility of reduced metal species within the zeolite matrix, enabling better proton substitution. The modification of zeolites with metals like gallium suppresses dealumination, leading to improved alkane transformation efficiency. The introduction of gallium ions into zeolites reduces the extent of acid protons, and hydrogen adsorption by reduced gallium ions forms gallium hydrides. Evacuating a reduced sample at high temperatures creates coordinatively unsaturated gallium ions that can be reversibly oxidized. Cooling in molecular hydrogen leads to the formation of gallium hydrides that compensate for the negative framework charge. Carbon monoxide probe DRIFT spectroscopy identifies various gallium species within the zeolite's micropore space, providing insights into the catalyst's active sites and reaction mechanisms.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中，酸性羟基团被金属离子取代，促进了更完全的质子替换，减少了脱铝。高温氢处理增强在沸石基质内的金属物种的流动性，使质子替换更为有效。通过引入如镓这样的金属到沸石中，可以抑制脱铝，从而提高烷烃转化效率。通过高能氢处理，镓离子在沸石中的引入减少了酸性质子的数量，并且通过还原态镓离子吸附氢气形成镓氢化物。在高温度下蒸发一个还原样品产生可逆氧化的配位不饱和镓离子。冷却到分子氢中会形成补偿框架负电荷的镓氢化物。碳一氧化合物探针傅里叶变换红外光谱（DRIFT）进一步识别沸石微孔空间中的各种镓物种，提供了催化剂活性位点和反应机制的洞察。
