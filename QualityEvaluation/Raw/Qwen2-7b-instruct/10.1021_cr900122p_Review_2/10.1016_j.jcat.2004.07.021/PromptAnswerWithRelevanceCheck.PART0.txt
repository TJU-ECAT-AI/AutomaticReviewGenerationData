The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the ability to substitute acidic hydroxyl groups with metal ions, such as gallium in the case of HZSM-5 zeolites, affects the catalytic activity by suppressing dealumination and promoting alkane transformations. The reaction conditions, like the temperature at which reduction occurs, determine the state of the metal ions within the catalyst, leading to the formation of various hydride species or metal oxo-ions upon further treatments. The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the ability to reversibly oxidize or reduce the metal ions, which can affect the stability and activity of the catalyst over time.

[1] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K of gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolite prepared by incipient wetness impregnation results in complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups."
[2] "These treatments facilitate the migration of the reduced gallium species into the micropores of the zeolite particles resulting in more complete substitution of the acid protons."
[3] "Substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by gallium ions in the zeolite micropores was only of a minor importance."
[4] "After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm1 gradually decreased."
[5] "This indicates substitution of the bridg- ing hydroxyl groups by the modifying gallium ions."
[6] "These bands were also not observed after admission of hydrogen to the evacuated samples at room temperature."
[7] "However, heating of such samples in a hydrogen atmosphere to 773 K with subsequent cooling of the zeolite in hydrogen to room temperature resulted in the appearance of two bands with maxima at 2041 and 2059 cm1 (Fig. 5)."
[8] "This points to the presence of multiple adsorption sites."
[9] "The remaining weak band is additionally split into two components indicating further inhomogeneity of the adsorption sites."
[10] "The intensity of the band with the maximum at 2188 cm1 increased in intensity."
[11] "Indeed, as follows from Figs. 57, DRIFTS measure- ments upon reduction indicate the formation of at least two different hydrides while according to Fig. 9, CO adsorption at higher pressures indicated the existence of several differ- ent sites connected with reduced gallium species."

The state of gallium in the catalysts is influenced by the composition, structure, and reaction conditions. The reduction of hydrogen at 773 K facilitates the migration of reduced gallium species into the zeolite micropores, leading to complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups. This process is more efficient than substitution through dealumination. The adsorption of carbon monoxide helps identify the various gallium species within the zeolite structure, revealing the presence of multiple adsorption sites and inhomogeneity in the adsorption patterns. The formation of gallium hydrides upon hydrogen adsorption indicates the presence of reduced gallium ions. The intensity of the CO stretching bands decreases after cooling in hydrogen due to the screening effect of gallium hydrides.

The composition and structure of the gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolite play a crucial role in alkane transformations. Specifically, reducing the zeolite at 773 K facilitates the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by gallium ions, which in turn reduces the extent of dealumination. This is because gallium ions can compensate for the negative charges of the aluminum-centered oxygen tetrahedra within the zeolite structure, rather than forming the more problematic (AlO)+ oxo-ions. Additionally, the formation of gallium hydrides upon hydrogen adsorption by reduced gallium species is reversible through evacuation or oxidation with nitrous oxide, indicating the dynamic nature of gallium states in these catalysts.

金属镓修饰的HZSM-5沸石的组成和结构对烷烃转换至关重要。具体来说，在773 K下还原沸石能够促进酸性羟基团被镓离子取代，这进一步减少了去铝化程度。这是因为镓离子可以补偿沸石结构中铝中心氧四面体的负电荷，而不是形成更麻烦的(AlO)+氧化物离子。此外，通过蒸发或与二氧化氮氧化，由还原的镓物种吸附的氢气形成的镓氢化物是可逆的，这表明这些催化剂中的镓状态的动态性质。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In particular, in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by metal ions facilitates more complete proton substitution, reducing dealumination. The use of high-temperature hydrogen treatments enhances the mobility of reduced metal species within the zeolite matrix, enabling better proton substitution. The modification of zeolites with metals like gallium suppresses dealumination, leading to improved alkane transformation efficiency. The introduction of gallium ions into zeolites reduces the extent of acid protons, and hydrogen adsorption by reduced gallium ions forms gallium hydrides. Evacuating a reduced sample at high temperatures creates coordinatively unsaturated gallium ions that can be reversibly oxidized. Cooling in molecular hydrogen leads to the formation of gallium hydrides that compensate for the negative framework charge. Carbon monoxide probe DRIFT spectroscopy identifies various gallium species within the zeolite's micropore space, providing insights into the catalyst's active sites and reaction mechanisms.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中，酸性羟基团被金属离子取代，促进了更完全的质子替换，减少了脱铝。高温氢处理增强在沸石基质内的金属物种的流动性，使质子替换更为有效。通过引入如镓这样的金属到沸石中，可以抑制脱铝，从而提高烷烃转化效率。通过高能氢处理，镓离子在沸石中的引入减少了酸性质子的数量，并且通过还原态镓离子吸附氢气形成镓氢化物。在高温度下蒸发一个还原样品产生可逆氧化的配位不饱和镓离子。冷却到分子氢中会形成补偿框架负电荷的镓氢化物。碳一氧化合物探针傅里叶变换红外光谱（DRIFT）进一步识别沸石微孔空间中的各种镓物种，提供了催化剂活性位点和反应机制的洞察。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by gallium ions during reduction in hydrogen at 773 K, which suppresses dealumination and enhances the catalyst's activity in alkane transformations.

2. The formation of coordinatively unsaturated Ga+ ions upon evacuation, which can reversibly oxidize by nitrous oxide at 673 K, or adsorb molecular hydrogen at lower temperatures, forming hydride species that are completely decomposed only in vacuum at 773 K.

3. The oxidation of gallium ions upon cooling to room temperature in hydrogen can be attributed to the oxidative addition of hydrogen leading to the formation of gallium dihydrides.

4. Hydrogen adsorption by reduced Ga+ species results in the formation of cationic gallium dihydrides, indicating the dynamic nature of gallium's oxidation states under different conditions.

5. The activation of gallium hydrides formation, observed only at temperatures exceeding 573 K, suggests that slower cooling rates lead to higher yields of hydride species compared to faster cooling procedures.

These insights into the chemistry of zeolite-occluded gallium provide a foundation for understanding the catalytic behavior of metal-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformations, highlighting the role of gallium's redox properties and its interactions with the zeolite framework.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转换过程的机制和效率。这些催化剂在工业中的重要性主要体现在以下几个关键因素：

1. 在773 K氢气中进行还原时，镓离子完全取代酸性羟基团，抑制了氢形式的铝流失，从而提高了催化剂在烷烃转换过程中的活性。

2. 在高温度下蒸发后形成的配位不饱和Ga+离子，可以通过与氮氧化物在673 K的可逆氧化，或者在较低温度下吸附分子氢形成氢化物种。这些物种只有在773 K真空下才能完全分解。

3. 铝离子在氢气中冷却至室温时的氧化可以归因于氢的氧化插入导致镓双氢化合物的形成。

4. 减少的Ga+物种通过吸附氢气形成正电性镓双氢化合物，这表明了镓氧化态在不同条件下动态变化的特性。

5. 铝化物形成需要激活过程，仅在超过573 K的温度下观察到，暗示了较慢的冷却速率相对于快速冷却过程能够产生更多的氢化物种。

这些关于嵌入沸石的镓化学的见解为理解金属交换沸石在烷烃转换过程中的催化行为提供了基础，突出了镓的氧化还原性质及其与沸石框架相互作用的重要性。
