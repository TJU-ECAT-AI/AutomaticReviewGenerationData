[1] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K of gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolite prepared by incipient wetness impregnation results in complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups."
[2] "These treatments facilitate the migration of the reduced gallium species into the micropores of the zeolite particles resulting in more complete substitution of the acid protons."
[3] "Substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by gallium ions in the zeolite micropores was only of a minor importance."
[4] "After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm1 gradually decreased."
[5] "This indicates substitution of the bridg- ing hydroxyl groups by the modifying gallium ions."
[6] "These bands were also not observed after admission of hydrogen to the evacuated samples at room temperature."
[7] "However, heating of such samples in a hydrogen atmosphere to 773 K with subsequent cooling of the zeolite in hydrogen to room temperature resulted in the appearance of two bands with maxima at 2041 and 2059 cm1 (Fig. 5)."
[8] "This points to the presence of multiple adsorption sites."
[9] "The remaining weak band is additionally split into two components indicating further inhomogeneity of the adsorption sites."
[10] "The intensity of the band with the maximum at 2188 cm1 increased in intensity."
[11] "Indeed, as follows from Figs. 57, DRIFTS measure- ments upon reduction indicate the formation of at least two different hydrides while according to Fig. 9, CO adsorption at higher pressures indicated the existence of several differ- ent sites connected with reduced gallium species."
[12] "The intensity of the band around 2218 cm1 also strongly decreased the intensity of the band with a max- imum at 2218 cm1 when compared to the oxidized sam- ple."
[13] "The intensity of the CO stretching bands is lower after cooling in hydrogen due to the screening of univalent gallium cations by the resulting hydrides."

The state of gallium in the catalysts is influenced by the composition, structure, and reaction conditions. The reduction of hydrogen at 773 K facilitates the migration of reduced gallium species into the zeolite micropores, leading to complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups. This process is more efficient than substitution through dealumination. The adsorption of carbon monoxide helps identify the various gallium species within the zeolite structure, revealing the presence of multiple adsorption sites and inhomogeneity in the adsorption patterns. The formation of gallium hydrides upon hydrogen adsorption indicates the presence of reduced gallium ions. The intensity of the CO stretching bands decreases after cooling in hydrogen due to the screening effect of gallium hydrides.

催化剂中镓的状态受到组成、结构和反应条件的影响。在773 K的氢气还原下，减少了镓物种的迁移并进入沸石微孔，导致酸性羟基团的完全替代。这一过程比通过脱铝化进行替代更有效率。吸附二氧化碳有助于识别沸石结构中的各种镓物种，揭示了多个吸附位点和吸附性质的不均匀性。氢吸附形成的镓氢化合物表明存在还原镓离子。在氢气冷却后，由于镓氢化合物的屏蔽效应，CO拉伸带的强度降低。
