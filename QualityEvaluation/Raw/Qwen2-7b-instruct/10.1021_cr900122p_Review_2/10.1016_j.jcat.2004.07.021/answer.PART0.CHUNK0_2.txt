[1] "Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K of gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolite prepared by incipient wetness impregnation results in complete substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups."
[2] "Substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by gallium ions in the zeolite micropores was only of a minor importance."
[3] "After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm1 gradually decreased."
[4] "The band with the highest GaH stretching frequency appears at lower temperatures compared to the other one. This points to the presence of multiple adsorption sites."
[5] "Indeed, as follows from Figs. 57, DRIFTS measurements upon reduction indicate the formation of at least two different hydrides."
[6] "Suppression of dealumination for the gallium-modified samples is then connected with compensation of the negatively charged aluminum-centered oxygen tetrahedra by gallium oxo-ions instead of (AlO)+ species."

The composition and structure of the gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolite play a crucial role in alkane transformations. Specifically, reducing the zeolite at 773 K facilitates the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by gallium ions, which in turn reduces the extent of dealumination. This is because gallium ions can compensate for the negative charges of the aluminum-centered oxygen tetrahedra within the zeolite structure, rather than forming the more problematic (AlO)+ oxo-ions. Additionally, the formation of gallium hydrides upon hydrogen adsorption by reduced gallium species is reversible through evacuation or oxidation with nitrous oxide, indicating the dynamic nature of gallium states in these catalysts.

金属镓修饰的HZSM-5沸石的组成和结构对烷烃转换至关重要。具体来说，在773 K下还原沸石能够促进酸性羟基团被镓离子取代，这进一步减少了去铝化程度。这是因为镓离子可以补偿沸石结构中铝中心氧四面体的负电荷，而不是形成更麻烦的(AlO)+氧化物离子。此外，通过蒸发或与二氧化氮氧化，由还原的镓物种吸附的氢气形成的镓氢化物是可逆的，这表明这些催化剂中的镓状态的动态性质。
