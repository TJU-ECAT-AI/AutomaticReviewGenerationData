<p>The use of transient kinetics is reviewed for recent works performed in the wide area of methane valorization. The specific contribution of techniques such as steady-state isotopic transient kinetics, fast temperature transients, TAP reactor studies is illustrated for reactions involving different modes of methane activation and various types of catalysts.</p>
<p>The transient kinetic analysis, using unlabelled or labelled molecules, has already proved to be a powerful and unique technique to investigate the way that gas molecules may react with an active surface. As a matter of fact, it allows to evaluate the residence time and the surface accumulation of the activated intermediates and may also provide information on the possible competition in adsorption/desorption steps with co-reacting molecules [1]. Moreover, it perfectly applies under the often severe temperature conditions required for methane activation, while numerous physico-chemical techniques used for catalyst characterization do not.</p>
<p>A second type of non-steady-state transient experiments consisted of switch- ing from the reaction mixture CH₄/CO₂/He/Ar to a mixture CO₂/He. In this case, large amounts of CO were released from the surface under pure CO₂ atmosphere, showing that carbon dioxide could react directly with the carbon deposits into CO. The amount of produced CO corresponded to the reverse Boudouard reaction -- CO₂ + C → 2CO -- allowing the initial carbon deposits to be oxidised by CO₂.</p>
<p>Only a very small delay was observed between the response of the labelled methane and the one of the argon tracer, representing the reference signal (Fig. 3b). At variance with methane, a significant delay was observed between the response of the labelled methane and the one of the argon tracer, representing the reference signal (Fig. 3b).</p>

1. The transient kinetic analysis method, utilizing isotopically labeled or unlabeled molecules, serves as a powerful and distinctive tool to study the interaction of gas molecules with a reactive surface. It enables the assessment of the residence time and surface accumulation of activated intermediates, as well as insight into the possible competition in adsorption/desorption stages compared to co-reacting molecules. This technique is particularly useful under the stringent temperature conditions required for methane activation, surpassing many physical-chemical methods used for catalyst characterization.

2. By transitioning from the reaction mixture containing methane, carbon dioxide, and helium to a mixture solely containing carbon dioxide and helium, substantial amounts of carbon monoxide were emitted from the surface in a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere. This demonstrated that carbon dioxide could directly react with carbon deposits to produce carbon monoxide. The quantity of emitted carbon monoxide matched the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO₂ + C → 2CO), enabling the oxidation of initial carbon deposits by carbon dioxide.

3. A negligible delay was noted between the response of the labeled methane and the argon tracer, which represented the reference signal. In contrast, a noticeable delay was observed between the response of the labeled methane and the argon tracer, highlighting the distinct behavior of methane under the experimental conditions.

1. 瞬态动力学分析方法，利用同位素标记或未标记的分子，作为研究气体分子与活性表面相互作用的强大且独特的工具。它能够评估激活中间体在表面的停留时间和积累时间，并提供吸附/脱附步骤中与共反应分子竞争的可能性信息。该技术特别适用于甲烷活化所需的严格温度条件，超越了许多用于催化剂表征的物理化学方法。

2. 通过将反应混合物从含有甲烷、二氧化碳和氦气转变为仅包含二氧化碳和氦气的混合物，在纯二氧化碳大气中，表面释放出了大量碳一氧化碳。这表明二氧化碳可以直接与碳沉积物反应生成一氧化碳。排放的一氧化碳量与逆布杜瓦尔反应（CO₂ + C → 2CO）相匹配，实现了由二氧化碳氧化初始碳沉积物的过程。

3. 标记的甲烷响应与代表参考信号的氩气追踪之间几乎没有延迟。相反，标记的甲烷响应与氩气追踪之间观察到了明显的延迟，突显了甲烷在实验条件下表现出的不同行为。
