The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The stability and symmetry of methane molecules pose challenges due to the difficulty in controlling the activation of specific C-H bonds and the stability requiring severe conditions that can lead to secondary reactions. Transient kinetic analysis, utilizing unlabelled or labelled molecules, serves as a powerful tool for understanding the activation mechanisms of gas molecules on active surfaces. Engineering challenges, such as heat and mass transfer control and catalyst stability, still need addressing in the context of alkane transformations. The interactions between carbon species and the metallic phase of the catalyst demonstrate the complexity of these processes.

[1] "Most of the above difficulties simply derive from two basic features of the methane molecule: its symmetry and stability."
[2] "Thus, secondary reactions occur which decompose part of the desired products into waste, such as CO x in direct oxidative conversions, or coke in non-oxida- tive homologation."
[3] "A second type of non-steady-state transient experiments consisted of switch- ing from the reaction mixture CHn/CO2/He/Ar to a mixture CO2/He. In this case, large amounts of CO were released from the surface under pure CO 2 atmosphere, showing that carbon dioxide could react directly with the carbon deposits into CO."
[4] "A significant residual production of hydrogen, corresponding to the conversion of about half the molar volume of methane, was observed after this transient step (Fig. 2). This demonstrated that under fuel-rich conditions, methane was decomposed into two hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom, the latter reacting with the nickel phase to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a marked decrease of the ferromagnetic signal."
[5] "Only a very small delay was observed between the response of the labelled methane and the one of the argon tracer, representing the reference signal (Fig. 3b)."

1. Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, due to their unique compositions, structures, and reaction conditions. The symmetry and stability of the methane molecule pose challenges in controlling the number of C-H bonds activated in these catalytic systems, which can lead to secondary reactions that decompose desired products into waste. These catalysts enable the direct conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates, overcoming the limitations associated with indirect conversion routes.

2. In the context of metal catalysts, the direct oxidative conversion of methane often results in the formation of COx as a waste product, whereas non-oxidative homologation can produce coke. The stability of the methane molecule necessitates severe operating conditions where the products of conversion are more reactive than methane itself, leading to such unwanted reactions.

3. When carbon dioxide reacts directly with carbon deposits on the metal catalyst surface under pure CO2 atmosphere, significant amounts of CO are released. This demonstrates the direct reactivity of carbon dioxide with the deposited carbon, facilitating the conversion of carbon compounds.

4. Under fuel-rich conditions, methane is decomposed into two hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom. This carbon atom reacts with the nickel phase of the catalyst to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a decrease in the ferromagnetic signal, highlighting the role of the catalyst in promoting methane decomposition.

5. There is a minimal delay observed between the response of the labeled methane and the argon tracer signal, suggesting efficient kinetic behavior of the labeled methane within the catalytic system. This indicates that the labeled methane is effectively utilized in the reaction, providing insights into the kinetic mechanisms involved.

1. 金属催化剂，包括支持型二氧化钒和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转换过程，尤其是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率产生显著影响，这主要归因于它们独特的组成、结构和反应条件。甲烷分子的对称性和稳定性在这些催化系统中激活C-H键时带来挑战，导致次级反应分解期望产物为废弃物。这些催化剂能够直接将甲烷转化为更高碳数的烃类和氧化合物，克服了间接转化途径相关的限制。

2. 在金属催化剂背景下，直接氧化甲烷通常会导致COx作为废弃物生成，而非氧化异构化可产生焦炭。由于甲烷分子的稳定性要求在极端条件下操作，产物比甲烷本身更活泼，从而导致这类不希望的反应。

3. 当在纯二氧化碳气氛下，二氧化碳直接与金属催化剂表面的碳沉积物反应，会释放大量二氧化碳。这表明二氧化碳与沉积碳的直接反应性，促进了碳化合物的转化。

4. 在富燃料条件下，甲烷分解成两个氢分子和一个碳原子。该碳原子与催化剂中的镍相反应形成碳化物物种，通过磁信号的明显减少得到证实，揭示了催化剂在促进甲烷分解中的作用。

5. 标记的甲烷与氩追踪器信号之间存在极小的延迟，表明标记的甲烷在催化体系中得到有效利用。这提供了关于反应动力学机制的见解，显示了标记甲烷在反应中的高效动力学行为。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For example, supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites are crucial in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions due to their ability to facilitate specific alkane transformations under controlled conditions. These catalysts enable efficient alkane conversion into desired products by promoting specific reaction pathways, which is essential for industrial applications. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include enhanced selectivity, improved conversion rates, and the ability to operate under conditions that maximize product yield while minimizing side reactions.

In the context of methane valorization, transient kinetic analysis offers a powerful tool for understanding the complex reactions occurring on metal surfaces. By perturbing the steady-state conditions through changes in feed concentration, molar flow rate, pressure, or temperature, researchers can observe the relaxation dynamics of the system. This method allows for the evaluation of residence times, surface accumulation of activated intermediates, and insights into adsorption/desorption steps, providing crucial information for the development and optimization of catalytic systems. The combination of unlabelled or labelled molecules enables detailed tracking of the transformation processes, especially under severe operating conditions required for methane activation.

The use of non-steady-state transient experiments, such as switching between different gas mixtures, generates a carbon tracing transient, which helps in understanding the reaction pathways and the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface. These experiments also reveal the development of specific phases, like carbide-like compounds, under reaction conditions. Furthermore, steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) provides quantitative insights into the isotopic distribution of methane and hydrogen, contributing to a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the role of isotopes in the conversion processes.

In summary, the factors contributing to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations include their ability to promote specific reaction pathways, enhance selectivity and conversion rates, and operate under conditions that optimize product yield while minimizing side reactions. Transient kinetic analysis offers a valuable tool for elucidating these mechanisms and optimizing catalyst performance.

1. The transient kinetic analysis method, utilizing isotopically labeled or unlabeled molecules, serves as a powerful and distinctive tool to study the interaction of gas molecules with a reactive surface. It enables the assessment of the residence time and surface accumulation of activated intermediates, as well as insight into the possible competition in adsorption/desorption stages compared to co-reacting molecules. This technique is particularly useful under the stringent temperature conditions required for methane activation, surpassing many physical-chemical methods used for catalyst characterization.

2. By transitioning from the reaction mixture containing methane, carbon dioxide, and helium to a mixture solely containing carbon dioxide and helium, substantial amounts of carbon monoxide were emitted from the surface in a pure carbon dioxide atmosphere. This demonstrated that carbon dioxide could directly react with carbon deposits to produce carbon monoxide. The quantity of emitted carbon monoxide matched the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO₂ + C → 2CO), enabling the oxidation of initial carbon deposits by carbon dioxide.

3. A negligible delay was noted between the response of the labeled methane and the argon tracer, which represented the reference signal. In contrast, a noticeable delay was observed between the response of the labeled methane and the argon tracer, highlighting the distinct behavior of methane under the experimental conditions.
