[1] "During the last decades, there was a world-wide interest in the conversion into value-added products of methane, as the main constituent of natural gas."
[2] "Most of the above difficulties simply derive from two basic features of the methane molecule: its symmetry and stability."
[3] "The transient kinetic analysis, using unlabelled or labelled molecules, has already proved to be a powerful and unique technique to investigate the way that gas molecules may react with an active surface."
[4] "For this case, engineering problems such as heat and mass transfer control and catalyst stability have still to be solved."
[5] "This clearly demonstrated that these carbon species were in strong chemical interaction with the metallic nickel phase, forming a new non-ferromagnetic phase."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The stability and symmetry of methane molecules pose challenges due to the difficulty in controlling the activation of specific C-H bonds and the stability requiring severe conditions that can lead to secondary reactions. Transient kinetic analysis, utilizing unlabelled or labelled molecules, serves as a powerful tool for understanding the activation mechanisms of gas molecules on active surfaces. Engineering challenges, such as heat and mass transfer control and catalyst stability, still need addressing in the context of alkane transformations. The interactions between carbon species and the metallic phase of the catalyst demonstrate the complexity of these processes.
