[1] "Most of the above difficulties simply derive from two basic features of the methane molecule: its symmetry and stability."
[2] "Thus, secondary reactions occur which decompose part of the desired products into waste, such as CO x in direct oxidative conversions, or coke in non-oxida- tive homologation."
[3] "A second type of non-steady-state transient experiments consisted of switch- ing from the reaction mixture CHn/CO2/He/Ar to a mixture CO2/He. In this case, large amounts of CO were released from the surface under pure CO 2 atmosphere, showing that carbon dioxide could react directly with the carbon deposits into CO."
[4] "A significant residual production of hydrogen, corresponding to the conversion of about half the molar volume of methane, was observed after this transient step (Fig. 2). This demonstrated that under fuel-rich conditions, methane was decomposed into two hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom, the latter reacting with the nickel phase to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a marked decrease of the ferromagnetic signal."
[5] "Only a very small delay was observed between the response of the labelled methane and the one of the argon tracer, representing the reference signal (Fig. 3b)."

1. Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, due to their unique compositions, structures, and reaction conditions. The symmetry and stability of the methane molecule pose challenges in controlling the number of C-H bonds activated in these catalytic systems, which can lead to secondary reactions that decompose desired products into waste. These catalysts enable the direct conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates, overcoming the limitations associated with indirect conversion routes.

2. In the context of metal catalysts, the direct oxidative conversion of methane often results in the formation of COx as a waste product, whereas non-oxidative homologation can produce coke. The stability of the methane molecule necessitates severe operating conditions where the products of conversion are more reactive than methane itself, leading to such unwanted reactions.

3. When carbon dioxide reacts directly with carbon deposits on the metal catalyst surface under pure CO2 atmosphere, significant amounts of CO are released. This demonstrates the direct reactivity of carbon dioxide with the deposited carbon, facilitating the conversion of carbon compounds.

4. Under fuel-rich conditions, methane is decomposed into two hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom. This carbon atom reacts with the nickel phase of the catalyst to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a decrease in the ferromagnetic signal, highlighting the role of the catalyst in promoting methane decomposition.

5. There is a minimal delay observed between the response of the labeled methane and the argon tracer signal, suggesting efficient kinetic behavior of the labeled methane within the catalytic system. This indicates that the labeled methane is effectively utilized in the reaction, providing insights into the kinetic mechanisms involved.

1. 金属催化剂，包括支持型二氧化钒和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转换过程，尤其是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的机制和效率产生显著影响，这主要归因于它们独特的组成、结构和反应条件。甲烷分子的对称性和稳定性在这些催化系统中激活C-H键时带来挑战，导致次级反应分解期望产物为废弃物。这些催化剂能够直接将甲烷转化为更高碳数的烃类和氧化合物，克服了间接转化途径相关的限制。

2. 在金属催化剂背景下，直接氧化甲烷通常会导致COx作为废弃物生成，而非氧化异构化可产生焦炭。由于甲烷分子的稳定性要求在极端条件下操作，产物比甲烷本身更活泼，从而导致这类不希望的反应。

3. 当在纯二氧化碳气氛下，二氧化碳直接与金属催化剂表面的碳沉积物反应，会释放大量二氧化碳。这表明二氧化碳与沉积碳的直接反应性，促进了碳化合物的转化。

4. 在富燃料条件下，甲烷分解成两个氢分子和一个碳原子。该碳原子与催化剂中的镍相反应形成碳化物物种，通过磁信号的明显减少得到证实，揭示了催化剂在促进甲烷分解中的作用。

5. 标记的甲烷与氩追踪器信号之间存在极小的延迟，表明标记的甲烷在催化体系中得到有效利用。这提供了关于反应动力学机制的见解，显示了标记甲烷在反应中的高效动力学行为。
