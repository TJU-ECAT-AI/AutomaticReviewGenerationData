[1] "The transient kinetic analysis is based on the principle (i) of perturbing a steady-state established on a working catalyst by changing abruptly one or more of the state variables such as feed concentration, molar flow rate, pressure or temperature, and (ii) of following the relaxation of the system."
[2] "The mechanism of the carbon dioxide reforming of methane was investigated over a model nickel-on-silica catalyst, which was shown to be reasonably stable under reaction conditions."
[3] "The amount of produced CO corresponded to the reverse Boudouard reaction -- CO 2 + C → 2CO -- allowing the initial carbon deposits to be oxidised by CO 2."
[4] "Under fuel-rich conditions, methane was decomposed into two hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom, the latter reacting with the nickel phase to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a marked decrease of the ferromagnetic signal."
[5] "Only a very small delay was observed between the response of the labelled methane and the one of the argon tracer, representing the reference signal."

1. The transient kinetic analysis involves perturbing a steady-state condition by rapidly altering parameters like feed concentration, molar flow rate, pressure, or temperature. It then tracks the system's recovery. This method was used to study the CO2 reforming of methane over a nickel-on-silica catalyst, revealing the reaction mechanism under specific conditions. In fuel-rich conditions, methane was split into two hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom, which reacted with the catalyst's nickel phase to produce bulk carbide species. The delay between the response of labeled methane and an argon tracer was minimal, indicating efficient tracking of the reaction's dynamics.

1. 转瞬动力学分析涉及通过快速改变参数（如进料浓度、摩尔流速、压力或温度）来扰动稳态状态，然后跟踪系统的恢复。这种方法被用于研究在特定条件下甲烷与CO2重整的机制。在燃料丰富的条件下，甲烷被分解为两个氢分子和一个碳原子，该碳原子与催化剂的镍相反应生成块状碳化物。标记的甲烷响应与代表参考信号的氩气响应之间的延迟非常小，这表明能够高效地追踪反应的动力学。
