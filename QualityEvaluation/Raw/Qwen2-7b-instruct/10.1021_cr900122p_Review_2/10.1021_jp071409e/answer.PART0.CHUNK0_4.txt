[3] "The catalytic activation of CH bonds is of fundamental interest, because it is the crucial step in important technological processes and also in many enzymatic reactions."
[4] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."
[5] "Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites. Therefore the rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is much larger than the rate of isopropyl alcohol (or propene) formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites."
[6] "The mechanism suggested is compatible with turnover frequencies and activation energies available, while other suggestions (CH addition onto the metal oxo bond)6,32 are not supported by the calculations."
[7] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica."
[8] "The detailed mechanism presented in this study is a firm basis for future analysis of different kinds of experiments and will be used in microkinetic models."
[9] "The majority of vanadia sites are inside the bulk of V2O5 crystallites and not accessible in such three-dimensional vanadia particles."
[10] "Propene can be formed via Ts3 or Ts5, or from Int5 via Ts11 and from Int7 via Ts14. All four of these routes for the second hydrogen abstraction are included, because their energies are too close to favor one over the other."
[11] "The rate of propyl alcohol formation relative to the rate of propene formation is proportional to the concentration of reduced sites Int12 relative to the concentration of non-reduced sites Int0."

The document investigates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory, focusing on monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica. It identifies the initial step as hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, leading to a diradical intermediate. The formation of propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting. The mechanism is compatible with experimental observations regarding turnover frequencies and activation energies. The document also discusses the comparative reactivity of vanadia sites on the surface versus in the bulk of vanadium oxide crystals. It concludes that the detailed mechanism provides a foundation for future experimental analyses and microkinetic modeling.
