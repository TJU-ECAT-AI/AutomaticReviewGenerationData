1. Supported vanadium oxides on silica are used as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. They consist of monomeric vanadium oxide species modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl group, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. This is followed by a rebound mechanism resulting in alkoxide or alcohol attachment to a VIII(OSi)3 site, from which propene can be formed. Alternatively, propene can be directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate. Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV sites on the surface, which have a much smaller concentration compared to OVV sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is significantly higher than the rate of isopropyl alcohol formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. At 750 K, the predicted apparent activation energy is 123 ± 5 kJ/mol, and the rate constant is approximately 0.26 s⁻¹, which is in close agreement with experimental findings. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also happen on VOSi bridging oxygen sites.

2. The catalysts considered in this study are supported vanadium oxides on silica, which are known for their activity in alkane transformations. The detailed mechanism provided serves as a solid foundation for future experimentation and modeling efforts.

1. 支持在硅胶上的钒氧化物被用作丙烷氧化脱氢的催化剂。它们由通过范德华替换硅氧烷基团的范德华氧化物物种组成。初始步骤涉及范德华氧原子的氢原子提取，导致一个二自由基中间体，在其中丙基自由基绑定到HOVIV位点。接下来是一个丙基反弹机制，产生连接到VIII(OSi)3表面位点的醇或醇，从而形成丙烯。另外，丙烯也可以直接通过从二自由基中间体的第二次氢原子提取获得。丙基的脱附导致气体相中丙基的稳定浓度，并留下减少的HOVIV位点在表面上。由于快速重新氧化，这些位点的浓度远小于OVV位点的浓度。丙烯形成后在OVV位点的读取速率远大于在HOVIV位点形成异丙基醇（或丙烯）的速率。在750 K时，预测的有效活化能为123±5 kJ/mol，速率常数约为0.26 s⁻¹，与实验结果相符。第一次氢原子提取仅发生在OVV位点上，而第二次氢原子提取也可能发生在VOSi桥接氧位点上。考虑的催化剂是支持在硅胶上的钒氧化物，它们以活性在烷烃转换中而闻名。提供的详细机制为未来实验和建模工作提供了坚实的基础。
