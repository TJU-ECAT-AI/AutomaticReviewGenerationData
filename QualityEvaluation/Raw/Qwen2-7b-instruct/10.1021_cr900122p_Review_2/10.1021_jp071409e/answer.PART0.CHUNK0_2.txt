1. The research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, forming a diradical intermediate with a propyl radical bonded to a HOVIV site. The second hydrogen abstraction can occur on either an OVV site or a VOSi bridging oxygen site. Fast reoxidation of the reduced HOVIV sites results in a smaller concentration compared to the OVV sites, affecting the reaction rates. Studies of V2O5(001) crystal surfaces suggest that bulk surface sites might be more active in propane dehydrogenation than monomer-supported sites. The proposed mechanism aligns with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison of turnover frequencies and activation energies confirms the compatibility of the suggested mechanism with existing observations.

2. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a critical role in the efficiency of alkane transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation. Factors like the presence of specific active sites, such as vanadyl and bridging oxygen sites, influence the reaction pathways and rates. The structure of the catalyst, whether it is supported as monomers or part of a bulk surface, also impacts activity and selectivity. Reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, affect the stability of the active sites and the rates of reactions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to efficiently convert lower alkanes to alkenes and their potential for oxygenation reactions, making them valuable in various chemical processes. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling, aiming to address selectivity issues in these processes.

1. 研究利用密度泛函理论探讨了丙烷氧化脱氢的可能机制。在硅胶上的单金属氧化物物种通过范德华替换的硅三氧硅酸盐进行建模。初始步骤涉及由范德华氧原子执行的氢抽象，形成包含丙基自由基和HOVIV(O)3的二自由基中间体。第二个氢抽象可以在OVV位点或VOSi桥接氧位点上发生。快速氧化还原HOVIV位点导致与再生（或未反应）OVV(O)3位点相比，后者浓度较小，影响反应速率。对V2O5(001)晶面的研究表明，如果它们是作为多面体而不是硅胶上的单体存在的，则晶面表面位点在丙烷脱氢化中的活性可能更高。所提出的机制与已知的周转频率和活化能相符合，而其他假设（例如，CH键添加到金属氧基团上）未得到计算支持。周转频率和活化能的比较证实了所建议机制与现有观察结果的一致性。

2. 金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件在烷烃转化过程中，尤其是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中起着关键作用。如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石等催化剂的特定活性位点（如范德华和桥接氧位点）影响反应路径和速率。催化剂的结构，无论是作为单体还是作为三维粒子的一部分，也影响活性和选择性。反应条件，如温度和压力，影响活性位点的稳定性以及反应速率。这些催化剂在工业上有重要意义，因为它们能够高效地将低级烷烃转化为烯烃，并且在氧气化反应中具有潜力，使其在各种化学过程中有价值。所提出的具体机制为未来实验分析和微观动力学建模提供了坚实的基础，旨在解决这些过程的选择性问题。
