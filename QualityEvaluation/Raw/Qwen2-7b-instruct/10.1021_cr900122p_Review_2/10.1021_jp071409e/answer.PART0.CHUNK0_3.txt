The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides, play a crucial role in alkane transformations. In the case of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl group (OVV), leading to the formation of a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持的钒氧化物，对烷烃转化具有关键作用。在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中，初始步骤是通过范德华（OVV）组进行氢原子抽取，导致在HOVIV位点上形成一个包含丙基自由基的二自由基中间体。随后从这个中间体的氢原子抽取可以直 接产生丙烯或通过醇的形成。首次氢原子抽取成为决定性步骤，有助于提高过程的整体效率。在750 K时，首次氢原子抽取的显着活化能约为123 kJ/mol，与实验结果相匹配。

[2] "Unfortunately, the density functional used in ref 9 (PW91) was different from the one we use (B3LYP)."
[3] "Another critical difference is that the oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, that is, formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here (Table 1), whereas it is strongly exothermic with VO2+."
[4] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

Comparisons with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces highlight that vanadia sites might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation if they are part of the bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies might be lower for V2O5 crystallites on surfaces, as only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles. The oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, resulting in the formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here, unlike with VO2+, which exhibits a strong exothermic characteristic. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies for propene formation have been observed to be around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K.

与晶格V2O5表面的计算比较表明，如果范德华物种是表面的组成部分而不是在硅氧烷上作为单体支持，则它们在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中可能更为活跃。然而，对于表面上的V2O5晶粒，表面物种的显着转换频率可能会更低，因为只有粒子内部的少量位点是可访问的。催化循环的氧化部分，即生成丙烯和H2O·VIII(d2)，对于这里研究的表面物种是吸热的，而VO2+则表现出强烈的放热特性。对于V2O5/SiO2催化剂，当范德华覆盖度低于3 V/nm2时，观察到的丙烯生成的显着转换频率约为748 K时的0.01 s-1和623 K时的0.3 × 10-3 s-1。
