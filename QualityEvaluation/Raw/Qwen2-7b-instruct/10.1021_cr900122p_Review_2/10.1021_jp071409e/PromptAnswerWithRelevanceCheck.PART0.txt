1. Supported vanadium oxides on silica are used as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. They consist of monomeric vanadium oxide species modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl group, leading to a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. This is followed by a rebound mechanism resulting in alkoxide or alcohol attachment to a VIII(OSi)3 site, from which propene can be formed. Alternatively, propene can be directly obtained by a second hydrogen abstraction from the diradical intermediate. Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV sites on the surface, which have a much smaller concentration compared to OVV sites. The rate of propene formation after readsorption on OVV sites is significantly higher than the rate of isopropyl alcohol formation after readsorption on HOVIV sites. At 750 K, the predicted apparent activation energy is 123 ± 5 kJ/mol, and the rate constant is approximately 0.26 s⁻¹, which is in close agreement with experimental findings. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also happen on VOSi bridging oxygen sites.

2. The catalysts considered in this study are supported vanadium oxides on silica, which are known for their activity in alkane transformations. The detailed mechanism provided serves as a solid foundation for future experimentation and modeling efforts.

1. 支持在硅胶上的钒氧化物被用作丙烷氧化脱氢的催化剂。它们由通过范德华替换硅氧烷基团的范德华氧化物物种组成。初始步骤涉及范德华氧原子的氢原子提取，导致一个二自由基中间体，在其中丙基自由基绑定到HOVIV位点。接下来是一个丙基反弹机制，产生连接到VIII(OSi)3表面位点的醇或醇，从而形成丙烯。另外，丙烯也可以直接通过从二自由基中间体的第二次氢原子提取获得。丙基的脱附导致气体相中丙基的稳定浓度，并留下减少的HOVIV位点在表面上。由于快速重新氧化，这些位点的浓度远小于OVV位点的浓度。丙烯形成后在OVV位点的读取速率远大于在HOVIV位点形成异丙基醇（或丙烯）的速率。在750 K时，预测的有效活化能为123±5 kJ/mol，速率常数约为0.26 s⁻¹，与实验结果相符。第一次氢原子提取仅发生在OVV位点上，而第二次氢原子提取也可能发生在VOSi桥接氧位点上。考虑的催化剂是支持在硅胶上的钒氧化物，它们以活性在烷烃转换中而闻名。提供的详细机制为未来实验和建模工作提供了坚实的基础。

1. The research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, supported on silica, are modeled using vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, forming a diradical intermediate with a propyl radical bonded to a HOVIV site. The second hydrogen abstraction can occur on either an OVV site or a VOSi bridging oxygen site. Fast reoxidation of the reduced HOVIV sites results in a smaller concentration compared to the OVV sites, affecting the reaction rates. Studies of V2O5(001) crystal surfaces suggest that bulk surface sites might be more active in propane dehydrogenation than monomer-supported sites. The proposed mechanism aligns with observed turnover frequencies and activation energies, differing from alternative hypotheses involving CH addition onto metal oxo bonds. The comparison of turnover frequencies and activation energies confirms the compatibility of the suggested mechanism with existing observations.

2. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a critical role in the efficiency of alkane transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation. Factors like the presence of specific active sites, such as vanadyl and bridging oxygen sites, influence the reaction pathways and rates. The structure of the catalyst, whether it is supported as monomers or part of a bulk surface, also impacts activity and selectivity. Reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, affect the stability of the active sites and the rates of reactions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to efficiently convert lower alkanes to alkenes and their potential for oxygenation reactions, making them valuable in various chemical processes. The detailed mechanism provides a solid foundation for future experimental analysis and microkinetic modeling, aiming to address selectivity issues in these processes.

1. 研究利用密度泛函理论探讨了丙烷氧化脱氢的可能机制。在硅胶上的单金属氧化物物种通过范德华替换的硅三氧硅酸盐进行建模。初始步骤涉及由范德华氧原子执行的氢抽象，形成包含丙基自由基和HOVIV(O)3的二自由基中间体。第二个氢抽象可以在OVV位点或VOSi桥接氧位点上发生。快速氧化还原HOVIV位点导致与再生（或未反应）OVV(O)3位点相比，后者浓度较小，影响反应速率。对V2O5(001)晶面的研究表明，如果它们是作为多面体而不是硅胶上的单体存在的，则晶面表面位点在丙烷脱氢化中的活性可能更高。所提出的机制与已知的周转频率和活化能相符合，而其他假设（例如，CH键添加到金属氧基团上）未得到计算支持。周转频率和活化能的比较证实了所建议机制与现有观察结果的一致性。

2. 金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件在烷烃转化过程中，尤其是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中起着关键作用。如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石等催化剂的特定活性位点（如范德华和桥接氧位点）影响反应路径和速率。催化剂的结构，无论是作为单体还是作为三维粒子的一部分，也影响活性和选择性。反应条件，如温度和压力，影响活性位点的稳定性以及反应速率。这些催化剂在工业上有重要意义，因为它们能够高效地将低级烷烃转化为烯烃，并且在氧气化反应中具有潜力，使其在各种化学过程中有价值。所提出的具体机制为未来实验分析和微观动力学建模提供了坚实的基础，旨在解决这些过程的选择性问题。

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides, play a crucial role in alkane transformations. In the case of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl group (OVV), leading to the formation of a diradical intermediate where a propyl radical binds to a HOVIV site. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction from this intermediate can yield propene directly or through the formation of an alkoxide or alcohol. The first hydrogen abstraction is rate-limiting, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy for the first hydrogen abstraction is approximately 123 kJ/mol, matching well with experimental findings.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持的钒氧化物，对烷烃转化具有关键作用。在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中，初始步骤是通过范德华（OVV）组进行氢原子抽取，导致在HOVIV位点上形成一个包含丙基自由基的二自由基中间体。随后从这个中间体的氢原子抽取可以直 接产生丙烯或通过醇的形成。首次氢原子抽取成为决定性步骤，有助于提高过程的整体效率。在750 K时，首次氢原子抽取的显着活化能约为123 kJ/mol，与实验结果相匹配。

[4] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

Comparisons with calculations for bulk V2O5 surfaces highlight that vanadia sites might be more active in propane oxidative dehydrogenation if they are part of the bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies might be lower for V2O5 crystallites on surfaces, as only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles. The oxidation part of the catalytic cycle, resulting in the formation of propene and H2O·VIII(d2), is endothermic for the surface species studied here, unlike with VO2+, which exhibits a strong exothermic characteristic. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies for propene formation have been observed to be around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K.

与晶格V2O5表面的计算比较表明，如果范德华物种是表面的组成部分而不是在硅氧烷上作为单体支持，则它们在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中可能更为活跃。然而，对于表面上的V2O5晶粒，表面物种的显着转换频率可能会更低，因为只有粒子内部的少量位点是可访问的。催化循环的氧化部分，即生成丙烯和H2O·VIII(d2)，对于这里研究的表面物种是吸热的，而VO2+则表现出强烈的放热特性。对于V2O5/SiO2催化剂，当范德华覆盖度低于3 V/nm2时，观察到的丙烯生成的显着转换频率约为748 K时的0.01 s-1和623 K时的0.3 × 10-3 s-1。
