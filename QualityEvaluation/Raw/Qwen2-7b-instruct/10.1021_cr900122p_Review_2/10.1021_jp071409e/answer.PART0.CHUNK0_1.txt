1. The study focuses on understanding the mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory, highlighting the importance of catalytic activation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds in various technological processes and enzymatic reactions.
2. The spin state of vanadium changes from singlet to triplet during the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
3. The rate-determining step in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is not the oxidation of the substrate itself, but rather the reoxidation of the catalyst.
4. Monomeric vanadium oxide species, specifically vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane, are utilized as models for the investigation.
5. The apparent activation energy for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is predicted to be 123 ± 5 kJ/mol at 750 K, closely matching experimental findings.
