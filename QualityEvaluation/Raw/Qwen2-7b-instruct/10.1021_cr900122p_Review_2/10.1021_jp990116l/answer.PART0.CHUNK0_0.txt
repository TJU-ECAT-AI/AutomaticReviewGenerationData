[1] "The density and the strength of acid sites (Brnsted and Lewis acid sites) in washed and calcined samples were measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, pyridine adsorption, and CD3CN adsorption."
[2] "When Ga, Zn, and Fe replace protons in HZSM-5, they form strong Lewis acid sites."
[3] "Pyridine adsorption results suggest that the ratio between Lewis and Brnsted sites increases in the following sequence: HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5 (see Table 2)."
[4] "The adsorption of CD3CN confirms also that the number of Lewis acid sites increases and that the strength of these Lewis sites increases in the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe."

1. The acidity of the samples was evaluated through the use of temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, pyridine adsorption, and CD3CN adsorption techniques.
2. The introduction of gallium, zinc, and iron into the HZSM-5 structure generates strong Lewis acid sites.
3. Analysis of pyridine adsorption data revealed an ascending trend in the ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acid sites when comparing HZSM-5 to Ga/ZSM-5, Fe/ZSM-5, and Zn/ZSM-5.
4. The number of Lewis acid sites increases with the order Al > Ga > Zn > Fe, and their strength also follows a similar sequence.

1. 温度程序脱氨、吡啶吸附和CD3CN吸附技术被用来评估样品的酸性。
2. 钙、锌和铁在HZSM-5中的引入产生了强Lewis酸位点。
3. 吡啶吸附结果表明，随着样品从HZSM-5到Ga/ZSM-5、Fe/ZSM-5和Zn/ZSM-5，Lewis酸位点与Brnsted酸位点的比例呈上升趋势。
4. 随着顺序为Al > Ga > Zn > Fe，Lewis酸位点的数量增加，并且其强度也遵循类似的序列。
