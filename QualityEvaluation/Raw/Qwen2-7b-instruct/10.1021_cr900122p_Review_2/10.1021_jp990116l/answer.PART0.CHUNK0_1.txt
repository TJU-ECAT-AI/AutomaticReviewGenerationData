[1] "Upon condensation of the vapor of a volatile precursor on the H-form of the zeolite, the concentration of Brnsted sites is lowered drastically and a high level of ion exchange is obtained."
[2] "Subsequent treatment with H2O to remove chlorine from the precursor induces hydrolysis of the metal ions. This process is strongly favored by a gain in Coulomb energy, it increases the Brnsted acid site density."
[3] "In the case of Ga/ZSM-5, some of these secondary Brnsted sites are particularly strong; the corresponding sites in Fe/ZSM-5 and Zn/ZSM-5 are weaker."
[4] "Also strong Lewis acid sites are formed by the introduction of Ga3+, Fe3+, or Zn2+."
[5] "Hydrolysis converts naked ions into oxo ions, such as (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+."
[6] "They are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO and, in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy."
[7] "In the case of Zn/ZSM-5, isolated Zn2+ cations compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron."

1. Metal-based catalysts are prepared by condensing a volatile precursor on the H-form of the zeolite, leading to a significant reduction in Brnsted sites and high ion exchange.
2. Removing chlorine from the precursor with water causes hydrolysis of metal ions, enhancing Brnsted acid site density through Coulomb energy gain.
3. Secondary Brnsted sites in Ga/ZSM-5 are stronger compared to Fe/ZSM-5 and Zn/ZSM-5.
4. Introduction of Ga3+, Fe3+, or Zn2+ forms strong Lewis acid sites.
5. Naked metal ions transform into oxo ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+ after hydrolysis.
6. Oxo ions are identified using temperature-programmed reduction techniques, with binuclear Fe3+ ions detected by ESR spectroscopy.
7. Zn/ZSM-5 contains isolated Zn2+ cations compensating for charges or attaching to specific zeolite structures.

1. 通过将挥发性前体凝结在沸石的H型上，金属基催化剂导致Brnsted位点浓度显著降低，并且实现了高离子交换。
2. 从前体中去除氯化物的水处理导致金属离子的水解，通过库仑能量增加提高了Brnsted酸位密度。
3. Ga/ZSM-5中的次级Brnsted位点比Fe/ZSM-5和Zn/ZSM-5更强大。
4. Ga3+、Fe3+或Zn2+的引入形成了强Lewis酸位点。
5. 离子水解将裸露的金属离子转化为如(GaO)+和(HOFeOFeOH)2+等氧化物离子。
6. Oxo离子通过热程序还原技术被识别，二核Fe3+离子通过ESR光谱学检测。
7. Zn/ZSM-5包含补偿电荷的孤立Zn2+离子，或者与特定的沸石结构结合。
