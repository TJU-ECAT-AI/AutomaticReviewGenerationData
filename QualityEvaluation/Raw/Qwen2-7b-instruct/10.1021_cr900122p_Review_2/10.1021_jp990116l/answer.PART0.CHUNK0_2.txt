1. Monovalent cations can easily be exchanged into a zeolite compared to divalent or trivalent cations. The sublimation method facilitates achieving a high level of cationic exchange for multivalent ions.
2. Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit two peaks centered around 400 C and at 700 C or 800 C.
3. In Ga/ZSM-5(14), the high-temperature peaks resemble those of HZSM-5, indicating the presence of Brnsted and/or Lewis acid sites.
4. The fraction of Brnsted acid sites that can be regenerated decreases in the sequence of Fe3+ salts.
5. In Ga/ZSM-5, some incorporation into the matrix occurs, akin to Fe/ZSM-5(33).
6. Some of the regenerated Brnsted sites in Ga/ZSM-5 are stronger than those in the original HZSM-5.
7. In Zn/ZSM-5, isolated Zn2+ cations balance the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron.

1. 一价阳离子比二价或三价阳离子更容易被交换到沸石中。升华方法有利于实现多价离子的高程度离子交换。
2. Fe/ZSM-5催化剂显示出两个峰值，分别位于约400 C和700 C或800 C。
3. 在Ga/ZSM-5(14)中，高温峰与HZSM-5相似，表明存在Brnsted和/或路易斯酸位点。
4. 可以再生的Brnsted酸位点的比例在Fe3+盐的序列中递减。
5. 在Ga/ZSM-5中，一些掺入到矩阵中，类似于Fe/ZSM-5(33)。
6. 部分再生的Brnsted位点在Ga/ZSM-5中比原始HZSM-5中的强。
7. 在Zn/ZSM-5中，孤立的Zn2+离子平衡了两个Al中心四面体的电荷，或者附着到一个硅醇基团、ZnOH和一个Al中心四面体上。
