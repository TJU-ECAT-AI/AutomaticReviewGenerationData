[1] "The objective is to design preparation methods yielding a high level of ion exchange for the synthesis of catalysts active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "It is therefore of importance to identify the iron species present in the cavities of HZSM-5."
[3] "The presence of Ga2O3 clusters highly dispersed in zeolite cavities, as shown by temperature-programmed reduction H2-TPR and CO-TPR (Figure 9)."
[4] "For Ga/ZSM-5, some incorporation into the matrix takes place, similar to the case of Fe/ZSM-5(33)."
[5] "The adsorption of pyridine results suggest that the ratio between Lewis and Brnsted sites increases in the following sequence: HZSM-5 < Ga/ZSM-5 < Fe/ZSM-5 < Zn/ZSM-5 (see Table 2)."
