1. The introduction of metals such as Zinc (Zn), Gallium (Ga), and Iron (Fe) into the HZSM-5 zeolite cavities through sublimation facilitates the identification of acid sites within the zeolite structure. The process is energetically favored due to a gain in Coulomb energy, which enhances the density of Brnsted acid sites. 

2. The introduction of these metals leads to the formation of strong Lewis acid sites, which are identified through various techniques such as pyridine adsorption and adsorption of acetonitrile. 

3. The presence of these metals also causes a measurable perturbation in the tetrahedral oxygen-to-tetrahedral (TOT) vibrations of the zeolite framework. This perturbation can be attributed to the formation of specific cationic structures such as (GaO)+, (HOFeOFeOH)2+, and small neutral clusters of Ga2O3 and Fe2O3.

4. In the case of Zn/ZSM-5, the Zn ions are present as isolated Zn2+ cations that compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. This stabilization prevents reduction of Zn ions below 800 C, maintaining their Lewis acid character.

5. The density and strength of acid sites, both Brnsted and Lewis types, can be quantified using techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, pyridine adsorption, and adsorption of acetonitrile. This helps in understanding the catalytic potential of the modified zeolite samples.

1. 将锌（Zn）、镓（Ga）和铁（Fe）通过升华引入HZSM-5分子筛笼中，能够识别出分子筛中的酸性位点。这一过程在库仑能增加的情况下得到强化，从而增加了Brnsted酸位点的密度。

2. 这些金属的存在导致形成强Lewis酸位点，这些位点可以通过吡啶吸附和乙腈吸附等技术进行识别。

3. 这些金属的引入还会引起分子筛框架中四面体氧到四面体（TOT）振动的可测量扰动。这种扰动可以归因于特定离子结构的形成，如（GaO）+、（HOFeOFeOH）2+ 和小的Ga2O3和Fe2O3簇。

4. 在Zn/ZSM-5的情况下，Zn离子以孤立的Zn2+离子的形式存在，它们补偿两个Al中心四面体的电荷或附着到一个硅醇基团或ZnOH和一个Al中心四面体上。这种稳定化阻止Zn离子在低于800°C时被还原，保持其Lewis酸特性。

5. 利用氨温度程序脱附、吡啶吸附和乙腈吸附等技术可以量化酸位点的密度和强度，无论是Brnsted还是Lewis类型。这有助于理解修改后分子筛样品的催化潜力。
