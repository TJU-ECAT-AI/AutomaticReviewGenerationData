1. "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
2. "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
3. "The optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
4. "Metal-Exchanged Zeolites Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
5. "Dehydrogenation of Alkanes on Ga-Zeolites: (a) Ga+ Active Sites, (b) GaO+ Active Sites, and (c) Ga2O2 Active Sites"
6. "In all cases, the active sites probably result from charge-compensation of framework aluminum by mononuclear Ga ([Ga+], (180, 181) [Ga(O)+] (180, 182-184)) or dinuclear species [Ga2O22+] (Figure 1). (185-187)"
7. "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
8. "It is therefore possible that CH bond activation on MoCx species leads to the growth of an alkyl chain and the formation of alkenes, similarly to what is observed in the nonoxidative coupling of methane on silica supported tantalum hydrides (vide infra, section)."
9. "From these studies, it is clear that metalalkyl surface complexes are key reaction intermediates in the dehydrogenation"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Supported vanadium oxides exhibit unique activity due to the involvement of isolated VO species, which contrasts with other systems based on molybdenum or tungsten oxides.
2. Silica is considered the optimal support for achieving high selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
3. The optimal operating temperature for these processes is narrowly defined, with temperatures around 500°C being critical to prevent combustion and maintain selectivity.
4. Metal-exchanged zeolites, such as Ga- and Zn-zeolites, are capable of transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, highlighting their importance in alkane conversion.
5. Ga+ species are identified as active sites for dehydrogenation on Ga-zeolites, facilitating the activation of alkane CH bonds and the formation of Gaalkyl intermediates.
6. Dinuclear Ga species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, offering advantages over mononuclear species in terms of reaction kinetics and product selectivity.
7. On Zn-zeolites, alkane activation also occurs through CH bond activation, leading to the formation of metalalkyl intermediates that play crucial roles in the catalytic process.
8. CH bond activation on Mo-containing species can lead to alkyl chain growth and alkene formation, similar to non-oxidative methane coupling on silica-supported tantalum hydrides.
9. Metalalkyl surface complexes are recognized as key intermediates in alkane dehydrogenation, indicating their central role in the transformation mechanisms.

These insights into the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts highlight their ability to efficiently facilitate alkane transformations, making them valuable tools in industrial applications.
