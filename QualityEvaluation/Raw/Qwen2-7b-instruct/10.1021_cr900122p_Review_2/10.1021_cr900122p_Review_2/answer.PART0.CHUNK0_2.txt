[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[2] "In the specific case of the conversion of ethane into ethene, it is even competitive with steam cracking."
[3] "Such processes are particularly important for alkenes having allylic CH bonds, e.g. propene and higher alkenes, which are more readily activated."
[4] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane are promising processes."
[6] "This is directly related to the easier CH bond activation of propene, the product, which is associated with a lower activation energy than the CH bond activation of propane, the reactant."
[7] "M-zeolites have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."
[8] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."
[9] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, (189, 190) and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."
[10] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, methyl species are probably key intermediates."
[11] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes on Ga-Zeolites: (a) Ga+ Active Sites, (b) GaO+ Active Sites, and (c) Ga2O2 Active Sites."
[12] "From these studies, it is clear that metalalkyl surface complexes are key reaction intermediates in the dehydrogenation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The active sites in these catalysts often involve isolated metal species, such as VO, Ga, and Zn, which facilitate the activation of allylic CH bonds in alkenes. The use of silica as a support enhances selectivity in these transformations. For instance, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is competitive with steam cracking, and the ease of CH bond activation varies depending on the alkene structure. Metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly those containing Ga or Zn, exhibit multifunctionality, activating H2 and alkane molecules, forming aromatics from alkanes, and coaromatizing methane and alkane. The key steps in these transformations often involve the formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which are crucial reaction intermediates. The reactivity patterns of Ga- and Zn-zeolites are similar, involving H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, and formation of aromatics. The use of these catalysts in industrial processes is significant due to their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics under optimized conditions.

金属催化剂，包括支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，在烷烃转化过程中，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中，对机制和效率有显著影响。这些催化剂中的活性位点通常涉及VO、Ga和Zn等孤立的金属物种，这有助于激活烯烃中的亚甲基CH键。使用硅作为支持物可以提高这些转化的选择性。例如，乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢与蒸汽裂解竞争，而烷基CH键的激活取决于烷烃的结构。金属交换沸石，特别是那些包含Ga或Zn的沸石，表现出多功能性，激活H2和烷烃分子，从烷烃形成芳香族化合物，并协同化合成甲烷和烷烃。这些转换过程的关键步骤往往涉及形成金属烷基中间体，这是关键的反应中间体。Ga-和Zn-沸石的反应模式相似，涉及H2和烷烃的激活、H/D交换和形成芳香族化合物。由于这些催化剂能够在优化条件下有效地将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳香族化合物，因此在工业过程中具有重要意义。
