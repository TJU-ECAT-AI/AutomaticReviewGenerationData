[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."
[2] "In the specific case of the conversion of ethane into ethene, it is even competitive with steam cracking."
[3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."
[4] "The optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."
[5] "This is directly related to the easier CH bond activation of propene, the product, which is associated with a lower activation energy than the CH bond activation of propane, the reactant."
[6] "While all these transformations are still subject to many mechanistic debates and detailed investigations, Malkyl species are probably key intermediates."
[7] "Ga-zeolites are also known to activate H2 (178, 179) and alkanes and to catalyze H/D exchange reactions."
[8] "Alkane activation (including methane) also occurs via CH bond activation and formation of metalalkyl intermediates, which have been experimentally observed on different Zn-zeolites."
[9] "Of several studies on the H/D exchange reaction of D2/alkane mixtures on various Zn-zeolites, (20, 200-202) a recent comparative study of H- and Zn-zeolite (zeolite = BEA) shows that Zn-BEA displays a much lower activation energy and higher rates (ca. 2 orders of magnitude) than the corresponding H-zeolite, (201) which clearly shows that the reaction mechanisms are different for the two systems, i.e. carbonium ion for H-BEA vs metalalkyl intermediates for Zn-BEA."
[10] "From these studies, it is clear that metalalkyl surface complexes are key reaction intermediates in the dehydrogenation"

Industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations depends on their composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Supported vanadium oxides, for example, are significant due to their active isolated VO species, making them competitive alternatives to systems using molybdenum or tungsten oxides. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is facilitated by these catalysts, especially when the process is optimized for temperatures around 500°C, where the activation energy of propene is lower compared to propane. 

Metal-exchanged zeolites are another class of catalysts that play a crucial role in transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. These catalysts can activate hydrogen and alkanes, catalyze hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions, and convert methane into aromatics. Zeolites with gallium (Ga-zeolites) and zinc (Zn-zeolites) are particularly noteworthy due to their ability to form metalalkyl intermediates during the dehydrogenation process. Ga-zeolites and Zn-zeolites exhibit different reaction mechanisms, with Ga-zeolites favoring metalalkyl intermediates and Zn-zeolites favoring carbonium ions.

Stoichiometric and catalytic processes involving CH bond activation on oxide surfaces yield well-defined organometallic complexes, which are essential in the transformation of alkanes. These complexes, such as those formed on silica-supported metal hydrides, enable the formation of metal alkyl complexes and hydrogen release, demonstrating the importance of structure and composition in achieving high selectivities and efficiency in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性取决于其组成、结构和反应条件。例如，支持的钒氧化物因其活性孤立的VO物种而特别突出，这使得它们成为与钼氧化物或钨氧化物系统相比的竞争性替代品。乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢过程得益于这些催化剂，特别是在约500°C的优化温度范围内，丙烯的活化能低于丙烷，这是由于丙烯的活化能较低。

金属交换沸石在将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃方面起着关键作用。这些催化剂能够激活氢气和烷烃，并催化氢/氘交换反应，将甲烷转化为芳香族化合物。含有镓（Ga-沸石）和锌（Zn-沸石）的沸石特别值得注意，因为它们能够形成金属烷基中间体以进行脱氢过程。Ga-沸石和Zn-沸石表现出不同的反应机制，Ga-沸石倾向于选择金属烷基中间体，而Zn-沸石倾向于碳离子。

在氧化物表面上进行的定量和催化剂过程通过形成吸附在氧化物上的金属有机复合物来实现CH键活化，这对于烷烃的转化至关重要。例如，在硅酸盐支持的金属氢化物上形成的复合物能够形成金属烷基复合物并释放氢气，这表明结构和组成对于实现高选择性和效率的烷烃转化的重要性。
