1. Supported vanadium oxides are noted for their potential in alkane transformations due to their active sites being isolated VO species, compared to other systems based on MoOx or WOx. Ethane-to-ethene conversion using these catalysts competes with steam cracking. High selectivity is achieved with small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces. Silica is considered the optimal support material for these processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is highlighted as a promising area. Metal-exchanged zeolites, especially those with Ga and Zn, can transform alkanes into aromatics and are involved in hydrogen activation and hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions. Zeolites containing Ga and Zn exhibit distinct reactivity patterns and mechanisms compared to hydrogen-zeolites. Metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites selectively oxidize benzene into phenol through nitrogen dioxide (N2O).

2. Factors contributing to the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts include their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into valuable products like ethene, aromatics, and methanol/formaldehyde. Their selective activation of hydrogen and alkane molecules, along with their involvement in direct oxidation reactions, makes them crucial for petrochemical industries. The optimized reaction conditions and structure of these catalysts enable efficient and environmentally friendly processes, enhancing the economic viability of industries relying on hydrocarbon processing.
