The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, supported vanadium oxides are noted for their ability to convert ethane into ethene efficiently, making them competitive with steam cracking. These catalysts often feature isolated vanadium species as active sites, differing from those based on molybdenum or tungsten oxides. The ease of activation of allylic CH bonds in alkenes, such as propene, indicates the importance of the catalyst's structure in determining the reaction pathway. Silica is found to be the optimal support due to its selectivity, especially for propene, which has a lower activation energy compared to propane. Metal-exchanged zeolites demonstrate versatility in transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, with malkyl species playing crucial roles in these reactions. Gallium- and zinc-zeolites show enhanced reactivity in alkane activation and H/D exchange reactions, highlighting the role of metal sites in these processes. The comparison of H- and zinc-zeolites reveals that zinc-zeolites exhibit significantly lower activation energies and higher rates in H/D exchange reactions, indicating differences in reaction mechanisms. Metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly those containing molybdenum, catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene with high selectivity, suggesting the involvement of metal alkyl surface complexes as key intermediates. These findings underscore the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, driven by their ability to optimize reaction pathways and achieve desired product distributions.
