1. Supported vanadium oxides are noted for their potential in alkane transformations due to their active sites being isolated VO species, compared to other systems based on MoOx or WOx. Ethane-to-ethene conversion using these catalysts competes with steam cracking. High selectivity is achieved with small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces. Silica is considered the optimal support material for these processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is highlighted as a promising area. Metal-exchanged zeolites, especially those with Ga and Zn, can transform alkanes into aromatics and are involved in hydrogen activation and hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions. Zeolites containing Ga and Zn exhibit distinct reactivity patterns and mechanisms compared to hydrogen-zeolites. Metal-exchanged zeolites containing MoOx and WOx catalyze the direct oxidation of methane into methanol/formaldehyde. Fe-zeolites selectively oxidize benzene into phenol through nitrogen dioxide (N2O).

2. Factors contributing to the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts include their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into valuable products like ethene, aromatics, and methanol/formaldehyde. Their selective activation of hydrogen and alkane molecules, along with their involvement in direct oxidation reactions, makes them crucial for petrochemical industries. The optimized reaction conditions and structure of these catalysts enable efficient and environmentally friendly processes, enhancing the economic viability of industries relying on hydrocarbon processing.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, supported vanadium oxides are noted for their ability to convert ethane into ethene efficiently, making them competitive with steam cracking. These catalysts often feature isolated vanadium species as active sites, differing from those based on molybdenum or tungsten oxides. The ease of activation of allylic CH bonds in alkenes, such as propene, indicates the importance of the catalyst's structure in determining the reaction pathway. Silica is found to be the optimal support due to its selectivity, especially for propene, which has a lower activation energy compared to propane. Metal-exchanged zeolites demonstrate versatility in transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics, with malkyl species playing crucial roles in these reactions. Gallium- and zinc-zeolites show enhanced reactivity in alkane activation and H/D exchange reactions, highlighting the role of metal sites in these processes. The comparison of H- and zinc-zeolites reveals that zinc-zeolites exhibit significantly lower activation energies and higher rates in H/D exchange reactions, indicating differences in reaction mechanisms. Metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly those containing molybdenum, catalyze the direct conversion of methane into benzene with high selectivity, suggesting the involvement of metal alkyl surface complexes as key intermediates. These findings underscore the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, driven by their ability to optimize reaction pathways and achieve desired product distributions.

Industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations depends on their composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Supported vanadium oxides, for example, are significant due to their active isolated VO species, making them competitive alternatives to systems using molybdenum or tungsten oxides. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane is facilitated by these catalysts, especially when the process is optimized for temperatures around 500°C, where the activation energy of propene is lower compared to propane. 

Metal-exchanged zeolites are another class of catalysts that play a crucial role in transforming alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. These catalysts can activate hydrogen and alkanes, catalyze hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions, and convert methane into aromatics. Zeolites with gallium (Ga-zeolites) and zinc (Zn-zeolites) are particularly noteworthy due to their ability to form metalalkyl intermediates during the dehydrogenation process. Ga-zeolites and Zn-zeolites exhibit different reaction mechanisms, with Ga-zeolites favoring metalalkyl intermediates and Zn-zeolites favoring carbonium ions.

Stoichiometric and catalytic processes involving CH bond activation on oxide surfaces yield well-defined organometallic complexes, which are essential in the transformation of alkanes. These complexes, such as those formed on silica-supported metal hydrides, enable the formation of metal alkyl complexes and hydrogen release, demonstrating the importance of structure and composition in achieving high selectivities and efficiency in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性取决于其组成、结构和反应条件。例如，支持的钒氧化物因其活性孤立的VO物种而特别突出，这使得它们成为与钼氧化物或钨氧化物系统相比的竞争性替代品。乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢过程得益于这些催化剂，特别是在约500°C的优化温度范围内，丙烯的活化能低于丙烷，这是由于丙烯的活化能较低。

金属交换沸石在将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃方面起着关键作用。这些催化剂能够激活氢气和烷烃，并催化氢/氘交换反应，将甲烷转化为芳香族化合物。含有镓（Ga-沸石）和锌（Zn-沸石）的沸石特别值得注意，因为它们能够形成金属烷基中间体以进行脱氢过程。Ga-沸石和Zn-沸石表现出不同的反应机制，Ga-沸石倾向于选择金属烷基中间体，而Zn-沸石倾向于碳离子。

在氧化物表面上进行的定量和催化剂过程通过形成吸附在氧化物上的金属有机复合物来实现CH键活化，这对于烷烃的转化至关重要。例如，在硅酸盐支持的金属氢化物上形成的复合物能够形成金属烷基复合物并释放氢气，这表明结构和组成对于实现高选择性和效率的烷烃转化的重要性。
