[Methane aromatization was performed in a glass, closed batch microreactor (0.2cm3; sealed glass insert for 7mm zirconia NMR rotors) with coadsorbed 13CH4 and propane (1:1) at 573873K. The Zn/H-BEA zeolite (Si/Al=18, 7.2wt% Zn) sample (ca.80mg) was activated at 673K for 20h under a vacuum, with the residual pressure less than 102Pa. Detailed characteristics of the zeolite used are provided in Ref.9. 300μmolg1 of each alkane was coadsorbed on the zeolite sample under vacuum and then the reactor sealed. After reaction at 573873K, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature for insitu NMR analysis. 13CNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer under magic spinning and with cross-polarization (CP/MAS). Identical conditions (CP parameters, rotation speeds, and number of scans) were used to enable comparison of the spectra in each series of experiments. The products were further extracted from the zeolite sample with diethyl ether and analyzed by GC-MS on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph and Varian Saturn-2000 mass spectrometer.]

The methane aromatization experiment involved using a glass, closed batch microreactor with a sealed glass insert for 7mm zirconia NMR rotors. The reactor contained a coadsorbed mixture of 13CH4 and propane at a 1:1 ratio at temperatures ranging from 573 to 873 K. A Zn/H-BEA zeolite sample with a Si/Al ratio of 18 and 7.2 wt% Zn was activated at 673 K for 20 hours under vacuum with a residual pressure below 102 Pa. Each alkane was coadsorbed onto the zeolite sample under vacuum conditions, and the reactor was sealed before the reaction. After the reaction at the specified temperatures, the reactor was cooled to room temperature for in situ NMR analysis. 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer with magic spinning and cross-polarization (CP/MAS). Identical conditions were used for CP parameters, rotation speeds, and number of scans across all experimental series. The products were extracted from the zeolite sample using diethyl ether and analyzed by GC-MS on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph and Varian Saturn-2000 mass spectrometer.

进行甲烷芳构化实验时，使用了带有7mm氧化锆NMR旋转器的封闭玻璃批处理微反应器。反应器中包含13CH4和丙烷以1:1的比例共吸附，在573至873 K的温度下。含Si/Al比为18且Zn含量为7.2 wt%的Zn/H-BEA沸石样品在673 K下真空激活20小时，残余压力低于102 Pa。每个烷烃在真空条件下被共吸附到沸石样品上，然后密封反应器。在指定温度下反应后，将反应器冷却至室温进行原位NMR分析。使用布鲁克Avance 400光谱仪记录了13C NMR谱，该仪器具有魔法旋转和交叉极化（CP/MAS）。所有实验系列均使用相同的CP参数、旋转速度和扫描次数。产物通过使用二乙醚从沸石样品中提取，并通过Varian CP-3800气相色谱仪和Varian Saturn-2000质谱仪进行了GC-MS分析。
