[1] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a)."
[2] "At higher reaction temperatures, acetic acid (δ=22ppm for CH3 and δ=186ppm for COOH11) is formed as the result of the further oxidation of acetaldehyde (Figure3b)."
[3] "In contrast to neat methane, the methoxy species (δ=58ppm, Figure4a) represents the only intermediate formed at 523K from 13CH4 in the presence of benzene."
[4] "At 573K, the surface methoxy species converts quantitatively into the methyl group of methylbenzenes (δ=20ppm, Figure4b)."
[5] "At 823K, both a broadening of the signal at δ=130ppm and a decrease in the intensity of the signal corresponding to the methyl groups occur, which points to a transfer of the 13C-label from the methyl groups to the aromatic ring of the methylbenzenes, which exhibit a variety of chemical shifts (from δ=125 to 135ppm,7 Figure4c)."

The activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species, which acts as a stabilized methyl cation (δ=58ppm). As the reaction temperature increases, acetic acid is formed from acetaldehyde (δ=22ppm for CH3 and δ=186ppm for COOH). When 13CH4 is present in the presence of benzene, only a methoxy species is formed at 523K. At 573K, this methoxy species converts into the methyl group of methylbenzenes (δ=20ppm). At 823K, the 13C-label is transferred from the methyl groups to the aromatic ring of the methylbenzenes, resulting in various chemical shifts (from δ=125 to 135ppm).

在Zn/H-BEA上，甲烷的活化发生在523K，通过表面甲氧基物种的形成（δ=58ppm），这是一种稳定的甲基离子。随着反应温度的升高，从乙醛酸形成乙酸（δ=22ppm对于CH3和δ=186ppm对于COOH）。当13CH4与苯共存时，在523K仅形成甲氧基物种。在573K时，该甲氧基物种转化为甲基苯的甲基（δ=20ppm）。在823K时，13C标签从甲基组转移到甲基苯的芳香环上，导致各种化学位移（从δ=125到135ppm）。

[Methane aromatization was performed in a glass, closed batch microreactor (0.2cm3; sealed glass insert for 7mm zirconia NMR rotors) with coadsorbed 13CH4 and propane (1:1) at 573873K. The Zn/H-BEA zeolite (Si/Al=18, 7.2wt% Zn) sample (ca.80mg) was activated at 673K for 20h under a vacuum, with the residual pressure less than 102Pa. Detailed characteristics of the zeolite used are provided in Ref.9. 300μmolg1 of each alkane was coadsorbed on the zeolite sample under vacuum and then the reactor sealed. After reaction at 573873K, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature for insitu NMR analysis. 13CNMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer under magic spinning and with cross-polarization (CP/MAS). Identical conditions (CP parameters, rotation speeds, and number of scans) were used to enable comparison of the spectra in each series of experiments. The products were further extracted from the zeolite sample with diethyl ether and analyzed by GC-MS on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph and Varian Saturn-2000 mass spectrometer.]

The methane aromatization experiment involved using a glass, closed batch microreactor with a sealed glass insert for 7mm zirconia NMR rotors. The reactor contained a coadsorbed mixture of 13CH4 and propane at a 1:1 ratio at temperatures ranging from 573 to 873 K. A Zn/H-BEA zeolite sample with a Si/Al ratio of 18 and 7.2 wt% Zn was activated at 673 K for 20 hours under vacuum with a residual pressure below 102 Pa. Each alkane was coadsorbed onto the zeolite sample under vacuum conditions, and the reactor was sealed before the reaction. After the reaction at the specified temperatures, the reactor was cooled to room temperature for in situ NMR analysis. 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer with magic spinning and cross-polarization (CP/MAS). Identical conditions were used for CP parameters, rotation speeds, and number of scans across all experimental series. The products were extracted from the zeolite sample using diethyl ether and analyzed by GC-MS on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph and Varian Saturn-2000 mass spectrometer.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in the context of methane aromatization on a Zn-modified high-silica zeolite, the activation of methane occurs through the formation of a surface methoxy species, a stabilized methyl cation. As reaction temperatures increase, the products include acetic acid, demonstrating the catalytic role of the zeolite in alkane transformation. Furthermore, the embedding of 13C atoms from methane into aromatic rings is attributed to a secondary process involving intramolecular scrambling of the 13C label through a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism. These findings highlight the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in optimizing alkane transformations for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，在烷烃转化机制和效率方面起着决定性作用。例如，在Zn改性的高硅沸石中进行甲烷芳香化时，甲烷的活化通过形成表面甲氧基物种，即稳定的甲基离子来实现。随着反应温度的升高，产物包括乙酸，这表明沸石在烷烃转化中的催化作用。此外，从甲烷中嵌入13C原子到芳环的过程归因于通过环扩张/收缩机制介导的13C标签的分子内重组过程。这些发现强调了催化剂组成、结构和反应条件在优化烷烃转化以适应工业应用的重要性。

[4] "At 823K, which is used for the co-conversion of propane and methane, the only 13C-labeled product observed is carbon dioxide (δ=127ppm), which is formed by decarboxylation of acetic acid."
[5] "Thus, the main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the presence of metal sites within the zeolite framework facilitates the activation of methane, leading to its conversion into more commercially useful chemicals and liquid fuels. The formation of a stabilized methyl cation upon activation enables the subsequent alkylation of aromatic compounds derived from higher alkanes, resulting in the production of valuable aromatic products. Moreover, the ring-expansion/contraction mechanism is crucial for the efficient embedding of 13C-labeled atoms from methane into the aromatic rings of methyl-substituted benzene derivatives, contributing to the high level of methane involvement in the aromatization process.
