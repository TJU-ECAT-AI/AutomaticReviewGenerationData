[1] "The activation of methane on Zn-containing zeolites was earlier presumed2,4 to proceed with the formation of a methyl cation by transfer of a hydride ion from the methane molecule, which was preactivated on the metal oxide species, to the carbenium ion formed from higher hydrocarbons."
[2] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a)."
[3] "At higher reaction temperatures, acetic acid (δ=22ppm for CH3 and δ=186ppm for COOH11) is formed as the result of the further oxidation of acetaldehyde (Figure3b)."
[4] "The embedding of the 13C atoms from methane into the aromatic ring is a result of a secondary process of intramolecular scrambling of the 13C label in methylbenzenes by a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism.13"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, in the context of methane aromatization on a Zn-modified high-silica zeolite, the activation of methane occurs through the formation of a surface methoxy species, a stabilized methyl cation. As reaction temperatures increase, the products include acetic acid, demonstrating the catalytic role of the zeolite in alkane transformation. Furthermore, the embedding of 13C atoms from methane into aromatic rings is attributed to a secondary process involving intramolecular scrambling of the 13C label through a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism. These findings highlight the importance of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in optimizing alkane transformations for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，在烷烃转化机制和效率方面起着决定性作用。例如，在Zn改性的高硅沸石中进行甲烷芳香化时，甲烷的活化通过形成表面甲氧基物种，即稳定的甲基离子来实现。随着反应温度的升高，产物包括乙酸，这表明沸石在烷烃转化中的催化作用。此外，从甲烷中嵌入13C原子到芳环的过程归因于通过环扩张/收缩机制介导的13C标签的分子内重组过程。这些发现强调了催化剂组成、结构和反应条件在优化烷烃转化以适应工业应用的重要性。
