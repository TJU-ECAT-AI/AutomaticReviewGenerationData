[1] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a)."
[2] "At higher reaction temperatures, acetic acid (δ=22ppm for CH3 and δ=186ppm for COOH11) is formed as the result of the further oxidation of acetaldehyde (Figure3b)."
[3] "In contrast to neat methane, the methoxy species (δ=58ppm, Figure4a) represents the only intermediate formed at 523K from 13CH4 in the presence of benzene."
[4] "At 573K, the surface methoxy species converts quantitatively into the methyl group of methylbenzenes (δ=20ppm, Figure4b)."
[5] "At 823K, both a broadening of the signal at δ=130ppm and a decrease in the intensity of the signal corresponding to the methyl groups occur, which points to a transfer of the 13C-label from the methyl groups to the aromatic ring of the methylbenzenes, which exhibit a variety of chemical shifts (from δ=125 to 135ppm,7 Figure4c)."

The activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species, which acts as a stabilized methyl cation (δ=58ppm). As the reaction temperature increases, acetic acid is formed from acetaldehyde (δ=22ppm for CH3 and δ=186ppm for COOH). When 13CH4 is present in the presence of benzene, only a methoxy species is formed at 523K. At 573K, this methoxy species converts into the methyl group of methylbenzenes (δ=20ppm). At 823K, the 13C-label is transferred from the methyl groups to the aromatic ring of the methylbenzenes, resulting in various chemical shifts (from δ=125 to 135ppm).

在Zn/H-BEA上，甲烷的活化发生在523K，通过表面甲氧基物种的形成（δ=58ppm），这是一种稳定的甲基离子。随着反应温度的升高，从乙醛酸形成乙酸（δ=22ppm对于CH3和δ=186ppm对于COOH）。当13CH4与苯共存时，在523K仅形成甲氧基物种。在573K时，该甲氧基物种转化为甲基苯的甲基（δ=20ppm）。在823K时，13C标签从甲基组转移到甲基苯的芳香环上，导致各种化学位移（从δ=125到135ppm）。
