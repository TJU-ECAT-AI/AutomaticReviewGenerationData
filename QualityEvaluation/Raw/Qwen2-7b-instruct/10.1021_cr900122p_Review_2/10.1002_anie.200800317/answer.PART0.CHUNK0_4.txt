[1] "The activation of methane on Zn-containing zeolites was earlier presumed to proceed with the formation of a methyl cation by transfer of a hydride ion from the methane molecule, which was preactivated on the metal oxide species, to the carbenium ion formed from higher hydrocarbons."
[2] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a)."
[3] "In the absence of a co-reactant, the methoxy group is further partially oxidized at 523K into the surface formate Zn-O-CHO (δ=173ppm)."
[4] "At 823K, which is used for the co-conversion of propane and methane, the only 13C-labeled product observed is carbon dioxide (δ=127ppm), which is formed by decarboxylation of acetic acid."
[5] "Thus, the main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4."
[6] "The embedding of the 13C atoms from methane into the aromatic ring is a result of a secondary process of intramolecular scrambling of the 13C label in methylbenzenes by a ring-expansion/contraction mechanism."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the presence of metal sites within the zeolite framework facilitates the activation of methane, leading to its conversion into more commercially useful chemicals and liquid fuels. The formation of a stabilized methyl cation upon activation enables the subsequent alkylation of aromatic compounds derived from higher alkanes, resulting in the production of valuable aromatic products. Moreover, the ring-expansion/contraction mechanism is crucial for the efficient embedding of 13C-labeled atoms from methane into the aromatic rings of methyl-substituted benzene derivatives, contributing to the high level of methane involvement in the aromatization process.
