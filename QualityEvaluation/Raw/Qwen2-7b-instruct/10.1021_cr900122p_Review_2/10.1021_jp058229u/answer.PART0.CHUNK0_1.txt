[1] "On the basis of evidence from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy, the Mo atoms in this catalyst are present as isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single MoO bond."
[2] "During CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde, the catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction and typically only 50500 ppm of MoVI is reduced to MoIV."
[3] "It was established that treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K under pure methane reduces the dispersed molybdate species to only a limited extent and results mainly in the deposition of amorphous carbon."
[4] "The addition of low concentrations of H2O to the feed enhances the rate of methane oxidation, and this phenomenon is ascribed to an enhancement in the concentration of surface hydroxide groups on the catalyst surface (see Scheme 2)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Mo atoms in the catalyst are isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species with a single MoO bond.
2. During the conversion of methane to formaldehyde, the catalyst experiences minimal reduction, with only 50 to 500 ppm of MoVI being reduced to MoIV.
3. Treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K with pure methane leads to limited reduction of the dispersed molybdate species, primarily forming amorphous carbon.
4. Adding small quantities of water to the feed increases the rate of methane oxidation, attributed to an increase in the concentration of surface hydroxide groups on the catalyst surface.

1. 催化剂中的Mo原子是以孤立的五配位钼酸盐物种形式存在，包含一个MoO键。
2. 在将甲烷转化为甲醛的过程中，催化剂经历轻微的还原，只有50到500 ppm的MoVI被还原为MoIV。
3. 将MoOx/SiO2在873 K下用纯甲烷处理会导致分散的钼酸盐物种有限的还原，主要形成无定形碳。
4. 向反应物中添加少量水可以增加甲烷氧化速率，归因于催化剂表面氢氧基团浓度的增加。
