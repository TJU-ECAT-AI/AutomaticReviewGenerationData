The study aimed to elucidate the fundamental redox reactions involved in the production of formaldehyde on MoOx/SiO2 catalysts. The treatment of MoOx/SiO2 under pure methane conditions leads to minimal reduction of the dispersed molybdate species, predominantly causing the formation of amorphous carbon. The catalyst experiences a minor degree of reduction during the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, with only 50-500 ppm of MoVI being reduced to MoIV. Oxygen atoms are extensively exchanged between the gas phase and the catalyst during CH4 oxidation with 18O2. Low concentrations of water enhance the catalyst's activity for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde. A theoretical mechanism for methane oxidation over MoOx/SiO2 was developed based on the findings and compared to earlier studies.

这项研究旨在阐明在MoOx/SiO2催化剂上形成甲醛的基元还原反应过程。在纯甲烷条件下处理MoOx/SiO2会导致分散钼酸盐物种的微弱还原，主要形成无定形碳。在甲烷氧化为甲醛的过程中，催化剂经历轻微的还原，只有50-500 ppm的MoVI被还原为MoIV。氧气原子在使用18O2进行CH4氧化时在气相和催化剂之间进行了广泛的交换。低浓度的水可以增强MoOx/SiO2催化剂对CH4氧化生成甲醛的活性。根据发现结果开发了一种甲烷氧化MoOx/SiO2的理论机制，并与先前的研究进行了比较。
