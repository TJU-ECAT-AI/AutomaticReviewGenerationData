[1] "The present investigation was undertaken to understand the elementary redox processes involved in the formation of formaldehyde over such species."
[2] "It was established that treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K under pure methane reduces the dispersed molybdate species to only a limited extent and results mainly in the deposition of amorphous carbon."
[3] "During CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde, the catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction and typically only 50500 ppm of MoVI is reduced to MoIV."
[4] "Additional experiments revealed that H2O formed in the reaction is the principal species responsible for the exchange of O atoms between the gas phase and the SiO2 support."
[5] "A mechanism for the oxidation of CH4 over MoOx/SiO2 was formulated in light of the observations made here and is discussed in the light of previous studies."
[6] "While highly dispersed MoOx and VOx supported on SiO2 are known to be active for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, the highest single-pass yields of formaldehyde are typically on the order of 25%."
[7] "The addition of low concentrations of H2O to the feed enhances the rate of methane oxidation, and this phenomenon is ascribed to an enhancement in the concentration of surface hydroxide groups on the catalyst surface (see Scheme 2)."

1. The study aimed to elucidate the redox processes involved in the formation of formaldehyde over MoOx/SiO2 catalysts.
2. Treatment of MoOx/SiO2 under methane at 873 K resulted in limited reduction of the dispersed molybdate species, mostly forming amorphous carbon.
3. During the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, the catalyst experienced minimal reduction, with only 50-500 ppm of MoVI being reduced to MoIV.
4. Hydrogen peroxide, generated during the reaction, played a key role in exchanging oxygen atoms between the gas phase and the SiO2 support.
5. A mechanism for the methane oxidation over MoOx/SiO2 catalysts was developed based on the findings of the study and previous research.
6. Although MoOx and VOx supported on SiO2 are active for methane oxidation, achieving high yields typically requires multi-step processes.
7. Adding small amounts of water to the feed increased the methane oxidation rate, attributed to enhanced surface hydroxide concentration on the catalyst.
