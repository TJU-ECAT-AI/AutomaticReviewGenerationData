The study examines the oxidation of methane over a molybdenum oxide supported on silica catalyst. The catalyst is characterized as consisting of isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single terminal oxo (MoO) function. The molybdenum atoms are not significantly reduced by methane or carbon monoxide at 873 K. However, hydrogen is effective in reducing the molybdenum to molybdenum IV. During the oxidation of methane, only 50 to 500 ppm of the molybdenum VI is reduced. It is proposed that peroxide species are formed by the reaction of oxygen with the reduced molybdate species on the catalyst surface. Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the reaction of the molybdenum peroxide species with methane, leading to the formation of formaldehyde and water. The addition of hydrogen to the feed enhances the rate of methane oxidation, as it increases the concentration of surface hydroxide groups on the catalyst surface.

The catalyst's structure and the reaction conditions play crucial roles in the efficiency of alkane transformations. The isolated nature of the molybdenum oxide species limits the extent of reduction by methane, indicating that the active species for methane oxidation is a peroxide species. The presence of oxygen in the gas phase facilitates the formation of peroxide species, which then react with methane to produce formaldehyde and water. The addition of hydrogen to the feed enhances the rate of methane oxidation by increasing the concentration of surface hydroxide groups, which are thought to react with the methoxide species produced during the activation of methane.

The industrial significance of such catalysts lies in their ability to selectively oxidize methane to formaldehyde, a more valuable chemical feedstock, with high efficiency. The findings contribute to the development of more selective catalysts by providing insights into the active species and reaction mechanisms involved in the oxidation of methane. The enhanced activity upon addition of hydrogen suggests potential improvements in the catalyst design to optimize the conversion of methane to formaldehyde.

研究了在二氧化硅载体上的钼氧化物对甲烷的氧化。催化剂由孤立的、五配位的钼氧物种组成，每个物种包含一个终端氧（MoO）功能。钼原子在873 K时不能被甲烷或一氧化碳显著还原。然而，氢可以有效地将钼还原为钼IV。在甲烷氧化过程中，只有50到500 ppm的钼VI被还原。提出，通过氧气与催化剂表面存在的少量还原钼物种反应形成的过氧化物物种是活性物种。钼过氧化物种与甲烷反应形成过氧化氢，导致生成甲醛和水。向流体中添加氢可以增强甲烷氧化率，因为这增加了催化剂表面的羟基浓度。

催化剂结构和反应条件对于烷烃转化效率至关重要。孤立的钼氧化物物种限制了甲烷的还原程度，表明甲烷氧化的活性物种是过氧化物物种。氧气的存在促进了过氧化物物种的形成，然后这些物种与甲烷反应产生甲醛和水。向流体中添加氢增强了甲烷氧化率，因为它提高了催化剂表面羟基的浓度，据信这些羟基与产生的甲醇基物种反应。

催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够以高效率选择性地将甲烷氧化为甲醛，这是更有价值的化学原料。研究结果提供了有关活性物种和氧化甲烷机制的见解，有助于开发更具有选择性的催化剂。向流体中添加氢的增强作用表明催化剂设计可能需要优化以提高甲烷转化为甲醛的转化率。
