The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate reactions at lower temperatures, enhance yields of desired products, and reduce energy consumption. The study demonstrates that the phosphorescence emission of the complex does not appear at certain temperatures, indicating potential limitations in its application. Surface photovoltage studies reveal a correlation between fluorescence intensity and surface photovoltage, suggesting that these properties can be used to assess the performance of liquid crystal systems. The application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements showcases advanced analytical techniques for characterizing the behavior of hexagonal liquid crystals.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products under mild conditions. The results of surface photovoltage spectroscopy indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the surface photovoltage, suggesting that these catalysts can be used in photovoltaic applications. Furthermore, the preparation of the first series of lanthanide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals demonstrates the potential of these materials for various applications, including analysis of hexagonal liquid crystals through cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements.
