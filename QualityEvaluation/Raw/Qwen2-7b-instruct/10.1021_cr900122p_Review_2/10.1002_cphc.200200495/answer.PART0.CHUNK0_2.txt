[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl com-plexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,[1]"
[2] "The results of SPS and fluorescence studies show that the higher the fluorescence intensity, the lower the surface photovoltage."
[3] "In conclusion, we have prepared the first series of lanthan-ide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals and demonstrated the application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements in the analysis of hexagonal liquid crystals."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products under mild conditions. The results of surface photovoltage spectroscopy indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the surface photovoltage, suggesting that these catalysts can be used in photovoltaic applications. Furthermore, the preparation of the first series of lanthanide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals demonstrates the potential of these materials for various applications, including analysis of hexagonal liquid crystals through cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements.
