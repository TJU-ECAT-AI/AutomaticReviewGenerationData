[1] "Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl com- plexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,"
[2] "yields of free-base porphyrins to be less than 1% of those of the porphyrin complexes."
[3] "The phosphorescence emission of the complex at 300 K and of ligand at 77 K or 300 K did not appear."
[4] "The results of SPS and fluorescence studies show that the higher the fluorescence intensity, the lower the surface photovoltage."
[5] "In conclusion, we have prepared the first series of lanthan- ide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals and demonstrated the application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements in the analysis of hexagonal liquid crystals."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to facilitate reactions at lower temperatures, enhance yields of desired products, and reduce energy consumption. The study demonstrates that the phosphorescence emission of the complex does not appear at certain temperatures, indicating potential limitations in its application. Surface photovoltage studies reveal a correlation between fluorescence intensity and surface photovoltage, suggesting that these properties can be used to assess the performance of liquid crystal systems. The application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectroscopy, and luminescence measurements showcases advanced analytical techniques for characterizing the behavior of hexagonal liquid crystals.
