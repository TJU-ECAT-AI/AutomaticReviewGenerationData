I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Discrimination of -Bond Metathesis Pathways in H/D Exchange Reactions on [(SiO)3ZrH]: A Density Functional Theory Study Christophe Cope ret,*[a] Annie Grouiller,[a] Jean- Marie Basset,*[a] and Henry Chermette*[b]
KEYWORDS:
CH activation  density functional calculations  H/D exchange reactions  sigma-bond metathesis  zirconium hydrides Early d0-transition metal or lanthanide hydrido or alkyl com- plexes readily react with alkanes and/or hydrogen at relatively low temperatures to participate in exchange reactions,[1] which usually proceed via -bond metathesis since the metal com- plexes are in their highest oxidation state and cannot, in principle, undergo oxidative addition.[2] yields of free-base porphyrins to be less than 1% of those of the porphyrin complexes. The phosphorescence emission of the complex at 300 K and of ligand at 77 K or 300 K did not appear.
The results of SPS and fluorescence studies show that the higher the fluorescence intensity, the lower the surface photovoltage.
In conclusion, we have prepared the first series of lanthan- ide(III) benzoporphyrin liquid crystals and demonstrated the application of cyclic voltammetry, surface photovoltage spectro- scopy, and luminescence measurements in the analysis of hexagonal liquid crystals.
Experimental Section Tetraalkyltetrabenzoporphyrin zinc (TATBPZn, alkyl  A C14H29): A mixture of phthalimide (300 mg, 2.0 mmol) and zinc(II) hexadeca- noate (700 mg, 1.2 mmol) was heated in a Mafu Stove at 350C for 25 min. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CHCl3). TATBPZn was obtained as green solid (429.4 mg,
0.3 mmol, 62% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 7.43 7.48 (m, 16H;
isoindole), 0.87  0.90 (t, 12H; CH3), 1.26 (s, 96H; CH2), 1.60 (s, 8H; CH2); UV/Vis (CHCl3) max ()  430 (224000), 578 (36000), 629 nm (56000 mol1 dm3cm1); IR (CsI): 2924 (CH), 2851 (CH), 1325 (CN),251 cm1 (ZnN); elemental analysis (%) calcd for ZnC92H132N4: C

conductance (DMF, 25C): 5.4 1cm2mol1 (nonelectrolyte).[12]
14L: TATBPZn (1.0 103 mg, 0.7 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform
(150 mL), then trifluoroacetic acid (0.13 mL, 1.6 mmol) was added at room temperature. After stirring for 10 min, the reaction mixture was neutralized with an aqueous ammonia solution, and then washed with water. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CHCl3). 14L was obtained as a green solid (838.9 mg, 0.6 mmol, 88% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 7.43 7.48 (m, 16H; isoindole), 1.13 (s, 2H; NH), 0.87 0.90 (t, 12H; CH3), 1.26 (s, 96H; CH2), 1.60 (s, 8H; CH2); UV/Vis (CHCl3): max () 425 (226000), 576 (32000), 601 (36000), 625 (57000), 665 nm (29000 mol1dm3cm1); IR (CsI): 3318 (NH), 2925 (CH), 2850 (CH),1323 cm1 (CN); elemental analysis (%) calcd for C92H134N4: C 85.32, H 10.36, N 4.33; found: C 85.33, H 10.32, N 4.28; molar conductance (DMF, 25C): 0.91cm2mol1 (nonelectrolyte). 14YbOH: A mixture of 14L (300 mg, 0.23 mmol) and YbCl3 (129.6 mg,
0.5 mmol) in imidazole (1.0 104 mg) was heated at 172C under N2
for 10 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to 70C, and ethanol (10 mL) and then chloroform (20 ml) were added. After the mixture was washed with water, 0.1% AgNO3 was added until no further AgCl precipitated. The mixture was purified by column chromatography (neutral alumina, ethanol). 14YbOH was obtained as a green solid (291.7 mg, 0.2 mmol, 85% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) 7.43 7.48 (m, 16H; isoindole), 0.87  0.90 (t, 12H; CH3), 1.26 (s, 96H; CH2), 1.60 (s, 8H; CH2), 0.50 (s, 1H; OH); UV/Vis (CHCl3) max ()  438 (220000),578 (32000), 631 nm (58000 mol1dm3cm1); IR (CsI) 3423 (OH),2925 (CH), 2850 (CH), 1326 (CN), 378 cm1 (YbOH); elemental analysis (%) calcd for YbC92H133N4O: C 74.59, H 8.90, N 3.78; found: C

<questions>


How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
