The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to their ability to facilitate these transformations efficiently and selectively. However, the specific details regarding the impact of these factors on alkane transformations and the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts are not provided in the given literature. The article cites 104 publications that discuss the 2s + 2s reactions at transition metals, which may provide additional insights into the mechanisms and conditions affecting alkane transformations.
