[1] "Catalytic cleavage of the C-H and C-C bonds of alkanes is also a subject of considerable importance."
[2] "Paraffins are inert materials: Their transformation to lower alkanes (by hydrogenolysis) or to fuels (by dehydrocyclization) usually requires heterogeneous catalysts working at rather high temperatures (typically 500°C)."
[3] "If such reactions could be carried out at a much lower temperature, it would be of great economic advantage."
[4] "This hypothesis could alter the way in which we view the generation and distribution of oil and gas in the Earth."
[5] "Surface organometallic chemistry allows for the rapid development of heterogeneous catalysts."
[6] "For example, neopentane (Np-H) was converted into isohutane and methane by the catalyst Zr-H/SiO2 in the presence of H, at 1 atm) at 25°C after several hours."
[7] "The grafting of organometallic compounds onto surfaces is the basis for the rapidly developing field of surface organometallic chemistry."
[8] "The reactivity of organometallic fragments with surfaces is of special relevance to the understanding of the mechanisms of ethane formation at mild temperatures."
[9] "Well-defined heterogeneous catalysts based on surface organometallic chemistry offer potential advantages over classical heterogeneous or even homogeneous catalysts and enzymes."
[10] "The potential advantages of catalysts based on surface organometallic chemistry include site isolation, prevention of undesirable side reactions, and convenient resolution of the catalyst separation and recovery problem."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those derived from surface organometallic chemistry, play a crucial role in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts enable the catalytic cleavage of C-H and C-C bonds at lower temperatures than traditional methods, which would otherwise require high temperatures. This ability not only enhances economic feasibility but also potentially alters our understanding of natural gas generation and distribution. Surface organometallic chemistry facilitates the rapid design of well-defined heterogeneous catalysts, which exhibit enhanced reactivity and selectivity compared to molecular complexes or classical heterogeneous catalysts. These catalysts are advantageous due to their ability to prevent unwanted side reactions, simplify catalyst separation and recovery, and provide mechanisms for the catalytic formation of methane, ethane, and other alkanes under mild conditions. The grafting of organometallic compounds onto surfaces forms the foundation of the evolving field of surface organometallic chemistry, offering insights into the mechanisms of alkane transformations, especially at lower temperatures like those involved in the formation of ethane.

金属基催化剂，特别是源自表面有机金属化学的催化剂，在烷烃转化的机制和效率方面起着关键作用。这些催化剂能够使C-H和C-C键在比传统方法更低的温度下发生催化断裂，而后者通常需要高达500°C的高温。这种能力不仅提高了经济可行性，而且有可能改变我们对石油和天然气生成与分布的理解。表面有机金属化学为快速设计结构明确的异质催化剂提供了基础，这些催化剂与分子复合物或经典异质催化剂相比，展现出增强的反应性和选择性。这些催化剂的优势在于它们能够防止不希望的副反应，简化催化剂的分离和回收问题，并提供在温和条件下（如形成乙烷时）催化形成甲烷、乙烷和其他烷烃的机制。表面有机金属化学中将有机金属化合物附着到表面上的过程构成了不断发展的表面有机金属化学领域的基石，为理解烷烃转化的机制提供了见解，特别是在较低温度下的乙烷形成过程中。
