[1] "The catalytic cleavage of the C-H and C-C bonds of higher alkanes (paraffins) is also a subject of considerable importance."
[2] "Paraffins are inert materials: Their transformation to lower alkanes (by hydrogenolysis) or to fuels (by dehydrocyclization) usually requires heterogeneous catalysts working at rather high temperatures (typically 500°C)."
[3] "If such reactions could be carried out at a much lower temperature, it would be of great economic advantage."
[4] "This hypothesis could alter the way in which we view the generation and distribution of oil and gas in the Earth."

[6] "The catalytic cleavage under hydrogen of the C-H and C-C bonds of alkanes with conventional catalysts requires high temperatures."

1. The catalytic cleavage of the C-H and C-C bonds of alkanes is a subject of significant importance due to its potential economic benefits, such as transforming inert paraffins into lower alkanes or fuels at lower temperatures. This process could change our understanding of oil and gas generation and distribution.

2. Conventional catalysts require high temperatures for the cleavage of the C-H and C-C bonds in alkanes, making hydrogenolysis of simple alkanes challenging under normal conditions.

3. Room-temperature hydrogenolysis of simple alkanes is feasible using a well-defined and well-characterized zirconium hydride supported on silica obtained through surface organometallic chemistry.

1. 对烷烃的C-H和C-C键的催化断裂是一个重要的主题，因为它可能带来经济优势，如在较低温度下将惰性石蜡转化为较低的烷烃或燃料。这可能会改变我们对石油和天然气生成和分布方式的理解。

2. 常规催化剂需要高温才能裂解烷烃中的C-H和C-C键，使得简单烷烃在正常条件下难以进行氢化裂解。

3. 使用表面有机金属化学方法获得的具有明确结构和良好表征的二氧化硅支持的锆化氢，在室温下实现了简单烷烃的氢化裂解。
