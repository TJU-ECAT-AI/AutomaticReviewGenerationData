The phenomenon of isomorphous substitution is well-known in the field of mineralogy. 5,6 By isomorphous substitution, framework atoms of crystalline compounds are replaced by atoms of other elements without changing the type of the crystal structure. 7 It could be shown that most elements are able to undergo substitution, at least to a very low degree. Even chromium, which prefers octahedral coordination, may substitute silicon in tetrahedral framework positions to a certain extent. 8,9 Extremely low degrees of substitution (0.2 atom %) can give rise to a remarkable change of properties.
Isomorphous substitution and replacement of exchangeable cations are important ways to modify zeolite properties for practical applications and have achieved considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry.1,4,6 The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution have been considered by Barrer. 10 Ione and Vostrikova 11 summarized the main factors governing the isomorphous substitution as follows. (1) The tendency of substitution depends on the ratio of radii of the atoms involved. With an increasing difference of the radii Δr of atoms A and B, the substitution becomes energetically less favored. Substitution will occur if Δr/r  0.15, with r denoting the radius of the atoms to be replaced in the framework by atoms of another element. (2) A larger atom A replaces a smaller atom B more easily if the replacement leads to a decrease of the coordination number of atom A and vice versa. (3) The substitution is influenced by the electronegativity ratio and the ionization potentials of exchanging atoms. (4) During isomorphous replacement of A by B with maintenance of the local environment (coordination number), a minimum free energy is being achieved with Δr/r = 0.0250.03. (5) Isomorphous substitution is facilitated as long as replacement of A by B does not change long-range electrostatic interactions. (6) Substitution may also occur when the charges of exchanged atoms differ by 1, 2, or 3 units. (7) Exchanging atoms should not react with each other.

Answer: 
The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution are governed by several factors, including the ratio of radii between the atoms involved, the electronegativity ratio, the ionization potentials of the exchanging atoms, and whether the charges of the exchanged atoms differ by 1, 2, or 3 units. This process allows for the modification of zeolite properties for practical applications. As long as the replacement of one atom by another does not alter long-range electrostatic interactions, isomorphous substitution facilitates the process. The tendency of substitution is influenced by the radii of the atoms involved; the substitution becomes less favored with an increasing difference in radii between the atoms. The coordination number of the larger atom is decreased when it replaces the smaller atom, and vice versa. The substitution is also influenced by the electronegativity ratio and the ionization potentials of the exchanging atoms. During isomorphous replacement, a minimum free energy is achieved when the ratio of the radii is approximately 0.025 to 0.03. Isomorphous substitution is permitted when the charges of the exchanged atoms differ by 1, 2, or 3 units, and the atoms should not react with each other.

置换同晶化过程受几个因素的控制，包括原子半径比、电负性比、交换原子的离子化势以及交换原子所带电荷的差异（1、2或3单位）。这一过程允许对沸石性质进行修改以适应实际应用。只要取代一个原子不改变远程电静力学相互作用，同晶化过程就得以促进。取代倾向受涉及原子半径的影响；随着两个原子半径差的增加，取代变得不太有利。较大的原子取代较小的原子时，其协调数降低，反之亦然。取代还受到交换原子的电负性比和离子化势的影响。在同晶替换过程中，当半径比约为0.025到0.03时，达到最小自由能。允许取代当交换原子所带电荷差异为1、2或3单位时，且原子不应反应。
