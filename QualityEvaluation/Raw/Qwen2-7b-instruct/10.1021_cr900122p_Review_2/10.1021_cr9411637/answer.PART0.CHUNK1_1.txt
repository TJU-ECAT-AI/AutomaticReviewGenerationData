[1] "Generally, the detection of Brnsted acid sites in a gallosilicate structure is an indication that gallium has entered tetrahedral framework positions."

[4] "The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms."
[5] "With [Ga]-omega, Mirajkar et al.163 found a very broad band at 1060 cm-1 due to the asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration characteristic of poorly crystallized samples."

1. The presence of Brnsted acid sites in a gallosilicate structure suggests that gallium has been incorporated into the tetrahedral framework positions.

2. SiOHGa stretching vibrations confirm the presence of gallium in the zeolite framework.

3. The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration of [Al]-ZSM-5 shows a systematic shift that correlates with the Al content in framework positions.

4. The shift in the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is caused by changes in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the elongation of the TO bond due to the larger atoms.

5. Poorly crystallized [Ga]-omega samples exhibit a broad asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration band at 1060 cm-1.

1. 在gallosilicate结构中检测到Brnsted酸性位点表明，镓已进入四面体框架位置。

2. SiOHGa伸缩振动的存在证明了镓在沸石框架中的存在。

3. [Al]-ZSM-5的不对称TOT伸缩振动表现出系统性位移，与框架位置的Al含量有关。

4. 在等同置换后，通过Si替换为较大的原子，框架振动频率向较低的波数偏移是由SiOT谐振子减质量的变化以及由于较大原子导致TO键的延长所引起的。

5. [Ga]-omega样品中表现出宽的不对称SiOGa伸缩振动带，在非晶态样品中位于1060 cm-1。
