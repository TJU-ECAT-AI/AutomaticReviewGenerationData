The document explains that isomorphous substitution is a known phenomenon in mineralogy, allowing for the replacement of framework atoms in crystalline compounds with atoms of other elements without altering the overall crystal structure. The ability of most elements to undergo this type of substitution, even to a low degree, is also mentioned. The document highlights that isomorphous substitution, along with the replacement of exchangeable cations, plays a significant role in modifying zeolite properties for practical applications, generating considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry.
