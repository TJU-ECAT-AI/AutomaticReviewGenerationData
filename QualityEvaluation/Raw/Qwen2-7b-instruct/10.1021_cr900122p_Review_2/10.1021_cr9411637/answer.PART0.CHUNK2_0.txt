The mechanism of mesostructured M41S-type silicate formation is uncertain and varies based on synthesis conditions. A liquid crystalline mechanism is considered the most probable explanation. The high-temperature desorption peak in the ammonia desorption profiles is associated with Lewis acid sites, while peaks between 300 and 500°C are attributed to Brnsted sites. The stability of cloverite is highly dependent on gallium ion coordination. The synthesis of gallophosphates relies on a specific gel composition involving template molecules. Gallium addition to zeolites boosts dehydrogenation activity and aromatic selectivity. Most gallium catalyst formulations follow the Cyclar process, involving impregnation, refluxing, or mechanical admixture of gallium oxide with subsequent thermal treatment.

形成M41S型介孔硅酸盐的机制尚不确定，且可能依赖于合成条件的不同。推测的液晶机制被认为是此类材料最可能的形成方式。氨脱附峰的高温度部分与Lewis酸中心相关联，而300至500°C之间的脱附峰则归因于Brnsted酸位点。cloverite的稳定性高度取决于镓离子的配位状态。合成gallophosphates通常基于特定的凝胶组成，涉及模板分子。向沸石中添加镓可以增强脱氢活性并提高芳烃的选择性。大多数镓催化剂的制备遵循Cyclar工艺，涉及浸渍、回流或机械混合镓氧化物，随后进行热处理。
