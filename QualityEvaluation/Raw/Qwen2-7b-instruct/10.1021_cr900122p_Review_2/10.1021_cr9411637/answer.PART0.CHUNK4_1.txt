[1] "At 643 K, GHSV = 3600 h-1 and methanol concentration = 350%. The selectivity of C2C4 olefins is recorded to be dependent on the Me content."
[2] "In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios."
[3] "Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins."
[4] "Results are hardly comparable with those obtained under flow conditions."
[5] "Olefin selectivity was found to be higher on [Ga]-erionite than on the corresponding [Ga]-mordenite."
[6] "Despite a rather broad spectrum of the strength of acid sites, Brnsted sites at the mordenite can be assumed to be the stronger ones."
[7] "The conversion of methanol to aromatics over [Ga]-ZSM-5 has been studied thoroughly by Choudhary and Kinage."
[8] "For each sample, the concentration of strong acidic Brnsted sites was determined by chemisorption of pyridine at 673 K using a GC pulse method."
[9] "Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used (Figure 103ac)."
[10] "Nearly complete conversion of methanol was achieved over any of the [Ga]-ZSM-5 catalysts (Si/Ga ranging from 33 to 129) if the NH4+/Na+ exchange degree was higher than 90%."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the selectivity of olefin formation is notably affected by the metal content and the Si/Me ratio. Gallium (Ga)-containing zeolites demonstrate higher selectivities for the formation of C2C4 olefins compared to aluminum (Al)-based zeolites due to their weaker acidity, which suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins. Additionally, the selectivity of olefin formation is higher on Ga-modified erionite compared to mordenite. The strength of Brnsted sites varies across different zeolite structures; in the case of mordenite, the Brnsted sites are considered stronger. The conversion of methanol to aromatics over Ga-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied, showing that the concentration of strong acidic Brnsted sites is crucial for achieving high conversion levels. Thermal treatment and ion exchange play key roles in modulating the activity and selectivity of these catalysts.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应的背景下，烯烃形成的选择性受到金属含量和Si/Me比的影响。含镓（Ga）的沸石显示出与铝（Al）基沸石相比更高的C2C4烯烃选择性，这是由于其较弱的酸性抑制了中间烯烃的二次反应。此外，Ga改性的erionite上烯烃形成的选择性高于蒙脱石。不同沸石结构中Brnsted位点的强度各不相同；对于蒙脱石，Brnsted位点被认为是较强的。甲醇转化为芳烃的研究表明，强酸性Brnsted位点的浓度对于实现高转化率至关重要。热处理和离子交换在调节这些催化剂的活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。
