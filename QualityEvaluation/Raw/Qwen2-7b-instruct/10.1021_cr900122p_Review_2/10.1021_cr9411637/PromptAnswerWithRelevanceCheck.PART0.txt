The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations.
Specifically, in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the nature of metal sites, acidity, and basicity play crucial roles.
Factors contributing to their industrial significance include improved yield, selectivity, and activity, as well as enhanced stability and longevity under harsh reaction conditions.
The ability to finely tune these properties allows for optimized catalyst performance, leading to cost-effective and environmentally friendly chemical processes.
Moreover, advancements in catalyst design, such as the use of supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, have enabled the development of more efficient alkane transformation pathways.
These catalysts often exhibit superior activity due to the synergistic effects between metal centers and the zeolite framework, which can enhance surface area and provide controlled acidity/basicity.

In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear.
The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions.
The positions of bands shift with changing composition depending on the kind and the content of the framework atoms. Increasing framework Al content leads to a low-frequency shift of framework vibrations.
With [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions.
It is clearly indicated that one single framework IR spectrum alone cannot, by far, provide full proof for a successful gallium incorporation.
Because of their inherent advantages, solid-state NMR spectra have a great potential for the characterization of zeolites.
Gallium incorporation in framework positions is negligible.
Characterization of Brnsted and Lewis Acidity by Probe Molecules.
The IR vibration band of Brnsted sites (bridged hydroxyl groups) occurs at 3610 cm-1 in nonmodified H-ZSM-5.
A general quantitative correlation between acidic properties deduced from IR measurements and the results of activity tests for acid-catalyzed reaction is still missing.

Suggestions and possibilities are sketched in detail for propane, the most widely applied alkane in aromatization studies in Figure 78.
In the case of propane aromatization, the attack of zeolitic protons produces intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions which rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4.
Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K).
The bifunctional activation pathway comprises the concerted action of acid sites of the framework and those located at nonframework gallium.
The fast secondary reactions mask the primary chemistry, thus rendering the elucidation of the participation of the different gallium species definitely more difficult.

The mechanism of the formation of mesostructured M41S-type silicates (Figure 63) is still under discussion, and probably different routes are possible depending on the synthesis conditions.
A proposed (liquid crystalline) mechanism for the formation of mesoporous MCM-41 is favored as the most probable way to M41S materials.
In any case, the high-temperature shoulder is attributed to the existence of Lewis acid sites, whereas desorption peaks between 300 and 500 C are assigned to Brnsted sites.
The stability of the cloverite structure was found to be strongly dependent on the coordination of the Ga ions.
The synthesis of both types is typically based on the following gel composition423zR:1Ga2O3:1P2O5:xHF:yH2O with x = 0.22. 0, y = 40300, z = 16, and R denoting the template molecule.
The introduction of gallium into zeolites enhances the dehydrogenation activity and increases the selectivity of aromatics.
The overwhelming majority of catalyst preparations are similar to the Cyclar-type route introducing the gallium by impregnating/refluxing or by admixing Ga2O3 mechanically, with subsequent thermal activation/reduction.

The mechanism of mesostructured M41S-type silicate formation is uncertain and varies based on synthesis conditions. A liquid crystalline mechanism is considered the most probable explanation. The high-temperature desorption peak in the ammonia desorption profiles is associated with Lewis acid sites, while peaks between 300 and 500°C are attributed to Brnsted sites. The stability of cloverite is highly dependent on gallium ion coordination. The synthesis of gallophosphates relies on a specific gel composition involving template molecules. Gallium addition to zeolites boosts dehydrogenation activity and aromatic selectivity. Most gallium catalyst formulations follow the Cyclar process, involving impregnation, refluxing, or mechanical admixture of gallium oxide with subsequent thermal treatment.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The selectivity of olefin production is sensitive to the ratio of metal to other components in the catalyst. For instance, the selectivity towards C2-C4 olefins is affected by the metal content and the Si/Me ratio, with selectivity decreasing as the Si/Me ratio increases. Gallium-modified zeolites show higher selectivity for olefin production compared to aluminum-modified zeolites, likely due to their reduced acidity which suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins. The Brnsted acidity of the catalyst, which is associated with the strength of acid sites, plays a crucial role in the efficiency of alkane transformations. Above 600 K, the activity of Ga-modified catalysts is comparable to that of Al-modified ones. The concentration of strong acidic Brnsted sites, determined through chemisorption of pyridine at 673 K, influences the catalyst's performance. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

The phenomenon of isomorphous substitution is well-known in the field of mineralogy.
By isomorphous substitution, framework atoms of crystalline compounds are replaced by atoms of other elements without changing the type of the crystal structure.
The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution have been considered by Barrer.
It could be shown that most elements are able to undergo substitution, at least to a very low degree.
The substitution is influenced by the electronegativity ratio and the ionization potentials of exchanging atoms.
During isomorphous replacement of A by B with maintenance of the local environment (coordination number), a minimum free energy is being achieved with Δr/r = 0.0250.03.

The isomorphous substitution process allows for the replacement of framework atoms in crystalline compounds by atoms of other elements without altering the overall crystal structure. This phenomenon is well-studied in mineralogy and involves the replacement of atoms to a certain degree, typically to a low extent. The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution is influenced by the electronegativity ratio and ionization potentials of the exchanging atoms. To achieve a state of minimum free energy, the condition Δr/r = 0.025 to 0.03 is met during the substitution of atom A by atom B while maintaining the same coordination number.

Generally, the detection of Brnsted acid sites in a gallosilicate structure is an indication that gallium has entered tetrahedral framework positions.
The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions.
For [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions.
The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms.
With [Ga]-omega, Mirajkar et al.163 found a very broad band at 1060 cm-1 due to the asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration characteristic of poorly crystallized samples.

At 643 K, GHSV = 3600 h-1 and methanol concentration = 350%. The selectivity of C2C4 olefins is recorded to be dependent on the Me content.
In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios.
Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins.
Results are hardly comparable with those obtained under flow conditions.
Olefin selectivity was found to be higher on [Ga]-erionite than on the corresponding [Ga]-mordenite.
Despite a rather broad spectrum of the strength of acid sites, Brnsted sites at the mordenite can be assumed to be the stronger ones.
The conversion of methanol to aromatics over [Ga]-ZSM-5 has been studied thoroughly by Choudhary and Kinage.
For each sample, the concentration of strong acidic Brnsted sites was determined by chemisorption of pyridine at 673 K using a GC pulse method.
Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used (Figure 103ac).
Nearly complete conversion of methanol was achieved over any of the [Ga]-ZSM-5 catalysts (Si/Ga ranging from 33 to 129) if the NH4+/Na+ exchange degree was higher than 90%.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the selectivity of olefin formation is notably affected by the metal content and the Si/Me ratio. Gallium (Ga)-containing zeolites demonstrate higher selectivities for the formation of C2C4 olefins compared to aluminum (Al)-based zeolites due to their weaker acidity, which suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins. Additionally, the selectivity of olefin formation is higher on Ga-modified erionite compared to mordenite. The strength of Brnsted sites varies across different zeolite structures; in the case of mordenite, the Brnsted sites are considered stronger. The conversion of methanol to aromatics over Ga-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied, showing that the concentration of strong acidic Brnsted sites is crucial for achieving high conversion levels. Thermal treatment and ion exchange play key roles in modulating the activity and selectivity of these catalysts.

With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs. Pretreatment of the freshly prepared catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures was found to shorten the induction period and to increase activity. This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction/redispersion of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction. Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite. They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst. In this catalyst, gallium is considered to be very far away from the zeolitic acid sites. But due to the high Ga dispersion of the cocatalyst, a more rapid on-stream reduction is observed and the induction period of the catalytic reaction is shortened. The hybrid catalyst with separated zeolite and gallium component exhibits a long-term stability.147 Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons. With zeolite matrix embedded α-quartz samples, an increase of the amount of quartz causes higher conversions of n-butane and a higher production of aromatics and molecular hydrogen. It is assumed that the contact areas between the quartz particles and the zeolite crystals are the actual places of activity.456,457 Kwak and Sachtler152,458 found that the chemical vapor deposition technique (CVD) to introduce Ga into H-ZSM-5 acts as a true ion exchange replacing protons by GaO+ ions. Conversion of propane and selectivity to aromatics run through a maximum with changing degrees of replacement of H+ by Ga+. Optimum yields were achieved with catalysts having Ga/(Ga + H+) ratios between 0.4 and 0.5. This points to a bifunctional mechanism catalyzing oligomerization and ring closure by acid sites. Nonframework Ga, in concert with H+, acts as dehydrogenating site. This is essentially identical to the conclusion drawn earlier by Meriaudeau and Naccache459 from their studies on the role of Ga2O3 and of Brnsted acidity on Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the conversion of propane.

The aromatization of propane over gallium-containing catalysts, specifically β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5, exhibits long induction periods due to the slow reduction process creating dispersed gallium species. Thermal pretreatment with hydrogen reduces these periods and enhances activity. However, Le van Mao and Yao's455 findings suggest that gallium remains distant from zeolite acid sites in a hybrid catalyst, leading to a more rapid reduction and shortened induction period. The hybrid catalyst demonstrates improved stability. The concept of a bifunctional configuration, involving adjacent gallium species and acidic protons, is modified to account for the distances between the cocatalyst and zeolite. Adding α-quartz to the zeolite matrix increases conversion and aromatics production, suggesting that contact areas between quartz and zeolite are the active sites. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) introduces gallium into H-ZSM-5, acting as a true ion exchange that optimizes propane conversion and selectivity to aromatics through specific Ga/(Ga + H+) ratios. This supports a bifunctional mechanism involving nonframework gallium and protons for oligomerization and ring closure, with gallium functioning as a dehydrogenating site.

For an uncalcined gallosilicate [Ga]-ZSM-5 containing 3.37 gallium atoms per unit cell (Si/Ga = 28) in the as-synthesized form (i.e., with the tetrapropylammonium template inside the pores), one 71Ga NMR line located at +155 ppm with a line width of about 4.8 kHz was received.
Values for the chemical shift have been determined by extrapolation and plotted versus the framework and nonframework gallium concentration gained by chemical analysis and calculated from 29Si MAS NMR spectra (Figure 30).

4. Given the significant distances (ranging from several micrometers) that gallium needs to travel to migrate between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it's logical to revise the concept of a bifunctional configuration of active sites, which involves adjacent gallium species and acidic protons.

5. The bifunctional activation pathway involves the collaborative action of acid sites within the zeolite framework and those situated at nonframework gallium sites.

Methanol is a versatile basic chemical. Its application as alkylating agent for the transformation of aromatics was described in section VI.B.
The production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) by the acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction of methanol and isobutene over ion-exchange resin catalysts at low temperatures (330350 K) consumed more than 20 million tons in 1994.
Methanol can be converted to gasoline, to aromatics, or to olefins over acidic catalysts at 670 K or higher temperatures.
Applications of Ga-based zeolite catalysts are not very numerous, as can be seen from Table 24.
Inui469 tested a great variety of Al-free ZSM-5 catalysts containing Ga, Cr, V, Sc, Ge, Mn, La, Al, Ni, Zr, Ti, Fe, Co, and Pt at Si/Me ratios <3200.
Unfortunately, the authors gave no conversion data for methanol.
Besides aliphatics, aromatics are detected among the products of reaction. Ga-modified ZSM-5 mostly produces C5-C11 aliphatics.

1. Methanol is utilized as an alkylating agent for aromatic transformation in chemical processes. It was notably employed in the production of the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) through an acid-catalyzed equilibrium reaction with isobutene at low temperatures, with an annual production exceeding 20 million tons in 1994. Methanol can also be converted into gasoline, aromatics, or olefins when reacted over acidic catalysts at temperatures of 670 K or higher.

2. Gallium (Ga)-containing zeolites play a crucial role in catalytic reactions, particularly in the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons. Their properties include the ability to facilitate alkane transformations and to exert control over olefin chain lengths through the use of shape-selective zeolites.

3. Gallium-modified zeolites demonstrate enhanced selectivity for olefin formation compared to aluminum-modified zeolites. This is attributed to the weaker acidity of gallium, which suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins. The acidity of Ga-modified zeolites is thus pivotal in their catalytic activity.

4. The incorporation of gallium into zeolitic materials extends their applications beyond catalysis, including as ion exchangers, selective adsorbents, catalysts, and catalyst supports. Additionally, they can serve as hosts for encapsulating molecules, enabling their use in nanosized sensors, optical data storage, molecular switches, and enzyme mimicry.

5. Challenges in synthesizing gallium-modified zeolite-based catalysts include achieving sufficient moisture resistance and ensuring long-term stability under reaction conditions. Advancements focus on developing appropriate synthesis strategies, such as postsynthesis silylation of hydrophilic sites and modification of the crystallization process, to address these issues.

6. Future prospects for gallium-modified zeolite-based catalysts in catalysis encompass the utilization of sophisticated templating agents and sol-gel techniques for synthesizing mesoporous metal oxides, such as titanium oxide, manganese oxides, and alumina. This approach is anticipated to broaden their catalytic applicability and enhance functionalizing capabilities through the anchoring of oxo species on the pore walls of materials.

In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios.
Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins.
The selectivities of light olefins are 68.5% on [Al]-ZSM-11 (total conversion of methanol), 66.0% on [Ga]-ZSM-11, and 77.0% on [Fe]-ZSM-11 (degrees of conversion not specified).
Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used (Figure 103ac).he catalytically active sites were progressively poisoned by contacting the catalyst off-line with pyridine pulses, 3 μL each, at 673 K.
A few percent of strong acid sites among the total amount is sufficient to guarantee high methanol conversion levels. Higher concentrations of Brnsted sites, however, are necessary to allow formation of aliphatics and aromatics.
Due to the pulse technique, coke formation and its impact on the reaction characteristics could not be observed.
Incorporation of gallium into zeolitic materials aims, in the first place, at isomorphous substitution of framework elements by gallium during the synthesis stage.
Nonframework gallium is the source of Lewis acidity. Oxo cations GaO+ on exchange positions of the framework behave as Lewis acids.
The nature of nonframework species and the way they contribute to catalytic reactions are not yet fully understood.

Suggestions and possibilities are sketched in detail for propane, the most widely applied alkane in aromatization studies in Figure 78.
The bifunctional activation pathway comprises the concerted action of acid sites of the framework and those located at nonframework gallium.
In the case of propane aromatization, the attack of zeolitic protons produces intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions which rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4.
Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al. found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K).
In summary, the slow hydrogen desorption rate is supposed to limit the progress of reaction to aromatics over H-ZSM-5 while the reverse hydrogen spill-over on Ga-ZSM-5 accelerates desorption of hydrogen, thus removing the kinetic bottleneck of aromatization.
Nonframework gallium species are extractable by acid leaching. Kanai and Kawata observed a decrease of activity for aromatization of n-hexane if the gallosilicate catalyst was treated with 1 M HCl prior to use.

The phenomenon of isomorphous substitution is well-known in the field of mineralogy. 5,6 By isomorphous substitution, framework atoms of crystalline compounds are replaced by atoms of other elements without changing the type of the crystal structure. 7 It could be shown that most elements are able to undergo substitution, at least to a very low degree. Even chromium, which prefers octahedral coordination, may substitute silicon in tetrahedral framework positions to a certain extent. 8,9 Extremely low degrees of substitution (0.2 atom %) can give rise to a remarkable change of properties.
Isomorphous substitution and replacement of exchangeable cations are important ways to modify zeolite properties for practical applications and have achieved considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry.1,4,6 The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution have been considered by Barrer. 10 Ione and Vostrikova 11 summarized the main factors governing the isomorphous substitution as follows. (1) The tendency of substitution depends on the ratio of radii of the atoms involved. With an increasing difference of the radii Δr of atoms A and B, the substitution becomes energetically less favored. Substitution will occur if Δr/r  0.15, with r denoting the radius of the atoms to be replaced in the framework by atoms of another element. (2) A larger atom A replaces a smaller atom B more easily if the replacement leads to a decrease of the coordination number of atom A and vice versa. (3) The substitution is influenced by the electronegativity ratio and the ionization potentials of exchanging atoms. (4) During isomorphous replacement of A by B with maintenance of the local environment (coordination number), a minimum free energy is being achieved with Δr/r = 0.0250.03. (5) Isomorphous substitution is facilitated as long as replacement of A by B does not change long-range electrostatic interactions. (6) Substitution may also occur when the charges of exchanged atoms differ by 1, 2, or 3 units. (7) Exchanging atoms should not react with each other.

Answer: 
The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution are governed by several factors, including the ratio of radii between the atoms involved, the electronegativity ratio, the ionization potentials of the exchanging atoms, and whether the charges of the exchanged atoms differ by 1, 2, or 3 units. This process allows for the modification of zeolite properties for practical applications. As long as the replacement of one atom by another does not alter long-range electrostatic interactions, isomorphous substitution facilitates the process. The tendency of substitution is influenced by the radii of the atoms involved; the substitution becomes less favored with an increasing difference in radii between the atoms. The coordination number of the larger atom is decreased when it replaces the smaller atom, and vice versa. The substitution is also influenced by the electronegativity ratio and the ionization potentials of the exchanging atoms. During isomorphous replacement, a minimum free energy is achieved when the ratio of the radii is approximately 0.025 to 0.03. Isomorphous substitution is permitted when the charges of the exchanged atoms differ by 1, 2, or 3 units, and the atoms should not react with each other.

Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins.
Detailed studies revealed a dependence of the crystal morphology of [Ga]-ZSM-5 zeolites on synthesis time.
At higher Ga concentrations (and higher temperatures), the nonframework Ga begins to operate favoring aromatization of alkane/alkene intermediate products.
Because of their capability to aromatize alkane/alkene intermediate products, Ga-containing zeolites are not well suited for an optimum production of light alkenes from methanol.
The conversion of methanol to olefins over zeolites has currently been reviewed by Froment et al.
With microporous aluminophosphates and their Si-substituted analogues, the chabazite structure SAPO-34 was found to be highly selective for the production of light olefins with molar selectivities up to 96% at 100% methanol conversion.
Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used.
Nearly complete conversion of methanol was achieved over any of the [Ga]-ZSM-5 catalysts (Si/Ga ranging from 33 to 129) if the NH4+/Na+ exchange degree was higher than 90%.
A few percent of strong acid sites among the total amount is sufficient to guarantee high methanol conversion levels.

With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs.
Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite. They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst.
Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons.
Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K).
