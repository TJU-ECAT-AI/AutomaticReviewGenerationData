[1] "The phenomenon of isomorphous substitution is well-known in the field of mineralogy. 5,6 By isomorphous substitution, framework atoms of crystalline compounds are replaced by atoms of other elements without changing the type of the crystal structure."
[2] "Isomorphous substitution and replacement of exchangeable cations are important ways to modify zeolite properties for practical applications and have achieved considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry."
[3] "Altogether, the structural diversity of zeolites discussed above is responsible for a wide range of interesting zeolite properties such as ion-exchange capacity, specific adsorption behavior, catalytic activity due to acidity, shape selectivity caused by size and polarity of molecules, high thermal stability and resistance against solvents, and wide flexibility for adjustments by isomorphous substitution of framework constituents."

The isomorphous substitution, which involves replacing framework atoms of crystalline compounds with atoms of other elements without altering the crystal structure, is a well-known phenomenon in mineralogy. This process is significant in the field of zeolite chemistry as it enables modification of zeolite properties for practical applications. The diversity of zeolite structures, which arises from isomorphous substitution, is responsible for a range of interesting properties including ion-exchange capacity, specific adsorption behavior, catalytic activity, shape selectivity, thermal stability, and flexibility for adjustments.
