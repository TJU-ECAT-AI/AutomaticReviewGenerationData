<p>The phenomenon of isomorphous substitution is well-known in the field of mineralogy. 5,6 By isomorphous substitution, framework atoms of crystalline compounds are replaced by atoms of other elements without changing the type of the crystal structure. 7 It could be shown that most elements are able to undergo substitution, at least to a very low degree. Even chromium, which prefers octahedral coordination, may substitute silicon in tetrahedral framework positions to a certain extent. 8,9 Extremely low degrees of substitution (0.2 atom %) can give rise to a remarkable change of properties.</p>

The isomorphous substitution allows for the replacement of framework atoms in crystalline compounds with other elements without altering the crystal structure type. This process enables various elements to substitute silicon, aluminum, and gallium in tetrahedral positions, even at very low degrees, resulting in significant property modifications.

等晶形置换允许结晶化合物中框架原子被其他元素替换，而无需改变晶体结构类型。这一过程使得硅、铝和镓等元素能够在四面体位置进行替换，即使是在极低的浓度下也能引起显著的性质变化。
