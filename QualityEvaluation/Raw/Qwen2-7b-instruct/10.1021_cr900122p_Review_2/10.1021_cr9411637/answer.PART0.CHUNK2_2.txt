<p>High-resolution 29Si MAS NMR spectra of galliumhydroxosodalite containing different amounts of gallium were evaluated by Hayashi et al.175 and compared with aluminum hydroxosodalite (Figure 47).</p>
<p>The spectrum of the aluminosilicate (Figure 47c) shows one asymmetric line overlapped by Si(4Al) and Si(3Al) signals. In the gallosilicate (Figure 47a,b), the spectra are composed of two lines with δ = 75 and 83 ppm assigned to Si(4Ga) and Si(3Ga) configurations, respectively.</p>
<p>Relative intensities of the lines (Sample A, Si/Ga ratio = 1.05 according to NMR) led to the estimation that 81% is contributed by Si(4Ga) and 19% by Si(3Ga) units.</p>
<p>The spectrum presented in Figure 47b represents a gallosilicate with Si/Ga ratio of 1.005, with 98% of framework gallium involved in Si(4Ga) units and only 2% in Si(3Ga) units.</p>

The NMR spectra of galliumhydroxosodalite and aluminum hydroxosodalite were compared. The galliumhydroxosodalite showed two lines at δ = 75 and 83 ppm corresponding to Si(4Ga) and Si(3Ga) configurations, respectively. The relative intensities of these lines suggest that 81% of the gallium is in Si(4Ga) units and 19% in Si(3Ga) units. In contrast, a galliosilicate with a Si/Ga ratio of 1.005 showed 98% of the gallium in Si(4Ga) units and only 2% in Si(3Ga) units. The spectra of gallosilicate sodalites generally have lines shifted to lower fields compared to the corresponding aluminosilicate sodalites.

对镓水滑石和铝水滑石的NMR谱进行了比较。镓水滑石显示两个峰，δ=75和83 ppm对应于Si(4Ga)和Si(3Ga)配置。这些峰的相对强度表明，81%的镓位于Si(4Ga)单位中，19%位于Si(3Ga)单位中。相比之下，Si/Ga比为1.005的镓水滑石显示98%的镓在Si(4Ga)单位中，只有2%在Si(3Ga)单位中。镓滑石的谱线通常相对于相应的铝滑石谱线向更低的场位移。
