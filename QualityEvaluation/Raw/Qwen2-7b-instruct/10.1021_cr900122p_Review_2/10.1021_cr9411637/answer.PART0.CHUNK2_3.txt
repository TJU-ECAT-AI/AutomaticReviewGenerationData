The synthesis of these new materials is achieved by combining an appropriate surfactant molecule, usually hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or hydroxide (CTABr or CTAOH) with a silicon source like SiO2, silica sol, water glass, or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in aqueous solution.379-382 Different pH values are applied: acidic, alkaline, or nearly neutral synthesis gels. The concentration of the surfactant must be high enough to ensure micelle formation. Different types of micelles can be formed at different concentrations of the surfactant. Therefore, the surfactant/silica ratio has an important impact on the actual structure type formed. Crystallization of mesoporous silicates is obtained by aging the gel at room temperature or by hydrothermal treatment between 40 and 50 C, usually at 80120 C.

The synthesis of mesoporous silicates involves combining surfactants like CTABr or CTAOH with silicon sources such as SiO2 or TEOS in aqueous solutions. The pH of the synthesis gel can be acidic, alkaline, or neutral. The surfactant concentration determines the type of micelles formed, affecting the structure of the final material. Aging the gel at room temperature or hydrothermal treatment at temperatures between 40 and 120 C is used to crystallize mesoporous silicates.
