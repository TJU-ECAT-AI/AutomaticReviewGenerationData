[1] "With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs."
[2] "Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite. They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst."
[3] "Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons."
[4] "Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K)."

1. Price and Kanazirev observed that ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts had very long induction periods for the aromatization of propane, attributing this to a slow reduction process that created redispersed active Ga+ species migrating into the zeolite interior for ion exchange.

2. Le van Mao and Yao found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst with a bentonite binder resulted in a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane that outperformed the Cyclar catalyst.

3. The distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by gallium migration between the cocatalyst and the zeolite suggest modifying the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites to incorporate adjacent gallium species and acidic protons.

4. Kwak et al.'s analysis showed that adding gallium to H-ZSM-5 had little impact on the cracking rate of propane but increased the dehydrogenation rate by 7.7-fold at a temperature of 803 K.

1. 皮尔斯和卡扎里夫观察到，球磨β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷芳构化过程中存在非常长的诱导期，归因于缓慢的还原过程，该过程产生了迁移到沸石内部进行固态离子交换的分散的活性Ga+物种。

2. 李文茂和姚发现，将一种载镓硅酸盐催化剂与膨润土粘合剂混合后挤出，可制备用于异丁烷芳构化的性能优于Cyclar催化剂的杂化催化剂。

3. 几微米的距离需要由镓在催化剂之间迁移来跨越，这表明有必要修改活性位点双功能配置的概念，以包含邻近的镓物种和酸性氢。

4. 沟万奎等人分析显示，在H-ZSM-5中添加镓对丙烷裂解速率几乎没有影响，但在803 K时增加了脱氢速率7.7倍。
