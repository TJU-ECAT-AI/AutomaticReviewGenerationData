With the aromatization of propane, Price and Kanazirev454 observed very long induction periods (up to 24 h) for ball-milled β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The authors ascribed this effect to the slow reduction process creating redispersed active Ga+ species that migrate into the zeolite interior where a solid-state ion exchange occurs. Pretreatment of the freshly prepared catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperatures was found to shorten the induction period and to increase activity. This kind of thermal pretreatment obviously anticipates reduction/redispersion of Ga species otherwise proceeding in the early stages of the catalytic reaction. Le van Mao and Yao455 could not confirm the transfer of gallium species into the interior of the zeolite. They found that extruding a wet mixture of a Ga-loaded silica cocatalyst, [Al]-ZSM-5, with a bentonite binder yields a hybrid catalyst for the aromatization of n-butane which is superior to the Cyclar catalyst. In this catalyst, gallium is considered to be very far away from the zeolitic acid sites. But due to the high Ga dispersion of the cocatalyst, a more rapid on-stream reduction is observed and the induction period of the catalytic reaction is shortened. The hybrid catalyst with separated zeolite and gallium component exhibits a long-term stability.147 Considering the magnitude of distances (several micrometers) to be bridged by migration of gallium between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it seems reasonable to modify the concept of bifunctional configuration of active sites based on adjacent gallium species and acidic protons. With zeolite matrix embedded α-quartz samples, an increase of the amount of quartz causes higher conversions of n-butane and a higher production of aromatics and molecular hydrogen. It is assumed that the contact areas between the quartz particles and the zeolite crystals are the actual places of activity.456,457 Kwak and Sachtler152,458 found that the chemical vapor deposition technique (CVD) to introduce Ga into H-ZSM-5 acts as a true ion exchange replacing protons by GaO+ ions. Conversion of propane and selectivity to aromatics run through a maximum with changing degrees of replacement of H+ by Ga+. Optimum yields were achieved with catalysts having Ga/(Ga + H+) ratios between 0.4 and 0.5. This points to a bifunctional mechanism catalyzing oligomerization and ring closure by acid sites. Nonframework Ga, in concert with H+, acts as dehydrogenating site. This is essentially identical to the conclusion drawn earlier by Meriaudeau and Naccache459 from their studies on the role of Ga2O3 and of Brnsted acidity on Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the conversion of propane.

The aromatization of propane over gallium-containing catalysts, specifically β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5, exhibits long induction periods due to the slow reduction process creating dispersed gallium species. Thermal pretreatment with hydrogen reduces these periods and enhances activity. However, Le van Mao and Yao's455 findings suggest that gallium remains distant from zeolite acid sites in a hybrid catalyst, leading to a more rapid reduction and shortened induction period. The hybrid catalyst demonstrates improved stability. The concept of a bifunctional configuration, involving adjacent gallium species and acidic protons, is modified to account for the distances between the cocatalyst and zeolite. Adding α-quartz to the zeolite matrix increases conversion and aromatics production, suggesting that contact areas between quartz and zeolite are the active sites. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) introduces gallium into H-ZSM-5, acting as a true ion exchange that optimizes propane conversion and selectivity to aromatics through specific Ga/(Ga + H+) ratios. This supports a bifunctional mechanism involving nonframework gallium and protons for oligomerization and ring closure, with gallium functioning as a dehydrogenating site.

在使用镓含量催化剂，特别是β-Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5，进行丙烷芳构化时，由于缓慢的还原过程导致分散的镓物种产生，因此表现出较长的诱导期。通过热预处理氢气可以减少这些周期并增强活性。然而，Le van Mao和Yao455的研究表明，在杂化催化剂中，镓与酸性位点保持远距离，导致快速还原和缩短了催化反应的诱导期。该杂化催化剂显示出了良好的稳定性。修改了双功能配置的概念，该概念涉及相邻的镓物种和酸性质子，以适应镓物种与沸石之间的距离。向沸石矩阵中添加α石英可以增加丁烷的转化率和芳香烃的产量，这表明接触区域是沸石和石英之间的活性位点。化学气相沉积（CVD）将镓引入H-ZSM-5，作为真正的离子交换，通过特定的Ga/(Ga + H+)比值优化了丙烷的转化和选择性到芳香烃。这支持了一种双功能机制，其中非框架镓和氢离子参与多聚化和环闭合，镓作为脱氢化位点。

Kanai and Kawata450 observed a decrease of activity for aromatization of n-hexane if the gallosilicate catalyst was treated with 1 M HCl prior to use. Activity could be enhanced afterward by addition of minor concentrations of Ga3+. These findings underline the supposition that nonframework gallium is the actual active species.

In summary, the slow hydrogen desorption rate is supposed to limit the progress of reaction to aromatics over H-ZSM-5 while the reverse hydrogen spill-over on Ga-ZSM-5 accelerates desorption of hydrogen, thus removing the kinetic bottleneck of aromatization. The adequacy of this BHS effect does not require a migration of Ga species, which, however, is shown to take place during reaction/regeneration or during reductive pretreatment procedures, especially in the presence of hydrogen.

In summary, the slow hydrogen desorption rate is believed to restrict the reaction progress to aromatics over H-ZSM-5, while the reverse hydrogen spill-over on Ga-ZSM-5 speeds up hydrogen desorption, thus alleviating the kinetic barrier for aromatization. The effectiveness of this back hydrogen spill-over (BHS) effect does not necessitate the migration of Ga species, which, however, is demonstrated to occur during reaction/regeneration or during reductive pretreatment, especially in the presence of hydrogen.

The alkylation of monoalkylbenzenes, the alkyl group which is already present activates the ortho and para ring positions for alkylation. Variation of the residence time and determination of initial selectivities showed that the para-isomer is the only primary product. This is caused by the strong geometric restrictions imposed on the formation of the transition state by the medium size pore system of the MFI structures. Ortho- and meta-isomers are formed exclusively by secondary isomerization on acid sites preferentially located on the external zeolite surface.

According to results reported by Burch and Scire, 539 who performed NO reduction by hydrogen in the absence of oxygen, carbonaceous residues as active intermediates in the selective reduction of NO on zeolite-based catalysts should be of minor importance. Higher conversions than those observed by ethane or methane as reductants have been achieved. The reaction, however, could not be performed in the presence of O2 because hydrogen preferentially reacts with O2 rather than with NO. The authors considered the mechanism in the presence of oxygen to be of a simple redox-type. Adsorption and decomposition of NOx proceeding at (reduced) metal sites are followed by removal of remaining adsorbed oxygen by the reducing hydrocarbon, thus restoring the (reduced) active site.
