[1] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."

[2] "For [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions."

[3] "With [Ga]-omega, Mirajkar et al.163 found a very broad band at 1060 cm-1 due to the asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration characteristic of poorly crystallized samples."

[4] "In both cases, the spectra, however, do not provide quantitative values of gallium concentration."

[5] "As nonframework gallium species are the actual active components in the Cylcar-type catalyst (see section VI) and their reducibility is crucial for the catalytic performance..."

[6] "The term gallosilicate implies complete absence of aluminum during synthesis. This, however, does not necessarily mean that aluminum is not present in detectable quantities in the synthesized crystalline materials..."

1. The presence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations indicates that gallium is incorporated into the zeolite framework positions.
2. The asymmetric TOT stretching vibration in [Al]-ZSM-5 shifts systematically with the aluminum content in framework positions.
3. In [Ga]-omega, a broad asymmetric SiOGa stretching vibration band at 1060 cm-1 is observed in poorly crystallized samples.
4. Spectral analysis does not provide quantitative values for gallium concentration.
5. Nonframework gallium species are the active components in the Cylcar-type catalyst and their reducibility impacts the catalytic performance.
6. Even though gallosilicates claim absence of aluminum, detectable quantities of aluminum might still be present in the synthesized crystalline materials.

1. SiOHGa伸缩振动的存在表明，镓被整合到沸石骨架位置。
2. [Al]-ZSM-5中，不对称TOT伸缩振动的位移与框架位置的铝含量系统相关。
3. 在[Ga]-omega中，低结晶样品显示出在1060 cm-1处由于非晶态特征的不对称SiOGa伸缩振动而出现非常宽的带宽。
4. 光谱分析无法提供镓浓度的定量值。
5. 非骨架镓物种是Cylcar型催化剂的实际活性成分，它们的还原性对催化性能至关重要。
6. 尽管gallosilicates声称不含铝，但在合成的晶体材料中可能仍然存在可检测的铝含量。
