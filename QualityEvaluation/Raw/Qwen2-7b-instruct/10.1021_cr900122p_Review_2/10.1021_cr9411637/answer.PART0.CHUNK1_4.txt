[1] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."
[2] "The positions of bands shift with changing composition depending on the kind and the content of the framework atoms."
[3] "Increasing framework Al content leads to a low-frequency shift of framework vibrations."
[4] "With [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions."

1. The presence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations in zeolites confirms that gallium has been integrated into the zeolite framework.
2. The infrared (IR) vibration frequencies of zeolite framework modes change with composition, influenced by the type and amount of atoms within the framework.
3. Adding aluminum to the zeolite framework results in a downward shift of the IR vibration frequencies.
4. In ZSM-5 modified with aluminum, the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration's frequency shifts systematically with aluminum content in the framework.
