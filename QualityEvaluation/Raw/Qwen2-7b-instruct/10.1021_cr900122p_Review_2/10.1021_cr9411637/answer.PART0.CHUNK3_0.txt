[1] "Suggestions and possibilities are sketched in detail for propane, the most widely applied alkane in aromatization studies in Figure 78."
[2] "In the case of propane aromatization, the attack of zeolitic protons produces intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions which rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4."
[3] "Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al.458 found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K)."
[4] "The bifunctional activation pathway comprises the concerted action of acid sites of the framework and those located at nonframework gallium."
[5] "The fast secondary reactions mask the primary chemistry, thus rendering the elucidation of the participation of the different gallium species definitely more difficult."

1. Detailed suggestions and possibilities for the aromatization of propane, the most commonly used alkane in such studies, are outlined in Figure 78.
2. During propane aromatization, zeolitic protons attack propane, forming intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions which rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4.
3. Kwak et al.'s analysis of initial product selectivities showed that adding gallium to H-ZSM-5 does not significantly affect the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene), but it increases the dehydrogenation rate by 7.7 times at a temperature of 803 K.
4. The activation pathway in the aromatization of alkanes, such as propane, involves a combined action of acid sites from the framework and those from nonframework gallium.
5. The complexity of secondary reactions obscures the primary chemistry, making it challenging to determine the specific roles of different gallium species.

1. 在图78中详细阐述了丙烷（最常用于芳香化研究的烷烃）的改质的建议和可能性。
2. 在丙烷芳香化过程中，由沸石酸性位点攻击丙烷，形成中间体C3H9+碳正离子，然后重新排列为C3H7+和H2或C2H5+和CH4。
3. Kwak等人对初始产物选择性的分析表明，在H-ZSM-5中添加镓对其裂解速率（甲烷和乙烷的等摩尔生成）没有显著影响，但在803 K时，其脱氢化速率增加了7.7倍。
4. 烷烃，如丙烷的改质途径涉及框架内酸性位点与非框架镓上酸性位点的协同作用。
5. 快速的次级反应掩盖了基本化学过程，使得明确不同镓物种的具体作用变得困难。
