The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The selectivity of olefin production is sensitive to the ratio of metal to other components in the catalyst. For instance, the selectivity towards C2-C4 olefins is affected by the metal content and the Si/Me ratio, with selectivity decreasing as the Si/Me ratio increases. Gallium-modified zeolites show higher selectivity for olefin production compared to aluminum-modified zeolites, likely due to their reduced acidity which suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins. The Brnsted acidity of the catalyst, which is associated with the strength of acid sites, plays a crucial role in the efficiency of alkane transformations. Above 600 K, the activity of Ga-modified catalysts is comparable to that of Al-modified ones. The concentration of strong acidic Brnsted sites, determined through chemisorption of pyridine at 673 K, influences the catalyst's performance. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂，如支持的二氧化钒和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。烷烃转化的选择性对催化剂中金属和其他成分的比例敏感。例如，C2-C4烯烃选择性的变化受金属含量和Si/Me比的影响，随着Si/Me比的增加，选择性降低。与铝改性沸石相比，镓改性沸石在烯烃生产中的选择性更高，这可能是因为它们较低的酸性抑制了中间烯烃的二次反应。沸石的Brnsted酸性，与酸位强度相关，对烷烃转化效率至关重要。在高于600 K的情况下，镓改性催化剂的活性与铝改性催化剂相当。通过在673 K下使用GC脉冲法化学吸附吡啶来确定强酸性Brnsted位点的浓度，影响催化剂的性能。这些因素共同决定了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。
