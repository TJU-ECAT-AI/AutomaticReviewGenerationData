The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, specifically supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations by affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. These catalysts are characterized by parameters such as specific surface area, pore size distribution, and metal loading, which determine the reaction pathways. The conditions under which the reactions occur, including temperature, pressure, and the use of promoters, also play critical roles in enhancing the catalytic activity and product distribution. The detailed mechanisms behind these transformations require a deep understanding of both the physical properties of the catalysts and the chemical kinetics of the reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their capability to increase the yield of valuable products, reduce energy usage, and minimize environmental impact.
