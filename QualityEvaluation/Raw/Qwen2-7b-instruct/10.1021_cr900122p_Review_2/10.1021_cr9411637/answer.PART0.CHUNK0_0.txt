The isomorphous substitution process allows for the replacement of framework atoms in crystalline compounds by atoms of other elements without altering the overall crystal structure. This phenomenon is well-studied in mineralogy and involves the replacement of atoms to a certain degree, typically to a low extent. The thermodynamics of isomorphous substitution is influenced by the electronegativity ratio and ionization potentials of the exchanging atoms. To achieve a state of minimum free energy, the condition Δr/r = 0.025 to 0.03 is met during the substitution of atom A by atom B while maintaining the same coordination number.

等晶位替换过程允许结晶化合物中的框架原子被其他元素的原子替换，而不改变晶体结构的整体类型。这一现象在矿物学中已被广泛研究，并涉及到以一定程度的替换，通常为较低程度。等晶位替换的热力学特性受交换原子的电负性比和离子化能的影响。为了达到最低自由能状态，在保持相同的配位数的同时替换原子A为原子B，条件是Δr/r = 0.025到0.03。
