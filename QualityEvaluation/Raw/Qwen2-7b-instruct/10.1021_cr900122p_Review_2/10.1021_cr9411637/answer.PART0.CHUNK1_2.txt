[1] "In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear."
[2] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."
[3] "For [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions."
[4] "The shift of the TOT framework vibration frequency to lower wavenumbers after isomorphous substitution of Si by larger atoms is due to the change in the reduced mass of the SiOT harmonic oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond by large T atoms."
[5] "One of the few shortcomings is the relatively low sensitivity and the problems which arise in the presence of paramagnetic nuclei."
[6] "The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of [Ga]-ZSM-5-type zeolites show main signals at δ = 105  0.8 and δ = 112.8  0.8 ppm, which are assigned to Si(1Ga) and to Si(0Ga) groups, respectively."
[7] "For an uncalcined gallosilicate [Ga]-ZSM-5 containing 3.37 gallium atoms per unit cell (Si/Ga = 28) in the as-synthesized form (i.e., with the tetrapropylammonium template inside the pores), one 71Ga NMR line located at +155 ppm with a line width of about 4.8 kHz was received."
[8] "Values for the chemical shift have been determined by extrapolation and plotted versus the framework and nonframework gallium concentration gained by chemical analysis and calculated from 29Si MAS NMR spectra (Figure 30)."

1. Infrared spectra show that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions through the presence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations.
2. Gallium incorporation shifts the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration of [Al]-ZSM-5 with Al content dependent on the gallium content.
3. The shift in TOT framework vibration frequency is caused by changes in the reduced mass of the SiOT oscillator and the lengthening of the TO bond upon isomorphous substitution.
4. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy faces challenges due to low sensitivity and issues with paramagnetic nuclei.
5. [Ga]-ZSM-5-type zeolites display 29Si MAS NMR spectra with main signals at δ = 105  0.8 and δ = 112.8  0.8 ppm, corresponding to Si(1Ga) and Si(0Ga) groups, respectively.
6. Uncalcined [Ga]-ZSM-5 contains a 71Ga NMR line at +155 ppm with a line width of about 4.8 kHz.
7. Chemical shift values for the 129Xe NMR spectrum are determined by extrapolation and plotted against gallium concentrations from chemical analysis and 29Si MAS NMR spectra.
8. The wavenumber of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration band in [Ga]-ZSM-5 is dependent on the total gallium content per unit cell.
