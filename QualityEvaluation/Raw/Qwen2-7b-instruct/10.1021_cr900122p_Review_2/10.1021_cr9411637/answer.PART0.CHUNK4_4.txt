[1] "In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios."
[2] "Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins."
[3] "Detailed studies revealed a dependence of the crystal morphology of [Ga]-ZSM-5 zeolites on synthesis time."
[4] "At higher Ga concentrations (and higher temperatures), the nonframework Ga begins to operate favoring aromatization of alkane/alkene intermediate products."
[5] "Because of their capability to aromatize alkane/alkene intermediate products, Ga-containing zeolites are not well suited for an optimum production of light alkenes from methanol."
[6] "The conversion of methanol to olefins over zeolites has currently been reviewed by Froment et al."
[7] "With microporous aluminophosphates and their Si-substituted analogues, the chabazite structure SAPO-34 was found to be highly selective for the production of light olefins with molar selectivities up to 96% at 100% methanol conversion."
[8] "Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used."
[9] "Nearly complete conversion of methanol was achieved over any of the [Ga]-ZSM-5 catalysts (Si/Ga ranging from 33 to 129) if the NH4+/Na+ exchange degree was higher than 90%."
[10] "A few percent of strong acid sites among the total amount is sufficient to guarantee high methanol conversion levels."

1. The selectivity of alkane transformations decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios.
2. Gallium-modified zeolites show higher selectivity for C2C4 olefins compared to aluminum-based zeolites due to reduced acidity.
3. Zeolite crystal morphology is influenced by the synthesis time.
4. Non-framework gallium enhances the aromatization of alkane/alkene intermediates at higher concentrations and temperatures.
5. Gallium-modified zeolites are not ideal for producing light alkenes from methanol due to their aromatization capabilities.
6. Conversion of methanol to olefins is comprehensively discussed in the literature by Froment et al.
7. The chabazite structure SAPO-34 is highly selective for light olefin production from methanol conversions.
8. Methanol conversion tests were conducted on samples with high NH4+/Na+ exchange levels and thermal pretreatment.
9. High conversion rates of methanol are achievable with gallium-modified zeolites if the exchange degree exceeds 90%.
10. A small fraction of strong acid sites is enough to ensure efficient methanol conversion.

1. 当Si/Me比增加时，烷烃转化的选择性会降低。
2. 含镓的沸石对C2C4烯烃的择形性高于铝基沸石，原因是其较低的酸性抑制了中间烯烃的二次反应。
3. 沸石的晶体形态受到合成时间的影响。
4. 高浓度的非框架镓在较高温度下促进烷烃/烯烃中间体的芳香化。
5. 含镓的沸石在甲醇转化为轻烯烃方面不是最佳选择，因为它们能促进中间体的芳香化。
6. 关于甲醇转化为烯烃的过程，Froment等人进行了全面的综述。
7. SAPO-34结构的钙质沸石在甲醇转化中表现出高度选择性地生成轻烯烃。
8. 对样品进行了高NH4+/Na+交换水平和4小时热预处理的测试。
9. 如果NH4+/Na+交换度超过90%，则任何镓改性的沸石（Si/Ga范围从33到129）均能实现几乎完全的甲醇转化。
10. 总酸位中少量的强酸位就足以保证高效的甲醇转化。
