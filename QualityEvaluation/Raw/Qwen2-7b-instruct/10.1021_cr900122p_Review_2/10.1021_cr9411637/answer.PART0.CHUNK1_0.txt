[1] "In this spectral range, absorption bands of stretching vibrations of the terminal silanol groups of acid-bridging GaO(H)Si groups and of the OH groups located at nonframework gallium species appear."
[2] "The occurrence of SiOHGa stretching vibrations prove that gallium is incorporated into zeolite framework positions."
[3] "The positions of bands shift with changing composition depending on the kind and the content of the framework atoms. Increasing framework Al content leads to a low-frequency shift of framework vibrations."
[4] "With [Al]-ZSM-5, a systematic shift of the asymmetric TOT stretching vibration is known to be dependent on the Al content in framework positions."
[5] "It is clearly indicated that one single framework IR spectrum alone cannot, by far, provide full proof for a successful gallium incorporation."
[6] "Because of their inherent advantages, solid-state NMR spectra have a great potential for the characterization of zeolites."
[7] "Gallium incorporation in framework positions is negligible."
[8] "Characterization of Brnsted and Lewis Acidity by Probe Molecules."
[9] "The IR vibration band of Brnsted sites (bridged hydroxyl groups) occurs at 3610 cm-1 in nonmodified H-ZSM-5."
[10] "A general quantitative correlation between acidic properties deduced from IR measurements and the results of activity tests for acid-catalyzed reaction is still missing."
