[1] "Suggestions and possibilities are sketched in detail for propane, the most widely applied alkane in aromatization studies in Figure 78."
[2] "The bifunctional activation pathway comprises the concerted action of acid sites of the framework and those located at nonframework gallium."
[3] "In the case of propane aromatization, the attack of zeolitic protons produces intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions which rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4."
[4] "Analyzing initial product selectivities, Kwak et al. found that the addition of Ga to H-ZSM-5 has no essential effect on the rate of propane cracking (equimolar formation of methane and ethylene) but increases the dehydrogenation rate 7.7-fold (T = 803 K)."
[5] "In summary, the slow hydrogen desorption rate is supposed to limit the progress of reaction to aromatics over H-ZSM-5 while the reverse hydrogen spill-over on Ga-ZSM-5 accelerates desorption of hydrogen, thus removing the kinetic bottleneck of aromatization."
[6] "Nonframework gallium species are extractable by acid leaching. Kanai and Kawata observed a decrease of activity for aromatization of n-hexane if the gallosilicate catalyst was treated with 1 M HCl prior to use."

1. Detailed suggestions for propane aromatization are provided in Figure 78.

2. A bifunctional activation pathway involving both framework acid sites and gallium-related sites is outlined.

3. The attack of zeolitic protons on propane leads to intermediate carbonium ions that rearrange.

4. Adding gallium to H-ZSM-5 affects the dehydrogenation rate without impacting the propane cracking rate.

5. Reverse hydrogen spill-over on Ga-ZSM-5 enhances hydrogen desorption, accelerating the aromatization process.

6. Acid leaching of nonframework gallium species can reduce the catalyst's activity for hexane aromatization.
