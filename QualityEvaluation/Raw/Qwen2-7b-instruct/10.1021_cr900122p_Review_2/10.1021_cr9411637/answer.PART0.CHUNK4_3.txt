[1] "In any case, selectivity decreases with increasing Si/Me ratios."
[2] "Compared with Al-ZSM-5, Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit higher selectivities of C2C4 olefins, which is ascribed to their weaker acidity suppressing secondary reactions of the intermediate olefins."
[3] "The selectivities of light olefins are 68.5% on [Al]-ZSM-11 (total conversion of methanol), 66.0% on [Ga]-ZSM-11, and 77.0% on [Fe]-ZSM-11 (degrees of conversion not specified)."
[4] "Samples with an NH4+/Na+ exchange level of 96% and 4 h thermal pretreatment at 873 K were used (Figure 103ac).he catalytically active sites were progressively poisoned by contacting the catalyst off-line with pyridine pulses, 3 μL each, at 673 K."
[5] "A few percent of strong acid sites among the total amount is sufficient to guarantee high methanol conversion levels. Higher concentrations of Brnsted sites, however, are necessary to allow formation of aliphatics and aromatics."
[6] "Due to the pulse technique, coke formation and its impact on the reaction characteristics could not be observed."
[7] "Incorporation of gallium into zeolitic materials aims, in the first place, at isomorphous substitution of framework elements by gallium during the synthesis stage."
[8] "Nonframework gallium is the source of Lewis acidity. Oxo cations GaO+ on exchange positions of the framework behave as Lewis acids."
[9] "The nature of nonframework species and the way they contribute to catalytic reactions are not yet fully understood."
[10] "The state of the art is constituted by the manufacturing of mesoporous silicates."
[11] "The application of gallium-modified zeolite-based catalysts in the exhaust gas cleaning suffers from structural changes occurring in the presence of moisture."

1. As the Si/Me ratio increases, the selectivity for alkane transformations decreases.
2. Gallium-modified zeolites show higher selectivity for C2-C4 olefins compared to aluminum-based zeolites, attributed to their reduced acidity that suppresses secondary reactions of intermediate olefins.
3. The selectivity for light olefins on aluminum, gallium, and iron zeolites varies, with gallium showing a slight advantage over aluminum and iron.
4. Gallium-ZSM-5 catalysts were treated with pyridine pulses to observe the progressive poisoning of catalytically active sites.
5. A certain percentage of strong acid sites is enough for efficient methanol conversion, while higher concentrations of Brnsted sites enable the formation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds.
6. The pulse technique prevented the observation of coke formation and its effects on reaction characteristics.
7. The primary goal of gallium incorporation into zeolitic materials is isomorphous substitution during synthesis.
8. Nonframework gallium acts as a Lewis acid source, specifically through oxo cations GaO+.
9. The mechanism of nonframework species' contribution to catalytic reactions remains unclear.
10. Modern technology focuses on producing mesoporous silicates for various applications.
11. Gallium-modified zeolite catalysts used in exhaust gas cleaning face structural issues when exposed to moisture.
