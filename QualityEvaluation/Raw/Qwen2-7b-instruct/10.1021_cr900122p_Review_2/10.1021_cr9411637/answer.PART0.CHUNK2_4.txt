The synthesis of mesoporous silicates, including M41S and FSM-16 materials, involves combining a surfactant molecule with a silicon source like SiO2 or TEOS. These materials are characterized by an ordered arrangement of uniform mesopores. The synthesis is conducted by aging the gel at room temperature or through hydrothermal treatment at temperatures between 40-120 C. A liquid-crystal templating mechanism is the favored method for synthesizing M41S materials. Gallium can be incorporated into these materials through the use of specific synthesis compositions, such as 0.0042-0.05Ga2O3, 1SiO2, 0.2NaOH, 0.27TMAOH, 0.27CTACl, and 60H2O for MCM-41 and related materials. For gallophosphate synthesis, a gel composition of zR:1Ga2O3:1P2O5:xHF:yH2O (where x = 0.22, 0, y = 40-300, z = 16, and R is the template molecule) is used.

合成介孔硅酸盐，包括M41S和FSM-16材料，涉及将表面活性剂分子与硅源（如SiO2或TEOS）结合。这些材料以均匀的介孔有序排列为特征。通过在室温下老化凝胶或在40-120℃下进行水热处理来合成这些材料。液晶模板机制是合成M41S材料的首选方法。可以通过特定的合成组成（如0.0042-0.05Ga2O3、1SiO2、0.2NaOH、0.27TMAOH、0.27CTACl和60H2O）将镓引入MCM-41和相关材料中。对于镓磷酸盐合成，使用zR:1Ga2O3:1P2O5:xHF:yH2O（其中x = 0.22，0，y = 40-300，z = 16，R表示模板分子）的凝胶组成。
