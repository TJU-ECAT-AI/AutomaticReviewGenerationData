1. During the process of propane aromatization, zeolitic protons attack propane to create intermediate C3H9+ carbonium ions, which then rearrange into C3H7+ and H2 or C2H5+ and CH4.

2. Kwak et al.'s analysis revealed that adding gallium (Ga) to H-ZSM-5 has minimal impact on the rate of propane cracking (resulting in equal amounts of methane and ethylene), but significantly increases the dehydrogenation rate by 7.7 times at a temperature of 803 K.

3. The thermal pretreatment of catalysts facilitates the reduction and redispersion of gallium species that would otherwise undergo these processes during the early stages of catalytic reactions.

4. Given the significant distances (ranging from several micrometers) that gallium needs to travel to migrate between the cocatalyst and the zeolite, it's logical to revise the concept of a bifunctional configuration of active sites, which involves adjacent gallium species and acidic protons.

5. The bifunctional activation pathway involves the collaborative action of acid sites within the zeolite framework and those situated at nonframework gallium sites.

1. 在丙烷芳构化过程中，择形沸石质酸原子攻击丙烷生成中间体C3H9+碳正离子，然后重新排列为C3H7+和H2或C2H5+和CH4。

2. Kwak等人分析发现，将镓（Ga）添加到H-ZSM-5中对丙烷裂解速率几乎没有影响（产生等量的甲烷和乙烯），但在803 K时，其脱氢化速率增加了7.7倍。

3. 催化剂的热预处理促进镓物种的还原和再分散，这些过程原本会在催化反应的早期阶段进行。

4. 考虑到镓需要跨越几微米的距离在催化剂的主催化剂和择形沸石之间迁移，重新定义活性位点的双功能配置概念是合理的，该配置涉及相邻的镓物种和酸性质子。

5. 双功能激活途径包括框架内酸性位点与非框架镓位点之间的协同作用。
