The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Metal-exchanged zeolites, due to their high activity and selectivity, have found extensive use in petrochemical industries. Supported vanadium oxides show superior performance in alkane transformations because of their strong acid sites and high surface area. In zeolite-catalyzed reactions, factors such as pore size, acidity, and metal loading determine the catalytic activity and selectivity.
