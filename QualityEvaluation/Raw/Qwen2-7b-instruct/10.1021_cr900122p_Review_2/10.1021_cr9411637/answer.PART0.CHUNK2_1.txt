The high-resolution 29Si MAS NMR spectra of galliumhydroxosodalite, which contains different amounts of gallium, were evaluated by Hayashi et al. and compared with aluminum hydroxosodalite. The spectrum of the aluminosilicate showed an asymmetric line overlapped by Si(4Al) and Si(3Al) signals. In contrast, the gallosilicate spectra were composed of two lines with δ = 75 and 83 ppm assigned to Si(4Ga) and Si(3Ga) configurations, respectively. Based on the relative intensities of the lines, it was estimated that 81% of the contribution comes from Si(4Ga) units and 19% from Si(3Ga) units in the sample with a Si/Ga ratio of 1.05.

Hayashi等通过高分辨率29Si MAS NMR光谱分析了含不同量镓的镓水滑石的结构，将其与铝水滑石进行了比较。铝硅水滑石的谱图显示了一个不对称线被Si(4Al)和Si(3Al)信号重叠。相反，镓硅水滑石的谱图由δ = 75和83 ppm的两线组成，分别对应于Si(4Ga)和Si(3Ga)配置。基于谱线强度的相对值，可以估计，在Si/Ga比为1.05的样品中，贡献的81%来自Si(4Ga)单元，19%来自Si(3Ga)单元。

The aluminosilicate framework of the zeolite omega consists of columns of gmelinite cages connected by oxygen atoms to form a 12-membered cylindrical main channel system along the crystallographic c-axis. The [Ga]-omega samples contained 0.09% of Al2O3, which was not detectable by 27Al MAS NMR, due to aluminum impurities in the gel components. The infrared lattice vibration bands for [Ga]-omega are shifted to lower wavenumbers compared to [Al]-omega. Both structure modifications remain stable up to 1000°C.

The term "natrolite" for a natural fibrous zeolite has been recognized since 1803. A solution of 40 wt % benzyl trimethylammonium hydroxide (BTMAOH) in methanol was used as a template. After 7 days of stirring at 175°C, the authors obtained [Ga]-natrolite crystals, consisting of anisotropic columns measuring 1020 μm in length with a nearly square cross-section. The average geometry for the two T sites, occupied by either Al or Ga, was found to be so similar that only one set of SinT (n = 04) peaks could be used to simulate the experimental spectra.

"Natrolite"这一术语自1803年起就被用来描述一种天然纤维状沸石。40%质量的苄基三甲基铵氢氧化物(BTMAOH)在甲醇中的溶液被用作模板。在175°C下搅拌7天后，作者获得了[Ga]-natrolite晶体，由长度为1020微米、近似正方形横截面的各向异性柱状晶体组成。两个T点位点的平均几何形状相似，无论是Al还是Ga占据，仅有一个SinT (n = 04)峰集可用于模拟实验光谱。

Newsam and Jorgenson synthesized the Ga-analogue of the cancrinite structure by adding NO3- ions to the gel compositions typically yielding gallosilicate sodalites (Ref. 110). After a synthesis time of 66 hours at 180°C, they obtained a solid product containing 85% [Ga]-cancrinite with a Si/Ga ratio of 1.022. Dehydration of the zeolites resulted in a small lattice contraction (0.2%) and a closer approach of sodium cations to the oxygen rings due to the loss of coordinating water molecules. Newsam (Refs. 97, 246) examined the impact of dehydration (achieved through vacuum treatment) on characteristic parameters of [Al]-L and [Ga]-L zeolites with identical Si/T ratios of 11.4.
