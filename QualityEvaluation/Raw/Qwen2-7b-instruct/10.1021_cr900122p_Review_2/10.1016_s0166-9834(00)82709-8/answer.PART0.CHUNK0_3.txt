The conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons over ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, specifically the zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms, has been investigated at temperatures between 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn exhibits higher activity and better BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) selectivity (up to 70%). The selectivity of BTX products decreases with increasing space velocity over ZSM-5-H, whereas it increases slightly over ZSM-5-Zn. Zinc in ZSM-5-Zn catalysts acts as a hydride acceptor, generating hydrogen through a transient species such as [Zn-HI+. The space velocity dependence of selectivity differs significantly between ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, with ZSM-5-Zn showing a slight increase in BTX selectivity at higher space velocities.

在730-820 K的温度范围内，对ZSM-5沸石催化剂的锌交换（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换（ZSM-5-H）形式进行了丙烷转化为芳香烃的转化研究。ZSM-5-Zn的活性更高，BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）选择性更好（高达70%）。随着空间速度的增加，ZSM-5-H中的BTX选择性降低，而ZSM-5-Zn则略有增加。Zn在ZSM-5-Zn催化剂中作为氢接受体，通过生成暂态物种[Zn-HI+来产生氢。ZSM-5-H和ZSM-5-Zn催化剂的产物选择性随空间速度的变化表现出显著差异，特别是ZSM-5-Zn在较高空间速度下BTX选择性略有增加。

The primary aspects of the conversion mechanism involve propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. The heat of adsorption data for Zn indicates very strong maximum acidity. At a significantly higher temperature, such as 999 K, as shown in Table 1, the conversion of propane over silicalite becomes considerable. Comparing the data in Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the conversion of propane over ZSM-5 catalysts results in notably higher yields of cracked (C1, C2) products compared to propylene.

转换机制的主要特征包括丙烷脱氢，随后是缩合和芳构化。吸附热数据表明Zn具有非常强的最大酸度。在更高的温度，例如999 K，如表1所示，丙烷向硅酸盐的转化变得显著。比较表1和2中的数据显示，丙烷在ZSM-5催化剂上的转化伴随着显著高于丙烯的裂解（C1，C2）产物的形成。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
For the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we propose that the zinc cation serves as a hydride acceptor to generate a transient species like [Zn-HI+ (resulting in hydrogen). The selectivity of BTX products over ZSM-5-H decreases with increasing space velocity, whereas it slightly increases over ZSM-5-Zn. In ZSM-5-Zn, the zinc cation behaves similarly as a hydride acceptor, forming [Zn-HI+ (and hence hydrogen).

对于ZSM-5-Zn催化剂，我们建议锌离子作为氢接受体，生成暂态物种如[Zn-HI+（进而产生氢）。ZSM-5-H中BTX的选择性随空间速度的增加而下降，而ZSM-5-Zn中BTX的选择性略有增加。在ZSM-5-Zn情况下，锌离子同样作为氢接受体，形成[Zn-HI+（进而产生氢）。
