The study of metal-based catalysts, particularly ZSM-5 zeolites in their proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) and zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) forms, reveals several key points regarding their role in alkane transformations, specifically in the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons. 

1. **Activity and Selectivity**: ZSM-5-Zn catalysts are more active and provide better BTX (Benzene, Toluene, Xylenes) selectivity compared to ZSM-5-H. This indicates that zinc-exchange enhances the catalyst's efficiency in producing BTX products from propane.

2. **Temperature Dependence**: Both catalysts show an increase in propane conversion with rising temperature. However, this trend is more pronounced in ZSM-5-Zn, suggesting that zinc-exchanged catalysts are more thermally responsive.

3. **Space Velocity Impact**: Increasing space velocity leads to a decrease in BTX selectivity for ZSM-5-H and an increase for ZSM-5-Zn. This difference in behavior is attributed to the unique mechanisms of dehydrogenation and aromatization occurring on these catalyst surfaces.

4. **Deactivation**: The catalysts exhibit slow deactivation over time, with a decrease in conversion rate ranging from 4 to 85 per hour. This suggests that the catalysts degrade gradually under continuous operation, affecting their long-term performance.

5. **Mechanism Insights**: The conversion mechanism includes dehydrogenation of propane followed by oligomerization and aromatization. Notably, the dehydrogenation step is rate-controlled on ZSM-5-H, whereas on ZSM-5-Zn, it reaches quasi-equilibrium.

6. **Product Distribution**: The composition of the products changes with space velocity. Over ZSM-5-H, the proportions of aromatic compounds decrease, while the proportion of Cl-C2 products increases. Conversely, over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity shows a small increase, indicating a different reaction pathway.

7. **Temperature Effect on Selectivity**: Both catalysts show an increase in the proportion of BTX products with increasing temperature, but this trend is more pronounced in ZSM-5-Zn, possibly due to the different mechanisms governing the conversion at higher temperatures.

These findings highlight the nuanced differences in the performance of ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts with various metal-exchanges, providing insights into optimizing conditions for alkane transformation processes, especially in the context of propane-to-aromatics conversion.

在对金属基催化剂，特别是ZSM-5沸石在质子交换（ZSM-5-H）和锌交换（ZSM-5-Zn）形式的研究中，对于丙烷转化为芳香烃的反应，在730-820 K的温度范围内揭示了一些关键点，涉及其在烷烃转化中的作用。

1. **活性与选择性**：ZSM-5-Zn催化剂比ZSM-5-H更活跃，并提供了更好的BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）选择性。这表明锌交换提高了催化剂从丙烷产生BTX产品的效率。

2. **温度依赖性**：这两种催化剂都显示随着温度升高，丙烷转化率增加。然而，在ZSM-5-Zn中这种趋势更为明显，表明锌交换催化剂在热响应上更加敏感。

3. **空间速度影响**：增加空间速度导致ZSM-5-H的BTX选择性下降，而ZSM-5-Zn则略有上升。这种不同的行为归因于这些催化剂表面上独特的脱氢化和芳构化机制。

4. **失活**：催化剂显示出缓慢的失活过程，转化率每小时减少4到85。这表明在连续操作过程中催化剂逐渐降解，影响其长期性能。

5. **机制洞察**：转化机制包括丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳构化。值得注意的是，在ZSM-5-H上脱氢步骤是速率控制的，而在ZSM-5-Zn上该步骤达到准平衡。

6. **产品分布**：随着空间速度的变化，产品的组成也发生变化。在ZSM-5-H上，芳香化合物的比例降低，而Cl-C2产品的比例增加。相反，在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性略有增加，表明不同的反应途径。

7. **温度对选择性的影响**：两种催化剂都显示出随着温度升高BTX产物比例增加的趋势，但ZSM-5-Zn中的这种趋势更为明显，可能由于在较高温度下控制转化的不同机制。

这些发现突出了具有不同金属交换的ZSM-5沸石催化剂之间的微妙差异，为优化烷烃转化过程提供了见解，特别是在丙烷到芳香烃转化的背景下。
