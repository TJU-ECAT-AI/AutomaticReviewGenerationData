[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%). Other reaction products were Cl-C2 hydro- carbons and C9, aromatics."
[2] "Over ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, while over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent."
[3] "We suggest that these effects arise because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium,with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-HI+,c.f. reaction 4."
[4] "Thus, at lower propylene reaction temperatures (e.g. 673 K, ref. 4), an examination of the product distribution data shows that there is a quantitative relationship between the proportions of aromatic and paraffinic (nz3) reaction products in the sense that the number of hydrogens required to be lost in the formation of the aromatics is equal to the number of hydrogens required to be gained in the formation of the paraffins."
[5] "The nature of the hydride abstraction reaction involved in aromatic genesis depends on reaction temperature."
[6] "However, under these conditions the nature of the reaction products is quite different to that obtained over the acidic catalysts: aromatic products are of negligible importance, and the reaction is almost entirely confined to dehydrogenation to propylene and cracking to C, and C2 hydrocarbons."
[7] "We suggest that these effects arise because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium,with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-HI+,c.f. reaction 4."

1. The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) zeolite was more active and provided better BTX selectivity in the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons compared to the proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) form. Other products included Cl-C2 hydrocarbons and C9 aromatics.
2. Over ZSM-5-H, the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, whereas over ZSM-5-Zn, the BTX selectivity slightly increased.
3. It was suggested that the effects of hydrogen on the level of propane conversion and the BTX content of the products arose because the respective dehydrogenation steps were in quasi-equilibrium. This was attributed to processes involving species of the type [Zn-HI+.
4. At lower propylene reaction temperatures, there was a quantitative relationship between the proportions of aromatic and paraffinic reaction products, where the number of hydrogens lost in aromatic formation equaled the number gained in paraffin formation.
5. The nature of the hydride abstraction reaction leading to aromatic formation depended on the reaction temperature.
6. Under certain conditions, the reaction products were predominantly dehydrogenation to propylene and cracking to C1 and C2 hydrocarbons, with minimal aromatic formation.
7. It was suggested that the effects of hydrogen on propane conversion and BTX selectivity arose due to the quasi-equilibrium between dehydrogenation steps involving species of the type [Zn-HI+.

1.ZSM-5-Zn型沸石的活性更高，苯系物选择性更好，在丙烷转化为芳香烃的过程中。其他产物包括Cl-C2烃和C9芳烃。
2.在ZSM-5-H上，空间速度增加时BTX选择性下降，而在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性略有增加。
3.研究表明，氢对丙烷转化水平和BTX含量的影响是因为相应的脱氢步骤处于准平衡状态。这归因于涉及类型[Zn-HI+的反应过程。
4.在较低的丙烯反应温度下，芳香族和烷基反应产物的比例之间存在定量关系，其中形成芳香族所需的氢原子数等于形成烷基所需的氢原子数。
5.芳香基生成的氢化物抽象反应的性质取决于反应温度。
6.在某些条件下，反应产物主要是脱氢为丙烯和裂解为C1和C2烃，芳香族形成极小。
7.提出氢对丙烷转化和BTX选择性的影响源于涉及类型[Zn-HI+的脱氢步骤之间的准平衡状态。
