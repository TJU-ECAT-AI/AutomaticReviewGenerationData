<p>The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K.</p>
<p>ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-70%). Other reaction products were Cl-C2 hydrocarbons and C9, aromatics.</p>
<p>In all cases, the propane conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature and the proportion of BTX increased, although this trend was more pronounced in the case of ZSM-5-Zn.</p>
<p>Over ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, while over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent.</p>
<p>The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization.</p>
<p>Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium.</p>
<p>Conversions of propane over ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts showed that the conversion of propane over ZSM-5 catalysts is accompanied by the formation of considerably greater amounts of cracked (C3, C2) products than are obtained from propylene.</p>

The study investigates the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons using ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, specifically focusing on the zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms. ZSM-5-Zn exhibited higher activity and better BTX selectivity (60-70%) compared to ZSM-5-H. Both catalysts saw an increase in propane conversion with higher temperatures, with ZSM-5-Zn showing a more pronounced increase. The BTX selectivity over ZSM-5-H decreased with increasing space velocity, whereas it slightly increased over ZSM-5-Zn. The conversion mechanism includes dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and aromatization. Cracking to Cl-C2 products occurs concurrently. The dehydrogenation step over ZSM-5-H follows a rate-controlled mechanism, whereas over ZSM-5-Zn, it is in quasi-equilibrium. Propane conversion over ZSM-5 catalysts resulted in significantly higher amounts of cracked products compared to propylene conversion.

研究了使用ZSM-5沸石催化剂（特别是锌交换（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换（ZSM-5-H）的形式）将丙烷转化为芳香烃的过程。ZSM-5-Zn在活性和对苯基甲基异构体的选择性（60-70%）方面优于ZSM-5-H。两种催化剂均在提高反应温度时看到丙烷转化率增加，其中ZSM-5-Zn的增加更为显著。ZSM-5-H上的BTX选择性随空间速度增加而降低，而ZSM-5-Zn略有增加。ZSM-5-H上的BTX选择性随空间速度增加而降低，而ZSM-5-Zn略有增加。转化机制包括脱氢、多聚化和芳构化。同时发生裂解至Cl-C2产物。ZSM-5-H中的脱氢步骤遵循速率控制机制，而ZSM-5-Zn中的步骤则处于准平衡状态。与丙烯相比，ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷转化产生的裂解产物显著更多。
