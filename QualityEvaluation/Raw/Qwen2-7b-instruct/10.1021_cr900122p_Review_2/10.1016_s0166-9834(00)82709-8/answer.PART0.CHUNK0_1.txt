<p>The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%). Other reaction products were Cl-C2 hydro- carbons and C9, aromatics.</p>
<p>In all cases, the propane conversion increased with increasing reaction temperature and the proportion of BTX increased, although this trend was more pronounced in the case of ZSM-5-Zn. Catalysts deactivated slowly on stream with a decrease in conversion in the range 4-85 per hour. The propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity over both types of catalysts.</p>
<p>Over ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, while over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity increased to a small extent.</p>
<p>The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation,followed by oligomerization and aromatization.</p>
<p>Cracking to Cl-C2 products is a concurrent reaction. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- ion is rate controlled,while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium.</p>
<p>The data in Table 1 for the reaction of propane over (non-acidic and zinc-free) silicalite show that if the temperature is high enough (e.g. 909 K), conversion can be substantial.</p>
<p>Under these conditions the nature of the reaction products is quite different to that obtained over the acidic catalysts: aromatic products are of negligible importance, and the reaction is almost entirely confined to dehydrogenation to propylene and cracking to C, and C2 hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Although the silicalite may have possessed some trace acidity due to residual trace of aluminium, the great differences in the reaction temperature regime and product distribution suggests that this reaction involved a quite different mechanism from that over acidic catalysts.</p>
<p>A comparison of the data in Tables 1 and 2 shows that the conversion of propane over ZSM-5 catalysts is accompanied by the formation of considerably greater amounts of cracked (C,, C2) products than are obtained from propylene.</p>
<p>It is clear that the enhanced level of C,, C2 production from propane, particularly over ZSM-5-H,implies the occurrence of a cracking reaction which does not proceed from iso.</p>
<p>Over ZSM-5-Zn only a small proportion of methane is formed distinguishing it from the reaction over ZSM-5-H and silicalite.This leads to the conclusion that a radical-chain mechanism probably does not make a significant contribution to propane over ZSM-5-Zn.</p>

1. The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite were studied for converting propane to aromatic hydrocarbons. ZSM-5-Zn showed higher activity and better BTX selectivity.

2. Increasing reaction temperature led to increased propane conversion and BTX selectivity, especially noticeable with ZSM-5-Zn. Catalysts deactivated slowly with a decrease in conversion rate.

3. Over ZSM-5-H, BTX selectivity decreased with increasing space velocity, whereas over ZSM-5-Zn, it increased slightly.

4. The conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation followed by oligomerization and aromatization.

5. Cracking to Cl-C2 products occurs concurrently. The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two catalyst types: over ZSM-5-H, dehydrogenation is rate-controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn, it is in quasi-equilibrium.

6. At high temperatures, conversion of propane over silicalite is substantial but differs significantly from acidic catalysts, with aromatic products being negligible and the reaction mostly confined to dehydrogenation to propylene and cracking to C, and C2 hydrocarbons.

7. The conversion of propane over ZSM-5 catalysts results in a higher amount of cracked (C,, C2) products compared to propylene.

8. ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show different dependencies of selectivity upon space velocity, with ZSM-5-H showing decreasing selectivity for total aromatic products and BTX with increasing space velocity, while ZSM-5-Zn shows an increase in BTX selectivity to a small extent.

9. A radical-chain mechanism does not make a significant contribution to propane conversion over ZSM-5-Zn, distinguishing it from reactions over ZSM-5-H and silicalite.

1. 研究了锌交换（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换（ZSM-5-H）形式的ZSM-5沸石催化剂，用于将丙烷转化为芳香烃。ZSM-5-Zn表现出更高的活性和更好的BTX选择性。

2. 随着反应温度的增加，丙烷转化率和BTX选择性均增加，尤其在ZSM-5-Zn中更为显著。催化剂随时间缓慢失活，转化率降低。

3. 在ZSM-5-H上，随着空间速度的增加，BTX选择性下降，而在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性略有增加。

4. 转化机制涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是多聚化和芳香化。

5. 拆裂到Cl-C2产物同时发生。主要脱氢步骤在两种催化剂类型上的机制不同：在ZSM-5-H上，脱氢速率控制，而在ZSM-5-Zn上，则接近平衡。

6. 在高温下，丙烷在无酸性和锌含量低的硅铝酸盐中的转化是实质性的，但与酸性催化剂相比存在显著差异，芳香族产物很少，反应主要是脱氢至丙烯和拆裂到C，和C2碳氢化合物。

7. 丙烷在ZSM-5催化剂上的转化产生更多裂解（C,, C2）产品，与丙烯相比。

8. ZSM-5-H和ZSM-5-Zn对空间速度的依赖性不同，在ZSM-5-H上，总芳香物和BTX的选择性随空间速度的增加而减少，而在ZSM-5-Zn上，BTX选择性略有增加。

9. 在ZSM-5-Zn中，丙烷转化过程中不存在显着的自由基链机制贡献，这与在ZSM-5-H和硅铝酸盐中的反应区分开来。
