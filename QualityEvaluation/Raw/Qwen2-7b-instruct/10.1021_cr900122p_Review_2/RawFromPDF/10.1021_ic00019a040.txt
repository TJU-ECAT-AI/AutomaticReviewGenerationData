isolated in a trigonal-bipyramidal form with [ N i ( ~ h e n ) ~ ] ~ +  
as the 
counterion. The large counterion PPN+, i.e. [(Ph3P)2N]+, 
has 
also been widely used to crystallize organometallic and carbonyl 
anionic complexes, e.g. [PPN] 
[HFe(C0)4]. 
The volumes of many of the cations and anions that form the 
basis of Basolo's generalizations have been calculated and used 
to compute the volume ratios Va/Vc (a = anion, c = cation) 
summarized in Table 111. It appears from the calculated anion 
to cation volume ratios given in Table Ill that the stabilization 
of unusual anionic coordination compounds may be achieved if 
the volume of the cation is greater than or equal to that of the 
anion. For example, in the series [NMe4I2[NiCI4], 
[NEt,],- 
[NiCI4], and [Ph3AsMeI2[NiCI4] 
the volume of the cation in- 
creases by a factor of 3 relative to that of the anion. The largest 
anion/cation volume ratio for the salts isolated as solids and listed 
in Table Ill is 1 .IO, 
and the smallest is 0.16. Therefore, contrary 
to previous suggestions, it is not necessary to match the cation 
and anion sizes with any great precision in order to stabilize 
unusual coordination environments and the cation volume may 
exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6. However, an anion 
with an unusual coordination environment is not likely to be 
isolated if Vu/ 
V, greatly exceeds 1.0. For example, the calculated 
Vu/ 
V, ratios for Li2NiC14 
and K2NiCI4, 
which cannot be isolated, 
are 50 and 10, respectively. Therefore, optimum conditions for 
crystallization are achieved when the cation is approximately equal 
to or larger in volume than the anion. The analysis is thus con- 
sistent with McDaniel's concept of a lower critical cation volume, 
with the lower limit corresponding approximately to Basolo's size 
matching criterion. 
The precise matching of the sizes of the cations and anions in 
molecular salts is not a dominating consideration in crystallization, 
since ions with quite different volumes can pack efficiently within 
a crystal by varying their coordination numbers. This effect may 
be illustrated by reference to the series of [PF6]- salts with 
spherical cations, whose packing coefficients have been summa- 
rized in Table 1V. Although the volume ratio ( 
Va/Vc) varies from 
1.7 to 14.7, the packing efficiency within the unit cell calculated 
from the volumes given in Tables I and I1 and the literature unit 
cell volumes lies within the narrow range of 64.6-71.5%. It is 
apparent from Table 1V that this is achieved by varying the 
coordination numbers of the cations and anions. Although the 
ions chosen in the table have relatively spherical geometries, similar 
considerations apply to ions with less symmetrical geometries. 
These results have encouraged us to develop a set of "radius ratio 
rules" for interpreting the structures of molecular salts, and these 
results will be described in subsequent publications.",'2 
It is apparent from the results presented in this paper that the 
crystallization of salts using large countercations may be 
successful 
even when the VJV, ratio falls to ca. 0.20, because the structure 
in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by 
varying the coordination number. The size effect may play an 
important role in the isolation process, however, if the cation is 
highly polarizing and is capable of forming a binary compound 
with a high lattice energy. For example, Li+ salts of [MX,]" 
anions are thermodynamically unstable6 because of the high lattice 
( I  I )  Mingos, D. M. P.; Rohl, A. L. To be published.

energy associated with LiX. For molecular cations M+ with a 
volume greater than or equal to that of the anion, there is a 
significant contribution to the lattice energy from van der Waals 
forces and the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X- 
is less critical. 
The variation in coordination number may not be important 
for characterizational purposes but could influence the magnetic, 
conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound 
significantly. 
The moments of inertia calculated for cations and anions provide 
objective criteria for evaluating their shape characteristics. For 
example, it is apparent from Table 111 that [dienH3I3+ 
is rather 
cylindrical in shape, whereas [Cr(NH3)6]3+ 
is effectively spherical. 
Therefore, although these counterions have similar volumes 
([dienH3I3+, 
108 A3, [Cr(NH3)6]3+, 
126 A3), 
only the chromium 
complex stabilizes the [CuCI5I3- ion. 
The complex [Pt(NH3)4] 
[CuC14] provides a particularly in- 
teresting example of size and shape matching. The volumes of 
the cation and anion are equal to within 1 A3, and their shape 
parameters are both indicative of discoidal geometries if the 
[CUCI~]~- 
ion adopts a square-planar geometry. In general, the 
packing efficiencies of discoidal molecules are greater than that 
of spherical molecules, which encourages the adoption of this 
geometry by [CuCI4l2-. 
The availability of the size and shape factors in Tables I and 
I1 should encourage the study of more systems where the coor- 
dination geometry is influenced by the shape of the cation. The 
complementary problem of stabilizing unusual cation geometries 
by selecting the appropriate counteranions could also be addressed 
using the data provided. It is noteworthy that currently there are 
few well-documented examples of this phenomenon.

Chemistry of (Si1ica)zirconium Dihydride 
Steven A. King and Jeffrey Schwartz* 
Received November 19, I990 
To most organometallic chemists, especially to those who use 
metals in 'fine" synthesis, the notion of organozirconium chemistry 
is intimately tied to that of a "soft" ligand environment which 
usually involves "Cp" (or Cp*) or phosphine ligation.' In contrast, 
well-known processes for ethylene or propylene polymerization2 
or olefin isomerization3 involve "hard", oxide-bound organo- 
zirconium compo~nds,~-~ 
including hydrides4 formed by hydro- 
genolysis4" of oxide-bound alkyls; apart from catalyzed olefin 
isomerization, the chemistry of these oxide-bound hydrides is

It was therefore of interest to us to compare the chemistry of 
zirconium hydrides in a hard (oxide) vs a soft ligation environment' 
in order to delineate the fundamental chemistry of oxide-bound 
zirconium hydrides and to learn if new reagent procedures based 
on 
them could be developed. 
Experimental Section 
General Procedures. All operations were performed in a Vacuum 
Atmospheres glovebox. Octane, THF, and ether were distilled from 
Na/benzophenone ketyl and stored in the glovebox. Pentane was dried 
over molecular sieves. Silica gel, Degussa Aerosil 300, was dried at 225 
"C (<0.1 Torr) for 24 h. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin- 
Elmer 1710 spectrometer. Pellets were made by pressing about 30 mg 
of sample to 8 tons on 
a hydraulic 
press. Gas chromatography was done 
on 
a Hewlett-Packard 5840 and 5970 chromatograph; 
GC-MS analysis 
was performed with a Hewlett-Packard 597 1 
A mass-sensitive detector. 
Proton NMR spectra were recorded on a General Electric QE-300 
spectrometer operating at 300 MHz. 
Tetramopentylzirconium? Neopentylmagnesium bromide in ether 
(20 mL, 1.12 M, prepared from neopentyl bromide and magnesium 
turnings and titrated9) 
was added to a stirred suspension of ZrCI, (1.35 
g, 5.80 mmol) in a 4 1  
mixture of ether and pentane (100 mL) at -40 
"C. The mixture was stirred overnight at 0 OC, allowed to warm to room 
temperature, and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated and extracted 
thoroughly with pentane. After filtration, the pentane solution was 
evaporated to give the title compound as a light tan solid (1.85 g, 85%). 
This material was pure by NMR analysis and was used without subli- 
mation. IH NMR (CDCI,): 6

and 
the solid was washed with pentane. Evaporation of the filtrate yielded 
no residue. The product was evacuated for 24 h with intermittent 
crushing to powder the material. IR (neat pellet): 3600 (br), 2960,2904,

Procedure for the Reactions of (Si02)ZrH2 
with Olefins and 
Acetylenes. The olefin or acetylene (1.0-2.0 mmol) was added to a 
stirred suspension of (Si02)ZrH2 
(50-80 mg) in 2-4 mL of pentane (for 
room-temperature reactions) or Octane (for those at 80 "C). 
Decane was 
commonly used as an internal standard. The mixture was stirred for 24 
h, and the solvent mixture was examined by gas chromatography. In- 
frared spectra of the catalyst were obtained by filtering off the solid, 
washing and drying it, and pressing a pellet. 
Cyclization of 1,s-Hexadiene. 1,s-Hexadiene (100 pL, 
68.8 mg, 838 
pmol) was added to a suspension of 1 (80 mg, 35.7 pmol) in Octane (2 
mL) and decane (25 pL). Them mixture was heated to 80 O
C
 for 24 h. 
GC analysis and comparison with an authentic sample showed that 1- 
methylcyclopentene had been formed in 64% 
yield (536 pmol; 15 turn- 
overs).

Trimerizatioa of I-Hexyne. I-Hexyne (100 pL, 71.6 mg, 872 pmol) 
was added to a suspension of 1 (80 mg, 35.7 pmol) in octane (2 mL) and 
decane (25 pL). The mixture was heated to 80 "C for 24 h. 1,2,4- 
Tributylbenzene and 1,3,5-tributylbenzene 
were formed in a 2:l ratio in 
16% yield (130 pmol of product; consumes 417 pmol of I-hexyne; 12 
turnovers). 
Deposition of HSi(OMe), onto Si02. Silica gel (500 mg) was added 
to a solution of HSi(OMe), (104 mg, 1.0 mmol) in pentane (25 mL). 
After being stirred overnight, the mixture was filtered, and the solid was 
washed with pentane. The product was dried in vacuo. IR (neat pellet): 
3420, 2958, 2856, 1858, 1630, 1460 cm-I; YS~+ = 2238 cm-I. The 
compound is air stable and undergoes none of the reactions of (SOz)- 
Zr-H species. 
Results 
Mechanistic studies on 
soluble Cp2ZrXY ("16e") species show 
that both halogen atom transfer (to Zr" 
and electrophilic 
attack (on 
ZrIV 
12) occur via a coordinative mechanism. Various 
reactions of (Si02)ZrH2 
illustrate both adduct formation and the 
need 
for adduct formation prior to reaction of the Zr-H bond with 
a substrate, modeling what is inferred, but not directly observed, 
for Cp2ZrXY systems. Cp2ZrXY 
complexes do not readily add 
exogenous ligands, but (Si02)ZrH2 
(vZr~ 
= 2254, 2190 cm-I) 
forms stable adducts," as 
does 16e (trit~x)~ZrCl~,*' 
even with THF 
(for (Si02)ZrH2.THF, uZrH = 2256, 2227 cm-I). The Zr-H 
bands in the adduct showed inverted intensities compared to those 
of the starting dihydride, presumably due to closing of the H- 
Zr-H angle by coordination of THF. In 
contrast with CpZZrH, 
which reacts rapidly with methylene chloride to give Cp2ZrHC1,15 
(Si02)ZrH2 
was unreactive; only when it was stirred in neat 
methylene chloride for several days was decomposition observed. 
Excess methyl iodide in pentane also failed to react with 1. 
Stepwise reaction was noted when (Si02)ZrH2 
was treated with 
protonic reagents.I3 Treatment with 1 equiv of ethanol at room 
temperature gave an adduct (vZrH = 2258,2230 cm-I) and, on 
heating (120 "C), a monohydride species ((SiO,)ZrH(OEt); v
~
H
 
= 2262 cm-I). Even when (Si02)ZrH2 
was allowed to react with 
5-25 equiv of ethanol in the gas phase at 120 O
C
 or in pentane 
solution, only this monohydride product was formed. Gaseous 
HCl (1 equiv) failed to react rapidly with (Si02)ZrH2. Instead, 
IR analysis showed attack on 
the surface of silica (

being heated 
(120 "C), the dihydride converted to the monohydride species 
(Si02)ZrHC1 
( v ~ ~ - ~  
= 2266 cm-I). Treating (Si02)ZrH2 
with 
2 equiv of 3-pentanone gave an adduct (vsH 
= 2219,2254 [sh]); 
uco = 1675 cm-I) which, on 
being heated to 120 "C, yielded the 
alkoxide (uZPH 
= 2258 cm-I). One equivalent of the ketone was 
recovered, and further treatment of the alkoxide with the ketone 
gave neither adduct nor 
dialkoxide. In 
contrast, both Cp2ZrH2 
and Cp2ZrHC1 
react rapidly with ketones or alcohols to give the 
dialkoxide and alkoxide chloride, respectively.16 Even excess HCl 
failed to react with (Si02)ZrHC1, at temperature as high as 180 
OC. From an "electronic" point of view, the high electronegativity 
of 0 
vs Cp- might make (oxide)Zr'v a more Lewis acidic, po- 
larizing species and, hence, a better *-acceptor from other ligands 
than is Cp2ZrIV. Thus, the surprisingly low reactivity of 
(Si02)ZrHX (X = *-donor group) in comparison with Cp2ZrIV 
analogues may be in part attributable to greater functional sat- 
uration of the zirconium center in the oxide-bound metal hydride.

olefin was isomerized to the thermodynamic mixture of linear

stronger *-donation by Cp than by silica should result in a weaker

failed either 
to form alkyls or to catalyze olefin isomerization. 
That (silica)ZrH2 is a good olefin polymerization catalyst 
suggests olefin "insertion" into a growing alkylzirconium chain 
is facile.17 An interesting variation on such olefin polyaddition 
is cyclization insertion of dienes. In fact, (Si02)ZrH2 
catalyzes 
cyclization of 1,s-hexadiene to methylcyclopentene (methylene- 
cyclopentane, the expected primary product of cyclization, un- 
dergoes double- 
bond isomerization to met 
hylcyclopentene under 
the cyclization conditions3). (See Scheme 11.)

metal acetylene trimerization catalysts may involve analogous 
metallacycles,26 
but known zirconacycles do not react with ace- 
tylenes to give arenes. Perhaps our reaction parallels routes 
proposed27 
for Pd(l1)-catalyzed cyclotrimerization and involves 
sequential acetylene insertion and 0-hydride elimination (via linear 
trimerization followed by cyclization). (See Scheme Ill.) 
Discussion 
Monomeric Cp2ZrXY species are nominally coordinatively 
unsaturated (16e), but *-donation from X and/or Y, 
inferred 
through both ~rystallography'~~~&~ 
and mechanistic analysis? can 
saturate the metal center. Unfortunately, no 
hard data exist to 
describe bonding between the -ZrH2 moiety and the surface of 
an oxide, but on the basis of structural studies for other oxide- 
supported Zr systemsy3' 
it may be that three oxygens of the support

Note: This implies that 
two OH groups of the support have reacted on deposition (as determined 
by measurement of RH evolution); 
one p o x 0  group is suggested also to 
be coordinated to Zr resulting in 5-coordinate

can interact with the metal. In this representation (Figure I), 
two oxygen atoms are "doubly" bridged and one is "triply" bridged, 
and all Zr-@Si 
angles are "bent". Electron counting for this 
arrangement can be done on the basis of structures reported for 
ZrOz (baddeleyite) and for soluble complexes containing Zr-0 
linkages. Baddeleyite contains two types of oxygen atoms:28 
tetrahedral, quadruply bridging ones ("sp3") and planar, triply 
bridging ones ("s$"). 
Two of the three triply bridged Zr-0 bonds 
are significantly shorter (2.05,2.06 A) than the five others in the 
unit cell (2.1 
5-2.28 A), suggesting *-interactions might exist for 
these oxygens (by "octet rule" electron counting, a 
*-bond order 
for each of these short interactions). *-Interactions for doubly 
Zr-bridging oxygens are also likely for (Cp2ZrX)20 
species (X 
= Cl,29a 
CH329b) and for (tritox)*Zr systemsI4 (tritox = 
[(CH,),C],CO-): 
in these cases14-29 
nearly linear Zr-0-Zr and 
C-0-Zr 
units and short Zr-0 bonds (Zr-0 = 1.94 and 1.895 
A, respectively) are consistent with sp 0 
and multiple *-inter- 
actions per 0. With this notion of multiple bonding, (trito~)~ZrCI~ 
has been described as a 16e system in which each 0 
of the alkoxide 
acts as a Cp- analog~e;'~ 
similarly, (silica)ZrH, can be thought 
of as a 16e species in which each of the three oxygen atoms of 
the support ligand serves 
as a 4e 
donor and (silica)ZrHCI, through 
CI to Zr *-donation, as an 18e species.

aminomalonate ligand (I) may be synthesized in high yield. 
Considerable discrimination may be obtained with respect to the 
mode of coordination of the aminomalonate, depending upon the 
nature of the tetradentate ligand. This may be employed in subtle 
ways to produce optically active aminoacidates via decarboxylation 
of the coordinated aminomalonate in aqueous acids6

Other prochiral branched terdentates could be used to similar 
effect. Should subsequent reactions be performed that do not 
involve the newly created chiral center, completely stereospecific 
chiral inductions are possible. One such prochiral terdentate is 
Mann's triamine, 1,2,3-triaminopropane (tap, 11), which could 
be used as a precursor for a number of optically active vicinal 
diamines providing five-membered chelate ring formation is in- 
volved. Some 50 years ago, Mann7 showed that tap could be 
coordinated to Pt(I1) and Pt(IV), with selective formation of 
five-membered chelate rings, and that [Pt(tap)Cl4]-HCI and 
[Pt(tap)CI,].HCI could be resolved into enantiomeric forms.7 
Unfortunately, these resolutions proved to be somewhat tedious, 
and the optically active complexes racemize in aqueous solution. 
Other systems may be used to overcome these difficulties, as with 
the researches of Wild et aL8 on the stereoselective coordination 
of glycerol to a chiral Pt(1l) complex. 
We have examined the coordination behavior of Mann's tri- 
amine with a Co(1II) complex containing the chiral tetradentate
