Abstract
The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal
supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous
catalysis. This paper is dealt with the current progress in catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane towards benzene and
naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts, in terms of templating role of zeolite micropores and metallic sites
on Mo and Re supported zeolite catalysts. The effect of zeolite supports and active metallic phases in conjunction with the
reaction conditions are discussed. The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between
the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed
by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
With the declining of crude oil reserves, the energy
supply is changing from being primarily oil based to
become more gas based. Methane is the major com-
ponent of most natural gas reserves, hence, it is im-
portant to investigate the conversion of methane from
the potential utilization of natural gas. On the other
hand, methane is the most stable and symmetric or-
ganic molecule consisting of four C–H bonds with
bond energy of 435 kJ/mol, accordingly, the investiga-
tion of methane conversion also is a great challenge
from the aspect of catalysis science.

A number of strategies are being explored for the
catalytic conversion of methane to more useful chem-
icals and fuels as reviewed by Lunsford [1]. The cat-
alytic conversion of methane can be divided into two
groups, which are described as indirect and direct. The
indirect processes rely upon the production of synthe-
sis gas, either by reforming reaction or by partial ox-
idation, followed by Fischer–Tropsch chemistry. For
the latter transformation route, methane can be con-
verted to the desired products, e.g. ethylene, methanol,
formaldehyde, and aromatics, directly. To date, the
greatest potential for advance in methane conversion
technology is the discovery of direct transformation
route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde
[2–4]. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alter-
native route for the direct conversion of methane had
been extensively studied since 1982. The splitting of

C–H bond is likely from the interaction between CH4
and the surface oxygen species [5]. A C2 selectivity
of 80% with a CH4 conversion of 20% can be ob-
tained over SrO/La2O3 [6] and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 [7]
catalysts. However, no catalysts could reach C2 yield
above 25% and selectivity to C2 higher than 80%, and
thus limit its industrial application.
Many processes related with methane conversion,
whether direct or indirect route, require the use of
oxygen, so the deep oxidation of methane is unavoid-
able. In order to suppress the formation of undesirable
products such as CO and CO2, many researchers
tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons
in the absence of oxygen. Mitchell and Wanyhorne
[8] reported that methane could be activated over
M/M′On/M′′O multi-component catalyst at 977 K
to form benzene and/or the carbonaceous deposit.
Belgued et al. [9] demonstrated that methane could
be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over a sup-
ported Pt catalyst via a two-step route. Bragin et al.
[10] found the aromatization reaction of methane to
benzene over Pt–CrO3/HZSM-5 catalyst at 1023 K in
a pulse-reactor.
In 1993, Wang et al. [11] reported that methane
could be transformed to benzene in a ﬂow mode reac-
tor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 cata-
lysts under non-oxidative condition. Since then, many
research groups concerned this catalytic process and
made inspiring efforts. Up to now, the research work
on this reaction can be sorted into the following parts.
(1) Catalyst modiﬁcation in terms of templating role
of zeolite micropores and metallic sites in conjunction
with optimization of reaction conditions. (2) Study of
the carbonaceous deposits focusing on the coke sup-
pression and characterization. (3) Synergetic effect be-
tween the metallic sites and the zeolite supports. (4)
Study of the active phases and reaction mechanisms.
Hereafter, we will focus on these aspects to present the
current advances in catalytic dehydrocondensation of
methane towards benzene and naphthalene over tran-
sition metal supported zeolite catalysts.
2. Catalyst modiﬁcation in terms of templating
role of zeolite micropores and metallic sites
Many researchers have tried a lot of catalysts, in
order to improve the catalyst activity, selectivity and
stability as summarized in [12]. It is generally accepted
that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as re-
ported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen
et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [16–19], Wang et al. [20,21],
and Liu et al. [22,23]. It is important to note the re-
sults reported by Wang et al. [20,21] and Liu et al.
[22,23], they noticed and analyzed the production of
naphthalene and quantitatively on-line calculated the
coke formation by using the internal standard of N2
and Ar. It also should be noticed that the coke evalu-
ation from GC analysis consists of all the undetected
carbon products such as amorphous and graphitic in-
ert carbons that are difﬁcult to detect and analyze with
on-line gas chromatographs. In order to look at unde-
tected carbon species, Liu and co-workers [23,24] an-
alyzed all the condensable products in the efﬂuent gas
separated for 4 h by using the ethanol-dry ice trap in
the methane reaction at 973 K on 3% Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alyst. The collected reaction products were analyzed
by the GC/MS with a capillary column (OV-1, 25 m)
up to 553 K and TOFRM (time-of-ﬂight reﬂect-mass)
spectrometer. The results show that a list of aromatic
compounds, such as benzene and naphthalene as the
major products, and other polycondensed aromatics,
such as anthracene, pyrene, tetracene, and their deriv-
iates which were collected as products of the methane
reaction. Lu et al. [25] testiﬁed the internal standard
analysis method by the data of material balance from
a 20 ml bench scale reactor.
Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transi-
tion metal ions, the preparation and treatment method.
They found that the activity is in the following se-
quence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. Later, Zeng et al.
[27] reported the W–H2SO4/HZSM-5 was a good cat-
alyst for methane aromatization at 1123 K, however,
the formation of coke was neglected. On the other
hand, it should be noted that the addition of a sec-
ond metal component is also studied as shown in [12].
The improvement in enhancing activity or stability has
been obtained by addition with Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and
Cu [22,28–31].
During the past 8 years, the catalyst modiﬁcation
in term of zeolite micropores was extensively studied
[23,32–37]. Some of typical results are listed in Table
1. Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over
Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of
zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silica–alumina
zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and 

possessing two-dimensional structure and pore di-
ameter equaling the dynamic diameter of a benzene
molecule, are ﬁne supports for methane dehydroarom-
atization catalysts. Liu et al. [23] studied the direct
conversion of methane to aromatics on a series of Mo
supported catalysts using HZSM-5, FSM-16, morden-
ite, USY, SiO2, and Al2O3 as the supporting materials
based on the total carbon balances. Among all the sup-
ports used, the HZSM-5 supported Mo catalysts ex-
hibit the highest yield of aromatic products, achieving
over 70% selectivity of total hydrocarbons at 5–12%
methane conversion at 973 K. Recently, the further
study on the templating role of zeolite micropores was
reported [33]. It was concluded that the zeolites having
pore size of 5–6 Å, similar as the kinetic diameters of
benzene and naphthalene molecules are good carriers.

investigated
the

performance
of
Mo
supported
microsized
and
nanosized HZSM-5 zeolites. The catalytic perfor-
mance of Mo/micro-HZSM-5 is better than that of
Mo/nano-HZSM-5. Recently, Shu et al. report that
HZRP-1 zeolite, a kind of phosphoric and rare earth
oxide-containing penta-sil type high-silica zeolite,
was a good support for methane dehydroaromatiza-
tion catalyst [35]. Compared with Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alysts, Mo/HZRP-1 catalysts are more active at high
Mo loading. Finally, they found Mo/HMCM-22 was
a highly selective catalyst for benzene formation in
methane dehydroaromatization [36]. The selectivity to
light aromatics of 80% at a CH4 conversion of 10.0%
was obtained on 6% Mo/HMCM-22 at 973 K. The

comparative reaction results on Mo/HMCM-22 and
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1 [37]. The
catalytic performance on Mo/HMCM-22 is featured
with a higher yield of benzene and a lesser yield of
naphthalene in comparison with that on Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst. In addition, it was found that more coke
formed on Mo/HMCM-22 catalyst. They proposed
the catalytic feature on the Mo/HMCM-22 catalyst
be mainly related with its unique pore system. The
typical framework structure of MCM-22 and ZSM-5
zeolites are presented in Fig. 2. For ZSM-5 zeo-
lite, it possesses a two-dimensional channel system
which consists of straight channels running parallel
to [0 1 0], having 10-ring of 5.3 × 5.6 Å free diam-

eter, as well as sinusoidal channels running parallel
to [1 0 0], having 10-ring of 5.1 × 5.5 Å free diame-
ter. For MCM-22 zeolite, its topological structure is
composed of an interconnected building unit forming
two independent pore systems: two-dimensional sinu-
soidal 10-ring interlayer channels of 4.0 × 5.9 Å and
12-ring interlayer supercages of 7.1 × 18.2 Å with
4.0 × 5.4 Å entrance aperture. The relatively smaller
size of pore mouth of MCM-22 may contribute to
its higher benzene selectivity than that of ZSM-5.
On the other hand, large numbers of 7.1 × 18.2 Å
cavities existed on MCM-22 zeolite was contributed
to its higher coke tolerance than that of ZSM-5
zeolite.

The previous studies had demonstrated that, besides
Mo active component, only transition metals such as
Fe, V, Co, and W showing slight activity of methane
to aromatics were reported before 1999 [23,26,27,29].
Recently, Wang et al. [38,39] reported a novel and
promising system of Re/HZSM-5 for the catalytic de-
hydrocondensation of methane. Representative result
is shown in Fig. 3. It was found that C2 hydrocar-
bons and aromatic compounds such as benzene and
naphthalene were continuously obtained with a con-
siderable evolution of hydrogen. The results on the
Fig. 3. Catalytic performance of 5Re/HZSM-5 in the dehydro-
condensation of methane at 973 K, 3 atm, and 1440 ml/g cat/h of
methane space velocity: (a) rates of product formation and of
methane conversion; and (b) formation selectivities in the methane
consumed vs. time on stream, where () refers to both the methane
conversion rate and methane conversion percent. Symbols (),
(), (), (△), and (+) refer to the formation rate of product
and the formation selectivity of hydrocarbons, ethane + ethene,
benzene, naphthalene, and coke, respectively [38].
Re/HZSM-5 show that the benzene selectivity based
on the consumed methane exceed 65% at the maxi-
mum value, due to the modest formation of coke and
polycondensed byproducts. Similar to Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst, high methane conversion and formation rate
of benzene was achieved on the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst.
In addition, optimization of reaction conditions had
also been studied. The experimental results showed
that various pretreatment and different reaction con-
ditions exerted great inﬂuence on the catalytic per-
formance as summarized in [12]. Pierella et al. [40]
and Choudhary et al. [41] studied the effect of the
presence of light hydrocarbons in the methane feed.
They all observed the conversion of methane at the
lower temperatures (673–873 K). Recently, Borry et al.
[42] investigated the non-oxidative catalytic conver-
sion of methane with continuous hydrogen removal
by simulation of membrane reactors. They suggested
that the removal of H2, perhaps by membrane separa-
tion, would shift the equilibrium of the methane dehy-
droaromatization and allow the higher conversion of
methane to be achieved.
3. Study of the carbonaceous deposits
The heavy carbonaceous deposit formed in methane
dehydrocondensation is a major obstacle for a bet-
ter understanding of the reaction and its practical
utilization. Ichikawa and co-workers [24,43,44] re-
ported the unique promotional effect of CO and CO2
on the catalytic stability for benzene and naphtha-
lene production on Mo/HZSM-5 and Fe/Co-modiﬁed
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst owing to the efﬁcient suppres-
sion of coke formation. The representative results
are plotted in Fig. 4. For Co modiﬁed Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst the methane reaction with CO yields higher
activities (950–1000 nmol/g cat/s in carbon base) of
benzene production with good stability for more than
100 h due to the minimization of the coke formation
to less than 20%. By contrast, the activity of the cat-
alyst decreased greatly under pure methane feed at
the same reaction conditions. Similarly, the stability
of the catalyst was also improved by adding a few
per cent CO2 into the methane feed gas. It is demon-
strated that added CO2 is converted to 2 mol of CO
by the reforming process (CO2 +CH4 = 2CO+2H2)
or by the reverse Boudart reaction (CO2 +C = 2CO).

using pure methane and on 3% Mo/HZSM-5 () and on 1% Co, 3% Mo/HZSM-5 (⊞) using methane + 4% CO at 973 K and 1 atm [44].
13CO isotopic labeling tracer studies [24] demon-
strated that 13C from 13CO is easily incorporated into
methane and products such as benzene and ethylene.
The unique role of CO addition to methane feed is
based on the formation of minute amounts of CO2 and
C by the Boudart reaction, where C is hydrogenated
to a common active carbon species [CHx] involving
methane conversion toward aromatic products such as
benzene and naphthalene, while CO2 reacts with the
surface inert carbon species (coke) to regenerate CO,
resulting in improved catalyst stability due to efﬁcient
suppression of coke formation on the catalyst.
Yuan et al. [45] studied the effect of oxygen on the
methane dehydroaromatization over the Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst and found that the small amount of oxygen
is beneﬁcial to improve the durability of the catalyst.
They suggested that the small amount of O2 partly re-
moves the coke deposits on the active sites and keeps
the catalyst as MoOxCy/HZSM-5. Lu et al. [25] found
that the pretreatment on HZSM-5 zeolite by steams re-
duced the serious deposition of coke on Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst.
Weckhuysen et al. [46] characterized the surface
carbon formed during the methane conversion on
Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts by XPS technique. They iden-
tiﬁed three different types of surface carbon species
existed, which denoted as species A, B, and C, re-
spectively. Species A, with a C1s bonding energy
(BE) of 284.6 eV, was due to graphitic-like carbon.
Species B, with a C1s BE of 282.7 eV, was due to
carbidic-like carbon in Mo2C. Species C, with a
C1s BE of 283.2 eV was a hydrogen-poor sp-type or
pre-graphitic type of carbon. It was suggested that the
sp-type carbon gradually covers both the zeolite sur-
face and the Mo2C phase during methane activation
and is responsible for the deactivation of Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst in methane dehydroaromatization.
Jiang et al. [47] studied the carbonaceous deposits
on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst by NMR technique. They in-
dicated that there are two kinds of carbonaceous de-
posits, one is located on partially reduced Mo species
and the other is on acid sites of zeolite. The former
is responsible for methane activation and transforma-
tion from cabene-like species and/or carbide species
to ethylene. The latter is active for the formation of
aromatics from ethylene. Yuan et al. [45] character-
ized the carbonaceous deposits by UV-Raman spec-
troscopy, and disclosed that the carbonaceous deposits
formed on Mo/HZSM-5 is mainly polyaromatic.
Ichikawa and co-workers [24,39,44] studied the
carbonaceous deposits formed on the catalyst surface
in methane aromatization without or with CO/CO2

addition by TPO experiment. Some typical results
are depicted in Fig. 5. It was demonstrated that
there are mainly two kinds of coke produced and
the coke amount was greatly reduced by adding var-
ious amounts of CO or CO2 to the methane feed
gas. The increase in CO concentration from 1.7 to
12.0% in methane ﬂow resulted in a marked sup-
pression of the total coke formation, particularly
the irreversible or inert coke which was oxidized to
CO2 at the higher temperature above 773 K in TPO
experiment. On the other hand, the CO2 addition
(1.6–4%) to methane feed effectively reduced both
the inert and the reactive coke, as a result, leav-
ing a small amount of the reactive coke, which is
oxidized at temperatures lower than 690 K. These
TPO data are consistent with the catalytic perfor-
mance of methane aromatization by addition of
CO2 to methane feed, different from those of CO
addition.
Recently,
Ma
et
al.
[48]
studied
the
coked
Mo/HMCM-22 sample by TPO technique. There are
two peaks located at 742 and 830 K were observed,
implying that at least two kinds of coke exist on the
catalyst surface. It was suggested that the deactivation
of the catalysts be mainly due to the carbonaceous
deposits on the zeolite acid sites. Finally, Ding et al.
[49] studied the evolution of COx and H2O when
samples used for CH4 reactions are treated in 40%
O2/He and the temperature is increased from room
temperature to 973 K. Three COx peaks were de-
tected. They assigned these peaks to the combustion
of (1) carbidic carbon in MoCx; (2) carbonaceous
species within zeolite channels near Mo species that
catalyze O2 dissociation step; and (3) carbon deposits
distant from these Mo species.
4. Synergetic effect between the metallic sites
and the zeolite supports
The synergetic effect between the metallic sites and
the zeolite supports is of signiﬁcance for the better
understanding of methane dehydrocondensation re-
action. Xu et al. [50] characterized the interaction
between ammonium heptamolybdate and NH4ZSM-5
zeolite at different stages of catalyst preparation by
FT-IR and different TP techniques. The results showed
that if Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were calcined at a proper
temperature, the Mo species would interact with acid
sites (mainly with Brönsted acid sites) and part of the
Mo species will move into the channel. If it is cal-
cined at 973 K, a strong interaction between the Mo
species and the skeleton of HZSM-5 will occur ac-
companying the formation of MoO42−species, which
is detrimental to methane activation. The group of Xu
et al. [51] also investigated the active Mo species by
NH4OH extraction combined with XRD, NH3–TPD
and TPR analyses. Further they studied the interaction
by solid NMR with a 27Al and 29Si probe [52]. The
results showed that there is a strong interaction be-
tween the Mo species and the framework Al and this
kind of interaction could lead to the extraction of the
framework Al.
Solymosi et al. [16–19] and Wang et al. [20,21]
conducted XPS, ion-scattering spectroscopy (ISS)
and FT-IR measurements on the Mo/HZSM-5 cata-
lyst. The Mo species in a sample calcined at 403 K
62
Y. Shu, M. Ichikawa / Catalysis Today 71 (2001) 55–67
was mainly presented as small (30–50 Å) crystallites
of the original ammonium heptamolybdate. After cal-
cination at higher temperature (773–973 K), the Mo
species became more highly dispersed on the external
surface. During preparation, a portion of the Mo ions
diffused into the channels. The FI-IR spectra showed
that the intensities of three stretching bands at 3747,
3611 and 3670 cm−1 diminished with the introduc-
tion of Mo on HZSM-5 zeolite, demonstrating the
interaction between Mo and zeolite support. Zhang
et al. [53] found the direct evidence for migration of
molybdenum into the zeolite pores during calcination
at high temperature by FT-IR, 27Al and 29Si NMR
experiments.
Liu and co-workers [23,43] studied the bifunctional
catalysis of Mo/HZSM-5 in the dehydrocondensation
of methane by XAFS/TG/DTA/MASS/FT-IR charac-
terizations. The TG/DTA/MASS and EXAFS stud-
ies reveal that the Mo oxide supported on HZSM-5
is endothermically converted with methane at 955 K
to molybdenum carbide Mo2C, which initiates the
methane conversion around 960 K, yielding benzene,
naphthalene, and C2 hydrocarbons. The IR measure-
ments in pyridine adsorption reveal that Mo/HZSM-5
catalysts having the optimum SiO2/Al2O3 ratio be-
tween 20 and 70 show the maximum Brönsted acidity.
A remarkable synergetic promotion in benzene forma-
tion exists for the hybrid catalysts consisting of 3%
Mo/SiO2 + HZSM-5 and Mo2C + HZSM-5, whereas
each component by itself shows marginal activity in
the reaction. They discussed the bifunctional catal-
ysis by analogy with the promotion mechanism on
the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for the dehydroaromatization of
alkanes.
Iglesia and co-workers [54,55] investigated the
structure of Mo and acid sites in Mo-exchanged
HZSM-5 catalyst by stoichiometry of the solid-state
exchange reaction. The amount of H2O evolved dur-
ing the exchange and the amount of residual OH
groups detected by isotopic equilibration with D2
showed that each Mo atom replace one H+ during
exchange. This stoichiometry and the requirement
for charge compensation suggests that exchanged
species consist of (Mo2O5)2+ ditetrahedral structures
interacting with two cationic exchange sites. Li et al.
further studied the structure of MoOx and MoCy in
Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst by in situ Raman and X-ray
adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) [56]. Finally, they de-
scribed the recent results dealing with the reduction,
carburization, and migration of Mo species during
methane reaction [49]. It was reported that the re-
duction and carburization of (Mo2O5)2+ species on
Mo/HZSM-5 cause the formation of MoCx parti-
cles and the concurrent regeneration of the bridging
OH groups initially displaced by the Mo oxo dimers
during exchange.
Ma et al. [57] studied the interaction between
Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite by ESR technique.
Four different EPR signals, denoted as signals A, B,
D, and E, respectively, have been recorded on the
Mo/HZSM-5 sample during its reduction by methane.
There are two kinds of Mo species observed on the
Mo/HZSM-5 sample, the ﬁrst kind is polynuclear and
located on the external surface, while the second kind
is associated with the Al in the lattice channels of
the zeolite. The hyperﬁne EPR signals of migrating
Mo ion (signals D and E) demonstrated the intense
interaction between the Mo species and the lattice Al
atom.
Bao and co-workers investigated the synergetic ef-
fect between Mo and zeolite supports on Mo modiﬁed
HZSM-5 [34,58–60], HZRP-1 [61] and HMCM-22
[62] catalysts by in situ MAS NMR technique. The
interaction between Mo species and zeolite sup-
port was so strong that the framework aluminum
could be extracted, accompanied by the formation of
Al2(MoO4)3 crystallines. 27Al MAS NMR spectra in
the calcined and reacted Mo/HZRP-1 catalysts [61]
revealed that the presence of tetrahedral framework
aluminum, which is associated with the formation
of Brönsted acidic sites, is of great signiﬁcance for
methane dehydroaromatization. Finally, they ﬁrstly
observed the variation of the amount of Brönsted acid
sites during a real methane dehydroaromatization re-
action, as well as the formation of water, benzene,
and aromatic carbonaceous deposits by in situ 1H
MAS NMR spectroscopy [60]. The representative 1H
MAS NMR spectra of 6% Mo/HZSM-5 are presented
in Fig. 6. As shown, on increasing the temperature
to 973 K for 10 min, the Brönsted acid signal at
δ = 4.1 decreased drastically, and two new resonance
at δ = 6.8 and 7.9 emerged clearly when the reaction
time was prolonged. The peak at δ = 6.8 is assigned
to the water molecules formed and adsorbed during
the reaction, whereas the signal at δ = 7.9 is assigned
to the hydrogen atoms of the aromatic species that are

acid sites. This gives a vivid description of what has
happened on the catalyst surface during the methane
dehydroaromatization than data from the gas phase
analysis.
5. Active species and reaction mechanisms
The mode of methane activation is one of hot top-
ics concerned with methane dehydrocondensation and
many kinds of active sites and reaction mechanisms
have been proposed. By X-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) technique, Solymosi et al. [16,17]
found Mo2C was formed on the used catalyst and
regarded this as the active species. Further they stud-
ied the catalytic performance of unsupported and
supported Mo2C [18,19] and concluded that, besides
Mo2C, the presence of the oxygen deﬁcient MoO2
probably was also responsible for the methane acti-
vation.
Wang et al. [20,21] also characterized the Mo/
HZSM-5 catalyst by XPS technique and found that
during the initial induction period, CH4 reduced the
Mo6+ in the zeolite to Mo2C accompanied by car-
bonaceous deposits. Pretreatment of the catalyst in a
CH4/H2 gas mixture at 973 K reduces Mo6+ ions in
the calcined catalyst into Mo2C and almost eliminates
the induction period, conﬁrming that Mo2C is the ac-
tive species in the activation of methane. They found
that pre-formation of Mo2C, without coke deposit,
could not completely eliminate the induction period.
So they suggested that a coke modiﬁed Mo2C might
be the active species in the formation of ethylene.
Surrounding the study of the active species, XPS,
TPR, DTA, EPR, MASS and simulation study were
successively used by the group of Xu and Bao
[29,30,48,57,63]. By EPR technique, Ma et al. [57]
proposed that the fully reduced Mo2C species re-
sulted from the MoO3oct species crystallites and
the MoOxsqu species, and the partially reduced Mo
species formed from the Mo species associated with
the Al atom are responsible for methane dehydroarom-
atization. They also investigated the nature of the
induction period as well as the environment needed
for methane aromatization over different Mo-based
catalysts by TP technique [48]. It was demonstrated
that the molybdenum carbide, which can continu-
ously activate methane even when multiple layers of
carbonaceous species are formed on its surface, and
Brönsted acid sites, to which the activated intermedi-
ate can migrate, together with the particular channel
structure of zeolite, are key roles for methane dehy-
droaromatization. Recently, Zhou et al. performed
Monte Carlo calculation simulation study on the ab-
sorption of molybdenum species in the channels of
HZSM-5 zeolite [63]. Two models of mobile Mo
species were designed and their sorption in HZSM-5
zeolite
pores
were
investigated.
The

calculation
results
suggest
that
the
tetrahedral
co-ordinated MoO2(OH)2 should be possible mobile
Mo species in ZSM-5 zeolite pores.
To characterize the active phase and elucidate the
mechanism of methane dehydrocondensation to ben-
zene, Mo K-edge EXAFS and TG/DTA/MASS/FT-IR
techniques were used by Ichikawa and co-workers
[23,38,39,43]. The representative EXAFS results are
shown in Fig. 7. The FT function of the Mo/HZSM-5
samples reacted with the methane at 973 K showed
peaks at the same position as those for the Mo2C
reference. After the reaction with methane, the Mo
oxide species is converted with methane to Mo2C
cluster (Mo–Mo: CN = 2.1–2.5, R = 2.96–2.98 Å;
Mo–C: CN = 0.8–0.9, R = 2.12–2.14 Å), in com-
parison with those of the Mo2C reference (Mo–Mo:
CN = 12, R = 2.97 Å; Mo–C: CN = 3, R = 2.10 Å)
[23,43]. The XANES/EXAFS and TG/DTA/MASS
studies reveal that the zeolite supported Mo oxide
is endothermally converted to molybdenum carbide
(Mo2C) cluster under methane, which initiates the
methane aromatization to benzene and naphthalene at
873–1023 K. On the other hand, it was demonstrated
that there is a close correlation between the activity
of benzene formation in methane aromatization and
the Brönsted acidity of Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst. These
results suggest that methane is dissociated on the
molybdenum carbide cluster supported on HZSM-5
having optimum Brönsted acidity to form CHx (x > 1)
and C2-species as the primary intermediates which
are subsequently oligomerized to aromatics such as
benzene and naphthalene at the interface of Mo2C
and HZSM-5 zeolite having the optimum Brönsted
acidity. The main transformation steps of this process
could be outlined as follows:
where (a–b) are on an Mo site of carbide or oxycarbide
and (c) is on HZSM-5.
Recently, the group of Ichikawa et al. further in-
vestigated the active species on Re/HZSM-5 catalyst
by EXAFS technique coupled with TG/DTA/MASS
[38,39]. As presented in Fig. 7, the FT functions of
the Re/HZSM-5 samples reduced at 573 K, reacted
with methane at 973 K are similar in the shape with
those of Re metal powder. EXAFS parameters of the
samples showed that after the reduction or reaction,
Re oxide species is converted to Re particle (Re–Re:
R = 2.74 Å, CN = 4.0) in comparison with those of
Re metal powder (Re–Re: R = 2.74 Å, CN = 12).
TG/DTA/MASS and EXAFS studies revealed that the
Re oxide species dispersed in the calcined HZSM-5
is reduced with hydrogen at 573 K or reacted with
methane at 895 K to metallic Re. In contrast to the
molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as the active species for
methane dehydrocondensation over the Mo/HZSM-5
catalyst, it was presented that the metallic Re on
Re/HZSM-5 is responsible for the catalytic dehydro-
condensation of methane toward C2 hydrocarbons
and benzene and naphthalene.
Iglesia and co-workers studied the Mo species in
Mo-exchanged HZSM-5 catalyst for non-oxidative
methane conversion by measurements of the kinet-
ics of formation and of the stoichiometry of ex-
changed MoOx species and in situ Raman study
[54–56]. Recently, they investigated the structure
and density of molybdenum species in Mo/HZSM-5
during the catalytic CH4 reaction by in situ XAS,
temperature-programmed oxidation after reaction,
and the isotopic exchange of D2 with OH groups in

HZSM-5 before and after CH4 reaction [49]. These
methods reveal that methane reaction cause exchanged
Mo2O52+ dimers to reduce and carburize to form
small MoCx (0.6–1 nm) clusters with the concurrent
regeneration of the bridging OH groups that were
initially replaced by Mo oxo dimers during exchange.
In this manner, catalytically inactive Mo oxo species
activate in contact with CH4 to form the two sites re-
quired for the conversion of CH4 to aromatics: MoCx
for C–H bond activation and initial C–C bond forma-
tion and acid sites for oligomerization and cyclization
of C2+ hydrocarbons to form stable aromatics.
6. Prospective aspects for methane
dehydrocondensation process
Methane dehydrocondensation in the absence of
oxygen over transition metal ions (mainly Mo, Re)
supported zeolite catalysts has been extensively stud-
ied since ﬁrst report in 1993. During the past 8 years,
several important progresses were fulﬁlled. For cata-
lyst evaluation, many research groups had established
the more accurate analysis systems. With the use of
N2 and Ar as an internal standard, the carbonaceous
species formed was on-line calculated, so the reaction
result of the catalyst is more reliable. Up to date, some
novel catalysts were reported, it can be concluded that
Mo and Re are the good active metal components,
while HZSM-5, HMCM-22, HZSM-11 and HZRP-1
are the ﬁne zeolite supports. It is recognized that the
methane dehydrocondensation reaction needs bifunc-
tional catalyst and the zeolites with two-dimensional
structure and pore size near to the dynamic diame-
ters of benzene and naphthalene molecules are ﬁne
supports. For the improvement of the catalyst activ-
ity and stability, Ichikawa and co-workers have shown
that the addition of small amounts CO and CO2 to the
methane feed inhibits the deactivation of the catalyst
greatly. The synergetic effect between the Mo species
and zeolite supports are thoroughly investigated by
FT-IR, XPS, EPR, solid NMR, EXAFS, stoichiometry
of the solid-state exchange reaction, and in situ Raman
techniques. It had been accepted that the interaction
between Mo and the zeolite support is very impor-
tant both in the preparation of a good catalyst and in
the catalytic reaction process. Generally speaking, the
active metal species and the Brönsted acidity of the
zeolite as well as the channel structure are crucial fac-
tors for the catalytic performance. It is basically agreed
that molybdenum carbide or oxycarbide is the active
species for the activation of C–H bond of methane,
then the formed intermediate is transformed to aro-
matic products on the acidic sites within the channels
of the zeolite. By contrast, for Re supported HZSM-5
catalyst, it was presented that the metallic Re is re-
sponsible for methane activation based on EXAFS and
TG/DTA/MASS studies.
Although a lot of research work had been done, in
terms of catalyst preparation, characterization, coke
formation and reaction mechanism, some problems
still remain to be solved, not only from the aspect
of fundamental research, but also from the aspect of
practical utilization of methane dehydrocondensation.
Some key points for prospective research on methane
dehydrocondensation are described as following.
6.1. The achievement of high activity and stability
In order to achieve the high activity and stability in
methane dehydrocondensation, the following methods
should be considered.
1. Improvement of the catalyst
Some new catalysts, both from the zeolite sup-
ports and the active metal components, need to be
discovered. On the other hand, try to modify the
previous catalysts by addition of certain elements
and optimization of the preparation and pretreat-
ment methods.
2. Removal of H2 by membrane technique
As previously presented by Borry et al. [42],
the removal of H2 is one of the efﬁcient ways for
the overcoming of the thermodynamic and kinetic
limit in methane dehydrocondensation. Therefore,
the study of membrane reactor for H2 removal is
needed.
3. Adoptions of integrated recycle reaction system
As reported by Qiu et at. [64], methane can
be converted in high yields to aromatics using an
integrated recycle system containing both an ox-
idative coupling reactor at 1073 K, for conversion
of CH4 to C2H4, and a secondary reactor contain-
ing Ga/ZSM-5 at 793 K for subsequent conversion
of ethylene to aromatics. Using this system, the
aromatic product yields of >70% at CH4 conver-
66
Y. Shu, M. Ichikawa / Catalysis Today 71 (2001) 55–67
sion of ∼100%, based on total added CH4, can be
obtained. Therefore, the study on the integrated
recycle reaction system was necessary for the
achievement of high activity and stability, espe-
cially from the potential commercialized aspect of
this reaction.
6.2. The effect of channel structure
The previous studies had shown that with the
use of different zeolite as catalyst support, such as
HMCM-22 and HZSM-5, the formation distribution
of benzene, naphthalene and coke is quite different.
However, how the channel structure of the zeolite sup-
port affect the product distribution and coke formation
is still not clear and this kind of study is emerging. It
will give us a guide for the preparation of new cata-
lyst and also be useful for the deep understanding of
methane dedydrocondensation.
6.3. The nature of carbonaceous deposits
The carbonaceous deposit formed in methane de-
hydrocondensation is a main obstruction for under-
standing of this reaction and the development of this
process. Unfortunately, this kind of study is scarce.
The reason is due to the study on the nature and
location of carbonaceous deposit is always tough.
Anyway, some studies on this aspect need conducted.
6.4. Active sites and reaction mechanisms
Although several research groups have investigated
the active sites by various techniques, it is still contro-
versial in some points, so the further study is needed.
For the reaction mechanisms, some of conclusions are
still based on the presumption, so the direct evidence
for the reaction mechanism needs established.
