Abstract
An overview is given on extensive studies, which are targeted to involve N2O into organic synthesis as an oxidant. Due to unique oxidative
properties, nitrous oxide provides remarkable prospects in catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation chemistry in both gas and liquid phases. The
interest to new oxidant resulted in appearance of a new technology for the production of inexpensive N2O too.

1. Introduction
The involvement of new feed stocks and reagents into
large-scale chemical industry is always a very important
event for the industry and its economics and often results in
dramatic consequences. It was the case, e.g., when coal, a
main feed stock for the industrial organic synthesis in the
19th century, had been substituted by oil in the 20th century.
The same is expected for the further substitution of oil by
natural
gas
(light
alkanes)
in
the
21st
century.
In
petrochemistry of the 20th century, an extremely important
consequence of the mentioned changes in the feed stock
basis had resulted from the substitution of extremely reactive
but dangerous acetylene and its derivates, which were
produced in the past mainly from the coal, by oleﬁns.
For sophisticated synthesis, which includes partial
oxidation of various organic substrates, one can recognize
utilization initially of air oxygen, then a set of inorganic
compounds like transition metal ions in a high oxidation
state, then the substitution of these oxidants by a ‘‘green
chemistry’’ oxidant hydrogen peroxide.
Indeed, the ﬁnal choice of real chemical industry is
basing not only on chemical properties of a particular
reagent but also (and often mainly) on comparative
assessments of its cost, availability, etc.
One of the most difﬁcult ﬁelds of catalytic chemistry is
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The main difﬁculty
here consists in the creation of selective catalysts. Such
catalysts should perform a dual function: to activate
dioxygen and generate some catalyst-bound oxygen species
of a proper reactivity, and to activate organic molecule so as
to direct the reaction to the desired products [1,2]. The
optimization of both these parameters simultaneously is a
very difﬁcult task, since one cannot tune them indepen-
dently. Modifying the catalyst composition, we often ﬁnd
ourselves in the situation when gaining in one aspect we are
losing in the others. That is why for many catalytic oxidation
reactions we fail to get a reasonable selectivity. Instead, we
have to use complex multi-step processes.
Two simple reactions of the above type are the partial
oxidation of methane to methanol and that of benzene to
phenol. These reactions are often included into the top 10
most difﬁcult challenges of modern chemistry. At present, to
produce methanol, methane is ﬁrst converted to a mixture of
H2 and CO and after that the latter mixture is converted to
methanol. As to the benzene oxidation to phenol, it is carried
usually via the three-step ‘‘cumene process’’ leading to
acetone as byproduct. Theoretically, the both selective
oxidations could be done in a single step, simply adding one
oxygen atom to the starting molecule.

Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various
oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The
idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant
chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while
the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged
or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new
opportunity for controlling the selectivity.
During the last decades, one of the most intriguing new
reagents for the selective oxidation has appeared to be
nitrous oxide, N2O. This compound is used in medicine due
to its light narcotic effect (‘‘laughing gas’’) but in chemistry
it was considered mostly as a not very toxic but practically
useless compound. Moreover, in the last two decades even
some special environmental restrictions were issued to
prevent the emission of N2O into the atmosphere, since the
compound has been recognized as a both greenhouse and
ozone depleting agent.
Our brief review is devoted to nitrous oxide as an oxidant,
which remarkable oxidation chemistry promises a signiﬁ-
cant progress in the ﬁeld. The paper includes four parts
comprising the following subjects: a gas phase catalytic
oxidation with nitrous oxide, a liquid phase non-catalytic
oxidation with nitrous oxide, the development of a pilot-
scale process for direct oxidation of benzene to phenol
(‘‘AlphOxTM’’), and the production of N2O via catalytic
selective oxidation of ammonia with dioxygen.
2. Gas phase catalytic oxidation with N2O
In the late 1970s–early 1980s, nitrous oxide has attracted
a signiﬁcant attention of researchers involved in searching
for new ways in selective transformation of methane. In
particular, research groups of Lunsford [3,4] and Somorjai
[5,6] showed that application of N2O oxidant over supported
MoO3 and V2O5 oxides provided high selectivity of methane
oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low
conversions.
First practical interest to nitrous oxide as an oxidant has
appeared in relation to phenol problem, which is one of the
most bulky chemicals, with the annual world production
exceeding 6 million tons. Its present-day cumene technology
includes three steps: (i) alkylation of benzene with propylene
to produce cumene; (ii) oxidation of the cumene to cumene
hydroperoxide; and (iii) decomposition of the latter to the
target product phenol and a co-product acetone. An ideal
solution of the problem would be, indeed, a direct oxidation
of benzene to phenol with dioxygen:
(1)
However, many attempts to accomplish this reaction were
unsuccessful. The interaction with O2 in the presence of
known catalysts leads mainly to the destruction of the
aromatic ring and low phenol selectivity.
In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the ﬁrst to use N2O for
the oxidation of benzene:
(2)
This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving
much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by
dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%.
These results were recognized as a promising lead to a long
awaited one-step direct process. However, a pilot test
performance did not meet the expectations since the
selectivity proved to be too low for a commercial
development.
Nevertheless, work [7] has stimulated further efforts in
searching for new more effective catalytic systems. As a
result,
in
1988,
three
groups
of
researchers
[8–10]
independently distinguished the ZSM-5 zeolites to be the
best catalysts for reaction (2). The catalysts allowed the
reaction to proceed at much lower temperature and, which is
even more important, with the selectivity approaching
100%. Further studies involved the active participation of
many
other
groups
[11–33]
and
contributed
to
the
improvement of the zeolite catalyst performance. Also, this
approach was expanded to the oxidation of various benzene
derivatives [34–39] as well as other type of hydrocarbons
[20,40–45].
On this basis, a new phenol process has been developed
jointly by Solutia Inc. (formerly a chemical business of
Monsanto separated in 1997) and the Boreskov Institute of
Catalysis (BIC). Below this process will be discussed in
more details. The remarkable oxidation activity of ZSM-5
gave rise to numerous discussions concerning the origin of
the mentioned untypical zeolite activity as well as the
reasons for an amazing speciﬁcity of the N2O oxidant
compared to O2.
As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different
approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a
traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with
strong Bro
¨nsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the
common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by
the presence of a transition metal admixture. After many
efforts, this catalytic admixture has been identiﬁed and
proved to be iron [46–49], which is present practically
always in zeolites at least at the level of a few hundred ppm
[50]. In the micropore space of the high silica zeolite matrix,
iron can form some active sites, which catalyze the reaction
and were called a-sites. Recently, several groups of
researchers [50–53] conducted most conclusive studies on
this subject, including preparation of virtually Fe-free
zeolites, which is a quite difﬁcult task. Presently, one may
conclude that the iron idea seems to be generally accepted,
although the detailed structure and composition of a-sites
till now are not perfectly clear and thus are the subject of
many theoretical [54–60] and experimental [58,61–69]
studies.

Fig. 1 shows a possible mechanism of the a-site
formation as it is suggested in [70]. An initial binuclear
iron complex (I) may form via both a Fe atom migration
from tetrahedral positions of the zeolite lattice or an
‘‘external’’ Fe insertion from FeCl3 (e.g., at a solid ion
exchange, sublimation, CVD, etc.). The existence of such
complexes inside Fe-containing zeolites of various structure
including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite and Fe-b was suggested
and well documented by many authors [61,71–81]. Upon
oxygen desorption at elevated temperatures, complex (I)
may transform into a reduced complex (II) (step 1). This
transformation seems to proceed rather readily. If this
oxygen evolution appears to be reversible, the a-site
formation does not occur and, at cooling, the system returns
to its initial state, thus restoring complex (I). Such
reversibility of the iron redox transformation was noted in
several works with FeZSM-5 zeolites, especially with those
having a high concentration of iron (1–5 wt.%) [62,73–
75,80]. For the a-site formation to occur, the reduced Fe2+
atoms should convert into a new stable state, in which they
lose their ability to react with O2 and thus make the step (1)
irreversible. The process of the Fe2+ stabilization appeared
to depend on the chemical composition of the matrix and is
strongly facilitated
by the
presence of water
vapor
[20,26,30,71,78]. Presumably, the stabilization can occur
in the form of complex (III), in which Fe2þ
2
entities are
strongly incorporated into a silicate fragment of the zeolite
matrix and have a more distant position as compared to
complex (II), thus making impossible their reoxidation into
the latter complex.
The reduced iron atoms of complex (III) appear to be
inert to dioxygen. However, they are readily oxidized at
elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into
complex (IV) to give adsorbed O
a species. Namely, this
reversible redox transition Fe2þ
a $ Fe3þ
a between complexes
(III) and (IV) is considered to provide a selective transfer of
oxygen atoms from N2O to hydrocarbon molecules to be
oxidized.
2.1. N2O speciﬁcity
A remarkable speciﬁcity of N2O is proved to relate to a
particular state of anion radical oxygen species O
a (called
a-oxygen), which forms on the a-sites from N2O, but
cannot form from O2 as it is illustrated by Fig. 1. A number
of thorough studies were devoted to investigation of
properties of a-oxygen including its reactivity tests, IR-
spectroscopy isotope labeling, and step-response experi-
ments [53,58,64,66–69,81–85]. Among the speciﬁc fea-
tures of a-oxygen, its very high reactivity seems to be the
most remarkable one. For example, it easily oxidizes
various organic molecules, including methane, even at
room temperature. This allows one to conduct a single turn-
over synthesis of, e.g., phenol according to the following
scheme [82]:

This scheme includes ﬁrst the a-oxygen loading (Eq. (3)).
Then, after the reactor cooling, the a-oxygen interaction
with benzene is allowed at room temperature (Eq. (4)). The
phenol product can be ﬁnally extracted from the catalyst
surface, e.g., with methanol (Eq. (5)). In all experiments of
this type, the extract analysis revealed nearly the theoretical
yield of phenol. No other products were detected. These
results approve clearly the a-oxygen participation, which is
further conﬁrmed by using the 18Oa isotope [45,82].
The Eqs. (3)–(5) seem to be the main steps of the reaction
mechanism at the benzene oxidation with N2O.
The similar reactions can be conducted with other organic
substrates too. These single turn-over reactions, beside a
mechanistic importance, happened to be a convenient way
for estimating the potentialities of the oxidation with a-
oxygen. For that, a variety of organic substrates were tested
for their interaction with a-oxygen at room temperature to
identify primary oxidation products [84,85]. The list of
investigated substrates includes alkanes,
cycloalkanes,
alkenes and aromatics (Table 1). The analysis of the
products extracted from the catalyst surface showed that the
interaction with Oa in all cases leads to the selective
formation of hydroxylated products, thus revealing a
remarkable N2O potential as a selective oxidant.

2.2. Other catalytic reactions at elevated temperatures
Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for
conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way
at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were
achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes
[40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene
oxide [86]. The data presented in Table 2 demonstrate the
selectivities toward hydroxylation products obtained in the
oxidation of various substrates over zeolite catalysts. One
can see that with alkane and alkene substrates, nearly no
hydroxylated products were obtained. Two exceptions are
works by Bulanek et al. [42] and Wood et al. [58]. In [42],
the selectivity of ca. 11.5% has been reported in the
hydroxylation of propane to propanol. In [58], even the
catalytic hydroxylation of methane to methanol has been
observed but the selectivity was only 2%.
The situation with aromatics is much more promising. In
some cases, the selectivities are high, over 90%. This is the
case for the hydroxylation of chlorobenzene, ﬂuorobenzene,
phenol and biphenyl. However, in many cases the resulted
selectivity appeared to be much lower than it might be
expected from the room temperature stoichiometric data.
One can assume that this is a result of side transformations
taking place inside zeolite cavities when performing
catalysis at elevated temperatures. To suppress such side
transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy
problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are
trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite
surface but leaving intact the a-sites. This is a difﬁcult
challenge. Nevertheless, in some cases this approach leads to
signiﬁcant improvements, which can be illustrated by an
example of hydroxylation of phenol to dihydroxybenzenes.
2.3. Hydroxylation of phenol
Fig. 2 shows a 40-h run for the hydroxylation of phenol
by N2O over the FeZSM-5 zeolite [87]:
(6)
The total selectivity of the reaction to the sum of
dihydroxybenzenes (DHB) is 95%. The upper picture
presents the distribution of the DHB isomers versus time
on stream. One can see that the fractions of resorcinol (RS)
and benzoquinone (BQ) are always small, while hydro-
quinone (HQ) and catechol (CH) are the two main products
subjected to a redistribution with the time-on-stream. At the
initial period, the HQ fraction comprises 85 mol%, and

decreases after 40 h to less than 60%, while there is a
compensating growth of CH. The lower picture in Fig. 2
shows the total productivity of DHBs. After reaching the
plateau, the productivity staysnearly constantformanyhours.
Note that presently there are three liquid phase industrial
processes practiced in a direct hydroxylation of phenol to
HQ and CH. All these processes use H2O2 as an oxidant and
catalysts of different types. Rhone Poulenc uses strong acids,
while Brichima—Fenton-type reagent, and Enichem—
titanosilicalite TS-1. Table 3 presents a comparison of the
phenol hydroxylation by H2O2 and N2O for the preparation
of HQ and CH. In relation to the phenol conversion, the
hydroxylation by N2O is inferior to Enichem process, but it
is superior with other parameters: better selectivities based
on both phenol and the oxidant, less tars (or coke) formation
and a more favorable isomer distribution in respect to HQ.
N2O forms mainly HQ, which is considered usually as a
more valuable product. Its amount averaged for 40 h run is
2.6 times greater than the amount of catechol. With H2O2,
the amounts of HQ and CH are equal in the best case. Thus,
the phenol oxidation with N2O may be considered as a lead
to an alternative process for the HQ and CH production.
2.4. Summary
Summarizing the consideration of the gas phase catalytic
oxidation by N2O, one should note, on the one hand, a
remarkable potentiality of nitrous oxide as a selective oxygen
donor, and on the other hand, difﬁculties that often arise when
trying to realize this potentiality. The main difﬁculty is slow
desorption of the desired hydroxylated product from the
catalyst. For that one should increase the temperature, which
can lead to side reactions inside zeolites as well as the catalyst
deactivation due to its coking. So, there is still a big room for
further studies and improvements in this ﬁeld.
3. Liquid phase oxidation with N2O
As a possible way to resolve the difﬁculties with the
catalytic gas phase oxidation discussed above, the authors of
[89] suggested an idea to transfer the reaction into a liquid
phase. This would facilitate the product removal from the
catalyst surface, thus increasing the number of possible
catalytic reactions. The idea was conﬁrmed only in part.
However, instead, it brought the authors of [89] to the
unexpected discovery of a non-catalytic oxidation of alkenes
to carbonyl compounds:
(7)
Actually, this type of the oxidation was ﬁrst described
much earlier, in 1951, by Bridson-Jones et al. [90,91].
However, due to low selectivities obtained by these authors
(not exceeding 64%) and very harsh reaction conditions,
which are difﬁcult to provide in the laboratory practice, no
attempt has been made since 1951 to reproduce or to
improve the results of [90,91].
The important distinctions of the work [89] were much
milder experimental conditions and a higher selectivity
toward the target carbonyls, which in many cases comprises
95–100%.

a Since the hydroxylation is performed in a phenol–benzene mixture, the N2O selectivities are based on the DHB formation (15%), and on the sum of the DHB
and phenol formation (89%).
Presently, the oxidation of cyclopentene [92] and cyclo-
hexene [89] with N2O to corresponding cyclic ketones is
studied in more details. Using these examples, one can
demonstratethisnewaspectoftheoxidationchemistryofN2O.
3.1. Oxidation of cyclopentene and cyclohexene
Presently, cyclohexanone (together with cyclohexanol) is
produced mostly via a simple but still ineffective large-scale
technology: the oxidation of cyclohexane by dioxygen. This
is the reaction of a radical type, and its selectivity decreases
strongly with increasing the substrate conversion over 3–
5%. The similar oxidation of cyclopentane is even less
selective. As a result, cyclopentanone is produced via much
more complicated ways, mainly via the adipic acid
decomposition, which theoretical yield is only 58 wt.%.
Table 4 shows that the liquid phase oxidation of
cyclopentene and cyclohexene by nitrous oxide leads to
much better results. The selectivities of both reactions are high
(96–99%) even at the high conversion of the organic
substrates. Thus, in case of cyclopentene, nearly 98%
selectivity was obtained at the 94% conversion. Such a high
selectivity can be explained by a non-radical type reaction
mechanism as well as by a remarkable feature of nitrous oxide
to react solely with the alkene C C bonds. Therefore, the
oxidation products having no such bonds are not subjected to
the overoxidation even at the high substrate conversion.
3.2. The mechanism of the N2O reaction with oleﬁns
The possible mechanism of oxygen transfer from nitrous
oxide to an unsaturated carbon atom seems to be of a special
interest. As a probable hypothesis one may assume an
intermediate formation of alkenoxide, which isomerizes
further into a carbonyl compound. For cyclohexene, e.g., it
means:
(8)
However, this hypothesis was not supported by the
experiment, since neither cyclopentene oxide nor cyclo-
hexene oxide undergo the isomerization or any other
transformation under the reaction conditions.
Another
hypothesis
[90,93]
seems
to
be
more
adequate. The oxygen transfer is assumed to occur via
the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition mechanism. This mechan-
ism has been convincingly substantiated by both experi-
mental
[89–93]
and
theoretical
studies
[94,95]
and
implies the formation of an intermediate 1,2,3-oxadiazo-
line complex:
(9)
3.3. The organic substrates screening
To estimate prospects and limitations of nitrous oxide
for the liquid phase oxidation, the authors of [96]
performed a wide screening of the alkene oxidation
including alkenes of various types. Further we give some
examples and make short comments on the results obtained
in [96].
3.3.1. Cycloalkenes
In addition to cyclopentene and cyclohexene discussed
above, the hydrocarbon cycles comprising 8 and 12
carbon atoms were studied too. Due to the symmetrical
location of the double bond, the only one type of resulting
ketones is possible with these molecules, which forms in
all
cases
with
the
high
selectivity
(96–99%).
The
availability of a substituent in the ring leads to the
formation of two isomeric ketones differing by the
position of oxygen.
3.3.2. Linear alkenes
The oxidation of linear alkenes (Table 5) exhibits
particular features depending on the position of the
double bond in the substrate molecule and the conﬁg-

uration of the intermediate oxadiazoline complexes.
For the case of terminal alkenes, the intermediate
complex may have conﬁguration (I) or (II) as shown in
Eq. (10):
In complex (I), the oxygen of N2O is bound to the
terminal carbon atom; consequently, the decomposition of
such intermediate leads to an aldehyde. In complex (II), the
oxygen is bound to the second carbon atom and the
decomposition of the intermediate leads to a ketone. Also,
with complex (II) there exists another possible way of the
decomposition which involves the cleavage of the C–C
bond. The latter way leads to an aldehyde with a smaller
number of carbon atoms and the equivalent amount of the
methylene species, :CH2, which is intercepted immediately
by the alkene or solvent molecules. Thus, the oxidation of
propylene in the benzene solvent (Table 5, entry 2) provided
the following results: the non-cleavage way of the reaction
resulted in the formation of 23 mol% of propanal and
31 mol% of acetone; the cleavage way resulted in the
formation of 22 mol% of acetaldehyde and methylene,
which, upon the reaction with propylene, forms 4 mol% of
methylcyclopropene and, upon the reaction with benzene,
15 mol% of cycloheptatriene.
With non-terminal alkenes, the cleavage path of the
oxidation is less pronounced and the oxidation leads to a
rather selective ketone formation. Thus, the oxidation of 2-
butene (Table 5, entry 5) provides methylethylketone with
the 86% selectivity, while the oxidation of 2-pentene (entry
6) provides 2- and 3-pentanones with the 88% total
selectivity.
3.3.3. Cycloalkadienes
These compounds contain two double bonds, which can
react with N2O consecutively, thus yielding accordingly
unsaturated monoketones and diketones. 1,4-Cyclohexa-
diene and 1,5-cyclooctadiene, which have the isolated
double bonds, as well as 1,3-cyclohexadiene with the
conjugated double bonds were studied [96].
The obtained distribution between mono- and diketones
gives an interesting feature of the reaction. At the oxidation
of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (Eq. (11)), 3- and 2-cyclohexen-1-
ones are the main products comprising 90–92% of the yield:

(Note that with 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 20–25% of the
converted alkene is consumed by a polymerization process,
which is not taken into account at calculating the product
composition shown in Eq. (11). With 1,5-cyclooctadiene, no
polymerization was noted.) The concentration of diketones
is very small and at conversion X = 37% comprises only 3%
instead of statistically expected 9%. This low yield of
diketones may indicate that the insertion of the ﬁrst carbonyl
group into 1,4-cyclohexadiene deactivates the remaining
double bond and makes it more resistant to the further
oxidation. Approximately, a 10-fold predominance of 1,4-
versus 1,3-cyclohexanedione is observed.
The oxidation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene also leads to the
formation of mono- and diketones (Eq. (12)):
However, unlike 1,4-cyclohexadiene, this diene forms
only one monoketone isomer. Besides, no deactivation effect
of the C O group is observed, so that in this case the
diketone fraction is much greater and close to its statistically
expected value. These distinctions are probably explained
by a more distant location of the double bonds in the 1,5-
cyclooctadiene molecule.

3a-hydroxyhexahydro-1(2H)-pentale-
none. Most probably, this compound forms as a result
of an intramolecular aldol condensation of 1,4-cycloocta-
nedione, which contribution increases with the temperature
and at 220 8C consumes 50% of the latter compound
(Eq. (12)).
The oxidation of conjugated 1,3-cyclohexadiene is
strongly complicated by the Diels-Alder side reaction.
Therefore, the main part of the diene is consumed by a
dimerization process, and only 25–30% are involved in the
oxidation, thus yielding cyclic ketones.
3.3.4. Bicyclic alkenes
The results of the oxidation for this type alkenes are
presented in Table 6. The oxidation of norbornylene (entry
1) leads to the formation of both ketone (norcamphor) and
aldehyde (1-formyl-3-methylenecyclopentane) in approxi-
mately equal amounts, thus indicating a signiﬁcant cleavage
of the double bond to occur.
The oxidation of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene proceeds with a
minor cleavage and yields a- and b-tetralones with the total
selectivity 93% (entry 2). The oxygen adds predominantly to
the a-position, and the amount of a-tetralone is approxi-
mately twice that of b-tetralone.
At the oxidation of indene, where the double bond
locates in a 5-membered cycle (entry 3), the oxygen also
adds to the both positions, but the preference of the a-
position becomes even greater. The ratio of a-indanone to
b-indanone is 4.5:1. Presumably, 2-ethenylbenzaldehyde

also forms (	10%) as a result of the double bond cleavage in
the indene molecules.
3.3.5. Heterocyclic alkenes
Among alkenes of this type, the cycles containing
oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur were tested (Table 7). 5-
Membered heterocycles with a similar structure of their
molecules (2,5-dihydrofuran, 3-pyrroline, butadiene sul-
fone) exhibit different reaction patterns depending on the
nature of the heteroatom. The oxygen-containing cycle of
2,5-DHF (entry 1) is oxidized selectively yielding a
corresponding ketone (94%), while the cycles containing
nitrogen (entry 2) and sulfur (entry 3) show a strong
tendency toward side reactions resulting in a set of
unidentiﬁed products.
The comparison of several oxygen-containing cycles
presented in Table 7 allows one to follow an effect of the
double bond location in the heterocycle molecules. Results
with 2,3-DHF (entry 4) and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (entry 5)
show that the double bonds of the nearest to the oxygen atom
location
exhibit
an
increased
disposition
toward
the
cleavage. Indeed, the oxidation of 2,3-DHF proceeds
exclusively via the cleavage route. It leads to 71% of allyl
formate
in
the
products.
No
sign
of
an
expected
butyrolactone was detected. The oxidation of 3,4-dihydro-
2H-pyran also proceeds primarily via the cleavage route,
giving 48% of 3-butenyl formate. But in this case, a
signiﬁcant contribution of a non-cleavage route is also
observed, which is evidenced by the presence of 31% of d-
valerolactone in the products.
Unlike that, the oxidation of 2,5-DHF (entry 1) and 4,7-
dihydro-1,3-dioxepin (entry 6), having a more distant
location of the double bonds (position 3), proceeds
essentially without a cleavage leading in both cases to the
formation of corresponding ketones with 94% selectivity.
3.4. Summary
The presented data show that the liquid phase oxidation
of alkanes with nitrous oxide into carbonyl compounds
can be applied to a variety of substrates including aliphatic,
cyclic, heterocyclic alkenes and their derivatives. By an
analogy with ‘‘epoxidation’’, this type of reactions may be
called ‘‘carboxidation’’. The carboxidation proceeds non-
catalytically in the temperature range of 150–250 8C yielding
ketones and aldehydes as the main products. Although the
reaction selectivity depends signiﬁcantly on the alkene
structure and its composition, each type of alkenes was
shown to include substrates whose carboxidation proceeds
selectively yielding 90–99% of carbonyl compounds.
Due to release of high reaction energy at the N2O
oxidation, it can cause also a cleavage of the alkene
molecule over the reactive double bond. This undesirable
process increases the number of the reaction products

and decreases the selectivity. But in the case of terminal
alkenes, where this process is most intensive, it may deserve
a special interest as a way for generating carbenes, which
can be used for conducting some ﬁne synthetic reactions.
4. The development of a new phenol process
The development of a new phenol process based on the
direct oxidation of benzene by N2O (reaction (2)) has been
made jointly by BIC and Solutia Inc. The interest of Solutia
to the remarkable oxidation chemistry of nitrous oxide
follows from the fact that Solutia is one of the major world
producers of adipic acid, which is an intermediate for the
Nylon-6,6 production.
The production of adipic acid includes several steps (see
Scheme (13)): the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane,
the oxidation of cyclohexane to a mixture of cyclohexanol
and cyclohexanone, and ﬁnally the oxidation of the latter
mixture to adipic acid with the use of nitric acid:
The last stage yields a large amount of concentrated
waste nitrous oxide, which is formed in a ca. 1:1 mole ratio
to adipic acid.
Nitrous oxide is not considered as an innocent ‘‘laughing
gas’’ any more. It may contribute to a global climate change
due to its green house and ozone depleting effects [98]. In a
recent review [99], various approaches for abating the
N2O emissions were discussed. Regarding this situation,
Solutia suggested to use waste nitrous oxide for the
oxidation of benzene to phenol, incorporating this reaction
as a key stage in a new modiﬁed adipic acid production
scheme [100–102]:
This scheme also starts with benzene. In this case, benzene
is ﬁrst oxidized to phenol, and only then goes to hydrogena-
tion. Nitrous oxide, which is produced at the last stage, returns
to the front end of the overall process thus closing the cycle.
The new phenol process uses a Fe-containing zeolite
catalyst and was called the AlphOxTM process after the name
of a-oxygen (see Section 2). The process has been
successfully tested at a pilot plant (Fig. 3) erected by
Solutia in Pensacola (Florida). The reaction was performed
in a simple adiabatic reactor, which is an essential feature of
this process economy. Table 8 presents typical parameters
describing the pilot reactor performance. One can see that
the new process provides high selectivity as referred to both
benzene and nitrous oxide. Its productivity is 400 g of
phenol per 1 kg of catalyst per hour, which is at the top end
of the best industrial catalysts for selective oxidation
reactions.
The AlphOxTM process shows several advantages when
compared to the cumene process, i.e., one step only, low
capital expenses, no acetone byproduct, and no highly
reactive intermediates. There are also outstanding safety
features. The operating conditions ensure that the whole
process is non-ﬂammable throughout, including the reaction
step, the separation system and the recycling loop. The
process has also very good environmental features. Instead
of spending efforts and money on the N2O neutralization, the
new phenol process uses N2O as a valuable raw material.
5. The catalytic production of inexpensive N2O
Extensive studies in the ﬁeld of the application of nitrous
oxide for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons make
development of
new
processes for
synthesis
of
the
inexpensive on purpose N2O of vital importance too. The
high capacity for the products of selective oxidation of
hydrocarbons, for example, phenol, needs technological
processes for the of nitrous oxide synthesis at the unit
capacity up to 100,000 t/y. The existing commercial-scale

(13)
(14)
N2O production technologies implemented in the industry
by the moment are based mostly on the thermal decom-
position of nitrite–nitrate salts mixtures [103] via the
reaction:
and can only provide one tenth of the required capacity to
N2O. At the same time, for the large-scale production of
nitrous oxide, catalytic technologies seem to be much more
promising.
Below we consider the recent development of a new
large-scale catalytic process for the synthesis of nitrous
oxide via selective oxidation of ammonia over a Mn–Bi–O/
a-Al2O3 catalyst. The catalyst was found to be active in the
temperature range 315–370 8C and to provide a high
selectivity (up to 90%) towards the N2O formation. The
process has been developed by BIC in a tight cooperation
with Solutia Inc., USA.
5.1. Catalysts for the oxidative synthesis of N2O
At present, several catalytic methods for the N2O
synthesis are known. This knowledge originates partly from
the extensive studies on numerous deNOX processes.
Among the known methods are:
(1) Catalytic reduction of NO with CO in the presence of
homogeneous catalysts [104].
(2) Catalytic reduction of NO either with CO, or with H2, or
with a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
(synthesis gas) in the presence of heterogeneous
catalysts such as supported platinum group metals,
for example (1–5) wt.% Ru, Pt/Al2O3 (or SiO2, ZrO2,
TiO2) [105].
(3) Catalytic oxidation of ammonia with dioxygen in the
presence of heterogeneous catalysts based on bulk metal
oxides:
2NH3 þ 2O2 ! N2O þ 3H2O:
(15)
In the latter situation, manganese dioxide was considered
in the literature as the most active and selective. More c-
omplex mixed oxide systems based on manganese dioxide
were developed as well: MnO2–Bi2O3 [106,107], MnO2–
CuO [108], MnO2–Bi2O3–Fe2O3 [106,108], MnO–CoO–
NiO [108]. The catalysts free of manganese oxides were also
proposed, e.g., Co3O4–Al2O3 [109], Pr2O3–Nd2O3–CeO2
[108]. Some of the tested systems were bulk catalysts [1-
06,107], while the other were suggested as both bulk cat-
alysts and catalysts impregnated to an inert support (silica,
graphite or another binding material) [108].
A number of disadvantages of the above mentioned
catalysts imposed serious restrictions upon their large-scale
applications. The main of these disadvantages are: (i) a low
activity and selectivity toward the formation of N2O (no
more than 84% at the molar ratio O2/NH3
1 in the reaction
mixture); (ii) a relatively high (up to 3%) selectivity toward
the formation of undesirable nitrogen oxide NO; (iii) a low
mechanical strength and low catalyst effectiveness.
In order to eliminate the above disadvantages, a number
of supported oxide catalysts were developed and tested in

BIC (see Table 9). A supported Mn–Bi–O catalyst has been
selected as having a good activity and needed level of
selectivity toward nitrous oxide combined with a low yield
of NO [110] through the undesirable side reaction:
2NH3 þ 2:5O2 ! 2NO þ 3H2O:
The procedure for the catalyst preparation includes the
double impregnation of an a-alumina support with a
solution of manganese(II) and bismuth(III) nitrates followed
by the calcination at 400–750 8C [110]. The prepared
catalyst appears to be mechanically strong and highly
selective toward nitrous oxide (up to 90%) at a wide range of
operating conditions.
5.2. Studies on the kinetic properties of the Mn–Bi–O/-a-
Al2O3 catalyst for the NH3 oxidation
The kinetic studies of the synthesized catalysts were the
initial stage in the development of a large-scale process of
the N2O production. Two types of the laboratory scale
reactors were used for these studies: (i) an isothermal plug
ﬂow reactor and (ii) a gradient-less CSTR equipped with an
external circulation loop to provide the regime of the ideal
mixing.
The kinetic properties of the Mn–Bi–O/a-Al2O3 catalyst
were studied at temperatures 270–400 8C in the following
range of the operation conditions: pressure 1–6 atm, contact
time 0.03–12 s, the inlet mixture concentrations of ammonia
1.0–50 vol.%, dioxygen 3.0–83 vol.%, water (steam) 0.0–
43 vol.%.
The main pathways of the ammonia oxidation with O2
over Mn–Bi–O/a-Al2O3 which were detected under the
studied conditions appeared to be the desirable reaction (15)
and the reaction:
2NH3 þ 1:5O2 ¼ N2 þ 3H2O:
(16)
One-parameter dependencies of the rates of reactions
(15) and (16) on the reactant concentrations and temperature
were obtained by a series of experiments using the gradient-
less reactor (Figs. 4 and 5). The overall rate of the ammonia
oxidation
was
found
to
increase
on
increasing
the
concentrations of NH3 and O2. Water was found to decrease
the rate of the ammonia oxidation. The selectivity toward
N2O increases on increasing the concentrations of dioxygen
and water and decreases on increasing the ammonia
concentration (Fig. 4). Thus, the maximal selectivity to
nitrous oxide is achieved at high concentrations of dioxygen
and water and at a low concentration of ammonia. At excess
oxygen, the selectivity toward N2O was as high as 90%. It
should be mentioned that only a minor decrease (to no less

than 88%) in the selectivity to nitrous oxide was observed at
the stoichiometric dioxygen/ammonia ratio. At the whole
range of the inlet composition and operation temperature,
the selectivity toward N2O was found to increase on
increasing the NH3 conversion. The latter observation could
be explained via the independence of the parallel pathways
(15) and (16) of the NH3 oxidation [110]. So, N2O is the ﬁnal
product of reaction pathway (15), and thus the rate of the
N2O formation should decrease on increasing the NH3
conversion in a less extent than the rate of the N2 formation.
The selectivity to N2O rises on increasing the temperature
from 315 to 370 8C. The further temperature increase results
in decreasing the N2O selectivity due to a signiﬁcant
formation of NO. Thus, the preferable temperature range for
achieving the maximal selectivity toward nitrous oxide has
appeared to be 340–370 8C (Fig. 5).
A mathematical processing of the obtained experimental
data allowed a phenomenological kinetic model to be
suggested for the steady state rates of the formation of both
N2O and N2 at the temperature range from 315 to 370 8C. The
model provides the minimal mean deviation of the experi-
mental and calculated data, i.e. ca. 9% for the rates of N2O and
N2 formation and ca. 1% for the selectivity to nitrous oxide.
5.3. The development of a technology for the catalytic
synthesis of nitrous oxide via the ammonia oxidation
Theoretical and experimental work done has shown the
possibility of the N2O production in the both ﬂuidized and
ﬁxed bed reactors. Below, some results of the pilot testing
and mathematical modeling of the new N2O production
process are summarized.
5.3.1. Fluidized bed reactor for the N2O production
To arrange a large-scale production of concentrated
nitrous oxide at as high as 100,000 t/y unit capacity, it seems
promising to use the concentrated inlet reaction mixture
consisting of NH3 and O2 at the molar ratio of ca. 1:1. The
adiabatic temperature rise is 80–90 8C per percent of the
inlet ammonia. Thus, the synthesis of nitrous oxide at the
high inlet concentrations of ammonia and dioxygen can be
provided using a ﬂuidized catalyst bed reactor only.
Due to a considerable structural inhomogeneity of the
ﬂuidized bed, a relatively long contact time is required for
the complete ammonia conversion. Theoretical estimations
have shown to be appropriate to restrict the ammonia
conversion in the ﬂuidized bed reactor to ca. 98% in order to
provide the further conversion of the reaction mixture using
an adiabatic ﬁxed bed reactor.
The Van Deemter two phase model [111] was used to
describe hydrodynamics of the ﬂuidized bed. The following
assumptions underlay the model: (1) the plug ﬂow regime is
assumed for a gas in the bubble phase; (2) axial gas
backmixing in the dense catalyst phase is taken into
consideration; (3) the chemical reaction occurs in the dense
phase only; (4) there are no temperature gradients in the bed.
The primary goal of the modeling of the ﬂuidized bed
reactor was to investigate the inﬂuence of the operation
conditions on the reactor performance. The ﬂuidized bed
properties such as the bed expansion, dense phase gas hold-
up and transition to turbulent ﬂuidization were studied using
the cold ﬂow model of 0.15 m i.d. [114]. The results of these
cold ﬂow studies were used during the modeling of the
ﬂuidized bed reactor. Table 10 presents the reference
operation conditions used for the modeling.
It has been established by the modeling that the rate of the
ammonia transformation in the ﬂuidized catalyst bed reactor
is determined under the given operation conditions by the
interphase mass transfer and catalyst activity. The bed height
providing the 98% ammonia conversion decreases by 20–
30% on increasing twice the interphase exchange coefﬁcient
or the catalyst activity. The axial dispersion of the gas in the
dense phase affects the reactor performance only moder-
ately. The neglecting of the axial dispersion leads to a 10%
decrease in the calculated bed height providing the ammonia
conversion equal to 98% and to a decrease in the calculated
selectivity to N2O by 1%.
Some parameters of the ﬂuidized catalyst bed reactor
estimated for the speciﬁed capacity for nitrous oxide equal to
100,000 t/y are summarized in Table 11.
The results of the above mathematical modeling were
used for a pilot testing of the catalyst for the N2O synthesis
in the ﬂuidized bed reactors of 4.1–7.0 cm i.d. The test
studies were carried out both in the Solutia Research Center
and in BIC.
The catalyst with a wide particle size distribution (10–
120 mm) for the ﬂuidized bed was prepared at BIC by the
above spoken procedure. The performance of the catalyst
samples for the ﬂuidized bed synthesis of N2O was tested
using a laboratory isothermal plug ﬂow reactor; the
selectivity to N2O was equal to 87–88%.
The pilot testing in the ﬂuidized bed reactor [116] was
carried out with the maximal catalyst loading 6 kg under the
following conditions:

Testing the catalyst in the pilot ﬂuidized bed installation
revealed only a minor difference between the catalyst
selectivity to N2O observed with the either ﬂuidized bed or
plug ﬂow reactors. The catalyst was found to be stable, no
catalyst activity losses were observed during the whole test
period.
5.3.2. Tubular reactor for the N2O production
The oxidation of ammonia to nitrous oxide is accom-
panied by the evolution of a considerable heat. This allows
the process to be conducted in a tubular reactor at far lower
concentrations of ammonia and dioxygen than those in the
ﬂuidized bed reactor. The maximal inlet ammonia con-
centration to provide the steady operation heat regimes in the
tubular reactor was determined by the tube diameter, the
catalyst particle size and geometry of the catalyst granules,
as well as the catalyst activity and process conditions. The
preliminary estimations reveal the maximal admissible
concentrations of ammonia of 4–7 vol.% at the tubular
reactor inlet.
The modeling of the nitrous oxide synthesis in the tubular
reactor was mainly aimed at searching for the optimal
operation parameters and stable working regimes to provide
the maximal inlet ammonia concentration and the largest
possible diameter of the reactor tube. The modeling was
based on a quasihomogeneous steady-state approximation
for the processes of heat and mass transfer in a two-
dimensional tubular reactor [112,117].
The imposed limitations for the choice of optimal
operation regimes were the following: (i) the hot spot
temperature in the reactor must not be higher than 400 8C in
order to prevent the selectivity losses; (ii) the hot spot to
cooling agent (HSCA) sensitivity of the reactor, which is
deﬁned as the ratio of the hot spot temperature variation
(DTHS) to the variation of the cooling agent temperature
(DTCA):
HSCA ¼ DTHS
DTCA
;
must not exceed 4 for a spherical catalyst and 5 for a Rashig
ring catalyst; (iii) the pressure drop through the bed is not
higher than 0.8 atm.
The
following
parameters
were
optimized
at
the
modeling: the superﬁcial gas velocity, temperature of the
cooling agent, temperature of the inlet reaction mixture, the
activity and particle size of the catalyst. It was discovered
during the modeling that the temperature of the heat carrier,
the catalyst activity and the inlet ammonia concentration are
the main parameters which affect the temperature proﬁle in
the reactor.
The results of the mathematical modeling gave rise to a
pilot testing of the ammonia oxidation process using an
installation consisting of a single tube of 4.5 m length [117].
The tube was immersed into a thermostat made of an air-
ﬂuidized bed of ﬁne g-Al2O3 particles. A typical steady-
state temperature proﬁle measured along the axis of the
tubular reactor is shown in Fig. 6. It is seen that the
longitudinal temperature proﬁles in the reactor obtained by
mathematical modeling are in a good agreement with the
experimental data.
The
mathematical
modeling
has
demonstrated
the
possibility to improve the tubular reactor performance
using the Rashig ring catalysts instead of spherical catalysts.
At the use of a Rashig ring catalyst, it was shown possibility
to increase the inlet ammonia concentration from 4.5 to
8 vol.% at the constant tube diameter due to increasing the
radial heat conductivity of the bed and the wall heat transfer
coefﬁcient (see Table 12).
5.4. The process ﬂowsheet for the large-scale production of
nitrous oxide via selective oxidation of ammonia
The data obtained at both the pilot testing of the BIC
developed catalyst and mathematical modeling of the
oxidation have allowed to suggest the following schemes
for the synthesis of concentrated nitrous oxide (Fig. 7)
[113,115,117].
Ammonia and dioxygen are co-fed at the molar ratio 1:1
into the main reactor, where the selective oxidation of
ammonia to N2O proceeds at 350–370 8C and 5 atm. The
main reactor could be of either a tubular ﬁxed bed or
ﬂuidized bed type. In the case of the tubular reactor, the inlet

reaction mixture is diluted by the recycle stream in order to
decrease the inlet ammonia concentration down to 8 vol.%.
The conversion of ammonia in the main reactor reaches ca.
98%. The gas which escapes the main reactor is supplied to a
NOx removal unit consisting of two consecutive adiabatic
ﬁxed bed reactors. In the ﬁrst reactor, the formation of N2O
takes place from residual reactants. In the second reactor, the
products are cleaned from NOx via the selective reduction of
nitrogen oxides with ammonia in the presence of oxygen to
produce molecular nitrogen. The outlet gas from the NOx
removal unit is cooled and fed to a NH3 removal unit which
consists of an ammonia absorber and a stripping tower. The
gas product mixture at the outlet of NH3 removal unit
contains mainly nitrous oxide (86% mol) and molecular
nitrogen (13.2% mol). The fraction of residual oxygen in the
gas product mixture is O2:N2O < 1:100.
Some engineering data for the process of synthesis of
nitrous oxide at the capacity 100,000 t/y are given in Table 13.
5.5. Summary for the catalytic N2O production
An a-alumina supported manganese–bismuth oxide
catalyst is developed for the oxidation of ammonia into
nitrous oxide. The catalyst can be used both in the ﬁxed and
ﬂuidized bed conditions. The pilot testing of the catalyst for
600–800 h under conditions of the ﬁxed and ﬂuidized bed
revealed that the catalyst properties are retained during the
whole test period. At the temperature range of 340–370 8C,
the catalyst provides the selectivity for the oxidation of
ammonia into nitrous oxide no less than 86%. The data
obtained by the pilot testing of the developed catalyst and
mathematical modeling of the ﬂuidized bed and tubular
reactors for the ammonia oxidation allow a process
ﬂowsheet to be suggested for the 100,000 t/y production
of nitrous oxide. The process provides the synthesis of
nitrous oxide comprising 86% of the target product (the rest
is N2). Ammonia contributes the main part (ca. 70%) to the
prime cost of the produced N2O.
6. General conclusions
At the last decade, the application of N2O in the laboratory
practice became a fast growing ﬁeld. It is evidenced, not
only by a large number of research groups (according to
our estimations, over 40) involved in the N2O studies, but
also by a signiﬁcant number of recent reviews dedicated to
the oxidation chemistry of nitrous oxide [34,119–124].
The studies reviewed in this paper showed that, due to
remarkable features of N2O, this oxidant opens new prospects
in the oxidation chemistry in both gas and liquid phases. At
present, advances in the gas phase reactions relate mainly to
the hydroxylation of benzene and other aromatic compounds
over Fe-containing zeolites. Much efforts are being taken
currently to study the mechanisms of the oxidation with N2O
and to search for new reactions and new types of the catalysts.
In the liquid phase reactions, nitrous oxide exhibits
another aspect of its unique oxidative chemistry, providing a
particular type of the non-catalytic oxidation of alkenes to
carbonyl compounds (i.e., the carboxidation reactions). The
possibility to conduct such reactions without a catalyst
mediation suggests a signiﬁcant technological advantage.
But actually it does not mean that there are no needs for
catalysis here. On the contrary, one could see that not all
carboxidation reactions considered above showed sufﬁcient
selectivities. For improving the selectivity, a decrease of the
reaction temperature without decreasing the reaction rate
would be highly appreciated. Evidently, this can be achieved
only with the aid of catalysis.
Studies on the catalytic liquid phase oxidation with N2O
are already initiated [125–131]. The most interesting results
in the ﬁeld were obtained by the research groups of Yamada
[127,128], Neumann [129,130], and Kozhevnikov [131].
Using various types of catalysts (Ru porphyrene complexes,
polyoxometallates, and supported metals), these authors
managed to conduct a selective oxidation of alkenes to
epoxides as well as alcohols to aldehydes. Although the
reaction temperature still was rather high (up to 150–
200 8C), these data showed that the catalytic activation of
N2O in the liquid phase is certainly feasible. Thus, this
approach may lead to new breakthrough results in the future.
As for the catalytic carboxidation of alkenes, no
successful results in either liquid or gas phases were

reported in the literature until now. One may think that this
promising type of oxidative reactions may happen to be a
difﬁcult challenge for the catalytic research.
Generally, N2O is considered as an expensive and quite
‘‘exotic’’ compound which application in chemical industry
is economically unreasonable. At the thorough considera-
tion it appeared to be not correct. Indeed, the production of
unexpensive N2O seems to be easy arranged as a large-scale
catalytic process too, the starting materials being widely
available and unexpensive ammonia and air. The economic
estimations based on the results of the pilot units tests
demonstrated that the speciﬁc cost of active oxygen in N2O
obtained by the new technology, is about four times lower
than the cost of active oxygen in the widely accepted oxidant
H2O2 [101]. No doubt this ﬁnding will provide an additional
driving force for searching new applications of nitrous oxide
in various ﬁelds of chemistry.
