The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the
structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range
of vanadium surface densities (0.5–15.0 VOx/nm2). X-ray diffrac-
tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists
as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2
on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on
SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to
polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface den-
sity increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on
ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies
decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density
on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing
VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support
sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con-
centration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a
maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a
balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces-
sibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type
of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover
rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences
in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation
turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface
VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydro-
genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to
COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur-
face density or structure. Thus, it appears that these two reactions
require similar VOx surface sites and that these sites are present at
similar surface densities on polyvanadate domains and small V2O5
clusters.

INTRODUCTION
Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a ther-
modynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes
from alkanes (1–3). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx)
catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways

limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions
(4–18). The local coordination and symmetry of V+5 cen-
ters in bulk and supported V2O5 have been frequently im-
plicated in the observed effects of support, VOx concentra-
tion, and pretreatment procedures on catalytic behavior.
Many of these structure–function relations remain incom-
plete because of difﬁcult structural characterization, unde-
tected transport restrictions, and kinetic analyses compli-
cated by parallel and sequential combustion pathways.
Theextentofdispersionandthelocalandextendedstruc-
ture of supported VOx species depend on the chemical iden-
tity and the surface area of the support (1–3, 17, 18). Previ-
ous studies have shown that basic metal oxides (e.g., MgO,
Bi2O3, La2O3, Sm2O3) lead to supported VOx species with
higher alkene selectivities than when acidic oxides are used
as supports (1, 13–15). Several authors have proposed that
acidic V2O5 species interact weakly with acidic supports,
leading to poorly dispersed V2O5 crystallites (13, 15).
The structure of selective VOx species and the reaction
pathways in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes remain
subjects of active discussion. Our recent study (4) com-
binedspectroscopicandchemicalcharacterizationmethods
with detailed kinetic analyses of oxidative dehydrogenation
pathwaysinordertoaddresstheseissuesonVOx/ZrO2cata-
lysts. This work showed that the structure and catalytic be-
havior of these materials depend strongly on VOx surface
density. Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx
surface densities above 3–4 VOx/nm2 provide active and se-
lective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Cata-
lysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2
surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of compet-
ing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2
products.
In this study, we examine the effect of support (Al2O3,
SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic
behavior of VOx species over a wide range of VOx surface
densities. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-
visible spectroscopy were used to examine the structure
and electronic properties of supported VOx species. Rate

constants for primary and secondary reaction pathways
were obtained by kinetic analysis of steady-state oxidative
dehydrogenation rates obtained in differential ﬂow reac-
tors.
EXPERIMENTAL
TiO2 (S¨
ud-Chemie, AG), Al2O3 (Degussa, AG), and
SiO2 (Davison Chemical) supports were obtained from
commercial sources. Zirconium (ZrO(OH)2) and hafnium
(HfO(OH)2) oxyhydroxides were prepared from the corre-
sponding oxychlorides by coprecipitation at controlled pH
(4). Vanadium was introduced at various concentrations
(Table 1) via incipient wetness impregnation of supports
with aqueous ammonium metavanadate solutions (99%,
Aldrich, Inc.) (4, 21). These solutions also contained ox-
alic acid (Mallinckrodt, analytical grade; NH4VO3/oxalic
acid = 0.5 M) in order to ensure dissolution of ammo-
nium metavanadate precursors. After impregnation, sam-
ples were dried overnight in air at 393 K and treated in dry
air at 773 K for 3 h.
Surface areas were measured in a N2 physisorption ﬂow
apparatus using thermal conductivity detection and multi-
point BET analysis methods. Samples were dehydrated in
He at 473 K for 1 h before surface area measurements.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained at room

temperature using Cu (Kα) radiation and a Siemens D5000
diffractometer. A small amount of catalyst was mixed with
vaseline, spread smoothly onto a thin glass plate, and placed
in the diffractometer.
Raman spectra were obtained using a HoloLab 5000
Raman research spectrophotometer (Kaiser Optical Sys-
tems, Inc). Samples (0.1 g) were pressed at 70 MPa pres-
sure into wafers (0.9 cm diameter, 0.1 cm thickness) and
mountedinaquartzcell.Thiscellcanbeheatedupto1073K
and gases can be introduced for in situ measurements dur-
ing treatments. Raman spectra were recorded in the 100 to
1300 cm−1 wavenumber range using a 532-nm laser line.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV-visible spectra were obtained
using MgO as a reference in a Varian-Cary 4 spectropho-
tometer equipped with a Harrick diffuse-reﬂectance attach-
ment. Reﬂectance data were converted to absorption spec-
tra using Kubelka–Munk functions (22). The sample cell
was equipped with a heater unit, a water cooling system,
a thermocouple, and a gas ﬂow system for in situ measure-
ments. UV-visible electronic spectra of samples dehydrated
in situ in dry air at 723 K for 30 min were measured in the
1.5–6.0 eV energy range at room temperature.
Oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities were
measured in a ﬁxed-bed quartz reactor using catalyst sam-
ples (0.015–0.3 g) diluted with quartz powder (0.5 g) in or-
der to prevent temperature gradients. A mixture of C3H8
(14.0 kPa) and O2 (1.74 kPa) in He was introduced into
the reactor at controlled ﬂow rates. Reactant and prod-
uct concentrations were measured by gas chromatogra-
phy (Hewlett-Packard 5880 GC, Carboxen packed column,
thermal conductivity detection). Only C3H6, H2O, CO, and
CO2 were detected as reaction products. Larger product
samples injected into a capillary column also failed to de-
tect any other reaction products. Bed residence times and
C3H8 and O2 conversions were varied by changing the feed
ﬂow rate between 0.5 and 6 cm3(STP) s−1. C3H8 and O2 con-
versions were below 1% and 20%, respectively. The rates
of formation of propene, CO, and CO2 were extrapolated
to zero conversion in order to estimate the rates of primary
C3H8 dehydrogenation and oxidation steps. Rate constants
for primary and secondary steps were obtained using a pre-
viously reported kinetic analysis method (4).
RESULTS
Catalyst surface areas and calculated VOx surface den-
sities (ns) are shown in Figs. 1a and 1b and in Table 1 as a
function of V2O5 content for Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and
ZrO2 supports after treatment in air at 773 K for 3 h. Each
catalyst is identiﬁed as, for example, 0.7 VOx/Al2O3, where
0.7 deﬁnes the weight loading of vanadia as V2O5. The pres-
ence of VOx had only a modest effect on the surface area
of the support (Fig. 1a). As a result, VOx surface densi-
ties increased almost linearly with increasing V2O5 content

(Fig. 1b). The surface density is deﬁned as the number of
vanadium atoms per square nanometer of the catalyst and
was calculated from the V2O5 content and the BET sur-
face area; it provides a convenient parameter for comparing
catalysts prepared on supports with a wide range of surface
areas. Clearly, at a given vanadium surface density the struc-
ture of VOx species will depend on the ability of a given
support to disperse the VOx species placed on its surface.
The dashed lines in Fig. 1b identify VOx surface densities
corresponding to theoretical monovanadate (2.3 VOx/nm2)
or polyvanadate (7.5 VOx/nm2) monolayers (17).
X-raydiffractionmeasurementsshowedthatVOxspecies
inhibit the conversion of metastable tetragonal ZrO2 to its
monoclinic form (Fig. 2a), as also reported for WOx and
other oxides supported on ZrO2 (23–25). VOx species also
inhibit the crystallization of amorphous HfO2 into mono-
clinic and orthorhombic structures (Fig. 2b), but they do
not inﬂuence the crystallinity of the anatase TiO2 structure
present in all VOx/TiO2 samples (Fig. 2e). Bulk V2O5 crys-
tallites were not detected at any VOx surface density within
the experimental range on ZrO2, HfO2, or TiO2 supports
(Figs. 2a, 2b, 2e). Bulk V2O5 crystallites were also not de-
tected on Al2O3- and SiO2-supported samples with low VOx
surface density (<3 VOx/nm2) (Figs. 2c, 2d). Higher surface
densities on SiO2 and Al2O3 lead to the appearance of V2O5
crystallites detectable by X-ray diffraction (Figs. 2c, 2d).
X-ray line breadth analysis using the Scherrer equation

at lower VOx densities on Al2O3 and SiO2 and at all surface

centration, poor crystallinity, or small numbers of unit cells.
V2O5 crystallites detectable by X-ray diffraction appeared
at lower VOx surface densities on SiO2 (3.5 VOx/nm2) than
on the other supports.
UV-visible absorption spectra reﬂect the electronic struc-
ture of valence bands in solids, but the broad nature of
charge transfer features in the spectra of metal oxides
makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne the position of these bands from
the energy at maximum absorption. Absorption edge ener-
gies provide a more convenient description of the electronic
properties of solids. The absorption edge in all UV-visible
spectra was determined using Tauc’s law, an expression that
describes the near-edge region in amorphous semiconduc-
tors and in crystalline semiconductors with indirect band
gap transitions (26). Using this expression, the edge en-
ergy is obtained from the intercept of a straight line ﬁtted
through the rise of the function [F(R∞)hν]1/2 plotted versus
hν (24), where F(R∞) is a Kubelka–Munk function (22), hν
is the energy of the incident photon. The position of the
absorption edge for low-energy charge transfer transitions
has been shown to correlate with the domain size of semi-
conductors and insulators (24, 27–35). The energy at the
absorption edge has been recently used to characterize the
size of MoOx (33), WOx (24), and VOx (4, 35) domains in
catalytic solids.
Typical diffuse reﬂectance UV-visible spectra are shown
in Fig. 3 for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/HfO2 samples. Absorption
bands in the 2–4 eV energy range reﬂect O2−to V5+ ligand-
to-metal charge transfer transitions (36–39). The corre-
sponding charge transfer bands in Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, and
ZrO2 occur at much higher energies and they do not in-
terfere with the analysis of absorption edge regions cor-
responding to VOx centers (Table 2). On TiO2, however,
this band appears at 3.17 eV and overlaps with the corre-
sponding bands in VOx species. In this case, VOx electronic
spectra were obtained by subtracting the TiO2 bands from
VOx/TiO2 spectra.
The effect of VOx surface density on absorption edge
energies is shown in Fig. 4 for the catalyst samples of
this study. The absorption energy for bulk V2O5 (2.05 eV)

calculated using Tauc’s law is shown as a horizontal line
in Fig. 4. The edge energy decreases with increasing VOx
surface density for all supports, as expected from an in-
crease in the size and dimensionality of VOx domains as
VOx surface density increases. At a given value of surface
density, the identity of the support inﬂuences the apparent
dispersion and absorption edge energy of VOx species.
Al2O3 and HfO2 appear to disperse VOx units more effec-
tively than other supports and edge energies remain high
(>2.5 eV), even at surface densities similar to those
expected for polyvanadate monolayers (ns = 7 VOx/nm2).
On silica supported catalysts, edge energies reach very
low values (2.1 eV) at much lower surface densities (2–3
VOx/nm2) than on other supports. The strength of inter-
actions between VOx and ZrO2 or TiO2 supports appears
to lie between the extremes observed on Al2O3 and SiO2
supports (Fig. 4), because absorption energies lie between
those measured on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/SiO2 supports.

Raman spectra for catalysts with VOx surface densities of
3.9–7.7 VOx/nm2 and 2.1–3.3 VOx/nm2 are shown in Figs. 5a
and 5b, respectively. The positions of the bands associated
with various VOx species are listed in Table 3. The nar-
row band at 1030–1020 cm−1 is assigned to V=
=O stretching
modes within isolated monovanadate species. The broad
bands in the 1000–600 cm−1 region can be ascribed to
V=
=O (1000–800 cm−1) and V-O-V (800–600 cm−1) stretch-
ing modes in polyvanadate species (18, 40, 41). Bulk V2O5
can be identiﬁed by bands at about 143, 282, 405, 489, 524,
694, and 993 cm−1, very similar to those detected on the
V2O5/SiO2 samples shown in Table 3. It is notable that
Raman spectroscopy provides evidence for V2O5 crystal-
lites at much lower VOx surface densities on all of the
supports than does XRD, indicating greater sensitivity of
Raman spectroscopy to the presence of crystalline V2O5.
The structure of the VOx species detected by Raman
spectroscopy depends on both support composition and
VOx surface density. In VOx/SiO2, the only bands detected
are those for monovanadate species and V2O5. As the VOx
surface density increases from 2.4 to 4.0 VOx/nm2, the pro-
portion of V2O5 to monovanadate species increases. On
Al2O3, no features are observed above the background
when the surface density is 2.3 VOx/nm2. At higher surface
densities (7.7 VOx/nm2), peaks attributed to monovana-
date species and V2O5 are detected. For vanadia supported
on TiO2, HfO2, and ZrO2, the most intense Raman bands
correspond to monovanadate and polyvanadate species.

(1000–600 cm−1) shifts to lower frequencies as the support
changes from HfO2 to ZrO2 to TiO2, suggestive of a increas-
ing percentage of V-O-V species relative to V=
=O bonds.
Figure 5a shows that at higher VOx surface densities, weak
bands corresponding to support-vanadia compounds are
detected on HfO2 and ZrO2. These bands are located at
772 and 977 cm−1 (Fig. 5a), in agreement with Raman spec-
tra reported for bulk ZrV2O7 (40, 42).
The catalytic properties of all supported vanadium oxide
samples are reported in Figs. 6–8. The effect of bed resi-
dence time on C3H8 conversion and on C3H6, CO, and CO2
selectivities is shown for VOx/Al2O3 (ns = 3.5 VOx/nm2) and
VOx/HfO2 (ns = 3.2 VOx/nm2) in Figs. 6a and 6b, respec-
tively. COx selectivities increase with increasing bed resi-
dence time, suggesting that C3H6 undergoes secondary ox-
idation reactions to form COx. Selectivities extrapolated to
zero residence time reﬂect the relative rates of direct con-
version of C3H8 to C3H6 and to COx.
Figure 7 shows propane reaction rates normalized by the
number of V-atoms and extrapolated to zero conversion

as a function of VOx surface density for all catalysts. In
general, oxidative dehydrogenation rates increase with in-
creasing VOx surface density. No reaction products were
detected on pure ZrO2, HfO2, SiO2, and Al2O3 sup-
ports at our reaction conditions. On pure TiO2, however,
propane reaction rates were signiﬁcant (2.2 × 10−7 mol/g-s)
and initial C3H6 selectivities were low (42%). The sup-
port activity was subtracted by assuming that the surface
of VOx/TiO2 consisted of bare patches with reaction rates
characteristic of pure TiO2 and that the rest of the surface
was covered with polyvanadate domains. Oxidative dehy-
drogenation rates per V-atom were highest on VOx/ZrO2
(Fig. 7). On HfO2, TiO2, and Al2O3 supports, reaction rates
(per V-atom) increased with increasing VOx density and
approached the higher rates observed on ZrO2 as surface
densities increased above 5 VOx/nm2. Reaction rates were
very low on SiO2-supported catalysts, probably due to the
presence of inactive monovanadate species and to the low
V2O5 dispersion detected by X-ray diffraction, UV-visible,
and Raman measurements.
Figure 8 shows that C3H6 selectivities extrapolated to
zero oxygen conversion increase with increasing VOx sur-
face density for all catalysts (Fig. 8). Selectivities were
corrected for reactions on TiO2 for VOx/TiO2 catalysts.
Propene selectivities are similar (70–90%) on all cata-
lysts at a given value of VOx surface density, except for
slightly higher values on Al2O3-supported catalysts at sur-
face densities below 10 VOx/nm2. It appears that the
larger VOx domains expected at higher surface densities
favor oxidative dehydrogenation over competing pathways
leading to the direct oxidation of propane to CO and
CO2.
DISCUSSION
X-ray diffraction and UV-visible and Raman spectro-
scopy data show that the structure of dispersed VOx species
depends on the identity of the support and on VOx surface
density (ns). Vanadia dispersed on Al2O3 shows the broad-
est range of VOx structures among the materials examined
in this study. At VOx surface densities below 1 VOx/nm2,
the large absorption edge energies in UV-visible spectra
and the absence of polyvanadate bands in Raman spectra
suggest that VOx species exist as monovanadate structures
or as isolated V+5 centers occupying cation vacancies within
the Al2O3 lattice (43). For surface densities between 1 and

7 VOx/nm2, UV-visible and Raman spectra detect the co-
existence of polyvanadate and monovanadate species on
Al2O3. Above 7 VOx/nm2, small V2O5 crystallites become
visible by X-ray diffraction and Raman bands correspond-
ing to crystalline V2O5 appear in the spectrum (Fig. 5a,
Table 3).
The structural evolution of dispersed VOx species on
HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2 is very similar to that observed on
Al2O3. UV-visible and Raman spectra show that polyvana-
date and monovanadate species co-exist on these support
surfaces at VOx surface densities above 1 VOx/nm2. Crys-
talline V2O5 species were not detected on any of the sup-
ports at surface densities below about 5 VOx/nm2. Higher
oxidation temperatures lead to the formation of V2O5
clusters and of zirconium vanadate on ZrO2 at surface
densities above 10 VOx/nm2 (4, 42, 44). Isolated tetrahe-
dral monovanadate species have also been detected using

On SiO2-supported samples, X-ray diffraction and
Raman spectroscopy do not detect V2O5 crystallites at
surface densities of about 1 VOx/nm2. Both techniques
clearly show the presence of crystalline V2O5 at higher
surface densities (>4 VOx/nm2). V2O5 crystallites become
detectable by X-ray diffraction on SiO2 at lower surface
densities (4.0 VOx/nm2) than on the other supports. VOx
species interact weakly with SiO2 and form V2O5 clus-
ters well below surface densities required to complete a
polyvanadate monolayer (7.5 VOx/nm2) (Fig. 2). Previous

studies have also shown that VOx dispersion is lower on
SiO2 than on Al2O3 or TiO2 for a given vanadium content
(47).
UV-visible spectra conﬁrm the conclusions reached from
Raman and X-ray diffraction studies. For example, edge en-
ergies for 10 VOx/SiO2 and 15 VOx/SiO2 were lower (2.1–
2.2 eV) than for other supports with the same vanadium
surface densities (ns = 2.4–4.0 VOx/nm2) (Fig. 4), suggest-
ing larger VOx domains on SiO2 than on the other supports.
At lower vanadium surface densities, the higher energy of
UV-Vis absorption edge suggests the presence of isolated
monovanadate species on this support. The high absorp-
tion energies on HfO2 and Al2O3 at low VOx surface den-
sities (<4 VOx/nm2) suggest the predominant presence of
monovanadate species (Fig. 4). Polyvanadate domains or
small V2O5 clusters account for the intermediate absorp-
tion energies observed on ZrO2 (Fig. 4). Absorption edge
energies decreased with increasing VOx surface densities
on all supports, as expected from the growth of VOx do-
mains as VOx surface density increases. Absorption edge
energies decrease with increasing number of next nearest
neighborsforMoOx(33)andWOx(24).Similareffectswere
observed for VOx species in standard compounds (Table 2).
These shifts reﬂect mainly the delocalization of molecular
orbitals over larger domains and they appear to be inﬂu-
enced only weakly by changes in local coordination (48).
Oxidative dehydrogenation rates (per V-atom) on sup-
ported vanadia depend on support composition and on
VOx surface density (Fig. 7). In general, reaction rates
(per V-atom) increase as VOx surface density increases
for all supports, suggesting that polyvanadate domains are
more active than monovanadate species. The data in Fig. 7
show that ZrO2-supported catalysts show the highest ox-
idative dehydrogenation rates and SiO2-supported cata-
lysts the lowest activity, while the other supports give inter-
mediate reactions rates (TiO2 > HfO2 > Al2O3). On Al2O3,
monovanadate structures favored at low surface densities
show high propene selectivities, but very low reaction rates
(Fig. 7). Reaction rates increase markedly as the coverage
of polyvanadate structures and the UV-visible edge ener-
gies increase with increasing VOx surface density on Al2O3.
Monovanadate structures present on Al2O3 at low VOx
surface densities are not very active, apparently because
oxidative dehydrogenation turnovers require reduction–
oxidation cycles of V+5 centers and V-O-Al species appear
to be more difﬁcult to reduce than V-O-V or V=
=O sites
in polyvanadate species. This conclusion is consistent with
reducibility studies using H2 as the reductant (49).
The very low apparent ODH turnover rates on VOx/SiO2
reﬂect the co-existence of inactive isolated monovana-
date species and active but poorly dispersed bulk V2O5,
as shown by the Raman spectra of VOx/SiO2. The ob-
served ODH rates are caused by the poor dispersion of
the V2O5 crystallites. The ODH turnover rate estimated
for bulk V2O5 based on its BET surface area and a surface
density of 7 VOx/nm2 is 2.25 × 10−3 s−1 at the conditions
of our experiments. True turnover rates may be actually
higher because not all low-index planes in V2O5 expose
V=
=O and V-O-V structures. The apparent turnover rates
on VOx/SiO2 samples are much lower than these values
(2–3 × 10−5 s−1, Fig. 7). These data suggest that the fraction
of VOx sites available at the surface of V2O5 crystallites sup-
ported on SiO2 is about 0.01. This value is consistent with
the large crystallites (30–40 nm) detected by line breadth
analysis of X-ray diffraction lines for VOx/SiO2 samples.
The observed effects of support and VOx surface den-
sity on reaction rates can be best interpreted by examin-
ing the dependence of oxidative dehydrogenation rates on
VOx domain size, as given indirectly by UV-visible edge en-
ergies in Fig. 9. Reaction rates (per total V-atom) increase
monotonically as absorption edge energies decrease from
2.9 to 2.2 eV (Fig. 9). These rates reach maximum values
of 2.0–2.5 × 10−3 s−1 at absorption energies of about 2.2 eV.
This trend clearly shows that polyvanadate domains con-
tain surface sites with higher activity than those present
on isolated monovanadate species, which have UV-Vis ab-
sorption edges at about 3.65 eV (Table 2). Reaction rates
normalized by the surface area and the VOx surface density
ofV2O5aresimilartothoseobtainedonthemostactivesup-
ported catalysts, suggesting that polyvanadate domains at-
tain surface structures with catalytic properties resembling
those of bulk V2O5. As discussed above, the unusually low
activity of VOx/SiO2 reﬂects the presence of inactive mono-
vanadate species and the low dispersion of V2O5 crystallites
on this support.
Clearly, the VOx surface density required for densiﬁca-
tion of VOx structures into polyvanadates and V2O5 clus-
ters depends on the identity of the support. The observed

catalytic trends, however, become less dependent on the
support when the VOx domain size or dispersion is char-
acterized by UV-visible edge energies (Fig. 9). Polyvana-
dates with high turnover rates and accessibility form do-
mains of size and structure controlled by the strength of
VOx-support interactions. Once formed, however, the re-
action rates and electronic properties of these VOx domains
(reﬂected in their absorption edge energies) becomes much
more weakly dependent on the identity of the support.
Bridging V-O-V groups in two-dimensional VO4 arrays,
which are favored at high vanadium coverages, have been
proposed as active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation on
VOx/Al2O3 (50). Ethane reaction rates (per V-atom) and
ethene selectivity increase with increasing vanadium load-
ing on SiO2 supports (51). Turnover rates (calculated from
site density measurements using O2 chemisorption uptakes
after reaction) also increased with increasing V-loading
(51). In the same study, V=
=O species were proposed as
active dehydrogenation sites and V-O-Si structures were
considered to provide combustion sites. On Nb2O5-V2O5
catalysts, turnover rates per surface V-atom increased with
VOx surface coverage, measured by surface-sensitive ion
scattering techniques (52). The higher turnover rates and
selectivity on polyvanadate and V2O5 structures is well doc-
umented, but molecular sieves containing V-atoms in pre-
sumed isolation are also active in oxidative dehydrogena-
tion reactions (3, 5, 12). This has led to the conclusion that
vanadate monomers, dimers, and polymers can all provide
active and selective sites for alkane oxidative dehydrogena-
tion (1). Our study provides strong evidence, however, that
monovanadate structures are signiﬁcantly less active than
polyvanadates for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Pseudo-ﬁrst-order rate coefﬁcients for dehydrogenation
(k1) and combustion (k2) pathways and for secondary com-
bustion of propene (k3) can be obtained from bed residence
time data. The assumption that all steps are ﬁrst order in hy-
drocarbon is consistent with our kinetic data on VOx/ZrO2
catalysts. The oxygen order implicit in the pseudo-ﬁrst-
order rate coefﬁcients is not required in the kinetic anal-
ysis because oxygen conversions were very low (<2%).
The details of the kinetic analysis have been reported else-
where (4).
The measured values of k1 increase with increasing VOx
surface density, in agreement with similar trends shown
in Fig. 7 for initial oxidative dehydrogenation rates. The

effects of VOx surface density on k1/k2 and k3/k1 ratios are
shown in Figs. 10a and 10b, respectively. For surface den-
sities between 1 and 8 VOx/nm2, k1/k2 ratios increase with
surface density, indicating that primary dehydrogenation is
favored over primary combustion on larger polyvanadate
domains. Except for Al2O3, all supports show similar k1/k2
values at a given VOx surface density. The high k1/k2 values
of Al2O3 reﬂect lower values for k2 on this support, since k1
values on these samples are comparable to those measured
on the other supports. It appears that primary propane oxi-
dation is inhibited as VOx species titrate unselective sites on
supportsurfacesandaslessactivemonovanadatestructures
are replaced by more active polyvanadate domains. The
similarity between the k1/k2 ratio for bulk V2O5 powders
(4.5) and for supported samples with high VOx surface den-
sities (2–5 VOx/nm2) shows that the relative rates of primary
dehydrogenation and combustion steps are essentially the
same for catalysis on polyvanadates, small VOx clusters, and
bulk V2O5 powders. Intraparticle diffusional restrictions
SUPPORTED VANADIUM OXIDES

can corrupt the kinetic nature of these k1/k2 ratios by caus-
ing propene combustion reactions within diffusion-limited
particles to appear to be propane combustion steps. The
observed increase in k1/k2 ratios as VOx surface density
increases (Fig. 10a) rules out this possibility, because such
diffusional restrictions would become more severe and lead
to lower k1/k2 ratios as the catalyst volumetric productivity
increases with increasing VOx site density (53).
The measured k3/k1 values, however, do not vary sys-
tematically with support composition or VOx surface den-
sity (Fig. 10b). The range of k3/k1 values (10–60) in these
samples is similar to those measured on VOx/ZrO2 cata-
lysts with a wider range of VOx surface densities (4). The
values obtained on bulk V2O5 powders (Fig. 10b) lie at
the upper end of this range. It appears that propane de-
hydrogenation and propene combustion rate coefﬁcients
vary similarly with VOx structure and domain size, suggest-
ing that similar surface structures are required for these two
reactions. Combustion rate coefﬁcients (k3), however, are
much higher than those for oxidative dehydrogenation (k1)
at the reaction conditions of this study. The similar struc-
tural requirements, satisﬁed by polyvanadates or V2O5 sur-
faces, and the higher rates of secondary reactions lead to
low propene yields on vanadia catalysts. If primary dehy-
drogenation and secondary combustion indeed share com-
mon structural requirements, it appears unlikely that struc-
tural modiﬁcations of V-centers beyond those attained by
changes in domain size can overcome current propene yield
limits. Cyclic dehydrogenation/reoxidation and membrane
reactor schemes may provide a more effective strategy for
increasing propene yields above those currently accessi-
ble in steady-state operation of supported vanadium oxide
catalysts.
CONCLUSIONS
The structure and dispersion of VOx species depend on
their surface density and on their interaction with a given
support. Support surfaces predominantly covered with
polyvanadate structures or small V2O5 clusters containing
V-O-V or V=
=O linkages lead to high oxidative dehydro-
genation rates and selectivities. The composition of the sup-
port inﬂuences the speciation of VOx species into mono-
vanadates, polyvanadates, and V2O5 clusters and thus the
catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in oxidative dehy-
drogenation reactions. The concentration of polyvanadate
structures increases with increasing VOx surface density.
Raman and UV-visible spectra show an excellent correla-
tion between oxidative dehydrogenation rates and the den-
sity of polyvanadate species on all support surfaces. Ox-
idative dehydrogenation rate coefﬁcients increase initially
with increasing VOx surface density on all supports, con-
currently with the densiﬁcation of isolated monovanadates
into polyvanadate domains, but ultimately decrease as the
latter evolve into V2O5 crystallites with low speciﬁc surface
area. Ratios of rate coefﬁcients for oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane to those for secondary propene combustion
are relatively insensitive to structural modiﬁcations caused
by changes in VOx surface density or support composition.
This suggests that sites required for oxidative dehydrogena-
tion also catalyze the undesired combustion of propene.
