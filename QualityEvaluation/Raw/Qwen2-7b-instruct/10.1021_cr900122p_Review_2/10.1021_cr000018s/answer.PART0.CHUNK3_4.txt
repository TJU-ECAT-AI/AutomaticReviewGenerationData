The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to enhance reaction rates, improve product selectivity, and reduce energy consumption. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their stability under reaction conditions, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to operate under mild conditions, which leads to higher yields and purity of products. Additionally, the development of new catalysts and the optimization of existing ones continue to drive advancements in chemical processes, leading to more efficient and sustainable manufacturing techniques.
