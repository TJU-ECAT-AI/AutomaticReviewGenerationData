[1] "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in determining the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions."
[2] "The use of these catalysts can lead to enhanced yields and selectivities in alkane transformations, which is of great industrial significance due to the potential for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness in chemical production processes."
