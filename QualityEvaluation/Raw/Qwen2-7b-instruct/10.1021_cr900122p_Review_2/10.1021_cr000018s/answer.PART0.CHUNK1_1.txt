[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177"
[3] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described. Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."

1. Photochemical CO2 reduction studies encompass a variety of systems, including Ru(bpy)3+ as a dual-function photosensitizer and catalyst, Ru(bpy)3+ alongside another metal complex as a catalyst, ReX(CO)3(bpy) or similar complexes as photosensitizers, Ru(bpy)3+ and Ru(bpy)3+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems, metalloporphyrins acting as dual-function photosensitizers and catalysts, and organic photosensitizers in conjunction with transition-metal complexes as catalysts.

2. In the most efficient photochemical CO2 reduction systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products can reach up to 40%.

3. The turnover number and frequency under photochemical conditions are influenced by factors such as irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration. These parameters have not been fully optimized in most photochemical experiments. Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- range from 1 to 10 h^-1, and turnover numbers usually fall within 100 or less.

1. 光化学CO2还原研究涵盖多种系统，包括Ru(bpy)3+作为双重功能的光敏化剂和催化剂，Ru(bpy)3+与另一个金属复合物作为催化剂，ReX(CO)3(bpy)或类似复合物作为光敏化剂，Ru(bpy)3+和Ru(bpy)3+-类型的复合物作为微异质体系中的光敏化剂，金属卟啉同时作为光敏化剂和催化剂，以及有机光敏化剂与过渡金属复合物作为催化剂。

2. 在最高效的光化学CO2还原系统中，所有还原产物的总量子产率可达到40%。

3. 在光化学条件下，转化数和频率受照射波长、光照强度、照射时间及催化剂浓度的影响。这些参数在大多数光化学实验中尚未完全优化。CO或HCOO-的典型转化频率在1到10小时^-1之间，而转化数通常在100或以下。
