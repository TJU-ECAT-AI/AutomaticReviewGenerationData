[1] "The successful development of new processes for the oxidative conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygenates will likely require novel types of reactors as well as novel catalysts."
[2] "The key features of the reaction mechanism appear to involve three stages: (i) electrophilic activation of RH by Pt(II) via a σ complex and a Pt(IV) alkyl hydride that undergoes deprotonations to a Pt(II) alkyl; (ii) oxidation by Pt(IV) to give a Pt(IV) alkyl; (iii) nucleophilic, SN2 attack of water at the α carbon of the latter with loss of H+ to give alcohol with Pt(II) as the leaving group."
[3] "The mechanism of the Shilov system, 103 representing one class of such electrophilic hydroxylation systems, has now been studied extensively, and many of the mechanistic features have been established."
[4] "The oxidation of methane by O2 to methanol."
[5] "The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."
[6] "The unusual high reactivity of electron-deficient metalloporphyrin complexes toward hydroperoxides, acting as living initiators that continuously provide high radical flux at low reaction temperatures."
[7] "The thermodynamics of this reaction are marginal; however, adjusting the reaction conditions and coupling this reaction with energetically favorable product processes could improve conversion efficiencies."
[8] "The selectivity in these cases appears to arise from the preferential reaction of 17-electron intermediates with CO2 rather than protons."
[9] "The mechanism of these reactions has not yet been established, their general features, especially the chemoselectivities (higher reactivity of alkanes compared to alcohols; preference for methyl groups in functional organics), suggest that alkane activation likely occurs by an electrophilic pathway as discussed above."
[10] "The key challenges that must be overcome in order to develop catalysts for the selective, energy-efficient oxidation of alkanes to valuable chemical products without large quantities of unwanted byproducts such as CO2 include the following: (1) identification of the reaction pathways leading to primary and secondary products and determination of the rate coefficients for each path; (2) in situ identification of reactive intermediates; (3) determination of the reactivity of different forms of oxygen present at the catalyst surface and their role in catalyzing desired and undesired oxidation processes; (4) identification of the elementary processes involved in hydrogen abstraction, carboncarbon bond cleavage, and oxygen insertion and the role of redox properties of metal cations in these processes; (5) establishment of the relative reactivities of carbonhydrogen bonds (1, 2, 3, HCH2X (X = OH, halide, etc.) toward soluble transition-metal complexes capable of electrophilic CH bond activation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways. Supported vanadium oxides, for instance, exhibit high alkene selectivity but show a decline in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. Metal-exchanged zeolites can be tuned to favor the production of specific oxygenated products from alkanes by adjusting the metal content and exchange conditions. The key factors that contribute to their industrial significance are:

1. The ability to activate alkane CH bonds selectively, leading to the formation of desired oxygenated products like alkenes and oxygenates.
2. The capability to operate under mild conditions, reducing energy consumption and improving process efficiency.
3. The robustness of these catalysts against poisoning and deactivation, enabling continuous operation and high throughput.
4. The capacity to handle a wide range of feedstocks, including light alkanes, ethylene, propane, butane, and isobutane, making them versatile in the petrochemical industry.
5. The potential for scalability and integration into existing industrial processes, facilitating the retrofitting of existing facilities for more sustainable production.

To achieve higher product selectivities and efficiencies, researchers must overcome several challenges:

1. Identify the detailed reaction pathways leading to primary and secondary products and quantify the rate constants for each process.
2. Develop methods for in situ monitoring of reactive intermediates to gain insights into the reaction mechanisms.
3. Determine the reactivity of different forms of oxygen (e.g., O2, H2O2) on the catalyst surface and understand their role in catalyzing desired vs. undesired oxidation processes.
4. Investigate the underlying mechanisms of hydrogen abstraction, carbon-carbon bond cleavage, and oxygen insertion, focusing on the impact of redox properties of metal cations.
5. Establish the relative reactivities of carbon-hydrogen bonds (1, 2, 3, HCH2X) towards transition-metal complexes capable of electrophilic CH bond activation, optimizing catalyst design for maximum efficiency.
6. Explore novel reactor concepts, such as ultrashort contact time reactors, to achieve higher product selectivities than those attainable with conventional fixed-bed reactors.
7. Address safety concerns when working with explosive mixtures, requiring specialized equipment and safety measures for rapid screening of selective, catalytic hydrocarbon oxidations under dioxygen.
8. Develop robust ligands for metalloporphyrin complexes that can withstand oxidizing conditions, minimizing undesirable side reactions and ensuring catalyst longevity.
9. Design conditions that maintain low oxidant concentrations to prevent hydroxy radical formation, enhancing the selectivity of alkane oxidation processes.
10. Enhance the stability and activity of catalysts to enable the direct oxidation of methane to oxygenates, overcoming limitations in yield, cost, and environmental impact.

These advancements will pave the way for more sustainable and efficient alkane functionalization processes, contributing to the development of greener chemical synthesis techniques.

B. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes:
While many oxide catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity (e.g., >80%) at very low alkane conversion levels, all show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support.

C. Selective Oxidation of Hydrocarbons to Oxygenated Products: Approaches Involving Heterogeneous Catalysts:
While considerable research has been carried out on each of these reactions, only two have been commercialized: the conversion of butane to acetic acid and the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride.

D. Approaches Involving Homogeneous Catalysts:
Although the first four processes represent highly significant developments and the elucidation of their mechanisms major achievements in organotransition-metal chemistry, none of these systems appears suited for the catalytic oxidative functionalization of hydrocarbons, e.g., the oxidation of methane by O2 to methanol.

E. Enzymatic and Biomimetic Systems:
Since these hydrocarbon oxidation reactions in biology are carried out at ambient temperature and pressure, catalysts designed based on this chemistry may have the advantage of requiring significantly less energy input than present technology based on heterogeneous catalysts.

F. Novel Reactor Concepts:
The successful development of new processes for the oxidative conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygenates will likely require novel types of reactors as well as novel catalysts. Such reactors may utilize ultrashort contact times, cycling catalyst beds, catalyst recirculation between oxidizing and reducing conditions, and the integration of chemical reaction and separations.

G. Alternative Processes:
Creative thinking is required to develop new routes to large-scale commodity chemicals that reduce investment and give higher yields.

H. Alternative Oxidants:
While the use of these oxidants provides cleaner processes and produces less carbon dioxide, the cost of N2O and H2O2 relative to air prevent wider applications beyond those used at present.

I. Research Challenges and Needs:
A number of significant challenges must be overcome in order to develop catalysts for the selective, energy-efficient oxidation of alkanes to valuable chemical products without large quantities of unwanted byproducts such as CO2.

V. Utilization of Carbon Dioxide:
There are several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 whenever possible.

### Question 1: How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes often relies on catalysts with high alkene selectivity. Supported metal oxides show a decrease in alkene selectivity with increasing alkane conversion, but this decline is observed to decrease with increasing basicity of the support. The structure of these catalysts, including the domain sizes of vanadia and the optical absorption band edge, affects the rate constants for the oxidative dehydrogenation processes. In the case of metal-exchanged zeolites, the exchange of metal ions can alter the catalytic properties, influencing the selectivity towards specific products.

### Question 2: What are the key factors that contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts in the context of alkane transformations?

Industrial significance of these catalysts is attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the ability to selectively oxidize alkanes to produce valuable chemical products without generating large quantities of unwanted byproducts like CO2 is crucial. Secondly, the catalysts' efficiency in transforming low molecular weight alkanes, particularly methane, into higher value products like olefins and oxygenates, is economically beneficial. Additionally, the catalysts' stability, selectivity, and activity at mild conditions (ambient temperature and pressure) make them attractive for industrial applications. Lastly, the development of catalysts that can operate under conditions that minimize energy input, such as using sunlight or oxygen as reactants, aligns with the sustainability goals of the chemical industry.

### Question 3: What are the specific challenges and needs in the development of catalysts for the selective, energy-efficient oxidation of alkanes to valuable chemical products, and what are the implications for the field?

The development of catalysts for the selective, energy-efficient oxidation of alkanes faces several significant challenges. These include identifying the reaction pathways leading to primary and secondary products, determining the rate coefficients for each path, in situ identification of reactive intermediates, and establishing the reactivities of different forms of oxygen present at the catalyst surface. The need for rapid screening of potential electrophilic transition-metal complexes for selective catalytic hydrocarbon oxidations under dioxygen is also highlighted. Additionally, for new biomimetic catalysts, robust ligands that can withstand oxidizing conditions, conditions to maintain low oxidant concentrations to minimize undesirable side reactions, and catalysts that utilize O2 as an oxidant are required. These challenges imply that interdisciplinary approaches involving synthesis, spectroscopy, computational modeling, and innovative reactor designs are essential for advancing catalyst development in this field.

### Question 4: What are the motivations for producing chemicals from CO2, and how can the utilization of CO2 contribute to the global carbon balance and future energy distribution systems?

Producing chemicals from CO2 serves multiple motivations. CO2 is a cheap, nontoxic feedstock that can replace toxic chemicals, and it is a renewable resource compared to fossil fuels. Producing chemicals from CO2 can lead to the creation of new materials and potentially more efficient routes to existing chemical intermediates. It also has the potential to positively impact the global carbon balance by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels, especially in sectors like transportation, which are major contributors to CO2 emissions. The utilization of CO2 in the production of high-energy density fuels from renewable energy sources or nuclear energy could provide a future energy distribution system based on liquid and gaseous fuels without increasing atmospheric CO2, thus mitigating climate change impacts.

这些催化剂的工业重要性体现在以下几个关键因素上：首先，能够选择性地氧化烷烃生成有价值化学产品，同时不产生大量副产品，如二氧化碳，这是非常重要的。其次，它们能够在低分子量烷烃（特别是甲烷）中高效地转化为更高价值的产品，如烯烃和氧基化合物，这具有经济上的优势。此外，催化剂在室温和压力下工作的稳定性和选择性也是工业应用的关键。最后，开发能够在光照或氧气作为反应物时最小化能量输入的催化剂，与化学工业的可持续发展目标相一致。

### 第三题：开发用于烷烃选择性、高效氧化为有价值的化学产品的催化剂面临哪些挑战和需求？这些挑战对领域有何影响？

开发用于烷烃选择性、高效氧化的催化剂面临着几个重大挑战。这些挑战包括确定形成初级和次级产品的反应路径，确定每条路径的速度系数，以及原位识别活性中间体。还需要了解表面氧的不同形式在催化剂上的作用，以及它们在催化过程中催化所需和不希望的氧化过程。对于新的生物模拟催化剂，需要耐受氧化条件的牢固配体，保持低氧化剂浓度以减少任何不必要的副反应的条件，以及利用氧气作为氧化剂的催化剂。这些挑战表明，合成、光谱学、计算建模和创新反应器设计的跨学科方法对于推进这一领域的催化剂发展至关重要。

### 第四题：生产CO2的动机是什么？CO2的利用如何有助于全球碳平衡和未来能源分配系统？

生产CO2化学制品有多种动机。CO2是一种廉价、无毒的原料，可以替代有毒化学品，并且它是一个与化石燃料相比可再生的资源。从CO2中生产化学物质不仅可以创造新材料，还可以提供更高效的现有化学中间体的生产途径。它还有助于通过减少大气中的CO2水平来积极影响全球碳平衡，特别是在交通等主要CO2排放源的部门。利用CO2生产高能密度燃料，从可再生能源或核能中获取能源，可以提供一个基于液态和气态燃料的未来能源分配系统，而不增加大气中的CO2含量，从而缓解气候变化的影响。

Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia. 78,79 A series of catalysts ranging in V2O5 weight loading from 1% to 15% were prepared and then characterized by X-ray absorption, Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and EXAFS. Since calcination at 773 K caused changes in the BET surface area of the samples, which depended on the weight loading of vanadia, the loading of vanadia is expressed in V atoms/nm2. Selective adsorption of CO2 on the zirconia support reveals that up to 1.2 V/nm2, corresponding to 60% coverage of the support, is deposited primarily as monomeric vanadate species. At higher vanadia surface densities, polyvanadates appear, and the surface of the zirconia becomes fully covered by a monolayer of vanadia at a surface density of 7.5 V/nm2. Raman spectroscopy and UVvisible absorption edge energy measurements confirm the progressive growth in the nuclearity of the supported vandia species with increasing vanadia surface loading. Values of the rate coefficients for eqs 911 were determined and examined as a function of vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UVvisible absorption band edge energy. As seen in Figure 5, while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains.

The use of mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, has been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81

The successful development of new processes for the oxidative conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygenates will likely require novel types of reactors as well as novel catalysts. Such reactors may utilize ultrashort contact times, cycling catalyst beds, catalyst recirculation between oxidizing and reducing conditions, and the integration of chemical reaction and separations. The potential for ultrashort contact time (1 ms) reactors has recently been demonstrated for the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas (CO and H2) and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. For example, methane + O2 can be converted to synthesis gas with greater than 95% selectivity at 1273 K over Rh/Al2O3114 and ethane + O2 can be converted to ethene with over 85% selectivity at 1123 K over Pt/Al2O3.115

The largest of these uses is urea production, which reached approximately 90 million metric tons per year in 1997.126b In addition to these commercial processes using CO2 (compounds 14 in Scheme 3), there are a number of reactions currently under study in various laboratories that hold promise (remaining reactions in Scheme 3).

Approximately 110 MT (megatons) of CO2 are currently used for chemical synthesis annually.126a The chemicals synthesized include urea (1), salicylic acid (2), cyclic carbonates (3), and polycarbonates (4). The largest of these uses is urea production, which reached approximately 90 million metric tons per year in 1997.126b In addition to these commercial processes using CO2 (compounds 14 in Scheme 3), there are a number of reactions currently under study in various laboratories that hold promise (remaining reactions in Scheme 3).

1. Metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations through their composition, structure, and reaction conditions. For supported vanadia, the structure affects the rate coefficients for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. The larger the vanadia domains, the higher the rate of ODH. The catalyst's surface density determines whether monomeric or polyvanadates are present, impacting the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

2. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium often produce only small to moderate yields of desired products. Exceptions include Mitsubishi's catalysts which showed high yields in the oxidation of propane to acrylic acid and its further conversion to acrylonitrile.

3. Ultrashort contact time reactors have been successfully used for the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas and ethane to ethene, demonstrating their potential for efficient alkane transformations.

4. Approximately 110 megatons of CO2 are annually used in chemical synthesis, with urea production being the largest commercial use. Various ongoing research in laboratories aims to expand the use of CO2 in chemical synthesis.

5. The review outlines barriers to further progress in CO2 utilization, including understanding reaction pathways, identifying reactive intermediates, determining the role of oxygen at the catalyst surface, and establishing the reactivity of carbon-hydrogen bonds. The review also suggests possible avenues for future research, emphasizing collaborations between academic, industrial, and national laboratories.

Scheme 13. Artificial Photosynthesis for CO2 Reduction with Ru(bpy)32+
...
Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less.

...
Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined. These may be important in polymer synthesis using propylene oxide and related monomers in analogy to propene polymerization. Likewise, chain transfer reagents to control polymer molecular weights are also needed. Catalysts with higher turnover frequencies than currently available are needed. Finally, extension of successes in polycarbonate synthesis to polyesters from olefins and CO2 is an attractive goal.

...
Regarding heterogeneous electrocatalysts, the principal barriers are poor product selectivity and unacceptably high reaction temperatures. Thus, in ethanol production by CO2 hydrogenation, ethanol is generally one component of a mixture of alcohols and hydrocarbons, and more selective catalysts are needed. Catalysts capable of operating at lower reaction temperatures for hydrogenating CO2 to methanol are also needed.

...
New approaches to reduce CO2 by six or eight electrons with high selectivity and low overpotentials are required. Better understanding of CC bond-forming reactions is necessary to design catalysts that selectively produce ethanol or ethylene.

...
Understanding the binary and ternary phase behavior of CO2substratereactant systems is needed to conduct reactions under the most favorable temperature and pressure conditions (i.e., to generate the number of phases and phase compositions desired).

...
The production of chemicals and fuels from CO2 would be significantly enhanced by fundamental studies of the kinetics and thermodynamics of catalytically relevant CH, CX, MH, MX, and MC bond-forming and -cleavage reactions.

...
Catalysts for formation of polyurethanes and polyesters using CO2 as a monomer would also be desirable.

...
The ability to predict ternary and quaternary phase behavior would also significantly enhance development of this field.

...
Catalysts for epoxide and olefin + CO2 copolymerization are needed that are less sensitive to water and oxygen, more active, and more stereoselective.

...
A better understanding of features promoting selective reactions with either CO2 or protons is needed. Similarly, a better understanding of factors controlling formate versus CO production is needed as well as how they relate to ultimate methanol or methane production.

...
It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes.

...
There are M/ZSM-5 active site models formulated on the basis of spectroscopic information.

...
For diesel engines, there is another important issue, which is control of particulate matter emission. Developing highly efficient, economical, and durable exhaust treatment systems for such engines is therefore crucial for large-scale application in transportation, especially for passenger cars.

...
For treatment of exhaust from lean-burn gasoline engines, the operating temperature window is 350-700°C, with occasional excursions to higher temperatures. For heavy-duty diesel engines, the operating temperature window is approximately the same; however, the hydrocarbon concentration is substantially lower. For light-duty diesel engines, the temperature window is 200-350°C, with the possibility that the lower limit could be as low as 150°C.

...
There are insufficient data for definitive conclusions on the potential of the alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts.

...
The state of the noble-metal surfaces and the reaction mechanism are not known.

1. The turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- reactions are typically between 1 and 10 h-1, with turnover numbers generally around 100 or less. Higher turnover frequencies are desired for catalysts, and extending successes in polycarbonate synthesis to polyesters from olefins and CO2 is an attractive goal. Understanding the phase behavior of CO2 systems under desired conditions and the kinetics and thermodynamics of relevant chemical reactions are crucial for enhancing the production of chemicals and fuels from CO2.

2. Catalysts for polyurethanes and polyesters formation from CO2 as a monomer are needed, requiring improvements in catalyst selectivity and efficiency. The ability to predict phase behavior in CO2 systems can significantly advance the field. Catalysts for epoxide and olefin + CO2 copolymerization must be less sensitive to water and oxygen, more active, and more stereoselective.

3. Selective reactions with CO2 or protons, factors controlling formate versus CO production, and their relation to final methanol or methane production need better understanding. The operating temperature windows for diesel engines vary based on the type, with light-duty engines having a lower limit as low as 150°C. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts, and the state of noble-metal surfaces and reaction mechanisms are not known.

1. CO或HCOO-反应的周转频率通常在1到10 h-1之间，周转数一般在100左右或更少。催化剂的更高周转频率是所需的，并且将聚碳酸酯合成的成功扩展到从烯烃和CO2合成聚酯是一个有吸引力的目标。理解CO2系统在所需条件下的相行为以及相关化学反应的动力学和热力学对于增强CO2来源的化学品和燃料的生产至关重要。

2. 需要催化剂用于以CO2作为单体形成聚氨酯和聚酯，要求改进催化剂的选择性和效率。预测CO2系统相行为的能力可以显著促进该领域的发展。对于环氧树脂和烯烃+CO2共聚物化催化剂，需要对水和氧气的敏感性较低、活性更高、立体选择性更好的催化剂。

3. 需要更好地理解与CO2或质子的选定反应、控制形成酸盐还是CO的因素及其与最终甲醇或甲烷生产的关系。柴油发动机的操作温度窗口根据类型而变化，轻型柴油发动机的下限可能低至150°C。关于铝基NOx减少催化剂的有效性的数据不足，而且不知道贵金属表面的状态和反应机制。
