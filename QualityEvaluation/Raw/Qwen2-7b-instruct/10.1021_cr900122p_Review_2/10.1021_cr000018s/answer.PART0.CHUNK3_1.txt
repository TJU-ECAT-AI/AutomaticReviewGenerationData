1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These factors significantly influence the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalysts, which in turn affect the yield and purity of the products. The industrial significance of these catalysts is due to their ability to enhance the conversion rates, reduce energy consumption, and improve the economics of the chemical processes they are used in.
