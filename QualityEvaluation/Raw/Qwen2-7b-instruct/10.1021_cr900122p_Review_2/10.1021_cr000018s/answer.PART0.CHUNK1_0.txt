[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "The aforementioned molecular sensitizers can be replaced with semiconductor electrodes or particles to achieve light harvesting."
[3] "Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."
[4] "It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes. 245,246"
[5] "Alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts have been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425 C. At high temperatures, their activities are higher than zeolite-based catalysts (e.g., Figure 20 for a SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst); 251-253 however, they also have a relatively narrow operating temperature window of about 150 C."

1. The systems for photochemical CO2 reduction are categorized into several groups, including Ru(bpy)32+ functioning as both a photosensitizer and a catalyst, Ru(bpy)32+ used as a photosensitizer alongside another metal complex as a catalyst, ReX(CO)3(bpy) or similar complexes as photosensitizers, Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems, metalloporphyrins serving as both photosensitizers and catalysts, and organic photosensitizers paired with transition-metal complexes as catalysts.

2. Molecular sensitizers for photochemical CO2 reduction can be substituted with semiconductor electrodes or particles for light harvesting.

3. The typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are around 1 to 10 h^-1, and turnover numbers usually fall within 100 or less.

4. Hydrothermal degradation of catalysts involves the dealumination of zeolite and the migration and agglomeration of metal ions and oxo complexes.

5. Alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts demonstrate high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425°C, with their activities surpassing those of zeolite-based catalysts. However, they have a relatively narrow operating temperature window of approximately 150°C.

1. 研究光化学CO2还原的系统被分为几个类别，包括Ru(bpy)32+作为光敏化剂和催化剂的双重身份；Ru(bpy)32+作为光敏化剂与另一种金属复合物作为催化剂；ReX(CO)3(bpy)或类似复合物作为光敏化剂；Ru(bpy)32+和Ru(bpy)32+-类型的复合物在微异质系统中作为光敏化剂；金属卟啉同时作为光敏化剂和催化剂；以及有机光敏化剂与过渡金属复合物作为催化剂。

2. 光化学CO2还原中的分子敏化剂可以被半导体电极或颗粒取代以实现光能捕获。

3. CO或HCOO-的典型周转频率在1到10 h^-1之间，周转数通常在100以下。

4. 催化剂的热力学降解涉及沸石的铝化物丢失以及金属离子和氧化物复合物的迁移和聚集。

5. 在425°C以上的温度下，以SnO2/Al2O3催化剂为例，铝基NOx降低催化剂显示出高活性和选择性。然而，它们的运行温度窗口相对较窄，约为150°C。
