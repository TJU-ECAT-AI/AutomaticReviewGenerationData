The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, greatly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation. These catalysts are pivotal in converting alkanes into higher value products due to their high selectivity, stability, and ability to operate under mild conditions. The specific properties of these catalysts, such as the type of metal, its valence state, and the nature of the support, significantly affect their performance. For example, vanadium-based catalysts are robust in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, while metal-exchanged zeolites offer tunable acidity and porosity for optimizing specific alkane conversion reactions. Reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of co-catalysts, also greatly impact catalyst activity and product yield.
