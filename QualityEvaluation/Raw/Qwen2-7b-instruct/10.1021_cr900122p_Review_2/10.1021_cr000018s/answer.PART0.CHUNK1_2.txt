[1] "The systems studied for photochemical CO2 reduction studies can be divided into several groups: Ru(bpy)32+ both as a photosensitizer and a catalyst;171 Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer and another metal complex as a catalyst;172 ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer;172a,173 Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems;174 metalloporphyrins both as a photosensitizers and catalysts;175 and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.17"
[2] "In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches 40%.177"
[3] "Under photochemical conditions, the turnover number and the turnover frequency are dependent on irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration, and they have not been optimized in most of the photochemical experiments described."
[4] "Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less."

1. The systems for photochemical CO2 reduction studies fall into several categories including Ru(bpy)32+ as both a photosensitizer and catalyst, Ru(bpy)32+ as a photosensitizer with another metal complex as a catalyst, ReX(CO)3(bpy) or a similar complex as a photosensitizer, Ru(bpy)32+ and Ru(bpy)32+-type complexes as photosensitizers in microheterogeneous systems, metalloporphyrins as both photosensitizers and catalysts, and organic photosensitizers and transition-metal complexes as catalysts.

2. In the most efficient systems, the total quantum yield for all reduced products reaches up to 40%.

3. The turnover number and the turnover frequency under photochemical conditions are influenced by irradiation wavelength, light intensity, irradiation time, and catalyst concentration. These factors have not been optimized in most photochemical experiments.

4. The typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and the turnover numbers are usually 100 or less.

1. 光化学CO2还原研究中的系统可以分为几类，包括作为光敏化剂和催化剂的Ru(bpy)32+；作为光敏化剂和另一种金属复合物作为催化剂的Ru(bpy)32+；作为光敏化剂的ReX(CO)3(bpy)或类似复合物；作为微异质系统中光敏化剂的Ru(bpy)32+和Ru(bpy)32+-型复合物；作为光敏化剂和催化剂的金属卟啉；以及作为催化剂的有机光敏化剂和过渡金属复合物。

2. 在最有效的系统中，所有还原产物的总量子产率达到40%。

3. 在光化学条件下，周转数和周转频率依赖于照射波长、光照强度、照射时间以及催化剂浓度。这些因素在大多数光化学实验中并未得到优化。

4. CO或HCOO-的典型周转次数在1到10 h-1之间，周转数通常为100或更少。
