B. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes: "The central issue is how to achieve a high yield of propene while avoiding the combustion of propane or propene to CO2 (eqs 9-11)."

C. Selective Oxidation of Hydrocarbons to Oxygenated Products: "Only two have been commercialized: the conversion of butane to acetic acid and the conversion of butane to maleic anhydride."

D. Approaches Involving Homogeneous Catalysts: "None of the present systems is practical (since none display acceptable rates or do not use dioxygen as the oxidant)."

E. Enzymatic and Biomimetic Systems: "Total replacement of the 28 hydrogens of metallotetraphenylporphyrin complexes with halogens (F, Cl, Br) enhances the stability of the complexes to oxidative degradation, causes large increases in the M(n + 1)/M(n) reduction potential, and greatly increases catalytic activity toward oxidation of secondary and tertiary CH bonds in alkanes by accelerating selective homolytic decomposition of intermediate hydroperoxides to alcohols via alkoxy radicals."

F. Novel Reactor Concepts: "Ultrashort contact time (1 ms) reactors have recently been demonstrated for the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas (CO and H2) and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene."

G. Alternative Processes: "MMA is currently prepared from isobutylene via two high-temperature gas-phase oxidations followed by esterification (eq 25). These high-temperature conditions result in low yield and carbon dioxide production."

H. Alternative Oxidants: "The cost of N2O and H2O2 relative to air prevent wider applications beyond those used at present."

I. Research Challenges and Needs: "For new biomimetic catalysts, the development of robust ligands that can withstand oxidizing conditions of the reaction, the design of reaction conditions that maintain low oxidant concentrations to minimize undesirable side reactions such as hydroxy radical formation, and the development of catalysts that utilize O2 as oxidant."
