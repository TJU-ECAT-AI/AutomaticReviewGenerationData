[1] "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions."
[2] "Factors contributing to their industrial significance include high activity, selectivity, stability, and the ability to handle a wide range of feedstocks."
[3] "The structure of these catalysts, such as the size and shape of the metal particles, the type and amount of support material, and the porosity of the zeolites, affect the accessibility of the reactants and products, which in turn impacts the reaction rates and product yields."
[4] "Reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of promoters or inhibitors, can also significantly alter the catalytic performance."
