How do the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, and what factors contribute to their industrial significance?

Some progress in understanding the relationships between catalyst structure and performance has been reported recently for metal oxide-supported vanadia. 78,79 A series of catalysts ranging in V2O5 weight loading from 1% to 15% were prepared and then characterized by X-ray absorption, Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and EXAFS. Since calcination at 773 K caused changes in the BET surface area of the samples, which depended on the weight loading of vanadia, the loading of vanadia is expressed in V atoms/nm2. Selective adsorption of CO2 on the zirconia support reveals that up to 1.2 V/nm2, corresponding to 60% coverage of the support, is deposited primarily as monomeric vanadate species. At higher vanadia surface densities, polyvanadates appear, and the surface of the zirconia becomes fully covered by a monolayer of vanadia at a surface density of 7.5 V/nm2. Raman spectroscopy and UVvisible absorption edge energy measurements confirm the progressive growth in the nuclearity of the supported vandia species with increasing vanadia surface loading. Values of the rate coefficients for eqs 911 were determined and examined as a function of vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UVvisible absorption band edge energy. As seen in Figure 5, while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains.

The use of mixed-metal oxide catalysts, often containing V as one of the elements, has been examined as candidates for the selective oxidation of alkanes. However, as seen in Table 3, such catalysts produce only small to moderate yields of the desired product. An exception is the work reported by Mitsubishi in which propane is oxidized to acrylic acid in yields exceeding 52% over a catalyst formulated as MoV0.3Ti0.23Nb0.12Ox. 80 This catalyst is even more effective in catalyzing the conversion of propane directly to acrylonitrile when the vapor-phase oxidation is run in the presence of ammonia. 81

The successful development of new processes for the oxidative conversion of alkanes to olefins and oxygenates will likely require novel types of reactors as well as novel catalysts. Such reactors may utilize ultrashort contact times, cycling catalyst beds, catalyst recirculation between oxidizing and reducing conditions, and the integration of chemical reaction and separations. The potential for ultrashort contact time (1 ms) reactors has recently been demonstrated for the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas (CO and H2) and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene. For example, methane + O2 can be converted to synthesis gas with greater than 95% selectivity at 1273 K over Rh/Al2O3114 and ethane + O2 can be converted to ethene with over 85% selectivity at 1123 K over Pt/Al2O3.115

The largest of these uses is urea production, which reached approximately 90 million metric tons per year in 1997.126b In addition to these commercial processes using CO2 (compounds 14 in Scheme 3), there are a number of reactions currently under study in various laboratories that hold promise (remaining reactions in Scheme 3).

Approximately 110 MT (megatons) of CO2 are currently used for chemical synthesis annually.126a The chemicals synthesized include urea (1), salicylic acid (2), cyclic carbonates (3), and polycarbonates (4).

1. Metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations through their composition, structure, and reaction conditions. For supported vanadia, the structure affects the rate coefficients for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. The larger the vanadia domains, the higher the rate of ODH. The catalyst's surface density determines whether monomeric or polyvanadates are present, impacting the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

2. Mixed-metal oxide catalysts containing vanadium often produce only small to moderate yields of desired products. Exceptions include Mitsubishi's catalysts which showed high yields in the oxidation of propane to acrylic acid and its further conversion to acrylonitrile.

3. Ultrashort contact time reactors have been successfully used for the oxidative conversion of methane to synthesis gas and ethane to ethene, demonstrating their potential for efficient alkane transformations.

4. Approximately 110 megatons of CO2 are annually used in chemical synthesis, with urea production being the largest commercial use. Various ongoing research in laboratories aims to expand the use of CO2 in chemical synthesis.
