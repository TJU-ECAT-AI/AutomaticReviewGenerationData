[1] "In considering various approaches to addressing the global atmospheric CO2 problem, it becomes evident that enhanced capabilities in the area of chemical catalysis could play a significant role."
[2] "Taking the United States as an example, catalysis currently plays a major role in 90% of the current chemical manufacturing processes."
[3] "Improved catalytic processes could lead to more atom-efficient and energy-efficient use of fossil fuels such as hydrocarbons, to higher yield conversions of other carbon-containing feedstocks to desired products, and to new industrial uses for CO2."
[4] "The multifaceted and worldwide scientific and technological challenges posed by carbon management raise the need for a research-oriented and cross-disciplinary assessment of contributions that catalytic research has and could make in addressing these challenges."
