Scheme 13. Artificial Photosynthesis for CO2 Reduction with Ru(bpy)32+
...
Typical turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- are between 1 and 10 h-1, and turnover numbers are generally 100 or less.

...
Factors controlling regio- and stereoselectivity of metal-centered CO2 transformations are also ill-defined. These may be important in polymer synthesis using propylene oxide and related monomers in analogy to propene polymerization. Likewise, chain transfer reagents to control polymer molecular weights are also needed. Catalysts with higher turnover frequencies than currently available are needed. Finally, extension of successes in polycarbonate synthesis to polyesters from olefins and CO2 is an attractive goal.

...
Regarding heterogeneous electrocatalysts, the principal barriers are poor product selectivity and unacceptably high reaction temperatures. Thus, in ethanol production by CO2 hydrogenation, ethanol is generally one component of a mixture of alcohols and hydrocarbons, and more selective catalysts are needed. Catalysts capable of operating at lower reaction temperatures for hydrogenating CO2 to methanol are also needed.

...
New approaches to reduce CO2 by six or eight electrons with high selectivity and low overpotentials are required. Better understanding of CC bond-forming reactions is necessary to design catalysts that selectively produce ethanol or ethylene.

...
Understanding the binary and ternary phase behavior of CO2substratereactant systems is needed to conduct reactions under the most favorable temperature and pressure conditions (i.e., to generate the number of phases and phase compositions desired).

...
The production of chemicals and fuels from CO2 would be significantly enhanced by fundamental studies of the kinetics and thermodynamics of catalytically relevant CH, CX, MH, MX, and MC bond-forming and -cleavage reactions.

...
Catalysts for formation of polyurethanes and polyesters using CO2 as a monomer would also be desirable.

...
The ability to predict ternary and quaternary phase behavior would also significantly enhance development of this field.

...
Catalysts for epoxide and olefin + CO2 copolymerization are needed that are less sensitive to water and oxygen, more active, and more stereoselective.

...
A better understanding of features promoting selective reactions with either CO2 or protons is needed. Similarly, a better understanding of factors controlling formate versus CO production is needed as well as how they relate to ultimate methanol or methane production.

...
It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes.

...
There are M/ZSM-5 active site models formulated on the basis of spectroscopic information.

...
For diesel engines, there is another important issue, which is control of particulate matter emission. Developing highly efficient, economical, and durable exhaust treatment systems for such engines is therefore crucial for large-scale application in transportation, especially for passenger cars.

...
For treatment of exhaust from lean-burn gasoline engines, the operating temperature window is 350-700°C, with occasional excursions to higher temperatures. For heavy-duty diesel engines, the operating temperature window is approximately the same; however, the hydrocarbon concentration is substantially lower. For light-duty diesel engines, the temperature window is 200-350°C, with the possibility that the lower limit could be as low as 150°C.

...
There are insufficient data for definitive conclusions on the potential of the alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts.

...
The state of the noble-metal surfaces and the reaction mechanism are not known.

1. The turnover frequencies for CO or HCOO- reactions are typically between 1 and 10 h-1, with turnover numbers generally around 100 or less. Higher turnover frequencies are desired for catalysts, and extending successes in polycarbonate synthesis to polyesters from olefins and CO2 is an attractive goal. Understanding the phase behavior of CO2 systems under desired conditions and the kinetics and thermodynamics of relevant chemical reactions are crucial for enhancing the production of chemicals and fuels from CO2.

2. Catalysts for polyurethanes and polyesters formation from CO2 as a monomer are needed, requiring improvements in catalyst selectivity and efficiency. The ability to predict phase behavior in CO2 systems can significantly advance the field. Catalysts for epoxide and olefin + CO2 copolymerization must be less sensitive to water and oxygen, more active, and more stereoselective.

3. Selective reactions with CO2 or protons, factors controlling formate versus CO production, and their relation to final methanol or methane production need better understanding. The operating temperature windows for diesel engines vary based on the type, with light-duty engines having a lower limit as low as 150°C. There are insufficient data on the effectiveness of alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts, and the state of noble-metal surfaces and reaction mechanisms are not known.

1. CO或HCOO-反应的周转频率通常在1到10 h-1之间，周转数一般在100左右或更少。催化剂的更高周转频率是所需的，并且将聚碳酸酯合成的成功扩展到从烯烃和CO2合成聚酯是一个有吸引力的目标。理解CO2系统在所需条件下的相行为以及相关化学反应的动力学和热力学对于增强CO2来源的化学品和燃料的生产至关重要。

2. 需要催化剂用于以CO2作为单体形成聚氨酯和聚酯，要求改进催化剂的选择性和效率。预测CO2系统相行为的能力可以显著促进该领域的发展。对于环氧树脂和烯烃+CO2共聚物化催化剂，需要对水和氧气的敏感性较低、活性更高、立体选择性更好的催化剂。

3. 需要更好地理解与CO2或质子的选定反应、控制形成酸盐还是CO的因素及其与最终甲醇或甲烷生产的关系。柴油发动机的操作温度窗口根据类型而变化，轻型柴油发动机的下限可能低至150°C。关于铝基NOx减少催化剂的有效性的数据不足，而且不知道贵金属表面的状态和反应机制。
