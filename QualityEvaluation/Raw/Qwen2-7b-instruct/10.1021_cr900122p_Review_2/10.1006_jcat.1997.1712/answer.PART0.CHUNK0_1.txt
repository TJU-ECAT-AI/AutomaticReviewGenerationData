[1] "The distribution and the chemical states of Mo in a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5, before and after calcination at different temperatures, were investigated using XPS, ISS, and FT-IR techniques, and correlated with kinetic results for the conversion of methane to benzene."
[2] "Impregnated molybdenum in the calcined catalyst is initially present as MoO3, primarily in the form of small crystallites on the external surface of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
[3] "After treatment at 400C, relatively little Mo is present in the channels of ZSM-5, and the acidity of the zeolite is not modified."
[4] "After calcination at 500C in O2, the Mo becomes highly dispersed on the external surface of the zeolite, and part of it diffuses into the channels, causing a decrease in acidity."

[9] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."

1. The distribution and chemical states of molybdenum in a 2 wt% molybdenum/zirconium-silica (Mo/ZSM-5) catalyst were studied using XPS, ISS, and FT-IR techniques, and linked to kinetic results for methane conversion to benzene.

2. Molybdenum oxide impregnated in the calcined catalyst is initially found in the form of small crystallites on the external surface of the zeolite.

3. At 400°C, little molybdenum is present in the channels of the zeolite, and the acidity of the zeolite remains unchanged.

4. After calcination at 500°C in oxygen, molybdenum disperses more evenly on the external surface of the zeolite and partly diffuses into the channels, leading to a decrease in acidity.

5. Although calcination at 700°C for 0.5 hours improves the dispersion of molybdenum on the external surface and possibly inside the zeolite channels, monolayer coverage of molybdenum on the external surface does not occur.

6. The presence of moisture during calcination significantly promotes diffusion of molybdenum into the channels, especially at higher temperatures.

7. Exposing a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to methane or a methane/hydrogen mixture at 700°C leads to the reduction of molybdenum ions to molybdenum carbide (Mo2C), rather than metallic molybdenum.

8. Approximately 60 to 80% of molybdenum species exist in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches a steady state, while part of the molybdenum (20-30%) remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in methane or methane/hydrogen at 700°C for many hours.

9. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, suggesting that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane.

1. 对于2 wt%钼/沸石-5（Mo/ZSM-5）催化剂，通过XPS、ISS和FT-IR技术研究了钼的分布和化学状态，并与甲烷转化为苯的热力学结果相关联。

2. 在煅烧催化剂中，钼氧化物最初以小晶粒形式存在于沸石的外部表面。

3. 在400°C下，沸石通道中几乎没有钼，且沸石的酸性保持不变。

4. 在500°C的氧气中煅烧后，钼在沸石的外部表面更均匀地分散，并部分扩散到通道中，导致酸性的降低。

5. 尽管在700°C下煅烧0.5小时可以改善外部表面和可能内部通道中的钼的分散，但外部表面的钼没有形成单层覆盖。

6. 煅烧过程中水分的存在显著促进了钼向通道的扩散，特别是在较高温度下。

7. 将2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂暴露于700°C的甲烷或甲烷/氢气混合物中导致钼离子还原为钼化碳（Mo2C），而不是金属钼。

8. 大约60到80%的钼物种在反应达到稳定状态后以Mo2C的形式存在，而部分钼（20-30%）仍以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在，并且即使在700°C下用甲烷或甲烷/氢气处理许多小时也不会被还原。

9. Mo2C的形成与苯生产启动时间相匹配，表明钼化碳钼物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。
