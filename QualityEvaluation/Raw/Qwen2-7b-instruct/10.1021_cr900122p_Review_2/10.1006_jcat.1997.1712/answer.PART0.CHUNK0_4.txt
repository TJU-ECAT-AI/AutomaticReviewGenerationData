[1] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C,rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the cata- lyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
[2] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene,indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
[3] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst,without coke deposition,does not completely eliminate the induction period,it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and,thus,that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

1. Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C leads to the reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, with about 60-80% of Mo species existing in this form after reaching steady state. Part of the Mo ions, about 20-30%, remain as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and are not reduced even when treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700°C for extended periods.
2. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the start of the activation period for benzene production, suggesting that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.
3. The incomplete elimination of the induction period after preformation of Mo2C without coke deposition indicates that the clean surface of Mo2C might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation. Hence, a coke-modified Mo2C surface is considered the actual active species for ethylene formation as the reaction intermediate.

1. 将2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 催化剂暴露于700°C的CH4或CH4/H2中会导致Mo离子还原为Mo2C，稳定状态下约有60-80%的Mo物种以这种形式存在。大约20-30%的Mo离子以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在，并且即使在700°C下处理CH4或CH4/H2长达数小时也不会被还原。
2. Mo2C的形成与苯生成的初始激活期时间相匹配，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。
3. 在没有焦炭沉积的情况下预先形成Mo2C后，消除诱导期不完全的情况表明，Mo2C的清洁表面可能对于更高碳氢化合物的形成过于活跃。因此，认为含有焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面是形成乙烯作为反应中间体的真正活性物种。
