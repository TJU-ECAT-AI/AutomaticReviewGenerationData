[1] "The distribution and the chemical states of Mo in a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5, before and after calcination at different temperatures, were investigated using XPS, ISS, and FT-IR techniques, and correlated with kinetic results for the conversion of methane to benzene."
[2] "The amount of Mo ions within the channels depends on the temperature, time, and atmosphere of calcination."
[3] "After calcination at 500C in O2, the Mo becomes highly dispersed on the external surface of the zeolite, and part of it diffuses into the channels, causing a decrease in acidity."
[4] "About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
[5] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
[6] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

1. The distribution and chemical states of molybdenum (Mo) in a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst were studied using XPS, ISS, and FT-IR techniques. The results were correlated with kinetic results for methane to benzene conversion.

2. The amount of Mo ions within the channels of the zeolite depends on the temperature, time, and atmosphere of calcination.

3. After calcination at 500°C in oxygen, Mo becomes highly dispersed on the external surface of the zeolite and diffuses into the channels, causing a decrease in acidity.

4. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state. Some Mo (20-30%) remains as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced, even when treated at 700°C in CH4 or CH4/H2 for extended periods.

5. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the initial activation period for benzene production, suggesting that carbidic Mo species are the active centers for methane activation.

6. The induction period observed with a calcined catalyst is attributed to the formation of Mo2C. The clean Mo2C surface might be too reactive for higher hydrocarbon formation, leading to a coke-modified Mo2C surface as the actual active species in the formation of ethylene.

1. 对于2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂，通过XPS、ISS和FT-IR技术研究了钼的分布和化学状态，并将其与甲烷转化为苯的热力学结果相关联。

2. 钼离子在沸石中的含量取决于煅烧温度、时间和气氛。

3. 在500°C氧气中煅烧后，钼在沸石外部表面高度分散，并扩散到通道中，导致酸性的降低。

4. 当反应达到稳态时，大约60%至80%的钼物种以Mo2C的形式存在。部分钼（20%-30%）以Mo4+和Mo5+形式存在，即使在700°C的CH4或CH4/H2下处理数小时也不会被还原。

5. Mo2C的形成与苯生成的初始激活期一致，表明钼碳化物物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。

6. 研究发现，煅烧催化剂产生的诱导期与钼碳化物的形成有关。清洁的钼碳化物表面可能对更高碳氢化合物的形成过于活跃，导致焦炭修饰的钼碳化物表面作为形成乙烯的活性物种。
