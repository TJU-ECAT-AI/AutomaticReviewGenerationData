[1] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C,rather than to metallic Mo."
[2] "About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."
[3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene,indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."
[4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst,without coke deposition,does not completely eliminate the induction period,it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and,thus,that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

1. When a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst is exposed to CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C, the molybdenum ions are reduced to Mo2C instead of metallic Mo.
2. Approximately 60 to 80% of the molybdenum species exist as Mo2C when the reaction reaches a steady state, whereas the rest (20-30%) remain as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and are not reduced, even after prolonged treatment in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C.
3. The formation of Mo2C aligns well with the onset of the initial activation phase for the production of benzene, suggesting that carbidic molybdenum species play a crucial role in activating methane.
4. The preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst without the formation of coke does not fully eliminate the induction period. This implies that the clean surface of Mo2C might be overly reactive, incapable of forming higher hydrocarbons, and that a coke-modified Mo2C surface might be the actual active species involved in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate.

1. 当2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂暴露于700°C的CH4或CH4/H2时，钼离子会被还原为Mo2C，而不是金属Mo。
2. 大约在反应达到稳态后，60到80%的钼物种以Mo2C的形式存在，而剩余的（20-30%）则以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在，并且即使在CH4或CH4/H2中进行长时间处理至700°C也不被还原。
3. Mo2C的形成与苯生产初期激活阶段的时间相吻合，表明碳化钼物种在甲烷活化过程中起关键作用。
4. 在催化剂上预先形成Mo2C而不形成焦炭并不能完全消除诱导期。这意味着清洁的Mo2C表面可能过于活跃，无法形成更高碳数的化合物，而带焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面可能是形成乙烯作为反应中间体的实际活性物种。
