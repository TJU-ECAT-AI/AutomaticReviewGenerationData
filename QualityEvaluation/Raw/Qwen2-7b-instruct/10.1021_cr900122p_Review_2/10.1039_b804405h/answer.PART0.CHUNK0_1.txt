[1] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[2] "Formic acid was the main product along with traces of acetic acid, methanol, acetone and MeCN oxidation products."
[3] "To distinguish between the oxidation of CH4 and the possible oxidation of CH3CN, the reaction was performed in CD3CN."
[4] "GCMS analysis of formic acid obtained in 6 mM concentration showed 68% of HCOOH and 32% of DCOOH, thus indicating parallel oxidation of CH4 and CD3CN in 2 : 1 ratio."
[5] "Kinetic analysis shows that this ratio is not compatible with a free radical mechanism of oxidation."
[6] "The catalytic oxidation of CH4 occurred with a high turnover number of 40.8."
[7] "However, the situation is complicated by the oxidation of the organic solvent which is difficult to avoid in the presence of active species strong enough to oxidize CH4."
[8] "With this aim, m-nitrido complex was supported onto silica."
[9] "Heterogeneous oxidations of CH4 were performed in pure H2O."
[10] "The CH4 oxidation was unambiguously evidenced using labelled 13CH4 in D2O at 60 °C."
[11] "When the mixture of 53% of CH4 and 47% of 13CH4 was used for oxidation, the 13C NMR spectrum of the final reaction mixture showed two signals at 81.6 and 165.5 ppm attributed to hydrated formaldehyde 13CH2(OH)2 and H13COOH, respectively."
[12] "Neither 13CH3OH (49 ppm) nor 13CO2 (125 ppm) signals were found in this spectrum."
[13] "When the reaction was performed in 97% H218O, CH3OH didn't contain 18O, indicating that its oxygen originated from H216O2."
[14] "The oxidation of CH4 was tested at different temperatures."
[15] "Remarkably, the oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 °C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[16] "At 40–50 °C HCOOH and CH2O were obtained in 2:1 ratio (runs 2 and 3)."
[17] "At higher temperature the amount of CH2O diminished in favour of HCOOH."
[18] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80 °C, providing 2632 turnovers."
[19] "Based on the results obtained by UVVis, EPR, ESI-MS techniques and in labelling experiments, we propose a tentative mechanism of the oxidation of CH4 (Fig. 4)."
[20] "In the first step, (FePctBu4)2N coordinates H2O2 to form hydroperoxo complex FeIVNFeIIIOOH which is probably in equilibrium with the deprotonated form FeIVNFeIIIOO."
[21] "(FePctBu4)2N oxo complex could be formed from FeIVNFeIIIOOH via heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond."
[22] "Recent DFT calculations showed that water favoured the formation of non-heme HOFeV Q O species via water-assisted OOH bond cleavage."
[23] "Otherwise, a homolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH would form FeIVNFeIV Q O with formation of OH radical."
[24] "High concentrations of HCOOH obtained in CH4 oxidations and the relative reactivity of CH4 and MeCN found in homogeneous conditions are also not compatible with free radical chemistry."
[25] "The heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH complex and the formation of putative very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeV Q O species should be favoured in the presence of acid by the protonation of peroxide oxygen."
[26] "Indeed, a significant improvement of the catalytic activity was observed in the presence of 0.1 M H2SO4."
[27] "The TONHCOOH was increased by more than a factor of 3 to attain 72.8."
[28] "After completion of the first reaction, a new portion of H2O2 was added directly to the reaction mixture."
[29] "Remarkably, the catalytic system retained practically the same catalytic activity in the second cycle (Table 1, run 7), indicating a high stability of the catalyst and even a possibility of recycling."
[30] "The catalyst exhibits a very high performance: more than 150 moles CH4 per mole of catalyst were oxidized to useful products."
[31] "This activity is far higher than that of most published systems operating via CH4 activation and approaches that of the most efficient so far, Perianas system based on Pt(II) bipyrimidine complex in oleum at 220 °C."
[32] "Total TON = 437 and 3050% product yields on H2O2 were attained using (FePctBu4)2N."
[33] "This catalytic system shows several attractive features: the clean oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (H2O), and the fact that solid catalyst can easily be separated by filtration."
[34] "In contrast to the much more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes, phthalocyanines can be accessible in bulk quantities."
[35] "It should be noted that the FeNFe unit of (FePctBu4)2N is essential for the catalytic activity."
[36] "Terminal nitrido ligand stabilizes FeV and even FeVI states in mononuclear cyclam complexes."
[37] "One can suggest that m-nitrido ligand in a diiron complex could also stabilize ultra high valent Fe states."
[38] "Mononuclear FePctBu4 and its diiron m-oxo (FeOFe) and m-carbido (Fe Q C Q Fe) complexes showed no oxidation of CH4."
[39] "m-Nitrido diiron complex and soluble MMO share a similar structural feature, binuclear iron sites."
[40] "However, the coordination spheres of these sites are different."
[41] "In MMO, the diiron centre contains four glutamate (carboxyl ligand) and two histidine (N-ligand) residues and two iron ions are connected via the carboxylate of glutamate and water or hydroxide fragments."
[42] "Iron ions in m-nitrido dimer are coordinated with four nitrogen atoms of planar exogenous phthalocyanine ligands which are nevertheless structurally related to endogenous porphyrin."
[43] "Further research is necessary to provide deeper insights into this novel fascinating chemistry."
