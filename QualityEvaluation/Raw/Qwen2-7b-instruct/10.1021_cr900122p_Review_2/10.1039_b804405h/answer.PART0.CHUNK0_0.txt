[1] "A stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine activates H2O2 to oxidize CH4 in water at 2560 1C to methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid as evidenced using 13C and 18O labelling."
[2] "Our studies on metallophthalocyanines (MPc) as catalysts for clean oxidation processes13 showed that FePc supported in m-oxo dimeric form (FeOFe fragment) exhibited better catalytic properties than monomer FePc."
[3] "After addition of H2O2 at 25 1C we detected a strong signal at g = 4.25 and a feature at g = 8.16 along with an enlarged signal at g = 2.07 and a small signal at g = 1.99 of the (FePctBu4)2N left."
[4] "The best solution to avoid uncertainties due to solvent oxidation is to use water, an inert, green and biologically relevant solvent."
[5] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[6] "The TONHCOOH was increased by more than a factor of 3 to attain 72.8."
[7] "This catalytic system shows several attractive features: the clean oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (H2O), and the fact that solid catalyst can easily be separated by filtration."
[8] "In contrast with organometallic CH4 activation, MMO proceeds via a different mechanism, by creating a very strong oxidizing diiron species able to attack a CH bond in CH4."
[9] "The heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH complex and the formation of putative very strong oxidizing FeIVNFeVQO species should be favoured in the presence of acid by the protonation of peroxide oxygen."
