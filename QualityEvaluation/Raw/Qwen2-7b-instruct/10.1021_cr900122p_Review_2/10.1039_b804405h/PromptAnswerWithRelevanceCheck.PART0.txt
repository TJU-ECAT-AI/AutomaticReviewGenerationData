The document discusses a novel catalyst, an N-bridged diiron phthalocyanine complex, which activates hydrogen peroxide to oxidize methane in aqueous solution at 25°C. The main products of this reaction are methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. The study highlights the importance of using water as the solvent because it avoids uncertainties associated with solvent oxidation. Even at lower temperatures, specifically 25°C, the system efficiently oxidizes methane to formic acid, achieving a turnover number (TON) of 13. By adding sulfuric acid, the TON for formic acid increased significantly to 72.8. The catalyst system demonstrates high efficiency, with total TON reaching 437 and product yields on hydrogen peroxide at 3050%. The system offers several advantages, including the use of a clean oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and a reaction medium (water), and the ease of separating the solid catalyst through filtration. Phthalocyanines, in particular, are noted to be more accessible in bulk quantities compared to more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes.

The literature describes the use of a stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine as a catalyst for the oxidation of methane in water at 2560 °C. This process generates methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid, as confirmed through 13C and 18O labeling. The diiron structure remains stable, as indicated by positive ESI-MS results. The catalyst's strong oxidizing properties led to the exploration of methane oxidation. To enhance the catalyst's stability, it was immobilized on silica. The oxidation of methane was effective at 25°C, yielding formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13. As temperature increased to 40-50°C, a 2:1 ratio of formic acid to hydrated formaldehyde was produced. The catalyst maintained consistent activity between 40 and 80°C, achieving 2632 turnovers. It demonstrated remarkable performance, oxidizing over 150 moles of methane per mole of catalyst. The initial reaction step involves the coordination of hydrogen peroxide to form a hydroperoxy complex. The catalyst's stability was further proven by its retention of activity in subsequent cycles, suggesting a possibility for recycling.

文献描述了一种稳定的l-亚硝基二铁酞菁作为水中的甲烷氧化催化剂，在2560°C下，该过程产生甲醇、甲醛和乙酸。通过13C和18O标记验证了这一结果。通过正离子电喷雾质谱（ESI-MS）结果表明，二铁结构保持稳定。由于其强氧化性质，探索了甲烷的氧化。为了提高催化剂的稳定性，它被固定在二氧化硅上。在25°C下，甲烷的氧化是有效的，产生了乙酸，其转盘数（TON）为13。随着温度升高到40-50°C，形成了形式酸与水化甲醛的2:1比率。在40至80°C之间，催化剂保持了相同的活性，实现了2632次循环。它显示了非凡的表现，每摩尔催化剂氧化超过150摩尔的甲烷。初始反应步骤涉及过氧化氢的配位形成过氧基复合物。催化剂的稳定性进一步证明了在后续周期中保留了活性，暗示了回收的可能性。
