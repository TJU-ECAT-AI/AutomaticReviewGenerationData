[1] "A stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine activates H2O2 to oxidize CH4 in water at 2560 1C to methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid as evidenced using 13C and 18O labelling."
[2] "The diiron structure was kept intact as evidenced by positive electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS)."
[3] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[4] "With this aim, m-nitrido complex was supported onto silica."
[5] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 1C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[6] "At 4050 1C HCOOH and CH2O were obtained in B2 : 1 ratio (runs 2 and 3)."
[7] "The activity of the catalyst was similar between 40 and 80 1C, providing 2632 turnovers."
[8] "The catalyst exhibits a very high performance: more than 150 moles CH4 per mole of catalyst were oxidized to useful products."
[9] "In the first step, (FePctBu4)2N coordinates H2O2 to form hydroperoxo complex FeIVNFeIIIOOH which is probably in equilibrium with the deprotonated form FeIVNFeIIIOO."
[10] "After completion of the first reaction, a new portion of H2O2 was added directly to the reaction mixture. Remarkably, the catalytic system retained practically the same catalytic activity in the second cycle (Table 1,run 7), indicating a high stability of the catalyst and even a possibility of recycling."

The literature describes the use of a stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine as a catalyst for the oxidation of methane in water at 2560 °C. This process generates methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid, as confirmed through 13C and 18O labeling. The diiron structure remains stable, as indicated by positive ESI-MS results. The catalyst's strong oxidizing properties led to the exploration of methane oxidation. To enhance the catalyst's stability, it was immobilized on silica. The oxidation of methane was effective at 25°C, yielding formic acid with a turnover number (TON) of 13. As temperature increased to 40-50°C, a 2:1 ratio of formic acid to hydrated formaldehyde was produced. The catalyst maintained consistent activity between 40 and 80°C, achieving 2632 turnovers. It demonstrated remarkable performance, oxidizing over 150 moles of methane per mole of catalyst. The initial reaction step involves the coordination of hydrogen peroxide to form a hydroperoxy complex. The catalyst's stability was further proven by its retention of activity in subsequent cycles, suggesting a possibility for recycling.

文献描述了一种稳定的l-亚硝基二铁酞菁作为水中的甲烷氧化催化剂，在2560°C下，该过程产生甲醇、甲醛和乙酸。通过13C和18O标记验证了这一结果。通过正离子电喷雾质谱（ESI-MS）结果表明，二铁结构保持稳定。由于其强氧化性质，探索了甲烷的氧化。为了提高催化剂的稳定性，它被固定在二氧化硅上。在25°C下，甲烷的氧化是有效的，产生了乙酸，其转盘数（TON）为13。随着温度升高到40-50°C，形成了形式酸与水化甲醛的2:1比率。在40至80°C之间，催化剂保持了相同的活性，实现了2632次循环。它显示了非凡的表现，每摩尔催化剂氧化超过150摩尔的甲烷。初始反应步骤涉及过氧化氢的配位形成过氧基复合物。催化剂的稳定性进一步证明了在后续周期中保留了活性，暗示了回收的可能性。
