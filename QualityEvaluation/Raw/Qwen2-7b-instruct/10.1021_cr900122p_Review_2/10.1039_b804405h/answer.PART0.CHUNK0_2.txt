[1] "The first catalytic tests showed very strong oxidizing properties of the (FePctBu4)2NH2O2 system and prompted us to try the oxidation of CH4."
[2] "Formic acid was the main product along with traces of acetic acid, methanol, acetone and MeCN oxidation products."
[3] "The best solution to avoid uncertainties due to solvent oxidation is to use water, an inert, green and biologically relevant solvent."
[4] "The oxidation of CH4 was still efficient even at 25 °C, providing HCOOH with TON = 13 (Table 1, run 1)."
[5] "The TONHCOOH was increased by more than a factor of 3 to attain 72.8."
[6] "Total TON = 437 and 3050% product yields on H2O2 were attained using (FePctBu4)2N."
[7] "This catalytic system shows several attractive features: the clean oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (H2O), and the fact that solid catalyst can easily be separated by filtration."
[8] "In contrast to the much more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes, phthalocyanines can be accessible in bulk quantities."

The document discusses a novel catalyst, an N-bridged diiron phthalocyanine complex, which activates hydrogen peroxide to oxidize methane in aqueous solution at 25°C. The main products of this reaction are methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. The study highlights the importance of using water as the solvent because it avoids uncertainties associated with solvent oxidation. Even at lower temperatures, specifically 25°C, the system efficiently oxidizes methane to formic acid, achieving a turnover number (TON) of 13. By adding sulfuric acid, the TON for formic acid increased significantly to 72.8. The catalyst system demonstrates high efficiency, with total TON reaching 437 and product yields on hydrogen peroxide at 3050%. The system offers several advantages, including the use of a clean oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and a reaction medium (water), and the ease of separating the solid catalyst through filtration. Phthalocyanines, in particular, are noted to be more accessible in bulk quantities compared to more expensive porphyrin and non-heme complexes.

文档讨论了一种新型催化剂，即N桥接二铁酞菁复合物，它能够激活过氧化氢在水溶液中于25°C氧化甲烷。该反应的主要产物为甲醛、甲醇、乙酸以及甲腈氧化产物。研究强调使用水作为溶剂的重要性，以避免与溶剂氧化相关的不确定性。即使在较低温度下，特别是25°C时，系统也能高效地将甲烷氧化为乙酸，得到的周转数（TON）为13。通过添加硫酸，乙酸的TON显著增加至72.8。该催化剂系统表现出高效率，总周转数达到437，氢过氧化物的产率为3050%。该系统具有几个优势，包括使用清洁的氧化剂（过氧化氢）和反应介质（水），以及通过过滤轻松分离固体催化剂的能力。值得注意的是，与更昂贵的卟啉和非血红素复合物相比，酞菁可以大批量获取。
