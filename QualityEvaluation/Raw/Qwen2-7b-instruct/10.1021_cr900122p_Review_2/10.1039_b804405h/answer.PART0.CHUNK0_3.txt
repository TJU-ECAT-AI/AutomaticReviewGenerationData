1. A stable l-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine activates H2O2 to oxidize CH4 in water at 2560 1C to methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid through 13C and 18O labelling.
2. The UVVis and EPR spectra of (FePctBu4)2N changed upon the addition of H2O2.
3. After adding H2O2 at 25 1C, a strong signal at g = 4.25 and a feature at g = 8.16 were observed along with expanded signals at g = 2.07 and g = 1.99 for (FePctBu4)2N.
4. Formic acid was the primary product resulting from the oxidation of CH4, accompanied by minor amounts of other compounds.
5. Water was identified as the optimal solvent for minimizing uncertainties due to solvent oxidation in the reaction.
6. The m-nitrido complex was supported onto silica to facilitate heterogeneous oxidations.
7. The oxidation of CH4 was confirmed using 13CH4 in D2O at 60 1C.
8. The oxidation of CH4 remained effective even at 25 1C, yielding HCOOH with a turnover number of 13.
9. Heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond in FeIVNFeIIIOOH and formation of FeIVNFeV Q O species, potentially very strong oxidants, is favored by protonation of peroxide oxygen in the presence of acid.
10. Phthalocyanines are considered advantageous over more expensive porphyrins and non-heme complexes due to their accessibility in bulk quantities.
