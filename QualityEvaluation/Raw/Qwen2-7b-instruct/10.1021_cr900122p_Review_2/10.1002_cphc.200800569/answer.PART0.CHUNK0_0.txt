[1] "The role of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhance- ment of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and nu- merous publications."
[2] "Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recom- binative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2)."
[3] "The activation energy of the exchange is 107 108 kJmol1 for both pro- pane[28,35] and n-butane.[42]"
[4] "While apparent activation energies are similar or notably lower for Zn- modified zeolites in comparison to acid-form zeolites, the rate of the exchange is essentially higher for Zn-modified zeolites within the same temperature range."
[5] "The acceleration of H/D exchange, coupled with the de- creased activation energy for Zn- modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."
[6] "The mechanism also rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations through their ability to activate alkane CH bonds. The presence of metals like Ga or Zn acts as catalysts for the recombinative desorption of H atoms from cleaved CH bonds, facilitating the formation of olefins. Metal-exchanged zeolites, especially those modified with Zn, show a significant promotion effect on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes. This is evidenced by a decrease in activation energy and an increase in reaction rate, which indicates easier and more reversible breaking and forming of CH bonds with the involvement of Zn species. The mechanism explains the regioselective involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the hydrogen exchange process.

These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to efficiently convert light alkanes into aromatics with high selectivity, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. The enhanced activation and transformation capabilities of these catalysts, especially when modified with Zn, offer a promising avenue for improving the economics and environmental impact of alkane processing technologies.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，通过激活烷烃CH键影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。镓或锌的存在作为从断裂CH键中重组脱氢原子的催化剂，促进了烯烃的形成。改性沸石，尤其是改性锌的沸石，显示出对小烷烃CH键激活的显著促进效果。这通过降低活化能和提高反应速率得到证明，这表明CH键更容易且可逆地断裂和形成，其中包含锌物种。该机制解释了仅C3和n-C4烷烃的甲基组在氢交换过程中的选择性参与。

这些催化剂在工业上具有重要意义，因为它们能够高效地将轻质烷烃转化为芳烃，这对于石油化学行业至关重要。这些催化剂的增强激活和转化能力，特别是当用锌改性时，为改进烷烃处理技术的经济性和环境影响提供了有希望的途径。
