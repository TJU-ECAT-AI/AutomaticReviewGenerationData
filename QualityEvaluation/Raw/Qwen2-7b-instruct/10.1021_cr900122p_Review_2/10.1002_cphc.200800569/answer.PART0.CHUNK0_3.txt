[1] "Modification of zeolites with Zn provides regioselectivity of the H/D hydrogen exchange and gives rise to an increase in the rate and a decrease in the activation energy for H/D exchange."
[2] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involve- ment in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."
[3] "The accelerating effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes, coupled with the decreased activation energy for Zn-modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."

The presence of Zn in modified zeolites significantly enhances the activation of C1n-C4 alkane CH bonds through Brnsted acid sites. This is achieved by the formation of Zn alkyl species from the alkane, which precedes its interaction with Brnsted acid sites. These Zn alkyl species enable a more efficient and reversible activation process, resulting in an increase in the rate of hydrogen exchange and a decrease in activation energy. The regioselectivity of the hydrogen exchange for propane and n-butane further indicates the synergistic effect of Zn species and Brnsted sites in alkane activation.

在改性沸石中加入Zn显著增强了通过Brnsted酸位激活C1n-C4烷烃CH键的能力。这是通过从烷烃形成Zn烷基物种来实现的，这随后与Brnsted酸位发生相互作用。这些Zn烷基物种使激活过程更加高效和可逆，导致氢交换速率增加和活化能降低。丙烷和n-丁烷的氢交换的选择性进一步表明了Zn物种和Brnsted位点在烷烃激活中的协同作用。
