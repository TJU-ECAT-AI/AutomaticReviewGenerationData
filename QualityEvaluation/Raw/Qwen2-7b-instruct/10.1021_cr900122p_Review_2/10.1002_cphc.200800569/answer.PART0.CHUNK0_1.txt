[1] "On the one hand, there is agreement on the bifunctional nature of these catalysts, where the metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alka- nes, while the Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins."
[2] "Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2)."
[3] "A simple reaction of hydrogen exchange between the acid sites of solid catalysts and alkane molecules, which usually precedes the chemical transformation of alkanes by the catalysts, is often used to characterize the activation of alkanes and the acidity of the catalysts."
[4] "The activation of alkane CH bonds by acidic zeolites is performed by protonation by the zeolites Brnsted acid site."
[5] "Regioselectivity of the exchange is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA for propane and n-butane."
[6] "The promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D exchange for all C1n-C4 alkanes is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations through various ways. These catalysts enable the dehydrogenation of alkanes and the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The metal species are primarily responsible for dehydrogenation, while Brnsted acid sites facilitate the transformation of olefins. Hydrogen exchange between acid sites and alkane molecules characterizes the activation of alkanes and the acidity of the catalysts. The activation of alkane CH bonds occurs via protonation by the zeolite's Brnsted acid site. The presence of Zn modifies the activation process, leading to regioselectivity in the H/D exchange for propane and n-butane. The promoting effect of Zn is achieved through the formation of Zn alkyl species, which precedes interaction with Brnsted acid sites.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products, such as aromatics, through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The unique properties of metal-exchanged zeolites, like Zn-modified zeolites, offer enhanced selectivity and activity in alkane transformations, making them attractive for industrial applications in petrochemical processes.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，通过多种方式影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。这些催化剂能够促进烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的聚合与环化。金属物种主要负责脱氢作用，而布伦斯特酸位则参与烯烃的聚合与环化。酸位与烷烃分子之间的氢交换常用于表征烷烃的活化和催化剂的酸性。烷烃CH键的活化过程通过沸石的布伦斯特酸位进行质子化实现。锌的存在改变了激活过程，导致丙烷和正丁烷的H/D交换具有区域选择性。锌的促进效果通过形成锌烷基物种实现，该物种在进一步与布伦斯特酸位交互之前，首先从烷烃形成。

这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为有价值的产物，如芳香族化合物，通过氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。金属交换沸石的独特性质，如锌改性的沸石，为烷烃转化提供了增强的选择性和活性，使其成为石油化工过程的吸引人应用点。
