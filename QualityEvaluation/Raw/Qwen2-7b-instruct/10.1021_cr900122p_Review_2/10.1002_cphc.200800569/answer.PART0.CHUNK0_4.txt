[1] "Modification of the zeolite with Zn provides regioselectivity of the H/D hydrogen exchange and gives rise to an increase in the rate and a decrease in the activation energy for H/D exchange."
[2] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."
[3] "The accelerating effect of Zn on the H/D exchange, coupled with the decreased activation energy for Zn-modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."
[4] "The synergy of the acid and the Zn-sites (as ZnO clusters) for the effective aromatization of small alkanes by Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn alkyl species formed on Zn sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The presence of metals like zinc (Zn) in zeolites enhances the activation of CH bonds in small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites through the formation of Zn alkyl species. These species facilitate the H/D exchange reaction and dehydrogenation of alkanes, leading to increased reaction rates and reduced activation energies. This synergy between the acid sites and Zn sites in the catalysts enables the effective aromatization of small alkanes. Industrial significance arises from the ability to convert light alkanes into aromatics with high selectivity, which is crucial for various chemical processes.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，对烷烃转换机制和效率产生了显著影响。锌（Zn）在沸石中的存在通过形成Zn烷基物种增强了沸石Brnsted位点对小烷烃中CH键的活化。这些物种促进了H/D交换反应和烷烃的脱氢，导致反应速率增加和活化能降低。催化剂中的酸位点与Zn位点之间的协同作用使小烷烃的有效芳构化成为可能。工业上的重要性体现在能够以高选择性地将轻烷烃转化为芳香烃，这对于各种化学过程至关重要。
