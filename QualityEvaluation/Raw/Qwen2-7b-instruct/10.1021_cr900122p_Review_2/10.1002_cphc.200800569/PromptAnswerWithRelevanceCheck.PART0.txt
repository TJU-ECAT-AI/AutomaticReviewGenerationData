[1] "The role of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhance- ment of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and nu- merous publications."
[2] "Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recom- binative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2)."
[3] "The activation energy of the exchange is 107 108 kJmol1 for both pro- pane[28,35] and n-butane.[42]"
[4] "While apparent activation energies are similar or notably lower for Zn- modified zeolites in comparison to acid-form zeolites, the rate of the exchange is essentially higher for Zn-modified zeolites within the same temperature range."
[5] "The acceleration of H/D exchange, coupled with the de- creased activation energy for Zn- modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."
[6] "The mechanism also rationalizes the involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations through their ability to activate alkane CH bonds. The presence of metals like Ga or Zn acts as catalysts for the recombinative desorption of H atoms from cleaved CH bonds, facilitating the formation of olefins. Metal-exchanged zeolites, especially those modified with Zn, show a significant promotion effect on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes. This is evidenced by a decrease in activation energy and an increase in reaction rate, which indicates easier and more reversible breaking and forming of CH bonds with the involvement of Zn species. The mechanism explains the regioselective involvement of only the methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the hydrogen exchange process.

These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to efficiently convert light alkanes into aromatics with high selectivity, which is crucial for the petrochemical industry. The enhanced activation and transformation capabilities of these catalysts, especially when modified with Zn, offer a promising avenue for improving the economics and environmental impact of alkane processing technologies.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations through various ways. These catalysts enable the dehydrogenation of alkanes and the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins. The metal species are primarily responsible for dehydrogenation, while Brnsted acid sites facilitate the transformation of olefins. Hydrogen exchange between acid sites and alkane molecules characterizes the activation of alkanes and the acidity of the catalysts. The activation of alkane CH bonds occurs via protonation by the zeolite's Brnsted acid site. The presence of Zn modifies the activation process, leading to regioselectivity in the H/D exchange for propane and n-butane. The promoting effect of Zn is achieved through the formation of Zn alkyl species, which precedes interaction with Brnsted acid sites.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable products, such as aromatics, through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The unique properties of metal-exchanged zeolites, like Zn-modified zeolites, offer enhanced selectivity and activity in alkane transformations, making them attractive for industrial applications in petrochemical processes.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，通过多种方式影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。这些催化剂能够促进烷烃的脱氢和烯烃的聚合与环化。金属物种主要负责脱氢作用，而布伦斯特酸位则参与烯烃的聚合与环化。酸位与烷烃分子之间的氢交换常用于表征烷烃的活化和催化剂的酸性。烷烃CH键的活化过程通过沸石的布伦斯特酸位进行质子化实现。锌的存在改变了激活过程，导致丙烷和正丁烷的H/D交换具有区域选择性。锌的促进效果通过形成锌烷基物种实现，该物种在进一步与布伦斯特酸位交互之前，首先从烷烃形成。

2559 activation and the hydrogen exchange reaction allows one to use H/D exchange as a test reaction for alkane activation.
Hydrogen exchange between small alkanes and Brnsted acid sites occurs within the temperature range of 523723 K on acid-form zeolites.[1935,40] The apparent activation energies are in the range of 107147 kJmol1. Methane and ethane ex- change with involvement of pentacoordinated carbonium ions as transition states on acidic zeolites. Propane can alternatively be exchanged with the intermediate formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. In this case, the regioselectivity of the ex- change into the methyl groups is detected.[34,41] Figures 1A and C demonstrate the involvement of both the methyl and the methylene groups of [D8]propane and [D10]n- butane in the exchange with acidic SiOHAl groups on zeolite H-ZSM-5. Indeed, the intensities of signals at 1.0 (CH3) and
1.5 ppm (CH2) of a 1H MAS NMR spectrum increase with the re-
action time. This corresponds to a transfer of a protium from the acidic SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the methyl and meth- ylene groups of the perdeuterated alkanes. It has been estab- lished that exchange with both the methyl and the methylene groups occur, with the inter- mediate formation of pentacoor- dinated carbonium ions as tran- sition states.
The activation energy of the exchange is 107 108 kJmol1 for both pro- pane[28,35] and n-butane.[42] When zeolites are modified with Zn, the picture of hydrogen exchange changes. Regioselec- tivity of the exchange is ob- served on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/
H-BEA
for propane and n- butane. The methyl groups of these alkanes are preferentially involved in the exchange. This corresponds to the growth in the intensity of the only methyl peak (at 1.0 ppm) with the reac- tion time in 1H MAS NMR spectra (Figure 1B,D,E,F). Kinetics param- eters of the exchange also change with regard to those on pure acid-form zeolites. While apparent activation energies are similar or notably lower for Zn- modified zeolites in comparison to acid-form zeolites, the rate of the exchange is essentially higher for Zn-modified zeolites within the same temperature range. The temperature thres- hold of the reaction onset de- creases by 50 K (see Figure 2 and Table 1).
Similar tendencies in the change of kinetic parameters of the exchange upon modifica- tion of BEA and ZSM-5 with Zn are also observed for methane and ethane. Figure 3 shows Arrhenius plots for the H/D ex- change reaction of methane and ethane on H-BEA, H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA.
It can be seen that the exchange is more than two orders of magnitude faster on Zn/H-BEA than that on a purely acidic form of the zeolites. The activation energies of the exchange for methane on
H-BEA
(138 kJmol1) and
H-ZSM-5
(118 kJmol1) are similar to those earlier identified for meth- ane[24] and ethane[25] on acid-form zeolites. The kinetics para- meters for H-BEA and H-ZSM-5 correspond to the mechanism of exchange with synchronous transfer of protons from the zeolite SiOHAl group to the alkane molecule and the symmet- rical return of one of the hydrogen atoms from the alkane to the oxygen atom of the zeolite framework via a pentacoordi- nated carbon atom in a transition state.[19] The rate of H/D exchange increases by more than two orders of magnitude for methane and ethane when the zeolite is modified with Zn. The apparent activation energies decrease to 8688 kJmol1. At the same time, the reaction onset is de- creased by 100 K.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the presence of metal species like Zn in zeolites affects the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted sites. Zn acts as an intermediate, facilitating the activation process through its interaction with Brnsted acid sites. This results in a decrease in activation energy, acceleration of hydrogen exchange reactions, and regioselectivity of the exchange for certain alkanes, such as propane and n-butane. The enhanced efficiency of alkane activation by Zn-modified zeolites points to a synergistic effect between the metal species and acid sites, potentially enabling effective aromatization of small alkanes through a combination of dehydrogenation and olefin formation steps.

The presence of Zn in modified zeolites significantly enhances the activation of C1n-C4 alkane CH bonds through Brnsted acid sites. This is achieved by the formation of Zn alkyl species from the alkane, which precedes its interaction with Brnsted acid sites. These Zn alkyl species enable a more efficient and reversible activation process, resulting in an increase in the rate of hydrogen exchange and a decrease in activation energy. The regioselectivity of the hydrogen exchange for propane and n-butane further indicates the synergistic effect of Zn species and Brnsted sites in alkane activation.
