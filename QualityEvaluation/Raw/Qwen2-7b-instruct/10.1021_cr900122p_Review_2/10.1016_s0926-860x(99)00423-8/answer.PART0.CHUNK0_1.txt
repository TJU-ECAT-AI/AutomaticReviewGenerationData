[1] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
[2] "The authors have reported the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation."
[3] "Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition."
[4] "It was shown that three different types of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts, the relative amount of each one varying with the metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites."
[5] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."
[6] "The new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with respect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
