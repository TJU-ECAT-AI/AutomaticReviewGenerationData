[1] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism."
[2] "The authors have reported the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation."
[3] "Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition."
[4] "The unique products obtained in the partial oxidation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (corresponding to Mo(1.36)) were formaldehyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and H2O."
[5] "The behavior of these catalysts in the MPO reaction can be explained as a function of both density and activity of these types of species and the residual acid sites of the HZSM-5 zeolite."
[6] "As noted above, this catalyst possesses well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds. Therefore, this result strongly supports the hypothesis regarding the specificity of Mo=O sites in HCOH production from methane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include the dispersion and density of active sites, such as M=O and MOM sites in MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts, which dictate the selectivity towards the production of formaldehyde and carbon oxides. The high degree of surface coverage in W/HZSM-5 catalysts leads to higher CO selectivity, whereas the well-dispersed monomeric species with two terminal Mo=O bonds in the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst enhance formaldehyde yield. These catalysts' industrial significance lies in their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable organic compounds, offering a sustainable approach to fuel production and chemical synthesis.

The grafted catalyst's improved formaldehyde yield over classical impregnated catalysts stems from the isolation of oxo species of molybdenum in a high dispersion state. This behavior contrasts with impregnation methods in water, leading to more efficient alkane transformations. The specific activity of these isolated MoO42 species enables the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst to surpass the performance of traditional catalysts in the partial oxidation of methane, demonstrating its potential for industrial applications in the production of formaldehyde and other organic compounds.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。关键因素包括活性位点的分散度和密度，如MoO3和V2O5催化剂中的M=O和MOM位点，它们决定了甲醛和碳氧化物的生成选择性。W/HZSM-5催化剂的高表面覆盖度导致较高的CO选择性，而新制备的grafted Mo/HZSM-5催化剂中分散良好的单体物种与两个末端Mo=O键则增强了甲醛产率。这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够高效地将烷烃转化为有价值的有机化合物，提供了一种可持续的燃料生产和化学合成途径。

新制备的grafted催化剂通过孤立的六价钼氧物种在高分散状态下的特定活性，使其在甲烷部分氧化反应中表现出优于传统催化剂的甲醛产率。这一行为与水基浸渍方法形成对比，从而提高了烷烃转化的效率。这些孤立的MoO42物种的特定活性使grafted Mo/HZSM-5催化剂能够在甲醛和其它有机化合物的生产中超越传统催化剂，展示了其在工业应用中的潜力。
