The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde is influenced by the dispersion and nature of metal oxide species, such as tetrahedral monomeric and octahedral polymeric species. Grafting transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures provides an alternative method to obtain catalysts with defined structure and composition. The use of conventional aqueous impregnation methods to prepare catalysts leads to different distributions of metal oxides, affecting the selectivity towards formaldehyde. The efficiency of these catalysts is also dependent on the carbon balance, which was always better than 97% in the studies conducted.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持的钒氧化物和分子筛改性的催化剂，其组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。甲烷部分氧化为甲醛受金属氧化物种的分散性和性质的影响，如四面体单体物种和八面体聚集体物种。将过渡金属复合物嫁接到活性表面结构上提供了一种获得具有定义结构和组成的催化系统的方法。通过传统水溶液浸渍方法制备的催化剂显示出不同的金属氧化物种分布，这影响了甲醛的选择性。这些催化剂的效率还取决于碳平衡，研究中碳平衡始终优于97%。
