[1] "Comparison of DRIFT spectra of OH groups in MFI with framework Si/Al ratios equal to 25 or 40 with the spectra of the same zeolites after reaction with zinc vapour at 773 K indicated quantitative substitution of acidic hydroxyls by Zn2 ions."
[2] "In the present study, this was demonstrated by very large red shifts of HH stretching vibrations of H2 adsorbed by zinc cations at 77 K and by heterolytic dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at moderately elevated temperatures."
[3] "Our results also confirmed that the extent of substitution of protons by zinc ions in the samples prepared by incipient wetness impregnation or by wet ion exchange is considerably lower than for the reaction with zinc vapour."
[4] "Indeed, for the sample with 100% of such sites, the amount of hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociative adsorption should be one half of that in the initial hydrogen form of the same zeolite."
[5] "At elevated temperatures the extent of such heterolytic dissociative adsorption increases resulting in higher intensity bands from hydrides and acidic protons."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, the specific interactions between the metal ions, the zeolite framework, and the alkane molecules determine the effectiveness of oxidative dehydrogenation and other catalytic processes. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively transform alkane molecules into desired products, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and the economic feasibility of the process. For instance, the complete substitution of protons by bivalent zinc ions in MFI zeolites with high Si/Al ratios demonstrates a new charge-alternating model for the localization of bivalent transition metal cations. This unique arrangement allows for the formation of sites with only partially compensated positive charges, which exhibits an unusually high chemical activity. This is evidenced by the large red shifts of hydrogen adsorption and heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. The extent of proton substitution varies depending on the preparation method, with reaction with zinc vapor leading to complete substitution, while ion exchange and wet impregnation result in a lower extent of substitution. The regeneration of acidic protons through heterolytic dissociative adsorption further highlights the efficiency of these catalysts, as it allows for the estimation of the number of unusual zinc ions present in the catalyst. The increased intensity of hydride and acidic proton bands at elevated temperatures indicates a higher degree of heterolytic dissociative adsorption, which is a key factor in the efficiency of alkane transformation processes catalyzed by these materials.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。在支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的背景下，金属离子、沸石骨架与烷烃分子之间的特定相互作用决定了氧化脱氢和其他催化过程的有效性。工业上这些催化剂的重要因素包括选择性地将烷烃分子转化为所需产物的能力、催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性以及过程的经济可行性。例如，在高Si/Al比例的MFI沸石中通过锌蒸汽反应完全替代质子的二价锌离子显示了一种新的双价过渡金属离子定位模型。这种独特的排列允许形成只有部分补偿正电荷的位点，显示出异常高的化学活性。这通过氢吸附的大红移和在适中的温度下异裂吸附的证据得到了证明。根据制备方法的不同，质子替代的程度也不同，其中与锌蒸汽反应导致完全替代，而离子交换和湿浸渍的结果是较低的替代程度。通过异裂吸附原位再生酸性氢进一步强调了这些催化剂的效率，因为它允许估计催化剂中存在的异常锌离子数量。随着温度的升高，异裂吸附的强度增加，导致氢化物和酸性氢带的强度增加，这是烷烃转换过程中这些材料效率的关键因素。
