<p>Until recently, it has been generally believed that bivalent cations in high-silica zeolites are localized at sites containing two negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra in the next-nearest positions to each other.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to predict the fraction of such sites. Feng and Hall10 and Rice et al.11 performed stochastic simulations of Al distribution in high-silica frameworks. In agreement with 29Si MAS NMR results on the random distribution of aluminium in MFI,12 they concluded that, at high Si/Al ratios, the probability of finding two Al ions in the same ring of the zeolite framework is very low.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substitution of protons by zinc ions. For the zeolite with the framework Si/Al ratio equal to 25 this is demonstrated by the spectrum (b) in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>Unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction with zinc vapour results in the complete substitution of all acidic protons by zinc ions.</p>
<p>Similar to our previous studies,59 the modified MFI samples were examined by low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe.</p>
<p>In agreement with the DRIFT spectrum of hydroxyl groups shown in Fig. 1, the spectrum of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by the zeolite modified via reaction with zinc vapour (Fig. 2(b)) also confirms the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions.</p>
<p>The chemical reaction with zinc vapour also results in the appearance of two new sites of molecular hydrogen adsorption with HH stretching frequencies of 4010 and 3938 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>At room temperature or slightly higher such sites dissociatively adsorb molecular hydrogen according to the following equation:</p>
<p>AlO<sub>2</sub>Zn<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub> → AlO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + ZnH</p>
<p>This results in the partial regeneration of the DRIFT band from acidic hydroxyl groups with the maximum at 3610 cm<sup>-1</sup> and in the appearance of the band from zinc hydrides at 1934 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>The stretching frequency of the resulting zinc hydrides is higher by more than 200 cm<sup>-1</sup> than that of 1710 cm<sup>-1</sup> for hydrides produced by dissociative hydrogen adsorption on ZnO.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts can enable alkane transformations under mild conditions, offering a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include enhanced selectivity, improved conversion rates, and reduced energy consumption. The document discusses how the reaction of high-silica zeolites with zinc vapor leads to complete proton substitution, indicating a unique mechanism for catalyst activity. This process involves the creation of sites with alternating positive and negative charges, which are responsible for the catalyst's unusual properties. The catalyst's ability to selectively transform alkane molecules into desired products, along with its potential for efficient hydrogen adsorption, makes it a promising candidate for industrial applications. The detailed examination of hydrogen adsorption and dissociative adsorption of hydrogen further elucidates the mechanism behind the catalyst's activity, providing insights into optimizing its performance for various alkane transformation processes.

The study discusses the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups in MFI zeolites with zinc ions (Zn2+) at high Si/Al ratios. The substitution process leads to the formation of sites with only partially compensated positive charges due to the presence of negatively charged aluminum tetrahedra. These partially compensated sites result in the unusual chemical activity of the modified zeolites. The study also compares the results of the zinc vapor treatment with those obtained through conventional ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation methods. The findings suggest that the high-silica zeolites modified by reacting with zinc vapor exhibit specific catalytic and adsorption properties that differ from those modified by ion exchange or impregnation.

These ions, with only partially compensated positive charges, exhibit unusually high chemical activity, explaining the unique catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with bivalent transition metal ions. The study demonstrated this by observing significant red shifts in hydrogen stretching vibrations and heterolytic dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at moderate temperatures.

研究发现，在高硅含量的MFI沸石通过锌蒸汽在773 K条件下处理后，酸性羟基被锌离子完全取代。这表明在高Si/Al比下，部分锌离子定位在孤立的铝占据的氧四面体上，带有单个负电荷。这些带部分补偿正电荷的离子显示出异常高的化学活性，解释了高硅沸石通过二价过渡金属离子改性所具有的独特催化和吸附性质。研究通过观察氢伸缩振动的显著红移和在中等温度下分子氢的异裂吸附来证明这一点。低温度氢吸附作为分子探针的应用显示，通过离子交换或初始湿润浸渍改性的沸石中也存在类似的不寻常锌离子定位点，但这种点的数量少于通过与锌蒸汽反应制备的样品中的数量。

<p>For the zeolite with the framework Si/Al ratio equal to 25 this is demonstrated by the spectrum (b) in Fig. 1. DRIFT spectrum (a) in Fig. 1 corresponds to protons in the initial hydrogen form pre-evacuated at 773 K. In agreement with our previous results,6,7 it contains a narrow DRIFT band at 3610 cm1 from the isolated bridging acidic hydroxyl groups and a much weaker band from the silanol groups with the maximum at 3740 cm1. A much broader band with the maximum at 29003600 cm1 also belongs to acidic OH groups that are hydrogen-bonded by the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Interaction with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the disap- pearance of the narrow and broad bands (line (b)). This indicates a chemical reaction of both isolated and hydrogen- bonded acidic protons with zinc atoms. The quantitative sub- stitution of acidic protons by zinc ions was also confirmed by AAS analysis of zinc content in the modified zeolite (ca. 2 wt% of zinc) and by the amount of releasing hydrogen that was close to one half of the aluminium content in the sample.</p>
<p>Similar to our previous studies,59 the modified MFI sam- ples were examined by low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe. The DRIFT spectrum of H2 adsorbed at 77 K by the same HMFI sample as in Fig. 1(a) is shown in Fig. 2(a).</p>
<p>In agreement with the DRIFT spectrum of hydroxyl groups shown in Fig. 1, the spectrum of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by the zeolite modified via reaction with zinc vapour (Fig. 2(b)) also confirms the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions. This follows from the disappearance of the band with the maximum at 4105 cm1 from hydrogen perturbed by acidic hydroxyl groups. On the contrary, similar to Fig. 1, the intensity of the band at 4125 cm1 from hydrogen adsorbed by the silanol groups remains unchanged.</p>
<p>It has been suggested in our previous work that bivalent zinc ions most strongly perturbing adsorbed hydrogen molecules are well separated from each other.9 The main argument supporting this conclusion was the higher fraction of such sites in zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios.</p>
<p>The fraction of such sites should decrease at the higher Si/Al ratios.</p>
<p>Indeed, for the sample with 100% of such sites, the amount of hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociative adsorption should be one half of that in the initial hydrogen form of the same zeolite. As follows from comparison of Figs. 1 and 5, for the zeolite with Si/Al 25 prepared by reaction of protons with zinc vapour, the corresponding amount of regenerated protons observed in our experiments was about 2530% of the initial number of protons. This indicates a considerable fraction of unusual zinc ions close to about 60%.</p>

1. The reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI zeolites with zinc vapor at 773 K results in the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions. This is demonstrated by the disappearance of narrow and broad DRIFT bands related to acidic protons in the modified zeolite. AAS analysis and the amount of released hydrogen confirm the quantitative substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions.

2. The chemical reaction with zinc vapor leads to the appearance of two new sites for molecular hydrogen adsorption with stretching frequencies of 4010 and 3938 cm−1. The band at 4010 cm−1 is similar to hydrogen adsorption by zinc ions at SII sites in ZnFAU prepared by conventional wet ion exchange. The band at 3938 cm−1 is attributed to hydrogen adsorbed by zinc ions localized at well-separated negatively charged aluminum occupied oxygen tetrahedra.

3. The complete substitution of protons by zinc ions in MFI zeolites with very high Si/Al ratios supports the new charge-alternating model of localization of bivalent transition metal cations at well-separated negatively charged aluminum atoms. This model is novel for high-silica zeolites, but similar structures with alternating excessive positive and negative charges have been known for a long time in monometallic and mixed-metal oxides.

4. The unusually large red shifts of hydrogen stretching vibrations and heterolytic dissociative adsorption of hydrogen at relatively low temperatures indicate the presence of acid-base pairs with well-separated zinc Lewis sites and negatively charged basic oxygen, which are characterized by strong perturbation of adsorbed hydrogen.

5. The amount of regenerated acidic protons from dissociative adsorption can be used to estimate the number of unusual zinc ions in the zeolite. For a sample with 100% of such sites, the amount of regenerated protons is about 25-30% of the initial number of protons, indicating a significant fraction of unusual zinc ions, approximately 60%.

1. 在773 K下，氢形式的MFI沸石与锌蒸汽反应的结果是酸性氢离子被锌离子完全取代。这通过消失在改性沸石中相关的窄带和宽带来证明，这些宽带与酸性氢氧基有关。通过原子吸收光谱分析（AAS）和释放的氢气量，可以确认酸性氢离子的定量取代由锌离子。

2. 锌蒸汽与氢反应导致出现两个新的分子氢吸附位点，其伸缩频率分别为4010 cm−1和3938 cm−1。频率为4010 cm−1的带类似于常规湿离子交换制备的ZnFAU中的锌离子在SII位点上的氢吸附。频率为3938 cm−1的带归因于位于相距较远的负电荷铝占有的氧四面体上的锌离子。

3. MFI沸石中硅/铝比非常高的情况下的锌离子完全取代酸性氢离子支持了新交替模型，该模型描述了二价过渡金属离子在负电荷铝原子间分离的局部化。对于高硅沸石来说，这是新颖的，但类似的结构在单金属和混合金属氧化物中已知很久，其中包含不同电荷的离子和晶格氧。

4. 异常大的氢伸缩振动红移和相对低温下的氢异裂吸附表明存在锌Lewis位点与负电荷基本氧形成酸碱对，这些位点对吸附的氢有强烈的扰动。

5. 从异裂吸附获得的再生酸性氢的数量可以用来估计沸石中异常锌离子的数量。对于具有100%此类位点的样品，再生氢的数量约为初始氢数量的25%-30%，这表明异常锌离子的显著比例，大约为60%。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, the specific interactions between the metal ions, the zeolite framework, and the alkane molecules determine the effectiveness of oxidative dehydrogenation and other catalytic processes. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively transform alkane molecules into desired products, the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions, and the economic feasibility of the process. For instance, the complete substitution of protons by bivalent zinc ions in MFI zeolites with high Si/Al ratios demonstrates a new charge-alternating model for the localization of bivalent transition metal cations. This unique arrangement allows for the formation of sites with only partially compensated positive charges, which exhibits an unusually high chemical activity. This is evidenced by the large red shifts of hydrogen adsorption and heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. The extent of proton substitution varies depending on the preparation method, with reaction with zinc vapor leading to complete substitution, while ion exchange and wet impregnation result in a lower extent of substitution. The regeneration of acidic protons through heterolytic dissociative adsorption further highlights the efficiency of these catalysts, as it allows for the estimation of the number of unusual zinc ions present in the catalyst. The increased intensity of hydride and acidic proton bands at elevated temperatures indicates a higher degree of heterolytic dissociative adsorption, which is a key factor in the efficiency of alkane transformation processes catalyzed by these materials.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。在支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的背景下，金属离子、沸石骨架与烷烃分子之间的特定相互作用决定了氧化脱氢和其他催化过程的有效性。工业上这些催化剂的重要因素包括选择性地将烷烃分子转化为所需产物的能力、催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性以及过程的经济可行性。例如，在高Si/Al比例的MFI沸石中通过锌蒸汽反应完全替代质子的二价锌离子显示了一种新的双价过渡金属离子定位模型。这种独特的排列允许形成只有部分补偿正电荷的位点，显示出异常高的化学活性。这通过氢吸附的大红移和在适中的温度下异裂吸附的证据得到了证明。根据制备方法的不同，质子替代的程度也不同，其中与锌蒸汽反应导致完全替代，而离子交换和湿浸渍的结果是较低的替代程度。通过异裂吸附原位再生酸性氢进一步强调了这些催化剂的效率，因为它允许估计催化剂中存在的异常锌离子数量。随着温度的升高，异裂吸附的强度增加，导致氢化物和酸性氢带的强度增加，这是烷烃转换过程中这些材料效率的关键因素。
