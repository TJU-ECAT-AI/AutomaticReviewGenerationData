[1] "Comparison of DRIFT spectra of OH groups in MFI with framework Si/Al ratios equal to 25 or 40 with the spectra of the same zeolites after reaction with zinc vapour at 773 K indicated quantitative substitution of acidic hydroxyls by Zn2 ions."
[2] "Complete substitution of protons indicates that at high Si/Al ratios some of the Zn2 cations are localized at the isolated aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra with single negative charges."
[3] "In parallel, the same amount of negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra remains without compensating cations or protons."
[4] "Their negative charges are neutralized indirectly by the electrostatic interaction with the surrounding positively charged cationic sites."
[5] "Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity."
[6] "This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations."
[7] "In the present study, this was demonstrated by very large red shifts of HH stretching vibrations of H2 adsorbed by zinc cations at 77 K and by heterolytic dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at moderately elevated temperatures."
[8] "Application of low temperature H2 adsorption as a molecular probe indicated that similar sites of unusual localization of bivalent zinc cations also exist in zeolites modified by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, but the amount of such sites is less than for the samples modified by reaction with zinc vapour."

The study found that in high-silica MFI zeolites modified by zinc vapor at 773 K, the protons are completely substituted by zinc ions. This indicates that at high Si/Al ratios, some of the zinc ions are localized at isolated aluminum occupied oxygen tetrahedra with single negative charges. These ions, with only partially compensated positive charges, exhibit unusually high chemical activity, explaining the unique catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with bivalent transition metal ions. The study demonstrated this by observing significant red shifts in hydrogen stretching vibrations and heterolytic dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen at moderate temperatures. The application of low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe showed that similar sites of unusual zinc ion localization exist in zeolites modified by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, but the amount of such sites is less than for the samples modified by reaction with zinc vapor.

研究发现，在高硅含量的MFI沸石通过锌蒸汽在773 K条件下处理后，酸性羟基被锌离子完全取代。这表明在高Si/Al比下，部分锌离子定位在孤立的铝占据的氧四面体上，带有单个负电荷。这些带部分补偿正电荷的离子显示出异常高的化学活性，解释了高硅沸石通过二价过渡金属离子改性所具有的独特催化和吸附性质。研究通过观察氢伸缩振动的显著红移和在中等温度下分子氢的异裂吸附来证明这一点。低温度氢吸附作为分子探针的应用显示，通过离子交换或初始湿润浸渍改性的沸石中也存在类似的不寻常锌离子定位点，但这种点的数量少于通过与锌蒸汽反应制备的样品中的数量。
