<p>For the zeolite with the framework Si/Al ratio equal to 25 this is demonstrated by the spectrum (b) in Fig. 1. DRIFT spectrum (a) in Fig. 1 corresponds to protons in the initial hydrogen form pre-evacuated at 773 K. In agreement with our previous results,6,7 it contains a narrow DRIFT band at 3610 cm1 from the isolated bridging acidic hydroxyl groups and a much weaker band from the silanol groups with the maximum at 3740 cm1. A much broader band with the maximum at 29003600 cm1 also belongs to acidic OH groups that are hydrogen-bonded by the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Interaction with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the disap- pearance of the narrow and broad bands (line (b)). This indicates a chemical reaction of both isolated and hydrogen- bonded acidic protons with zinc atoms. The quantitative sub- stitution of acidic protons by zinc ions was also confirmed by AAS analysis of zinc content in the modified zeolite (ca. 2 wt% of zinc) and by the amount of releasing hydrogen that was close to one half of the aluminium content in the sample.</p>
<p>Similar to our previous studies,59 the modified MFI sam- ples were examined by low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe. The DRIFT spectrum of H2 adsorbed at 77 K by the same HMFI sample as in Fig. 1(a) is shown in Fig. 2(a).</p>
<p>In agreement with the DRIFT spectrum of hydroxyl groups shown in Fig. 1, the spectrum of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by the zeolite modified via reaction with zinc vapour (Fig. 2(b)) also confirms the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions. This follows from the disappearance of the band with the maximum at 4105 cm1 from hydrogen perturbed by acidic hydroxyl groups. On the contrary, similar to Fig. 1, the intensity of the band at 4125 cm1 from hydrogen adsorbed by the silanol groups remains unchanged.</p>
<p>It has been suggested in our previous work that bivalent zinc ions most strongly perturbing adsorbed hydrogen molecules are well separated from each other.9 The main argument supporting this conclusion was the higher fraction of such sites in zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios.</p>
<p>The fraction of such sites should decrease at the higher Si/Al ratios.</p>
<p>Indeed, for the sample with 100% of such sites, the amount of hydroxyl groups resulting from dissociative adsorption should be one half of that in the initial hydrogen form of the same zeolite. As follows from comparison of Figs. 1 and 5, for the zeolite with Si/Al 25 prepared by reaction of protons with zinc vapour, the corresponding amount of regenerated protons observed in our experiments was about 2530% of the initial number of protons. This indicates a considerable fraction of unusual zinc ions close to about 60%.</p>

1. The reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI zeolites with zinc vapor at 773 K results in the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions. This is demonstrated by the disappearance of narrow and broad DRIFT bands related to acidic protons in the modified zeolite. AAS analysis and the amount of released hydrogen confirm the quantitative substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions.

2. The chemical reaction with zinc vapor leads to the appearance of two new sites for molecular hydrogen adsorption with stretching frequencies of 4010 and 3938 cm−1. The band at 4010 cm−1 is similar to hydrogen adsorption by zinc ions at SII sites in ZnFAU prepared by conventional wet ion exchange. The band at 3938 cm−1 is attributed to hydrogen adsorbed by zinc ions localized at well-separated negatively charged aluminum occupied oxygen tetrahedra.

3. The complete substitution of protons by zinc ions in MFI zeolites with very high Si/Al ratios supports the new charge-alternating model of localization of bivalent transition metal cations at well-separated negatively charged aluminum atoms. This model is novel for high-silica zeolites, but similar structures with alternating excessive positive and negative charges have been known for a long time in monometallic and mixed-metal oxides.

4. The unusually large red shifts of hydrogen stretching vibrations and heterolytic dissociative adsorption of hydrogen at relatively low temperatures indicate the presence of acid-base pairs with well-separated zinc Lewis sites and negatively charged basic oxygen, which are characterized by strong perturbation of adsorbed hydrogen.

5. The amount of regenerated acidic protons from dissociative adsorption can be used to estimate the number of unusual zinc ions in the zeolite. For a sample with 100% of such sites, the amount of regenerated protons is about 25-30% of the initial number of protons, indicating a significant fraction of unusual zinc ions, approximately 60%.

1. 在773 K下，氢形式的MFI沸石与锌蒸汽反应的结果是酸性氢离子被锌离子完全取代。这通过消失在改性沸石中相关的窄带和宽带来证明，这些宽带与酸性氢氧基有关。通过原子吸收光谱分析（AAS）和释放的氢气量，可以确认酸性氢离子的定量取代由锌离子。

2. 锌蒸汽与氢反应导致出现两个新的分子氢吸附位点，其伸缩频率分别为4010 cm−1和3938 cm−1。频率为4010 cm−1的带类似于常规湿离子交换制备的ZnFAU中的锌离子在SII位点上的氢吸附。频率为3938 cm−1的带归因于位于相距较远的负电荷铝占有的氧四面体上的锌离子。

3. MFI沸石中硅/铝比非常高的情况下的锌离子完全取代酸性氢离子支持了新交替模型，该模型描述了二价过渡金属离子在负电荷铝原子间分离的局部化。对于高硅沸石来说，这是新颖的，但类似的结构在单金属和混合金属氧化物中已知很久，其中包含不同电荷的离子和晶格氧。

4. 异常大的氢伸缩振动红移和相对低温下的氢异裂吸附表明存在锌Lewis位点与负电荷基本氧形成酸碱对，这些位点对吸附的氢有强烈的扰动。

5. 从异裂吸附获得的再生酸性氢的数量可以用来估计沸石中异常锌离子的数量。对于具有100%此类位点的样品，再生氢的数量约为初始氢数量的25%-30%，这表明异常锌离子的显著比例，大约为60%。
