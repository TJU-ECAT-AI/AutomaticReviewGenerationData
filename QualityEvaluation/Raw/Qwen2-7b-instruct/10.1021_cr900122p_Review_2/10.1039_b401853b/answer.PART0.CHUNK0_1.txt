[1] "Comparison of DRIFT spectra of OH groups in MFI with framework Si/Al ratios equal to 25 or 40 with the spectra of the same zeolites after reaction with zinc vapour at 773 K indicated quantitative substitution of acidic hydroxyls by Zn2 ions."
[2] "In parallel, the same amount of negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra remains without compensating cations or protons."
[3] "Their negative charges are neutralized indirectly by the electrostatic interaction with the surrounding positively charged cationic sites."
[4] "Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity."
[5] "This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations."
[6] "For instance, cobalt- and copper-modified MFI are active in selective reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in oxygen excess."
[7] "On the contrary, faujasites or other low-silica zeolites modified with the same cations catalyze neither of these reactions."
[8] "In this connection, an interesting alternative to ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation is modification of high-silica zeolites via a reaction of the hydrogen forms with zinc vapour at high temperatures."
[9] "The results obtained on localization of zinc cations are compared with those for the same HZSM-5 modified by conventional ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation."

The study discusses the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups in MFI zeolites with zinc ions (Zn2+) at high Si/Al ratios. The substitution process leads to the formation of sites with only partially compensated positive charges due to the presence of negatively charged aluminum tetrahedra. These partially compensated sites result in the unusual chemical activity of the modified zeolites. The study also compares the results of the zinc vapor treatment with those obtained through conventional ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation methods. The findings suggest that the high-silica zeolites modified by reacting with zinc vapor exhibit specific catalytic and adsorption properties that differ from those modified by ion exchange or impregnation.

研究讨论了在高Si/Al比的MFI沸石中酸性羟基团被锌离子（Zn2+）替换的过程。替换过程导致形成只有部分补偿的正电荷的位点，由于存在负电荷的铝四面体。这些部分补偿的位点导致了改性的沸石的异常化学活性。研究还比较了通过锌蒸汽处理的结果与通过常规离子交换或浸渍方法获得的结果。发现通过与锌蒸汽反应改性的高硅沸石显示出与离子交换或浸渍方法改性的沸石不同的特定催化和吸附性质。
