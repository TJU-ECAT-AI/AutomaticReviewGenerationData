<p>Until recently, it has been generally believed that bivalent cations in high-silica zeolites are localized at sites containing two negatively charged aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra in the next-nearest positions to each other.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to predict the fraction of such sites. Feng and Hall10 and Rice et al.11 performed stochastic simulations of Al distribution in high-silica frameworks. In agreement with 29Si MAS NMR results on the random distribution of aluminium in MFI,12 they concluded that, at high Si/Al ratios, the probability of finding two Al ions in the same ring of the zeolite framework is very low.</p>
<p>However, in contrast to ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substitution of protons by zinc ions. For the zeolite with the framework Si/Al ratio equal to 25 this is demonstrated by the spectrum (b) in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>Unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction with zinc vapour results in the complete substitution of all acidic protons by zinc ions.</p>
<p>Similar to our previous studies,59 the modified MFI samples were examined by low-temperature hydrogen adsorption as a molecular probe.</p>
<p>In agreement with the DRIFT spectrum of hydroxyl groups shown in Fig. 1, the spectrum of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by the zeolite modified via reaction with zinc vapour (Fig. 2(b)) also confirms the complete substitution of acidic protons by zinc ions.</p>
<p>The chemical reaction with zinc vapour also results in the appearance of two new sites of molecular hydrogen adsorption with HH stretching frequencies of 4010 and 3938 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>At room temperature or slightly higher such sites dissociatively adsorb molecular hydrogen according to the following equation:</p>
<p>AlO<sub>2</sub>Zn<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub> → AlO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + ZnH</p>
<p>This results in the partial regeneration of the DRIFT band from acidic hydroxyl groups with the maximum at 3610 cm<sup>-1</sup> and in the appearance of the band from zinc hydrides at 1934 cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>The stretching frequency of the resulting zinc hydrides is higher by more than 200 cm<sup>-1</sup> than that of 1710 cm<sup>-1</sup> for hydrides produced by dissociative hydrogen adsorption on ZnO.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts can enable alkane transformations under mild conditions, offering a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include enhanced selectivity, improved conversion rates, and reduced energy consumption. The document discusses how the reaction of high-silica zeolites with zinc vapor leads to complete proton substitution, indicating a unique mechanism for catalyst activity. This process involves the creation of sites with alternating positive and negative charges, which are responsible for the catalyst's unusual properties. The catalyst's ability to selectively transform alkane molecules into desired products, along with its potential for efficient hydrogen adsorption, makes it a promising candidate for industrial applications. The detailed examination of hydrogen adsorption and dissociative adsorption of hydrogen further elucidates the mechanism behind the catalyst's activity, providing insights into optimizing its performance for various alkane transformation processes.
