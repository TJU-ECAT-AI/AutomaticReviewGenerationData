1. Research groups led by Lunsford and Somorjai demonstrated that the use of N2O as an oxidant over supported MoO3 and V2O5 oxides resulted in high selectivity for methane oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low conversion rates.
2. The proposed approach aims to modify the oxidant chemistry to alter the state of surface oxygen, while keeping the activation of organic molecules relatively unchanged or minimally affected, thereby offering a new opportunity to control selectivity.
3. In 1983, Iwamoto et al. pioneered the use of N2O for benzene oxidation, but encountered difficulties due to the destruction of the aromatic ring and low phenol selectivity in the presence of known catalysts.
4. A variety of organic substrates were tested for their interaction with a-oxygen at room temperature to identify primary oxidation products, revealing the potential of N2O as a selective oxidant.
5. Hydroxylation reactions involving aromatics showed high selectivities, over 90%, for the hydroxylation of chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, phenol, and biphenyl.
6. Despite challenges, certain strategies have led to significant enhancements, exemplified by the hydroxylation of phenol to dihydroxybenzenes, where the total selectivity reached 95%.
7. In the initial stages of the hydroxylation process, the hydroquinone (HQ) fraction comprised 85 mol%.

1. Lunsford和Somorjai的研究小组表明，在MoO3和V2O5氧化物上使用N2O作为氧化剂，可以实现高选择性地将甲烷转化为甲醇和甲醛，尤其是在低转化率的情况下。
2. 所提出的方法旨在通过改变氧化剂化学性质来改变表面氧的状态，同时保持有机分子的活化相对不变或轻微影响，从而提供控制选择性的新机会。
3. 1983年，Iwamoto等人首次使用N2O进行苯的氧化，但在已知催化剂的存在下，由于芳香环的破坏和低苯酚选择性，这一反应尝试未能成功。
4. 对多种有机物在室温下与a-oxygen的相互作用进行了测试，以识别主要氧化产物，这揭示了N2O作为选择性氧化剂的潜力。
5. 针对芳香族化合物的羟基化反应显示了高选择性，超过90%，涉及氯苯、氟苯、苯酚和联苯的羟基化。
6. 尽管存在挑战，某些策略已经导致显著改进，通过苯酚的羟基化至二羟基苯环为例，总选择性达到了95%。
7. 在羟基化过程的初期阶段，羟基奎宁（HQ）的比例为85 mol%。
