[1] "In the late 1970searly 1980s, nitrous oxide has attracted a significant attention of researchers involved in searching for new ways in selective transformation of methane."
[2] "First practical interest to nitrous oxide as an oxidant has appeared in relation to phenol problem, which is one of the most bulky chemicals, with the annual world production exceeding 6 million tons."
[3] "The interaction with O2 in the presence of known catalysts leads mainly to the destruction of the aromatic ring and low phenol selectivity."
[4] "This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen."
[5] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested."
[6] "The process of the Fe2+ stabilization appeared to depend on the chemical composition of the matrix and is strongly facilitated by the presence of water vapor."
[7] "The reduced iron atoms of complex (III) appear to be inert to dioxygen. However, they are readily oxidized at elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into complex (IV) to give adsorbed O a species."
[8] "Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."
[9] "One can assume that this is a result of side transformations taking place inside zeolite cavities when performing catalysis at elevated temperatures."
[10] "The total selectivity of the reaction to the sum of dihydroxybenzenes (DHB) is 95%."

1. Metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations through their composition, structure, and reaction conditions. Supported vanadium oxides enable high selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, while metal-exchanged zeolites facilitate the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide with good selectivities. The structure and chemical composition of these catalysts play crucial roles in controlling the reactions, ensuring that the desired products are formed efficiently.

2. Factors contributing to the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts include their ability to operate under various conditions, their high selectivity, and their efficiency in producing desired chemical products. The use of supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites allows for the selective transformation of alkanes into valuable intermediates, which are essential components in the production of various downstream chemical products.

3. At elevated temperatures, the catalysts can undergo side transformations, leading to issues like coking, which can deactivate the catalysts. To mitigate this, researchers are exploring methods to neutralize functional groups on the catalyst surfaces while preserving the active sites responsible for the desired reactions.

4. Metal-exchanged zeolites, such as FeZSM-5, exhibit high selectivity in the hydroxylation of phenol to dihydroxybenzenes. The selectivity reaches up to 95%, with the formation of hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CH) being the predominant products, showcasing the industrial potential of these catalysts in phenol transformations.
