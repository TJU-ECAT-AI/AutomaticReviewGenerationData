[1] "The involvement of new feed stocks and reagents into large-scale chemical industry is always a very important event for the industry and its economics and often results in dramatic consequences."
[2] "Indeed, the final choice of real chemical industry is basing not only on chemical properties of a particular reagent but also (and often mainly) on comparative assessments of its cost, availability, etc."
[3] "For that, a variety of organic substrates were tested for their interaction with a-oxygen at room temperature to identify primary oxidation products."
[4] "This is a difficult challenge. Nevertheless, in some cases this approach leads to significant improvements, which can be illustrated by an example of hydroxylation of phenol to dihydroxybenzenes."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to conduct oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions with high selectivity and yield. The cost, availability, and efficiency of these catalysts are crucial considerations for industrial applications. Additionally, the interaction of organic substrates with a-oxygen under room temperature conditions demonstrates the potential of nitrous oxide as a selective oxidant, offering a convenient method for evaluating its potential in various oxidation reactions. Challenges in suppressing side transformations and coking during catalysis at elevated temperatures require careful surface modification to preserve the active sites, leading to significant improvements in selectivity in certain cases.
