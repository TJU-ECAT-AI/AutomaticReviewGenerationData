[1] "In particular, research groups of Lunsford [3,4] and Somorjai [5,6] showed that application of N2O oxidant over supported MoO3 and V2O5 oxides provided high selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low conversions."
[2] "First practical interest to nitrous oxide as an oxidant has appeared in relation to phenol problem, which is one of the most bulky chemicals, with the annual world production exceeding 6 million tons."
[3] "An ideal solution of the problem would be, indeed, a direct oxidation of benzene to phenol with dioxygen:(1)"
[4] "This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen."
[5] "The catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed at much lower temperature and, which is even more important, with the selectivity approaching 100%."
[6] "The remarkable oxidation activity of ZSM-5 gave rise to numerous discussions concerning the origin of the mentioned untypical zeolite activity as well as the reasons for an amazing specificity of the N2O oxidant compared to O2."
[7] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested."
[8] "The process of the Fe2+ stabilization appeared to depend on the chemical composition of the matrix and is strongly facilitated by the presence of water vapor [20,26,30,71,78]."
[9] "Presumably, the stabilization can occur in the form of complex (III), in which Fe2 2 entities are strongly incorporated into a silicate fragment of the zeolite matrix and have a more distant position as compared to complex (II), thus making impossible their reoxidation into the latter complex."
[10] "However, they are readily oxidized at elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into complex (IV) to give adsorbed O a species."
[11] "The Eqs. (3)(5) seem to be the main steps of the reaction mechanism at the benzene oxidation with N2O."
[12] "These single turn-over reactions, beside a mechanistic importance, happened to be a convenient way for estimating the potentialities of the oxidation with a- oxygen."
[13] "The data presented in Table 2 demonstrate the selectivities toward hydroxylation products obtained in the oxidation of various substrates over zeolite catalysts."
[14] "However, in many cases the resulted selectivity appeared to be much lower than it might be expected from the room temperature stoichiometric data."
[15] "To suppress such side transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite surface but leaving intact the a-sites."
[16] "Fig. 2 shows a 40-h run for the hydroxylation of phenol by N2O over the FeZSM-5 zeolite [87]:(6)"

1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts enable selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, including the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, which is typically a multi-step process. The selectivity of these reactions is notably improved under certain conditions, such as lower temperatures and higher oxygen concentrations.

2. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to provide high selectivity in alkane transformations, reduce the number of steps required in chemical processes, and potentially decrease energy consumption and environmental impact. The use of catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites offers a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods, such as the use of air or inorganic compounds in oxidation reactions.

3. The specific mechanisms of action for these catalysts involve the formation of active sites, such as the a-sites in zeolites, which facilitate the selective transfer of oxygen atoms from nitrous oxide (N2O) to hydrocarbon molecules during oxidation reactions. These active sites are crucial for the efficiency of the reactions, as they enable the direct addition of oxygen atoms to hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of hydroxylation products.

4. Factors contributing to the industrial significance of these catalysts include their ability to operate at lower temperatures, the high selectivity they exhibit in oxidation reactions, and the potential for their use in a wide range of substrates, including alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, and aromatics. The catalysts' efficiency and versatility make them attractive for various industrial applications, particularly in the chemical industry where the selective transformation of hydrocarbons is essential.

5. To enhance the performance of these catalysts, researchers focus on optimizing their composition and structure, improving their stability, and developing strategies to minimize unwanted side reactions, such as coking, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The goal is to maintain or increase the catalyst's activity and selectivity over multiple reaction cycles, ensuring their long-term viability in industrial processes.
