[1] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 adsorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[2] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K."
[3] "In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions,giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."
[4] "Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."
[5] "This may be primarily attributed to the deactivation of Brnsted acid sites that play an important role in the formation of aromatics and coke."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, specifically zinc- and gallium-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zinc-modified zeolites facilitate strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane, leading to heterolytic dissociation into zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon heating. In contrast, gallium-modified zeolites exhibit weak adsorption of ethane, and ethane dissociation occurs via oxidative addition to gallium ions, generating ethyl and hydride fragments. These fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium hydrides upon further heating. The absence of Brnsted acidity in gallium-modified zeolites contributes to the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene, whereas zinc-modified zeolites suffer from deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity, affecting their industrial significance.

金属基催化剂，特别是锌和镓改性的沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率。锌改性沸石使吸附的乙烷具有强烈的极化性，导致加热后发生异裂解，生成锌乙基碎片和质子。相比之下，镓改性沸石表现出对乙烷的弱吸附，乙烷在加热到523K时通过氧化加成到镓离子上进行异裂解，产生乙基和氢化物碎片。这些碎片在进一步加热后分解为乙烯和镓氢化合物。镓改性沸石中缺乏Brnsted酸性有助于稳定且选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯，而锌改性沸石由于生成Brnsted酸性而遭受失活和次级芳构化反应的影响，这影响了它们的工业重要性。
