[1] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."
[2] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 adsorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[3] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."
[4] "The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene."
[5] "Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits a much higher ethane conversion and the product mixture contains aromatics, mostly benzene."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, zinc-modified HZSM-5 catalysts activate ethane through strong polarizability, leading to heterolytic dissociation into zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon heating. In contrast, gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts weakly adsorb ethane, allowing for dissociative ethane adsorption at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to gallium species. These differences in alkane activation mechanisms have direct implications for the types of products formed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, with zinc-modified catalysts favoring aromatics formation and gallium-modified catalysts favoring ethylene production. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into desired products, depending on the specific catalyst used, thereby optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of chemical processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率产生了显著影响。例如，锌改性HZSM-5催化剂通过强烈的极化作用激活乙烷，导致加热后乙烷异裂为锌乙基碎片和质子。而镓改性HZSM-5催化剂则以较弱的方式吸附乙烷，在高温下进行异裂吸附，产生乙基和氢化物碎片结合到镓物种上。这些不同的烷烃活化机制直接影响了催化碳氢化合物转化过程中产物的类型，锌改性催化剂倾向于形成芳香族化合物，而镓改性催化剂倾向于生成乙烯。这些催化剂在工业中的重要性在于它们能够选择性地将烷烃转化为所需的产品，这取决于所使用的具体催化剂，从而优化化学过程的效率和选择性。
