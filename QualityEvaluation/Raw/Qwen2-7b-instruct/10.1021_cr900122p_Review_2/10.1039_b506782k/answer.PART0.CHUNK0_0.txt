[6] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The differences in the mechanisms of alkane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts highlight how these factors impact the outcomes. Specifically, over Zn/ZSM-5, adsorbed ethane undergoes strong polarizability and heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of zinc ethyl fragments and protons. In contrast, ethane adsorption over Ga/ZSM-5 is much weaker, and dissociative adsorption occurs at higher temperatures through oxidative addition, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species. The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation enables the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene. However, Zn/ZSM-5 displays higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity. These differences in mechanisms and efficiency are crucial for understanding the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转换机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。锌改性和镓改性HZSM-5催化剂上的烷烃激活机制的不同突显了这些因素如何影响结果。具体来说，在Zn/ZSM-5上，吸附的乙烷经历强烈的极化和异裂解，导致形成锌乙基碎片和质子。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5上的乙烷吸附要弱得多，并在较高温度下通过氧化添加发生脱附，形成与Ga31物种协调的乙基和氢碎片。Ga/ZSM-5上烷烃激活过程中缺乏Brnsted酸性质子的形成使得乙烷稳定且选择性地转化为乙烯。然而，Zn/ZSM-5具有更高的初始活性，但因生成Brnsted酸性质子而遭受结焦失活和次级芳香化反应。这些机制和效率的差异对于理解这些催化剂在烷烃转换过程中的工业重要性至关重要。
