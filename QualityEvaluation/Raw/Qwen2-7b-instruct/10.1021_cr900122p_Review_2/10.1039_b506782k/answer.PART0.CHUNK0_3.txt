[1] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 adsorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[2] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K."
[3] "In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."
[4] "Comparison of infrared spectra of ethane adsorbed on zinc- and gallium-modified ZSM-5 indicates that hydrocarbon activation over the charge-compensating reduced cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."
[5] "Reactivity The difference in the mechanism in alkane activation should have direct consequences for the product mixture observed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion."
[6] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."
[7] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits a much higher ethane conversion and the product mixture contains aromatics, mostly benzene."
[8] "This may be primarily attributed to the deactivation of Brnsted acid sites that play an important role in the formation of aromatics and coke."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The differences lie in how these catalysts activate alkanes and the products they generate.

For instance, Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5 exhibit distinct activation mechanisms for ethane. In Zn/ZSM-5, ethane is strongly polarized upon adsorption, leading to heterolytic dissociation into zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon heating. In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 weakly adsorbs ethane, and dissociative ethane adsorption occurs only at high temperatures through oxidative addition, producing ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species. These differences impact the product mixtures observed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, with Ga/ZSM-5 selectively converting ethane into ethylene due to the absence of Brnsted acidity, whereas Zn/ZSM-5 generates aromatics, including benzene, but faces deactivation and coke formation issues.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable chemicals like ethylene and aromatics. However, their performance can be limited by deactivation and coke formation, necessitating careful selection and optimization of catalyst compositions and reaction conditions.

金属基催化剂，如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构以及反应条件显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。这些差异体现在这些催化剂如何激活烷烃及其产生的产物。

例如，Zn/ZSM-5和Ga/ZSM-5在乙烷激活上表现出不同的机制。在Zn/ZSM-5中，乙烷在吸附时被强烈极化，导致加热后发生异裂解生成锌乙基碎片和质子。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5弱吸附乙烷，只有在高温下通过氧化添加进行乙烷吸附，产生乙基和氢化物碎片结合到Ga31物种。这些差异影响了催化热碳氢化合物转化过程中观察到的产品混合物，Ga/ZSM-5选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯，由于缺乏Brnsted酸性，而Zn/ZSM-5则生成芳香族化合物，如苯，但面临着失活和焦炭形成的问题。

这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为有价值的化学品如乙烯和芳香族化合物。然而，它们的性能可能受到失活和焦炭形成的影响，需要仔细选择和优化催化剂组成和反应条件。
