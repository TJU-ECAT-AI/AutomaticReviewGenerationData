The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The differences in the mechanisms of alkane activation over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts highlight how these factors impact the outcomes. Specifically, over Zn/ZSM-5, adsorbed ethane undergoes strong polarizability and heterolytic dissociation, leading to the formation of zinc ethyl fragments and protons. In contrast, ethane adsorption over Ga/ZSM-5 is much weaker, and dissociative adsorption occurs at higher temperatures through oxidative addition, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species. The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation enables the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene. However, Zn/ZSM-5 displays higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity. These differences in mechanisms and efficiency are crucial for understanding the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转换机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。锌改性和镓改性HZSM-5催化剂上的烷烃激活机制的不同突显了这些因素如何影响结果。具体来说，在Zn/ZSM-5上，吸附的乙烷经历强烈的极化和异裂解，导致形成锌乙基碎片和质子。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5上的乙烷吸附要弱得多，并在较高温度下通过氧化添加发生脱附，形成与Ga31物种协调的乙基和氢碎片。Ga/ZSM-5上烷烃激活过程中缺乏Brnsted酸性质子的形成使得乙烷稳定且选择性地转化为乙烯。然而，Zn/ZSM-5具有更高的初始活性，但因生成Brnsted酸性质子而遭受结焦失活和次级芳香化反应。这些机制和效率的差异对于理解这些催化剂在烷烃转换过程中的工业重要性至关重要。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, zinc-modified HZSM-5 catalysts activate ethane through strong polarizability, leading to heterolytic dissociation into zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon heating. In contrast, gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts weakly adsorb ethane, allowing for dissociative ethane adsorption at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to gallium species. These differences in alkane activation mechanisms have direct implications for the types of products formed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, with zinc-modified catalysts favoring aromatics formation and gallium-modified catalysts favoring ethylene production. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to selectively convert alkanes into desired products, depending on the specific catalyst used, thereby optimizing the efficiency and selectivity of chemical processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率产生了显著影响。例如，锌改性HZSM-5催化剂通过强烈的极化作用激活乙烷，导致加热后乙烷异裂为锌乙基碎片和质子。而镓改性HZSM-5催化剂则以较弱的方式吸附乙烷，在高温下进行异裂吸附，产生乙基和氢化物碎片结合到镓物种上。这些不同的烷烃活化机制直接影响了催化碳氢化合物转化过程中产物的类型，锌改性催化剂倾向于形成芳香族化合物，而镓改性催化剂倾向于生成乙烯。这些催化剂在工业中的重要性在于它们能够选择性地将烷烃转化为所需的产品，这取决于所使用的具体催化剂，从而优化化学过程的效率和选择性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, specifically zinc- and gallium-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Zinc-modified zeolites facilitate strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane, leading to heterolytic dissociation into zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon heating. In contrast, gallium-modified zeolites exhibit weak adsorption of ethane, and ethane dissociation occurs via oxidative addition to gallium ions, generating ethyl and hydride fragments. These fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium hydrides upon further heating. The absence of Brnsted acidity in gallium-modified zeolites contributes to the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene, whereas zinc-modified zeolites suffer from deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity, affecting their industrial significance.

金属基催化剂，特别是锌和镓改性的沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率。锌改性沸石使吸附的乙烷具有强烈的极化性，导致加热后发生异裂解，生成锌乙基碎片和质子。相比之下，镓改性沸石表现出对乙烷的弱吸附，乙烷在加热到523K时通过氧化加成到镓离子上进行异裂解，产生乙基和氢化物碎片。这些碎片在进一步加热后分解为乙烯和镓氢化合物。镓改性沸石中缺乏Brnsted酸性有助于稳定且选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯，而锌改性沸石由于生成Brnsted酸性而遭受失活和次级芳构化反应的影响，这影响了它们的工业重要性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The differences lie in how these catalysts activate alkanes and the products they generate.

For instance, Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5 exhibit distinct activation mechanisms for ethane. In Zn/ZSM-5, ethane is strongly polarized upon adsorption, leading to heterolytic dissociation into zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon heating. In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 weakly adsorbs ethane, and dissociative ethane adsorption occurs only at high temperatures through oxidative addition, producing ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species. These differences impact the product mixtures observed during catalytic hydrocarbon conversion, with Ga/ZSM-5 selectively converting ethane into ethylene due to the absence of Brnsted acidity, whereas Zn/ZSM-5 generates aromatics, including benzene, but faces deactivation and coke formation issues.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes into valuable chemicals like ethylene and aromatics. However, their performance can be limited by deactivation and coke formation, necessitating careful selection and optimization of catalyst compositions and reaction conditions.

金属基催化剂，如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构以及反应条件显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。这些差异体现在这些催化剂如何激活烷烃及其产生的产物。

例如，Zn/ZSM-5和Ga/ZSM-5在乙烷激活上表现出不同的机制。在Zn/ZSM-5中，乙烷在吸附时被强烈极化，导致加热后发生异裂解生成锌乙基碎片和质子。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5弱吸附乙烷，只有在高温下通过氧化添加进行乙烷吸附，产生乙基和氢化物碎片结合到Ga31物种。这些差异影响了催化热碳氢化合物转化过程中观察到的产品混合物，Ga/ZSM-5选择性地将乙烷转化为乙烯，由于缺乏Brnsted酸性，而Zn/ZSM-5则生成芳香族化合物，如苯，但面临着失活和焦炭形成的问题。

这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为有价值的化学品如乙烯和芳香族化合物。然而，它们的性能可能受到失活和焦炭形成的影响，需要仔细选择和优化催化剂组成和反应条件。
