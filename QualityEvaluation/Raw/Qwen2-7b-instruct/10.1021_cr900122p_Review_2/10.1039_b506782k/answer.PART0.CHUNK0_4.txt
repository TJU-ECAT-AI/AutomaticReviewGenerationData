The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. This allows for efficient dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation, regenerating Brnsted acid protons upon heating. In contrast, ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5, and hydrocarbon activation occurs via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures. This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments that decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 leads to stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene. Conversely, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。例如，乙烷在Zn/ZSM-5上的室温下强烈吸附，导致碳氢化合物的强极化。这使得通过异裂吸附和脱氢在加热时能够高效地发生，并在加热时再生Brnsted酸性质子。相比之下，在减少的Ga/ZSM-5上，乙烷仅弱吸附，碳氢化合物激活发生在加热到较高温度时通过单价Ga1离子的氧化加成。这导致乙基和氢化物碎片形成，进一步加热分解为乙烯和镓氢化物。在Ga/ZSM-5中缺乏乙烷激活时生成的Brnsted酸性质子导致乙烷稳定且选择性地转化为乙烯。相反，Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的初始活性，但由于生成Brnsted酸性质子而遭受结焦失活和次级芳香化反应。
