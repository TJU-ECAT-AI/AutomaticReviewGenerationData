[1] "Among all the tested catalysts, one of the best is Mo/HZSM-5. The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the cru- cial factors for the catalytic performance [25]."
[2] "The addition of a second metal component also ex- erts influence on the performance of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst as shown in Table 3."
[3] "The nature of carbonaceous deposits and their role in the reaction As we have already pointed out, carbonaceous mate- rials deposit during the methane dehydro-aromatization. This is the main obstacle for better understanding of the reaction and for the development of the process."
[4] "Now it seems that these remarkable differences between methane activation in homogeneous and heteroge- neous catalysis are less pronounced with methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
[5] "Several results showed that most of the Mo located on the external surface of the zeolite af-ter impregnation of ammonium heptamolybdate with HZM-5."
[6] "Does this imply that an acid solution-like environment in solid state under the assistance of TMI is more available for methane activation?"

1. The best catalyst for alkane transformations is Mo/HZSM-5. Its performance depends on the zeolite's structure, acidity, and the state and location of the molybdenum species.
2. Adding a second metal component affects the performance of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts.
3. Carbon deposits form during the process of methane dehydro-aromatization, posing a significant obstacle to understanding and optimizing the reaction.
4. The differences in methane activation between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis are less pronounced in the case of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts.
5. Most of the molybdenum species are located on the external surface of the zeolite after impregnation.
6. The solid-state acid solution provided by the zeolite and the metal modifier might facilitate methane activation.
