<p>Among all the tested catalysts, one of the best is Mo/HZSM-5. The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the crucial factors for the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Optimization of reaction conditions has also been extensively studied. All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere, temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and regeneration, exerted great influences on the catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The interaction between the Mo species and the HZSM-5 is of special significance for the understanding of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. Such an interaction can be addressed in terms of at least two different aspects: the interaction between the Mo species and the framework Al, and the interaction between the Mo species and the acid sites.</p>
<p>The nature of carbonaceous deposits and their role in the reaction is a major obstacle for better understanding of the reaction and for the development of the process. Unfortunately, this topic has not received enough attention to illustrate the mechanism and nature of carbonaceous formation in this area.</p>
<p>It is well accepted that both the metal and the acid sites of a bi-functional catalyst play a crucial role in methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in the absence of oxygen, despite the fact that various active sites and reaction mechanisms were suggested by different research groups.</p>
<p>The real status of the Mo species during the reaction and the role of the Mo species and HZSM-5 zeolite for the elemental reaction pathway of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are of general significance for methane chemistry and for the development of the theory of methane activation.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, by affecting the key factors like the channel structure and acidity of the zeolite support, the valence and location of metal species, and the reaction conditions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their ability to efficiently activate and convert alkanes into desired products under controlled conditions, minimize byproduct formation, and operate at economically viable scales. The interaction between metal species and the zeolite support plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. The nature of carbonaceous deposits during the reaction remains an area of ongoing investigation. Despite the complexity and variability of proposed mechanisms, it is generally accepted that both metal and acid sites of a bi-functional catalyst are essential for the catalytic conversion of methane. Understanding the precise status of metal species and their interaction with the zeolite support during the reaction pathway is vital for advancing methane chemistry and the theoretical understanding of alkane activation.
