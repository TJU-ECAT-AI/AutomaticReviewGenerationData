1. The best catalyst for methane dehydro-aromatization is Mo/HZSM-5. Factors such as the channel structure, acidity of the zeolite, and the valence and location of the molybdenum species play crucial roles in catalytic performance.

2. Adding a second metal component affects the performance of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst.

3. The introduction of Mo species and/or the addition of the second metal component alters the acid sites of the zeolite, reducing the number of strong acid sites and increasing the number of moderate strength acid sites.

4. There are ongoing debates about the mode of methane activation and various active sites and reaction mechanisms have been proposed.

5. Carbonaceous materials accumulate during the methane dehydro-aromatization process, posing obstacles to understanding the reaction and process development.

6. Key research areas for future investigation include understanding the nature of carbonaceous deposits, controlling the location and distribution of molybdenum species, determining the reaction mechanism, exploring methane activation and active sites, and examining the similarities and differences between alkane aromatization and methane aromatization.
