[1] "Among all the tested catalysts, one of the best is Mo/HZSM-5. The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the cru- cial factors for the catalytic performance [25]."
[2] "The addition of a second metal component also ex- erts influence on the performance of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst as shown in Table 3."
[3] "The interaction between the Mo species and HZSM-5 is of special significance for the under- standing of methane dehydro-aromatization over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."
[4] "From the above-mentioned mechanisms suggested by different research groups, we can see that all the above mechanisms, particularly the elementary reac- tion pathways, are speculative."
[5] "Many problems still remain to be solved about this reaction, not only from the point of view of academic research, but also from the point of view of potential industrial utilization of natural gas."

1. The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are critical factors for the catalytic performance of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. The addition of a second metal component also affects the performance.

2. Various factors, including the presence of additional metals, can influence the activity of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts. These factors can be seen from the results listed in Table 3.

3. There is a notable interaction between Mo species and the HZSM-5 zeolite, leading to dispersion of Mo species on the zeolite. This interaction becomes stronger with increasing Mo loading and calcination temperature. At excessively high levels, the Mo species may extract framework Al, forming extraneous Al and Al2(MoO4)3.

4. The suggested mechanisms for the reaction are largely speculative. The precise pathways of the elementary reactions are not definitively known.

5. Numerous challenges persist regarding this reaction, including the understanding of carbon deposits and their role in the reaction, the optimal location and distribution of Mo species, the elucidation of the reaction mechanism, and the efficient management of methane activation and the identification of active sites.

1. HZSM-5沸石的通道结构和酸性，以及钼物种的价态和位置，是Mo/HZSM-5催化剂催化性能的关键因素。添加第二种金属成分也会影响性能。

2. 各种因素，包括额外金属的存在，可以影响Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的活性。这些因素可以从表3列出的结果中看出。

3. 钼物种与HZSM-5沸石之间存在显著相互作用，导致钼物种在沸石上的分散。这种相互作用随钼负载量和煅烧温度的增加而增强。在过高的水平下，钼物种可能会提取框架Al，形成额外的Al和Al2(MoO4)3结晶体。

4. 提议的反应机制大多是推测性的。确切的初级反应路径尚未明确知道。

5. 关于此反应仍然存在许多挑战，包括碳沉积物的性质及其在反应中的角色的理解、钼物种的位置和分布的最佳选择、反应机制的阐明，以及有效管理甲烷激活和识别活性位点。
