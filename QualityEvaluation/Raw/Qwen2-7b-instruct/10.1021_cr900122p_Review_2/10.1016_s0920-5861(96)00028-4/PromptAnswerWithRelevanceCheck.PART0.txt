C-H bond activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.

Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products.

Ga and Zn introduce sites that increase the rate of other elementary steps in dehydrogenation reactions; these steps are associated with the disposal of H-atoms formed in C-H activation steps.

On Ga/H-ZSM5, both turnover rates and aromatics selectivity depend on H2 pressure; they decrease as H2 pressure increases.

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites.

Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity.

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H2).

This removal of H-atoms by the recombinative desorption is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes.
