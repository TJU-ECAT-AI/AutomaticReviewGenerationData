[1] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[2] "These reactions proceed in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal cracking reactions to form methane and ethane."

[3] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."

[4] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."

[5] "Ga and Zn cations within zeolite channels may act as momentary hydrogen acceptors that can dispose of the hydrogen by recombination with H-atoms stabilized by basic framework oxygens in H-ZSM5."

[6] "Ga and Zn species remove H-atoms as H2 and prevent these rehydrogenation reactions."

[7] "Ga and Zn cations introduce sites that increase the rate of other elementary steps in dehydrogenation reactions; these steps are associated with the disposal of H-atoms formed in C-H activation steps."

[8] "Ga species act as 'portholes' for the desorption of H-atoms, but also increase the reverse reaction, the dissociative chemisorption of dihydrogen."

[9] "Ga and Zn cations within zeolite channels may act as momentary hydrogen acceptors that can dispose of the hydrogen by recombination with H-atoms stabilized by basic framework oxygens in H-ZSM5."

[10] "Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity."
