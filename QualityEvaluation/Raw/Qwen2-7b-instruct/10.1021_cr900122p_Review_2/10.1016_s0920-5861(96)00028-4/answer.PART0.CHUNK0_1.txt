[1] "Reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 require the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of the hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions."

[2] "Hydrogen disposal can take place by transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on the surface or by the recombinative desorption to form dihydrogen (H 2)."

[3] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."

[4] "Isotopic exchange experiments suggest that propane aromatization occurs on H-ZSM5 by a complex reaction sequence involving dehydrogenation to propene, rapid oligomerization-cracking of alkene intermediates, and the cyclization and aromatization of these alkenes into stable C 6 + aromatics."

[5] "Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface."

[6] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity."

[7] "Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorption, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D 2 into reaction products."

[8] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."

[9] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the re-combinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

[10] "This removal of H-atoms by the recombinative desorption is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H 2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes."

1. Propane reactions on H-ZSM5 demand activation of C-H bonds and disposal of hydrogen atoms generated during these reactions.

2. Hydrogen disposal can occur through transfer to adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on the surface or through recombinative desorption forming dihydrogen (H 2).

3. Sequential release of several hydrogen atoms during a propane aromatization cycle restricts reaction rate and selectivity on H-ZSM5.

4. Propane aromatization on H-ZSM5 follows a complex sequence involving dehydrogenation to propene, rapid oligomerization-cracking of alkene intermediates, and cyclization and aromatization of these alkenes into stable C 6 + aromatics.

5. Hydrogen is also produced through recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

6. Modifications with exchanged Ga and Zn cations enhance hydrogen disposal, propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity.

7. Isotopic studies reveal that C-H bond activation occurs at comparable rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase chemical propane conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation into reaction products.

8. Ga and Zn sites speed up propene formation by removing hydrogen atoms from acid sites activating C-H bonds, enabling acid sites to cycle without producing cracking products.

9. Ga and Zn function as 'gateways' and catalyze the re-combinative desorption of hydrogen atoms, generated from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (H).

10. This removal of hydrogen atoms by recombinative desorption is desirable for minimizing by-products like methane and ethane and efficiently extracting high-purity H 2 from light alkanes.

1. 丙烷在H-ZSM5上的反应需要激活C-H键并处理由这些反应产生的氢原子。

2. 氢的处理可以发生在吸附的碳氢化合物碎片表面，或者通过重组结合释放形成二氢（H 2）。

3. 丙烷芳香化循环中多个氢原子的连续释放限制了在H-ZSM5上的反应速率和选择性。

4. 丙烷在H-ZSM5上的芳香化遵循一个复杂的序列，包括脱氢到丙烯，快速烯烃中间体的异构化裂解，以及这些烯烃的环化和芳香化成稳定的C 6 +芳香烃。

5. 还有氢通过重组结合释放氢吸附在沸石表面上产生。

6. 通过交换Ga和Zn离子的修改增加了氢的处理、丙烷的周转率和芳基的选择性。

7. 同位素研究表明，C-H键活化在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上以相似的速率发生，但交换的Ga和Zn离子增加了化学丙烷转化、重组结合氢解离和从D 2引入反应产物中的D-原子的速率。

8. Ga和Zn站点加速丙烯形成，通过移除激活C-H键的酸站点的氢原子，使酸站点循环而不产生裂解产品。

9. Ga和Zn功能作为“门户”，催化由酸催化C-H键断裂产生的氢原子的重组结合释放为全部氢（H）。

10. 这种通过重组结合释放去除氢原子的方法有助于减少甲烷和乙烷等副产品的生成，并高效地从轻烷烃中提取高纯度H 2。
