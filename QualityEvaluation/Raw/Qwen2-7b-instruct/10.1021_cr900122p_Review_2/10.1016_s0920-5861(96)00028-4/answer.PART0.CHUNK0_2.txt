C-H bond activation steps are fast and quasi-equilibrated during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.

The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C3+ carbocations.

The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3H8/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn.

Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brönsted acid sites.

Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, and aromatic selectivity.

1. During steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, C-H bond activation steps are fast and quasi-equilibrated.

2. The initial dehydrogenation of propane forms propene, which then undergoes acid-catalyzed reactions within zeolite channels.

3. The release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the reaction rate and selectivity on H-ZSM5.

4. The rate of propene formation is higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but the C-H bond activation rate remains similar.

5. C-H bond activation takes place on Brönsted acid sites on Na-ZSM5.

6. Modifications with Ga and Zn cations enhance hydrogen disposal, propane turnover, and aromatic selectivity.

1. 在H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上进行稳定的丙烷脱氢环二聚化时，C-H键活化步骤快速且接近平衡。

2. 丙烷脱氢形成丙烯，随后在沸石通道中通过聚合或碳正离子的加成进行酸催化反应。

3. 在H-ZSM5上的丙烷脱氢环二聚化过程中，多个H原子的释放限制了反应速率和选择性。

4. Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上的丙烯形成速率高于H-ZSM5，但C-H键活化速率对Ga和Zn的存在依赖较弱。

5. Na-ZSM5上的反应证实C-H键活化发生在Brönsted酸位点上。

6. 通过Ga和Zn的修饰可以增强氢的去除、丙烷转化率和芳香族选择性。
