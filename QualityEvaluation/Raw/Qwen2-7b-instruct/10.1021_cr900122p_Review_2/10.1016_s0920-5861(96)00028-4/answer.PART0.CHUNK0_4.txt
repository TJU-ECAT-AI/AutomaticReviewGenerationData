C-H activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.
Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products.
The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.
In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover.
Ga and Zn species increase the rate of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products.
The rate of C-H bond activation, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and propane chemical conversion have been measured from the rates of isotopic redistribution and chemical conversion during reactions of C3Hs/C3D8 and D2/C3Hs mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.

1. During steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization, the C-H activation steps are quick on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5.

2. Ga and Zn species enhance the rates of propane chemical conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation.

3. The release of multiple H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization cycle restricts the reaction rate and selectivity on H-ZSM5.

4. In situ X-ray absorption studies indicate that Ga and Zn species are located at ion exchange sites as monomeric ions, and they undergo reduction-oxidation cycles during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover.

5. Ga and Zn species boost the rates of propane chemical conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation.
