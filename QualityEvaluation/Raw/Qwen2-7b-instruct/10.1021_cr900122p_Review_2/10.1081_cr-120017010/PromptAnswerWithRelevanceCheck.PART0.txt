<quotes>
[I]. "The production of hydrogen from fossil fuels via steam reforming has been the main source of hydrogen production, but this process requires high temperatures and consumes a large amount of energy."
[II]. "One potential solution is to develop new catalytic processes that allow for hydrogen production at lower temperatures and with higher efficiency."
[III]. "Nonoxidative activation of methane involves the conversion of methane to hydrogen and carbon monoxide without the formation of oxygen-containing products."
[IV]. "Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions."
[V]. "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations."
[VI]. "Factors contributing to their industrial significance include high selectivity, stability under harsh conditions, and the ability to operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to traditional methods."
[VII]. "The efficiency and selectivity of alkane transformations through these catalysts depend on the specific metal species, support materials, and the preparation method of the catalyst."
[VIII]. "For instance, supported vanadium oxides are known for their high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation due to their strong Lewis acidity and ability to facilitate the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide."

1. The nonoxidative activation of methane involves converting methane into hydrogen and carbon monoxide without producing oxygen-containing products. This process is an alternative to traditional methods, aiming to reduce energy consumption and increase efficiency.

2. Metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, are essential in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts' performance is influenced by their composition, structure, and reaction conditions.

3. Factors that contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts include their high selectivity, stability under extreme conditions, and capability to operate at lower temperatures and pressures than conventional techniques.

4. The effectiveness and selectivity of alkane transformations using these catalysts are determined by the specific metal components, supporting materials, and the catalyst preparation method. For example, supported vanadium oxides exhibit high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation due to their strong Lewis acidity and ability to generate hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

1. 甲烷非氧化激活涉及将甲烷转化为氢气和一氧化碳，而不生成氧含量产品。这一过程是传统方法的替代方案，旨在降低能耗并提高效率。

2. 金属基催化剂，如支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，对于烷烃转化至关重要，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。这些催化剂的性能受到其组成、结构和反应条件的影响。

3. 这些催化剂在工业上的显著贡献因素包括高选择性、在恶劣条件下的稳定性以及能够在较低温度和压力下运行的能力，与传统方法相比。

4. 例如，支持的五氧化二钒在氧化脱氢过程中表现出高活性，由于其强路易斯酸性和生成氢气和一氧化碳的能力。烷烃转化的有效性和选择性取决于特定的金属成分、支撑材料和催化剂制备方法。
