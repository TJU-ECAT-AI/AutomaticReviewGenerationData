<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This article discusses the nonoxidative activation of methane, focusing on various aspects such as fundamental surface science studies, low temperature coupling of methane, pyrolysis and high-temperature coupling of methane, production of hydrogen, formation of carbon filaments, synthesis of diamond films, and concluding remarks. It does not, however, delve into the specific composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influencing alkane transformations, nor does it discuss the factors contributing to their industrial significance.
