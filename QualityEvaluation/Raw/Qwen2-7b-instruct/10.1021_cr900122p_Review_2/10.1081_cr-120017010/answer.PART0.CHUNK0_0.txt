1. The nonoxidative activation of methane involves converting methane into hydrogen and carbon monoxide without producing oxygen-containing products. This process is an alternative to traditional methods, aiming to reduce energy consumption and increase efficiency.

2. Metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, are essential in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts' performance is influenced by their composition, structure, and reaction conditions.

3. Factors that contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts include their high selectivity, stability under extreme conditions, and capability to operate at lower temperatures and pressures than conventional techniques.

4. The effectiveness and selectivity of alkane transformations using these catalysts are determined by the specific metal components, supporting materials, and the catalyst preparation method. For example, supported vanadium oxides exhibit high activity in oxidative dehydrogenation due to their strong Lewis acidity and ability to generate hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
