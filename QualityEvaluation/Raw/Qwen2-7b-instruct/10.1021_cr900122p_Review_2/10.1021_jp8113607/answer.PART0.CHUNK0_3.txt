Structure-reactivity relationship for catalytic activity of gallium oxide and sulfide clusters in zeolite influences alkane transformations through specific mechanisms. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in determining the efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include enhanced selectivity, improved stability, and higher activity under optimized conditions.
