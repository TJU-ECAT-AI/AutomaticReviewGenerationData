The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These factors include the specific arrangement of metal atoms within the catalyst, the presence of active sites, the stability under reaction conditions, and the selectivity towards desired products. Industrial significance is attributed to the high conversion rates, product purity, and cost-effectiveness these catalysts offer in chemical processes.
