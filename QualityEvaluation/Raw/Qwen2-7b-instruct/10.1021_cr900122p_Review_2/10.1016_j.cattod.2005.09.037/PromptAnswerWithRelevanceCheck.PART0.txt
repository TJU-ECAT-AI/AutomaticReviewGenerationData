The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, factors such as metal type, support material, and operating conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition) play crucial roles in determining the conversion pathways, selectivity, and product yields. Supported vanadium oxides, for instance, are often employed in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions due to their high reactivity towards alkane molecules, leading to the formation of olefins and aromatics. Metal-exchanged zeolites, on the other hand, offer a heterogeneous catalytic platform that can selectively activate and transform alkanes through the use of zeolite frameworks to control reaction kinetics and product distribution. These catalysts are industrially significant because they enable efficient and selective conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals and fuels, contributing to the sustainability of petrochemical industries.

<p>The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations stabilized in three different clusters (Fig. 1(ac)). Their geometry is similar to that one of a- sites in ZSM-5 zeolite, but the clusters differ in localization of aluminium atoms. The optimized CuO bond lengths obtained by these calculations are summarized in Table 2.</p>
<p>As one could expect, the copper cations are localized in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters more closely to Al atoms.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite of the effective coordination number of Cu+ by the zeolitic oxygen atoms equal to 3, the bond lengths with two oxygen atoms adjacent to the aluminium are somewhat shorter compared with the third CuO bond. In contrast, for the Cu+ZIII cluster the copper cation is very strongly shielded by the surrounding relatively closely located O4, O5 and O7 atoms.</p>

1. The DFT modeling demonstrates that the copper cations in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters are closer to aluminum atoms. This proximity results in slightly shorter CuO bond lengths with the two oxygen atoms next to the aluminum compared to the third CuO bond. In contrast, the Cu+ZIII cluster has a copper cation that is strongly shielded by nearby oxygen atoms O4, O5, and O7.

<p>One can also emphasize that formation of the [Cu+(h2-H2)] adsorption complexes leads to the significant changes in the geometry of the adsorption sites. For both Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters the Cu+ ion partially leaves the initial cationic site upon hydrogen adsorption, while its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2. In contrast,adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ cation in the Cu+ZIII cluster that is strongly shielded with the surrounding lattice oxygens results neither in any significant perturbation of H2 molecule,nor in the change of the adsorption site geometry (Tables 2 and 3).</p>
<p>In the similar way, according to the DFT modelling, H2 adsorption by the bivalent copper in Cu2+Z2 (Fig. 11) cluster also does not lead to any significant changes of this adsorption site in the geometry (Table 2).</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
2. The formation of [Cu+(h2-H2)] complexes causes significant changes in the adsorption site geometry. In Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters, the Cu+ ion moves away from the initial cationic site when hydrogen binds, reducing its coordination number to lattice oxygen atoms to 2. Conversely, in the Cu+ZIII cluster, where the Cu+ ion is strongly shielded by surrounding lattice oxygens, hydrogen adsorption does not significantly alter the H2 molecule or the adsorption site geometry. Similarly, bivalent copper adsorption in the Cu2+Z2 cluster does not lead to substantial geometric changes in the adsorption site (Table 2).

2. 形成[Cu+(h2-H2)]复合物会导致吸附位点几何结构发生显著变化。在Cu+ZI和Cu+ZII簇中，当氢气结合时，Cu+离子会从初始的离子位点移动，其与晶格氧原子的配位数降低至2。相反，在Cu+ZIII簇中，该Cu+离子被周围晶格氧原子强烈屏蔽，氢吸附不会显著改变H2分子或吸附位点几何结构（表2）。同样地，二价铜吸附在Cu2+Z2簇中也不会导致吸附位点的明显几何变化（表2）。

A new insight in the unusual adsorption properties of Cu+ cations in Cu-ZSM-5 zeolite

The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations. The obtained results indicated that in addition to the previously reported strong adsorption of nitrogen, the univalent copper also unusually strongly adsorbs molecular hydrogen and ethane.

Adsorption of hydrogen is the most amazing since the observed low-frequency shifts of the HH stretching vibrations were as high as about 1000 cm1. This is quite different from much weaker H2 perturbation by Cu2+ cations.

Adsorption of ethane by Cu+ ions also resulted in the low-frequency shifts of some of CH IR stretching bands up to 400 cm1.

The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework.

Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals.

The overall yield of Cu+ sites of the strong H2 or N2 adsorption is about twice lower than the total copper content.

During last 20 years, a great number of transition metal complexes containing intact molecular dihydrogen have been reported.

The first examples of alkane coordination by transition metals were reported upon application of the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of the d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W) [38,39].

The coordination of alkanes to M(CO)5 fragment has also been observed by transient absorption technique in solution or in the gas phase in refs. [40 42].

More recently, the coordination of methane by the naked transition metal atoms has been directly observed in the low-temperature matrices.

Experiments on the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal complexes also revealed the formation of alkane complexes as reaction intermediates.

The complexes with light alkanes have been also subjected to theoretical calculations in refs. [37,44], both as intermediates in CH activation, or as the independent entities. However, direct observation of these species has not been reported yet.

The number of sites of strong H2 and N2 adsorption were evaluated from adsorption isotherms of both these gases, which were measured volumetrically at 293 K.

The quantum chemical calculations were carried out within the gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) using the GAUSSIAN-98 program [45].

The calculated adsorption energies were corrected for the zero-point energies (ZPE) obtained from the vibrational mode calculations, whereas the correction for the basis set super-

To investigate the orbital distribution of electrons and to estimate the energies of donoracceptor interactions in the ethane adsorption complexes with Cu+ ions, the population analysis was performed using Natural Bond Orbital method program that has been attached to the GAUSSIAN-98 package.

According to the ref. [52], this method allows a rather reasonable description of different types of interatomic interactions and discrimination of their types, as well as analysis of the orbital populations and orbital energies.

The obtained results indicated that for the Cu/H-ZSM-5red sample the fraction of Cu+ sites strongly adsorbing H2 molecules corresponds to about 0.45 of the total copper content, while for the sample prepared by the high-temperature reaction with CuCl vapour to about 0.37 (see Table 1).

On the other hand, only about twice lower amounts of hydrogen and nitrogen adsorption in comparison with the total copper content, indicate that about one-half of the modifying Cu+ ions are accessible for both N2 and H2 molecules.

Moreover, about 20% of the Cu+ sites of the strong dinitrogen adsorption are inactive with respect to hydrogen adsorption.

This indicates that the Cu+ cations are strongly inhomogeneous and exhibit different adsorption properties.

Such inhomogenity could be explained by different coordination and accessibility or by different binding properties of univalent copper depending on different localization in the ZSM-5 framework.

The results of our DFT modelling explain inhomo- geneity of Cu+ adsorption sites even for the simplest example of a-sites with different localization of aluminum atoms.

These sites certainly correspond only to one of the possibilities of copper localization. However, even this simplest model illustrates the possible origin of inhomogeneity.

We also suggest that the Cu+ sites of the stronger N2 adsorption, which are inactive with respect to adsorbed H2 molecules could be strongly shielded with the surrounding oxygen atoms Cu+ ions.

Most likely, that the band at 4105 cm1 in the DRIFT spectra of hydrogen adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 (Fig. 12(b)) belongs just to such sites.

1. The univalent copper cations in Cu-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibit unusual adsorption properties towards molecular hydrogen and ethane, with low-frequency shifts of the stretching vibrations indicating strong perturbation of these molecules. The DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations support the structure of the adsorption complexes. Electron back donation from the Cu+ ions' dp-orbitals to the s*orbitals of hydrogen and ethane plays a significant role in the bonding.

2. The yield of Cu+ sites strongly adsorbing H2 or N2 is approximately half the total copper content, suggesting strong inhomogeneity in the adsorption properties of the Cu+ cations in the zeolite.

3. The adsorption of ethane by Cu+ ions results in significant low-frequency shifts of CH stretching bands, indicating unusual perturbation of ethane molecules. Theoretical calculations suggest the formation of s-type adsorption complexes with Cu+ ions.

4. The inhomogeneity of Cu+ adsorption sites is explained by differences in coordination, accessibility, and binding properties of the univalent copper ions based on their localization in the zeolite framework. Some Cu+ sites with strong N2 adsorption capabilities are inactive for hydrogen adsorption.

5. The band at 4105 cm1 in the DRIFT spectra of hydrogen adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 likely corresponds to Cu+ sites that are active for N2 adsorption but inactive for hydrogen adsorption.

The adsorption of ethane onto Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite leads to significant perturbation of the adsorbed molecules, evidenced by a substantial red shift in the CH stretching bands. This unique behavior has not been previously observed in ethane adsorption on any other cationic zeolite or oxide form. The conclusion is that the unusual properties of the adsorbed ethane molecules arise from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper ions, marking the first direct DRIFTS observation of stable alkane transition metal complexes.
