<p>Despite numerous observations of H2 s-complexes [36,37], no similar series of the stable complexes with transition metals have been previously reported for light alkanes. All of the alkane complexes so far detected are unstable at room temperature and rather specific methods are required for their preparation and detection.</p>
<p>Indeed, the first examples of alkane coordination by transition metals were reported upon application of the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of the d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W) [38,39]. The coordination of alkanes to M(CO)5 fragment has also been observed by transient absorption technique in solution or in the gas phase in refs. [40 42]. More recently, the coordination of methane by the naked transition metal atoms has been directly observed in the low-temperature matrices. Experiments on the oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal complexes also revealed the formation of alkane complexes as reaction intermediates [37,43]. The complexes with light alkanes have been also subjected to theoretical calculations in refs. [37,44], both as intermediates in CH activation, or as the independent entities. However, direct observation of these species has not been reported yet.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, factors such as metal type, support material, and operating conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition) play crucial roles in determining the conversion pathways, selectivity, and product yields. Supported vanadium oxides, for instance, are often employed in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions due to their high reactivity towards alkane molecules, leading to the formation of olefins and aromatics. Metal-exchanged zeolites, on the other hand, offer a heterogeneous catalytic platform that can selectively activate and transform alkanes through the use of zeolite frameworks to control reaction kinetics and product distribution. These catalysts are industrially significant because they enable efficient and selective conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals and fuels, contributing to the sustainability of petrochemical industries.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中，金属类型、支撑材料以及操作条件（如温度、压力和原料组成）对反应路径、选择性和产物产率起着关键作用。例如，支持的钒氧化物通常用于氧化脱氢反应，由于其对烷烃分子的高活性，导致形成烯烃和芳香族化合物。而金属交换沸石提供了一个异相催化平台，通过利用沸石框架来控制反应动力学和产品分布，实现选择性地激活和转化烷烃。这些催化剂在工业上非常重要，因为它们能够高效且选择性地将烃类转化为有价值的化学品和燃料，为石油化学行业的可持续性做出了贡献。
