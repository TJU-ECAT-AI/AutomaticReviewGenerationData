<p>The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations stabilized in three different clusters (Fig. 1(ac)). Their geometry is similar to that one of a- sites in ZSM-5 zeolite, but the clusters differ in localization of aluminium atoms. The optimized CuO bond lengths obtained by these calculations are summarized in Table 2.</p>
<p>As one could expect, the copper cations are localized in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters more closely to Al atoms.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite of the effective coordination number of Cu+ by the zeolitic oxygen atoms equal to 3, the bond lengths with two oxygen atoms adjacent to the aluminium are somewhat shorter compared with the third CuO bond. In contrast, for the Cu+ZIII cluster the copper cation is very strongly shielded by the surrounding relatively closely located O4, O5 and O7 atoms.</p>

1. The DFT modeling demonstrates that the copper cations in Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters are closer to aluminum atoms. This proximity results in slightly shorter CuO bond lengths with the two oxygen atoms next to the aluminum compared to the third CuO bond. In contrast, the Cu+ZIII cluster has a copper cation that is strongly shielded by nearby oxygen atoms O4, O5, and O7.

1. DFT模拟显示，Cu+ZI和Cu+ZII簇中的铜离子靠近铝原子。这种接近导致与相邻铝原子的两个氧原子之间的CuO键长略短于第三个CuO键。相比之下，Cu+ZIII簇中的铜离子被附近的氧原子O4、O5和O7强烈屏蔽。

<p>One can also emphasize that formation of the [Cu+(h2-H2)] adsorption complexes leads to the significant changes in the geometry of the adsorption sites. For both Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters the Cu+ ion partially leaves the initial cationic site upon hydrogen adsorption, while its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2. In contrast,adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ cation in the Cu+ZIII cluster that is strongly shielded with the surrounding lattice oxygens results neither in any significant perturbation of H2 molecule,nor in the change of the adsorption site geometry (Tables 2 and 3).</p>
<p>In the similar way, according to the DFT modelling, H2 adsorption by the bivalent copper in Cu2+Z2 (Fig. 11) cluster also does not lead to any significant changes of this adsorption site in the geometry (Table 2).</p>

2. The formation of [Cu+(h2-H2)] complexes causes significant changes in the adsorption site geometry. In Cu+ZI and Cu+ZII clusters, the Cu+ ion moves away from the initial cationic site when hydrogen binds, reducing its coordination number to lattice oxygen atoms to 2. Conversely, in the Cu+ZIII cluster, where the Cu+ ion is strongly shielded by surrounding lattice oxygens, hydrogen adsorption does not significantly alter the H2 molecule or the adsorption site geometry. Similarly, bivalent copper adsorption in the Cu2+Z2 cluster does not lead to substantial geometric changes in the adsorption site (Table 2).

2. 形成[Cu+(h2-H2)]复合物会导致吸附位点几何结构发生显著变化。在Cu+ZI和Cu+ZII簇中，当氢气结合时，Cu+离子会从初始的离子位点移动，其与晶格氧原子的配位数降低至2。相反，在Cu+ZIII簇中，该Cu+离子被周围晶格氧原子强烈屏蔽，氢吸附不会显著改变H2分子或吸附位点几何结构（表2）。同样地，二价铜吸附在Cu2+Z2簇中也不会导致吸附位点的明显几何变化（表2）。
