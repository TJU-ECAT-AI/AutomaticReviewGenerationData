[1] "The summary of the above-discussed experimental data indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption properties."
[2] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules,which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."
[3] "It was also shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites of the strong N2 adsorption."
[4] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."
[5] "It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide."
[6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

1. The experimental data suggests that Cu+ containing ZSM-5 zeolites display similar adsorption properties regardless of how they were prepared.
2. The adsorption of hydrogen by certain Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 causes a strong perturbation of the adsorbed molecules, evidenced by a significant low-frequency shift in the corresponding HH stretching frequencies.
3. The number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing molecular hydrogen is less than those strongly adsorbing nitrogen molecules.
4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling of hydrogen adsorption by Cu+ cations at the a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite helped in better interpretation of experimental infrared (IR) data.
5. Adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions leads to a very strong perturbation of the adsorbed molecules, causing a significant red-shift in the CH stretching bands.
6. The unusual properties of adsorbed ethane molecules are attributed to the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.

1. 上述讨论的实验数据表明，含Cu+的ZSM-5沸石无论制备方法如何，表现出相似的吸附性质。
2. CuZSM-5中的某些Cu+离子吸附氢气时，会引发吸附分子的强烈扰动，这从相应的HH拉伸频率的显著低频位移中可以明显看出。
3. 强烈吸附分子氢的Cu+离子数量少于强烈吸附氮分子的数量。
4. 密度泛函理论（DFT）对Cu+离子在ZSM-5沸石a位点的氢吸附进行建模，有助于更准确地解释实验红外（IR）数据。
5. 改性后的ZSM-5沸石与Cu+离子结合，吸附乙烷导致吸附分子发生强烈的扰动，引起CH拉伸波段的显著红移。
6. 乙烷分子的异常吸附特性归因于交换的单电子铜离子形成的强s型吸附复合物。
