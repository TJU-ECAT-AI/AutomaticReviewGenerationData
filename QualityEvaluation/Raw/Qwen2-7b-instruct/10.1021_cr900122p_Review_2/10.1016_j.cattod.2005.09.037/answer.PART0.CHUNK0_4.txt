<p>It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5 zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide. It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations.</p>

The adsorption of ethane onto Cu+-modified ZSM-5 zeolite leads to significant perturbation of the adsorbed molecules, evidenced by a substantial red shift in the CH stretching bands. This unique behavior has not been previously observed in ethane adsorption on any other cationic zeolite or oxide form. The conclusion is that the unusual properties of the adsorbed ethane molecules arise from the formation of strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper ions, marking the first direct DRIFTS observation of stable alkane transition metal complexes.

改性后的Cu+-负载型ZSM-5沸石对乙烷的吸附导致吸附分子发生显著扰动，表现为CH伸缩振动峰的明显红移。这一独特现象在任何其他类型的阳离子沸石或氧化物上均未被观察到。研究结果表明，吸附乙烷分子的异常性质源自与交换得到的一价铜离子形成的强s型吸附复合物，这是首次直接通过DRIFTS技术观察到稳定的烷烃过渡金属复合物。
