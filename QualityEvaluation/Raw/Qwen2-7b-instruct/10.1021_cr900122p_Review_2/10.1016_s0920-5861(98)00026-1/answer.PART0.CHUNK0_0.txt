2.3. Stoichiometric reactions of O 2 Reactivity of O 2 species is also very high, though much inferior to O. As for the isotope exchange, O 2 is only capable of exchanging places with the gas phase molecules [7]:
16O
2 s 18O2  18O 2 s 16O2 (6) There is no isotope scrambling, and identity of the exchanged particles is preserved.
On ZnO and V2O5/SiO2 [16], O 2 ion slowly reacts with propylene at room temperature, but gives no interaction with CO, H2 and C2H4. On MgO O 2 radical apparently is more reactive [17]. At 1758C,the reaction with propylene proceeds to completion within 2 h. Acetaldehyde and methanol are detected in the products. Authors [17] believe that the rst step of the reaction is hydrogen abstraction leading to allyl radical:
CH2CH  CH3  O
2 ! CH2CHCH2  HO
2 (7) Then the allyl radical probably reacts with surface oxygen ions to form acetate and formate ions.

The oxygen dioxide (O2) species reacts with hydrocarbons at a slower rate compared to the O radical. On ZnO and V2O5/SiO2, O2 ion reacts with propylene at room temperature, but does not interact with CO, H2, and C2H4. On MgO, the O2 radical appears to be more reactive, reacting with propylene at 175°C to produce acetaldehyde and methanol in a two-hour period. The first step of this reaction involves hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of an allyl radical, which then likely reacts with surface oxygen ions to produce acetate and formate ions.

氧二酸（O2）物种与烃类反应的速度较慢，与O自由基相比。在ZnO和V2O5/SiO2上，O2离子在室温下与丙烯反应，但不与CO、H2和C2H4相互作用。在MgO上，O2自由基似乎更活跃，在175°C下与丙烯反应，产生乙醛和甲醇，整个过程在两小时内完成。该反应的第一步涉及氢原子摘取，形成一个丙烯基自由基，然后很可能会与表面氧离子反应生成乙酸盐和碳酸盐。

3.3. Role of oxygen diffusion A number of theories explaining selectivity of oxide catalysts are based on the important role of the surface and bulk oxygen diffusion [37,4043]. It is assumed that oxygen is supplied to the surface sites not directly from the gas phase, but via volume diffusion [41] or diffusion from the other surface sites. A consistent remote control concept was proposed by Delmon and coworkers to explain a synergetic effect in the oxida- tion of olens over multicomponent catalysts [43].

Several theories explaining the selectivity of oxide catalysts emphasize the significant role of surface and bulk oxygen diffusion [37,4043]. Oxygen is thought to be supplied to the surface sites not directly from the gas phase, but through volume diffusion [41] or diffusion from other surface sites. Delmon and colleagues proposed a coherent remote control concept to elucidate the synergistic effect in the oxidation of olefins over multicomponent catalysts [43].

几个理论解释了氧化物催化剂的选择性，强调了表面和内部氧气扩散的重要作用[37,4043]。氧气被认为不是直接从气相供应到表面位点，而是通过体积扩散[41]或从其他表面位点扩散。Delmon及其同事提出了一种一致的远程控制概念来解释多组分催化剂上烯烃氧化的协同效应[43]。

4.1. Formation of a-oxygen. The role of iron Authors of the rst papers discovering a-oxygen formation at N2O decomposition related this phenomen- on either to the presence of a single electron donor acceptor sites in ZSM-5 zeolite [55] or to the admix- ture of transition metals [56]. Later, a hypothesis was also suggested [57] to correlate a-oxygen with coor- dinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms of the zeolite (Lewis acid sites). Detailed studies on the meachanism of N2O decomposition performed over ZSM-5 zeolites [58] and their ferrosilicate analogs [53] have shown that formation of a-oxygen relates to the presence of iron.

The initial papers describing the formation of a-oxygen during N2O decomposition linked this phenomenon to the presence of a single electron donor-acceptor site in ZSM-5 zeolite [55] or to the mixture of transition metals [56]. Later, it was hypothesized [57] that a-oxygen correlates with coordinately unsaturated aluminum atoms in the zeolite (Lewis acid sites). In-depth studies of N2O decomposition mechanisms over ZSM-5 zeolites [58] and their ferrosilicate counterparts [53] revealed that the formation of a-oxygen is associated with the presence of iron.

5.3.1. Location of a-sites The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [8487] and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intra- crystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface of zeolite crystals.
Which of these iron states form a-sites is a question of great importance.

6. Comparison of Oa with other species of surface oxygen In the previous sections of the paper, we have seen that there are several types of oxygen species that can exist on the surface. Some of them have been experi- mentally studied, while the others are hypothetical and cannot be observed directly. It is of interest to compare a-oxygen with well studied O and O 2 radicals that were discussed earlier. The goal of such a comparison would be to nd out if Oa is in fact a new species or identical to a known one.
