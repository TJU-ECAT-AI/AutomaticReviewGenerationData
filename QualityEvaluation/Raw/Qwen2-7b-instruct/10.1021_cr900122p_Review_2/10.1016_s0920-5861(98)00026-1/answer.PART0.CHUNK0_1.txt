[1] "The main reason for the limited use of oxidation catalysis in organic synthesis is the difficulty of finding selective catalysts. A selective catalyst is supposed to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by generating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and acti- vate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way. Optimization of these two functions is a difficult problem, since one cannot tune them independently by varying chemical composition of the catalysts."
[2] "Attempts to understand the mechanism and to model unique MO functions are hindered by the inability of artificial systems to provide such a powerful oxygen activation coupled with the high selectivity."
[3] "New concepts in this field are discussed in other reviews published in this issue."
[4] "As one will see, such processes are becoming closer to reality and one of them is at the commercial development stage."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations by affecting their ability to activate oxygen and selectively transform alkane molecules. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include their capacity to perform dual functions: activating oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species and activating alkane molecules to direct the desired oxidation pathway. The optimization of these functions is challenging due to the interdependence of the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity. Advanced catalysts like those in the FeZSM-5 system can mimic the high reactivity and selectivity of biological monooxygenases, offering new opportunities for practical applications. The commercial development of such catalysts for alkane transformations is progressing, making these processes increasingly viable for industrial use.
