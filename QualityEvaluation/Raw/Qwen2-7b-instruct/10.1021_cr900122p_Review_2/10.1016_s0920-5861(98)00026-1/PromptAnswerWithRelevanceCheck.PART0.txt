2.3. Stoichiometric reactions of O 2 Reactivity of O 2 species is also very high, though much inferior to O. As for the isotope exchange, O 2 is only capable of exchanging places with the gas phase molecules [7]:
16O
2 s 18O2  18O 2 s 16O2 (6) There is no isotope scrambling, and identity of the exchanged particles is preserved.
On ZnO and V2O5/SiO2 [16], O 2 ion slowly reacts with propylene at room temperature, but gives no interaction with CO, H2 and C2H4. On MgO O 2 radical apparently is more reactive [17]. At 1758C,the reaction with propylene proceeds to completion within 2 h. Acetaldehyde and methanol are detected in the products. Authors [17] believe that the rst step of the reaction is hydrogen abstraction leading to allyl radical:
CH2CH  CH3  O
2 ! CH2CHCH2  HO
2 (7) Then the allyl radical probably reacts with surface oxygen ions to form acetate and formate ions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxygen dioxide (O2) species reacts with hydrocarbons at a slower rate compared to the O radical. On ZnO and V2O5/SiO2, O2 ion reacts with propylene at room temperature, but does not interact with CO, H2, and C2H4. On MgO, the O2 radical appears to be more reactive, reacting with propylene at 175°C to produce acetaldehyde and methanol in a two-hour period. The first step of this reaction involves hydrogen abstraction, leading to the formation of an allyl radical, which then likely reacts with surface oxygen ions to produce acetate and formate ions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氧二酸（O2）物种与烃类反应的速度较慢，与O自由基相比。在ZnO和V2O5/SiO2上，O2离子在室温下与丙烯反应，但不与CO、H2和C2H4相互作用。在MgO上，O2自由基似乎更活跃，在175°C下与丙烯反应，产生乙醛和甲醇，整个过程在两小时内完成。该反应的第一步涉及氢原子摘取，形成一个丙烯基自由基，然后很可能会与表面氧离子反应生成乙酸盐和碳酸盐。

3.3. Role of oxygen diffusion A number of theories explaining selectivity of oxide catalysts are based on the important role of the surface and bulk oxygen diffusion [37,4043]. It is assumed that oxygen is supplied to the surface sites not directly from the gas phase, but via volume diffusion [41] or diffusion from the other surface sites. A consistent remote control concept was proposed by Delmon and coworkers to explain a synergetic effect in the oxida- tion of olens over multicomponent catalysts [43].

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Several theories explaining the selectivity of oxide catalysts emphasize the significant role of surface and bulk oxygen diffusion [37,4043]. Oxygen is thought to be supplied to the surface sites not directly from the gas phase, but through volume diffusion [41] or diffusion from other surface sites. Delmon and colleagues proposed a coherent remote control concept to elucidate the synergistic effect in the oxidation of olefins over multicomponent catalysts [43].

4.1. Formation of a-oxygen. The role of iron Authors of the rst papers discovering a-oxygen formation at N2O decomposition related this phenomen- on either to the presence of a single electron donor acceptor sites in ZSM-5 zeolite [55] or to the admix- ture of transition metals [56]. Later, a hypothesis was also suggested [57] to correlate a-oxygen with coor- dinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms of the zeolite (Lewis acid sites). Detailed studies on the meachanism of N2O decomposition performed over ZSM-5 zeolites [58] and their ferrosilicate analogs [53] have shown that formation of a-oxygen relates to the presence of iron.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The initial papers describing the formation of a-oxygen during N2O decomposition linked this phenomenon to the presence of a single electron donor-acceptor site in ZSM-5 zeolite [55] or to the mixture of transition metals [56]. Later, it was hypothesized [57] that a-oxygen correlates with coordinately unsaturated aluminum atoms in the zeolite (Lewis acid sites). In-depth studies of N2O decomposition mechanisms over ZSM-5 zeolites [58] and their ferrosilicate counterparts [53] revealed that the formation of a-oxygen is associated with the presence of iron.

最早描述N2O分解过程中形成a-oxygen现象的论文将其归因于ZSM-5沸石中单电子供体-受体位点的存在[55]或过渡金属混合[56]。后来有人假设[57]，a-oxygen与沸石中的配位不饱和铝原子（路易斯酸位点）有关。对ZSM-5沸石[58]及其铁硅酸盐同系物[53]的深度研究显示，a-oxygen的形成与铁的存在相关联。

6. Comparison of Oa with other species of surface oxygen In the previous sections of the paper, we have seen that there are several types of oxygen species that can exist on the surface. Some of them have been experi- mentally studied, while the others are hypothetical and cannot be observed directly.

[1] "The main reason for the limited use of oxidation catalysis in organic synthesis is the difficulty of finding selective catalysts. A selective catalyst is supposed to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by generating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and acti- vate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way. Optimization of these two functions is a difficult problem, since one cannot tune them independently by varying chemical composition of the catalysts."
[2] "Attempts to understand the mechanism and to model unique MO functions are hindered by the inability of artificial systems to provide such a powerful oxygen activation coupled with the high selectivity."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Selective catalysts are essential as they must activate oxygen to produce species of appropriate reactivity and activate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way. The difficulty in finding such catalysts stems from the inherent trade-off between activity and selectivity. The paper highlights how natural enzymes, such as monooxygenases, can perform oxidative transformations efficiently in a single step, which is a significant challenge for chemists to mimic artificially. The unique ability of monooxygenases to activate oxygen and perform selective oxidation is due to their specific structural features, which are not easily replicated in artificial systems. The paper introduces a new concept based on biomimetic strategy utilizing iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix to generate 'a-oxygen'. This species is remarkable for its high reactivity and selectivity, closely resembling the active oxygen of monooxygenases. The presence of a zeolite matrix in the catalyst provides steric restrictions around the active sites, contributing to the high selectivity of the process. The temperature range in which the high selectivity is maintained spans from room temperature to 600°C, showcasing the versatility of this catalytic system. The industrial significance of such catalysts lies in their potential to enable more efficient and selective alkane transformations, particularly in the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, a process that could replace the traditional three-stage cumene method. The commercial development of this new process, which utilizes waste N2O, presents a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative, aligning with the growing demand for environmentally friendly technologies. The paper also emphasizes the importance of understanding the structure and reactivity of active oxygen species on the surface of oxide catalysts, which is crucial for optimizing the design of catalysts for various oxidation processes.
