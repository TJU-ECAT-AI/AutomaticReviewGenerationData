[2] "First of all, this is true for the reactions of oxidative hydroxylation of hydrocarbons, many of which are carried out in industry via complex multi-stage processes sometimes involving chemically illogical steps."

[3] "The main reason for the limited use of oxidation catalysis in organic synthesis is the difficulty of finding selective catalysts. A selective catalyst is supposed to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by generating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and acti- vate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way."

[4] "Reactions in the liquid phase are outside of our consideration. New concepts in this field are discussed in other reviews published in this issue."

[5] "This concept is related to the remarkable species of oxygen (called a-oxygen) generated on iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix, which in many aspects resembles the active oxygen of MO."

[6] "As one will see, such processes are becoming closer to reality and one of them is at the commercial development stage."

[7] "At the same time, natural enzymes monooxygenases (MO) can easily effect these transformations in a single step [3] (to the continuous envy of chemists)."

[8] "Nature rejected the idea of activation of the organic molecules, instead concentrating its skills on the activation of oxygen."

[9] "Attempts to understand the mechanism and to model unique MO functions are hindered by the inability of artificial systems to provide such a powerful oxygen activation coupled with the high selectivity."

[10] "This paper considers active oxygen species on the surface of oxide catalysts as well as their role in the gas-phase partial oxidation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Selective catalysts are essential as they must activate oxygen to produce species of appropriate reactivity and activate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way. The difficulty in finding such catalysts stems from the inherent trade-off between activity and selectivity. The paper highlights how natural enzymes, such as monooxygenases, can perform oxidative transformations efficiently in a single step, which is a significant challenge for chemists to mimic artificially. The unique ability of monooxygenases to activate oxygen and perform selective oxidation is due to their specific structural features, which are not easily replicated in artificial systems. The paper introduces a new concept based on biomimetic strategy utilizing iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix to generate 'a-oxygen'. This species is remarkable for its high reactivity and selectivity, closely resembling the active oxygen of monooxygenases. The presence of a zeolite matrix in the catalyst provides steric restrictions around the active sites, contributing to the high selectivity of the process. The temperature range in which the high selectivity is maintained spans from room temperature to 600°C, showcasing the versatility of this catalytic system. The industrial significance of such catalysts lies in their potential to enable more efficient and selective alkane transformations, particularly in the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, a process that could replace the traditional three-stage cumene method. The commercial development of this new process, which utilizes waste N2O, presents a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative, aligning with the growing demand for environmentally friendly technologies. The paper also emphasizes the importance of understanding the structure and reactivity of active oxygen species on the surface of oxide catalysts, which is crucial for optimizing the design of catalysts for various oxidation processes.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持的五氧化二钒和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化机制和效率产生了重大影响，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。选择性催化剂至关重要，因为它们需要激活氧气生成具有适当活性的氧物种，并激活起始材料以引导氧化向期望方向进行。寻找这些催化剂的困难在于活动性和选择性之间的固有折衷。论文强调了自然酶，如单氧酶，可以有效地在单一步骤中执行氧化转换，这是化学家难以模仿的人工系统。单氧酶能够激活氧气并进行选择性氧化的独特能力归因于它们的具体结构特征，这些特征在人工系统中难以复制。论文引入了一种基于生物模拟策略的新概念，利用铁复合物在ZSM-5沸石矩阵中的生成'a-oxygen'。这种物种因其高活性和选择性而显着，与单氧酶的活性氧非常相似。在催化剂中存在的沸石矩阵提供了活性位点周围的空间限制，从而增加了过程的选择性。该温度范围在维持高选择性时从室温到600°C，展示了这种催化系统的灵活性。工业意义在于此类催化剂有可能使烷烃转化更加高效和选择性，特别是直接氧化苯为苯酚的过程，这可以取代传统的三阶段cumene方法。新工艺的商业开发，利用废氮氧化物，提供了一种可持续且环保的替代方案，符合日益增长的环境友好型技术需求。论文还强调了理解表面氧化物催化剂上活性氧物种的结构和反应性的关键性，这对于优化各种氧化过程的设计至关重要。
