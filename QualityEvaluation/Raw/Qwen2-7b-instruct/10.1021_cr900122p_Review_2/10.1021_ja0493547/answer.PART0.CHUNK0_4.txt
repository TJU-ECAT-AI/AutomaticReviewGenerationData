1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.
2. Industrial significance of these catalysts is largely attributed to their ability to enhance the selectivity, activity, and stability during alkane transformations, leading to higher yields of desired products and reduced byproducts.
