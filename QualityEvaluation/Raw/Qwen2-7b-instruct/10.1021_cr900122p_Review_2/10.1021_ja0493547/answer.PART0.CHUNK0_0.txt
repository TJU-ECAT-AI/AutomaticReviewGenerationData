The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include high selectivity, good stability, and efficient utilization of reactants under mild conditions. These catalysts enable alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, which are crucial for the production of valuable chemical intermediates and fuels.
