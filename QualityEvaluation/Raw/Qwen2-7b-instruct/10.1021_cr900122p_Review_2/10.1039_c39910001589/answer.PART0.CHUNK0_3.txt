[1] "A great deal of interest is shown today in the activation of methane and higher alkanes."
[2] "The first example of an intermolecular alkane activation reaction is the methyl exchange with methane in a lutetium complex, Scheme 1.2"
[3] "Reaction of tetraneopentylzirconium, ZrNp4, with the surface of a silica, previously dehydroxylated at 773 K, leads to a well-defined3 surface complex,- SiOZrNp3, 1, eqn. (1)."
[4] "This supported zirconium hydride, 2, [Zr],-H, reacts with cyclooctane at room temperature to form a Zr-cyclooctyl surface complex, eqn. (2)."
[5] "Surprisingly, this supported [Zr],-H 2 under moderate conditions [p(CH4) 5.3 x 104 Pa; T 423 K] is also reactive towards methane, eqn. (4)."
