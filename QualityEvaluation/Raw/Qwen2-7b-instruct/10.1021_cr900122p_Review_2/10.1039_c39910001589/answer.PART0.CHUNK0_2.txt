[1] "A great deal of interest is shown today in the activation of methane and higher alkanes."
[2] "The first example of an intermolecular alkane activation reaction is the methyl exchange with methane in a lutetium complex, Scheme 1.2"
[3] "Cp2LuCH3 + 13CH4 + Cp2Lu13CH3 + CH4 Scheme 1 1"
[4] "Support for reaction (2) is given by [Zr],-H + cyclooctane + [Zr],-cyclooctyl + H2 (2)"
[5] "Evidence for reaction (4) comes from the following data: (i) Upon introduction of CH4 on 2 at 423 K, the intensity of the v(Zr-H) band decreases."
[6] "To our knowledge, no reaction of intermolecular alkane activation has previously been reported either on a molecular- or on a grafted-zirconium complex."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The increased electrophilicity of the metal center due to the stabilization of an 8e-Zr by surface siloxy ligands allows for the activation of alkane C-H bonds. The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to facilitate efficient alkane transformations under moderate conditions, leading to the production of valuable chemicals like cyclooctanal and methanol. The enhanced electrophilicity of the zirconium center, facilitated by the silica surface, enables the reaction of C-H activation of alkanes, which is not commonly observed in molecular or grafted-zirconium complexes. This process is particularly advantageous for the selective production of functionalized alkenes and alcohols from methane and higher alkanes, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional petrochemical routes.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。金属中心的电负性增加得益于表面硅氧烷配体对8e-Zr的稳定化，这允许烷烃C-H键的激活。这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够在温和条件下有效促进烷烃转换，产生有价值的化学品如环辛醇和甲醇。由于表面硅氧烷的增强作用，锆中心的电负性得到提高，从而使得烷烃C-H键的活化成为可能，这是在分子或接枝的锆复合物中不常观察到的过程。这一过程特别有利于从甲烷和更高碳数的烷烃选择性生产功能化的烯烃和醇，提供了一种可持续的替代传统石油化学路线的方法。
