"This supported zirconium hydride, 2, [Zr],-H, reacts with cyclooctane at room temperature to form a Zr-cyclooctyl surface complex, eqn. (2)."
"Upon introduction of CH4 on 2 at 423 K, the intensity of the v(Zr-H) band decreases."
"Molecular hydrogen is formed during this interaction."
"Analysis by mass spectrometry shows that subsequent hydrolysis with D 2 0 (2.7 x lo3 Pa) liberates exclusively CH3D, eqn. (5)."
"To our knowledge, no reaction of intermolecular alkane activation has previously been reported either on a molecular- or on a grafted-zirconium complex."
