[1] "A great deal of interest is shown today in the activation of methane and higher alkanes."
[2] "A common feature of these complexes is that the metal is in its highest oxidation state; it therefore, has a do electron configuration and is consequently highly electrophilic."
[3] "This supported [Zr],-H 2 under moderate conditions [p(CH4) 5.3 x 104 Pa; T 423 K] is also reactive towards methane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, the highest oxidation state of the metal in these complexes contributes to their high electrophilicity, which facilitates the activation of methane and higher alkanes. In particular, the supported zirconium hydride complex demonstrates reactivity towards methane under moderate conditions, showcasing the enhanced electrophilicity of the metal center due to stabilization by the surface siloxy ligands.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和分子交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。例如，这些复合材料中金属处于最高氧化态的特点，导致它们具有高亲电性，从而促进甲烷和更高烷烃的活化。特别是，支持的锆氢化物复合材料在温和条件下表现出对甲烷的反应活性，这归因于表面硅氧烷配体对金属中心稳定性的增强，从而提高了其亲电性。
