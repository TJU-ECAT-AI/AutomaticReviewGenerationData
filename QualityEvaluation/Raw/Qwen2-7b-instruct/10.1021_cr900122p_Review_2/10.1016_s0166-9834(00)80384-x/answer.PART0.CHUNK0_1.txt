[1] "The conversion of light (C, to C,) alkanes to aromatics,chiefly benzene,toluene and xylenes (BTX), can be accomplished using zeolites of the ZSM-5 type."
[2] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate,such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."
[3] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane,n-butane and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity. i-Butane is the most reactive of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen."
[4] "However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity."
[5] "It was found that the incorporation of zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 had a similar beneficial effect on the selectivity to BTX from propane (Fig. 2)."

The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics, primarily benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX), can be facilitated through the use of ZSM-5 zeolites. When propane is utilized as the reactant under conditions of 500°C and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be enhanced to approximately 40-45% following treatment of the base zeolite with zinc or gallium nitrate solutions, leading to a final content of around 1.0 mass-% of zinc or gallium. In a comparative analysis of propane, n-butane, and isobutane conversions over Zn-ZSM-5, it was observed that the alkanes exhibit varying degrees of activity and BTX selectivity. Among these, isobutane demonstrates the highest reactivity and yields the greatest percentage of hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. However, it exhibits the lowest BTX selectivity. Incorporating zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 catalysts has been found to similarly improve the BTX selectivity for propane conversion.

轻烷烃转化为芳烃，主要是苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX），可以通过使用ZSM-5沸石实现。当丙烷作为反应物在500°C和0.1 MPa下使用时，在基质沸石上用锌或镓硝酸盐溶液处理后，可以将BTX选择性提高到约40-45%，此时锌或镓的最终含量约为1.0质量-%。在对丙烷、正丁烷和异丁烷在Zn-ZSM-5上的转化进行比较分析时，发现这些烷烃在活性和BTX选择性方面存在差异。其中，异丁烷表现出最高的反应性，并且产生氢气的最高百分比回收。然而，它显示出最低的BTX选择性。将锌或镓引入H-ZSM-5催化剂中已被发现可以同样提高丙烷转化的BTX选择性。
