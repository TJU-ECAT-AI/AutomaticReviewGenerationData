[M.S. SCURRELL]
"The conversion of light (C, to C,) alkanes to aromatics, chiefly benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX), can be accomplished using zeolites of the ZSM-5 type. The conversion to aromatics is not completely selective. Light alkenes, the probable reaction intermediates, together with light alkanes, are formed in addition to the BTX components."

[ABSTRACT]
"It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 500°C and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[EXPERIMENTAL]
"Zinc or gallium was introduced by treating the H-ZSM-5 with aqueous solutions of the respective metal nitrate. The final zinc or gallium contents of the catalysts were typically up to ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[RESULTS AND DISCUSSION]
"It was found that the incorporation of zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 had a similar beneficial effect on the selectivity to BTX from propane (Fig. 2)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of metal components, specifically zinc and gallium, into H-ZSM-5 catalysts significantly improves the selectivity of converting propane to BTX components. By treating the base zeolite with metal nitrate solutions, the catalysts achieve a BTX selectivity of around 40 to 45% under specific conditions. The improvement in selectivity is attributed to the efficient management of hydrogen atoms during the aromatization process, reducing the formation of light alkanes as side products.

金属成分，特别是锌和镓，被引入H-ZSM-5催化剂中，显著提高了将丙烷转化为BTX组分的选择性。通过用金属硝酸盐溶液处理基础沸石，催化剂在特定条件下实现了约40到45%的BTX选择性。选择性的提高归因于在芳构化过程中高效管理氢原子，减少了轻烷烃作为副产品的形成。
