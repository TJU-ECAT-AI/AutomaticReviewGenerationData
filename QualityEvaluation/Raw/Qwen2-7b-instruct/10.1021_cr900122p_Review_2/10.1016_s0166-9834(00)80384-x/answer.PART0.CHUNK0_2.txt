[1] "The conversion of light (C, to C,) alkanes to aromatics, chiefly benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX), can be accomplished using zeolites of the ZSM-5 type."
[2] "On H-ZSM-5, all the hydrogen atoms lost on aromatization of the reactant alkane seem to appear in the products as light alkanes."
[3] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 500C and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."
[4] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane, n-butane, and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity."

1. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics, primarily benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX), can be achieved through the use of ZSM-5 type zeolites. On H-ZSM-5, all hydrogen atoms lost during the aromatization process tend to appear in the products as light alkanes.
2. When propane undergoes conversion at 500°C and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can increase from approximately 10% (H-ZSM-5) to around 40 to 45% after the base zeolite is treated with zinc or gallium nitrate solutions, resulting in a final zinc or gallium content of about 1.0 mass-%.
3. A comparative analysis of propane, n-butane, and i-butane conversion over Zn-ZSM-5 indicates differences in reactivity and BTX selectivity among these alkanes.
4. i-Butane exhibits the highest reactivity among the three alkanes and also achieves the greatest hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen.
5. However, i-Butane displays the lowest BTX selectivity.

1. 对轻质烷烃进行芳香化，主要转化为苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX），可以通过使用ZSM-5类型的沸石实现。在H-ZSM-5上，所有在芳香化过程中失去的氢原子似乎在产品中以轻质烷烃的形式出现。
2. 当丙烷在500°C和0.1 MPa下作为反应物时，通过用锌或镓硝酸盐溶液处理基质沸石，可以将BTX选择性从大约10%（H-ZSM-5）提高到约40到45%，最终锌或镓含量为大约1.0质量-%。
3. 对于丙烷、n-丁烷和异丁烷的比较研究显示，在Zn-ZSM-5上这些烷烃在活性和BTX选择性方面存在差异。
4. 异丁烷在这三种烷烃中表现出最高的活性，并且实现了最大的氢回收作为二氢。
5. 然而，异丁烷的BTX选择性最低。
