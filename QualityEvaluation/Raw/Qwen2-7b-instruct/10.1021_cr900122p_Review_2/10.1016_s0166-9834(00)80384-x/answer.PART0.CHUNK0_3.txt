[H-ZSM-5 zeolites (silicon: aluminium ratio = 19) were prepared as described previously [ 141, and were characterized using X-ray diffractometry.]
[The synthesized materials were converted into the NH,+ form by exchange with ammonium chloride solutions.]
[The H+ form was obtained by calcining at 550C.]
[Zinc or gallium was introduced by treating the H-ZSM-5 with aqueous solutions of the respective metal nitrate.]
[All solids were crushed and sized before use.]
[Reactions were carried out using a flow microreactor which contained ca. 0.4 g catalyst.]
[The reactant was passed at a suitable space velocity (mass hourly space velocity, MHSV, in the range ca. 0.3 to 21 h-l) at atmospheric pressure.]
[The reaction temperature was normally 490 to 500 C.]
[The products were analyzed by sampling the exit stream at suitable intervals using a gas-sampling valve and a gas-liquid chromatograph.]
[It was found that the incorporation of zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 had a similar beneficial effect on the selectivity to BTX from propane (Fig. 2 ).]

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as metal-exchanged zeolites like H-ZSM-5, play a crucial role in alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The introduction of metals like zinc or gallium enhances the selectivity to BTX, leading to more efficient alkane conversions. The effectiveness of these catalysts is influenced by parameters such as the silicon:aluminum ratio, the preparation methods, the presence of metal ions, and the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and space velocity. These factors contribute to their industrial significance by enabling selective conversion of alkanes to valuable products like BTX with high efficiency and minimal side products.
