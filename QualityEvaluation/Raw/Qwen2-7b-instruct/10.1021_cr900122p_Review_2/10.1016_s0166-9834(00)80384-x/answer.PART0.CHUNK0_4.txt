[1] "The conversion of light (C, to C,) alkanes to aromatics, chiefly benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX), can be accomplished using zeolites of the ZSM-5 type."
[2] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."
[3] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane, n-butane, and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity."
[4] "i-Butane is the most reactive of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen."
[5] "However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity."

1. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics, primarily benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX), can be achieved through the use of ZSM-5 zeolites. 
2. By treating the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, the BTX selectivity can be significantly enhanced from approximately 10% (using H-ZSM-5) to around 40 to 45% with propane as the reactant at 500°C and 0.1 MPa. 
3. The conversion behavior of propane, n-butane, and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 catalysts varies in terms of activity and BTX selectivity. 
4. Among these, i-butane demonstrates the highest reactivity and the greatest hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. 
5. However, i-butane exhibits the lowest BTX selectivity.

1. 轻烷烃转化为芳烃，主要为苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX），可以通过使用ZSM-5型沸石实现。
2. 在500°C和0.1 MPa下使用丙烷作为反应物时，通过用锌或镓硝酸盐溶液处理基础沸石，BTX选择性可以从约10%（使用H-ZSM-5）增加到大约40至45%。
3. 对于丙烷、正丁烷和异丁烷在Zn-ZSM-5催化剂上的转化行为，在活性和BTX选择性方面存在差异。 
4. 其中，异丁烷显示出最高的反应性和最大的氢回收为二氢。
5. 然而，异丁烷的BTX选择性最低。
