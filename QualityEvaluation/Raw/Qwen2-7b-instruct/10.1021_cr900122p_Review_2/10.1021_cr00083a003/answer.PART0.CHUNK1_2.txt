[1] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deactivates under these conditions, but becomes more selective."
[2] "On the fresh catalyst used by Centi et al. for their kinetics study, a critical factor governing the selectivity at very high butane conversions is the instability of the formed maleic anhydride in the back end of the catalytic bed."
[3] "Enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
[4] "The recent results of Maleic Anhydride Synthesis from C, Hydrocarbons illustrate the important relationship between catalytic behavior and the surface modifications induced by the medium itself."
[5] "In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation, or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst or when nonequilibrium conditions at reduced pressures are employed."
[6] "The change of valence state of vanadium thus depends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction."
[7] "However, a deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides."
[8] "The binary vanadium phosphorus oxide system is rather complicated because of the great variety of observed phases and the difficulties encountered in the development of successful and reproducible syntheses of pure single phases stable under reaction conditions."
[9] "Improved understanding of the factors determining the structure of PVO has allowed the development of suitable methods of preparation of vanadyl pyrophosphate."
[10] "As illustrated in Figures 17 and 18, the variation of the content of P in the composition modifies the catalytic properties in n-butane oxidation and butene oxidation and the redox properties of the catalysts."
[11] "The strong increase of the rate of vanadium oxidation in the phosphorus-deficient catalyst leads to an enhancement of the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride (effect on the selectivity), whereas the decreased rate of reduction of vanadium in the catalyst with higher P content than a stoichiometric one leads to the reduced rate of hydrocarbon depletion (effect on the activity)."
[12] "It is reasonable to correlate these catalytic effects with the redox properties of the catalyst."
[13] "The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction in going from the alkane or alkene to maleic anhydride: a first step of oxidative dehydrogenation up to adsorbed butadiene and a second step of further oxidation of this intermediate."
[14] "The first step is suggested to be controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available."
[15] "These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V)."
[16] "Highly reactive surface oxygen (weakly adsorbed oxygen and/or Activated oxygen species (O*) were indicated also by Ebner et al. to be responsible for the butane activation step."
[17] "Oxygen chemisorption experiments suggest that much of the surface vanadium in (VO)2P207 is available for oxygen chemisorption. Around 1 oxygen molecule was adsorbed per 3 surface vanadiums."
[18] "The stability of the intermediate reported in Scheme 3 is very high and it desorbs under vacuum only at very high temperatures."
[19] "The multipulse experiments performed in the TAP reactor clearly indicate that the PVO catalyst functions with two types of oxygen."
[20] "The role of adsorbed oxygen was investigated also by infrared spectroscopy."
[21] "In the fresh catalysts lattice oxygen is very easily lost due to defects in the structure."
[22] "With an equilibrated catalyst, lattice oxygen is not as labile and can perform only reactions of allylic dehydration and of oxygen insertion with ring closure to form furan."
[23] "The nature of the oxygen species involved in the synthesis of maleic anhydride may be interpreted in light of the different kinetic behaviors of fresh and equilibrated catalysts."
[24] "The role of adsorbed oxygen was investigated also by infrared spectroscopy."
[25] "The formation of strongly adsorbed species was detected in pulse reactor tests from the loss of carbon balance and in the TAP transient experiments."
[26] "The formation of this strongly bound species thus modifies the working state of (V0),P2O7 in steady-state reaction conditions for n-butane oxidation."
