[1] "Under these conditions,as in the case of bubl-ene, the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deac- tivate,' but becomes more selective (Figure 14b)."
[2] "On the fresh catalyst used by Centi et alJO for their kinetics study, a critical factor governing the selectivity at very high butane conversions is the instability of the formed maleic anhydride in the back end of the cata- lytic bed."
[3] "These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
[4] "This factor is important only for contact times higher than those required to achieve 100% conversion'44 (presence of only residual 0,in the flow) or for very high oxygenln-butane ratios.'34"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) systems, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The VPO catalysts exhibit enhanced selectivity towards maleic anhydride production when subjected to specific conditions. The instability of maleic anhydride in the catalytic bed, influenced by the presence of a more oxidizing atmosphere, leads to its enhanced formation. This effect is most pronounced under high butane conversion conditions, where the catalyst operates at longer contact times or with high oxygen-to-butane ratios. The catalyst's selectivity and activity are finely tuned by controlling these conditions, enabling efficient conversion of alkanes into valuable chemicals like maleic anhydride.

金属基催化剂，尤其是钒磷氧化物（VPO）体系，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响。VPO催化剂在特定条件下表现出对马来酸酐生产的高选择性。在催化床中马来酸酐的不稳定性，受到更氧化气氛的影响，导致其增强形成。这种效应在高丁烷转化率条件下最为明显，催化剂在此时操作于较长的接触时间或高氧/丁烷比下。通过控制这些条件，催化剂的选择性和活性得到了精确调整，从而实现了高效将烷烃转化为有价值的化学品如马来酸酐。
