[1] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deactivates, but becomes more selective."
[2] "It is thus worthwhile to analyze the variations in the catalyst surface as a function of position in the catalytic bed."
[3] "These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
[4] "The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction."
[5] "However, a deeper examination of the dynamics of the working state of the catalyst surface and the relationship between surface-induced modifications and catalytic behavior would lead to an even better understanding of the selectivity-controlling properties of these mixed oxides."
[6] "In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation, or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst or when nonequilibrium conditions at reduced pressures are employed."
[7] "The change of valence state of vanadium thus depends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction."
[8] "The presence of different valence states of vanadium on the principal X-ray diffraction lines of vanadyl pyrophosphate (P:V = l.0)."
[9] "It is thus possible to modify and study the P:V ratio around the stoichiometric value (P:V = 1.0) without the formation of other crystalline phases."
[10] "At low conversion, the catalysts with P:V ratio 0.95 and 1.01 show the same activity, selectivity, and kinetic behavior."
[11] "For these vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts, a content of phosphorus lower than required for stoichiometric P:V = 1.0 principally influences the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, whereas for catalysts with a higher amount of P with respect to P:V = 1.0, the predominant effect is on the rate of formation of maleic anhydride."
[12] "When PVO catalysts were treated in a cyclic fashion with pure O2 followed by butenes, the selectivity in maleic anhydride formation diminished as compared with steady-state behavior."
[13] "Nakamura et al. also suggested that some V5+ ions were necessary for maleic anhydride synthesis, but the optimum mean valence state of catalyst is close to four."
[14] "An increase of P content in the 0.9-1.2 P:V atomic ratio decreases specific activity in n-butane depletion and maleic anhydride yield."
[15] "This suggests a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V)."
[16] "The different redox properties of the three catalysts depend upon the preparation procedures."
[17] "However, when the content of Vv is too high, the oxidation proceeds further to carbon oxides."
[18] "These data suggest a strong relationship between selectivity to maleic anhydride at high conversion and rate of formation of vanadium(V)."
[19] "The results of surface modifications induced by the interaction of C4 hydrocarbons as well as the results of P:V ratio effect on redox properties and on selectivity/activity are interpreted on the basis of two different types of reaction."
[20] "The first step is suggested to be controlled by the rate of Vw reduction, whereas the second step is controlled by the amount of Vv available."
[21] "This is illustrated for catalysts with the same P:V ratio in Figure 20, which shows the rates of Vv formation (Figure 20b) and the corresponding maleic anhydride yields vs butane conversion (Figure 20a)."
[22] "At low conversion and similar rates of Vv formation the catalysts show approximately similar selectivity, but at high conversion, when the greatest disparity in rates of oxidation exists, the more oxidizable catalyst shows the highest rate of maleic anhydride decomposition."
[23] "Furthermore, the higher selectivities in the absence of gas-phase oxygen obtained in n-butane conversion in a transport bed reactor are explained on the basis of the absence in these conditions of surface-active species like 0, and 0-."
[24] "The oxygen which can readily oxidize furan is more rapidly depleted than the oxygen available to form furan from butene."
[25] "This suggests that oxygen insertion on the 2,5-positions of furan occurs simultaneously."
[26] "The multipulse experiments performed in the TAP reactor clearly indicate that the PVO catalyst functions with two types of oxygen."
[27] "It is worthy of note that the stability of the intermediate reported in Scheme 3 is very high and it desorbs under vacuum only at very high temperatures."
[28] "This suggests that it cannot desorb as the DHF intermediate, but remains strongly bound to the surface up to final formation of furan (route b of Scheme 2a), which may desorb as an intermediate in the vacuum conditions of TAP experiments."
[29] "This mechanism is a key to the selectivity and the absence of intermediate products in the reaction of n-butane conversion to maleic anhydride."
