[I] "The demand for this industrially important chemical, used principally in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow over the next 5 years, due in part to new uses for this highly functionalized molecule."

[II] "Currently, worldwide production of maleic anhydride is based on the major feedstocks benzene, n-butane, and butenes."

[III] "However, productivity from n-butane is lower due to lower selectivities to maleic anhydride at higher conversions and the somewhat lower feed concentrations (less than 2 molar %) used to avoid flammability of process streams."

[IV] "In the past few years, development of fluid bed butane-based systems has been reported. These systems offer the advantage of operation at higher butane concentrations (up to 4%) and thus lower original capital costs."

[V] "The recently developed DuPont transport bed technology may be the most economically favorable route for maleic production in the 1990s. This process operates at lower conversions per pass and with higher selectivities than normally encountered in fixed or fluid bed systems, and uses a unique attrition resistance system."

[VI] "All catalysts used industrially for the production of maleic anhydride from butane are PVO-based systems."

[VII] "The preparation of vanadium phosphorus oxides was the subject of a recent review by Huddett, and older data on these catalysts have been reviewed by Varma and Saraf."

[VIII] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases."

[IX] "Optimal performance properties are associated with catalysts containing 4-9 V(V) ions per V(IV) ion."

[X] "In the oxidation of n-butane, the rate-determining step is the activation of n-butane."

1. The demand for maleic anhydride, primarily used in unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is anticipated to increase in the coming years due to new applications for this highly functionalized molecule.

2. Currently, the majority of maleic anhydride production relies on benzene, n-butane, and butenes as feedstocks.

3. The efficiency in producing maleic anhydride from n-butane is lower due to decreased selectivity at higher conversion levels and the lower feed concentrations (below 2 molar %) employed to prevent process stream flammability.

4. Recent advancements in fluid bed systems for butane-based production offer benefits like higher butane concentration (up to 4%) and reduced initial capital costs.

5. The DuPont transport bed technology could be the most cost-effective option for maleic anhydride production in the 1990s, operating at lower conversion rates per pass with superior selectivity compared to traditional fixed or fluid bed systems, and featuring an attrition-resistant design.

6. All industrial catalysts for maleic anhydride production from butane are based on vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) systems.

7. The synthesis of vanadium phosphorus oxides was comprehensively reviewed by Huddett, and earlier data on these catalysts were explored by Varma and Saraf.

8. The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is marked by easy formation and interconversion of various crystalline vanadium(IV) and vanadium(V) phases.

9. The ideal catalyst performance correlates with those containing 4-9 vanadium(V) ions per vanadium(IV) ion.

10. In the n-butane oxidation process, the rate-limiting step is the activation of n-butane.

1. 这种在工业上极为重要的化学物质，主要用于不饱和聚酯树脂、农业化学品、食品添加剂、润滑油添加剂和制药等领域的需求，在未来五年预计会增长，部分原因在于这种高度功能化的分子有了新的用途。

2. 目前，生产马来酸酐的主要原料包括苯、异丁烷和丁烯等。

3. 从异丁烷生产马来酸酐的效率较低，原因是转化率较高时选择性降低，且采用的进料浓度（低于2摩尔%）是为了避免工艺流体的可燃性。

4. 最近开发的基于液床的异丁烷系统提供了优势，如更高的异丁烷浓度（可达4%），从而降低了初始资本成本。

5. 预计在1990年代，杜邦运输床技术可能是生产马来酸酐最具经济效益的途径。该过程以较低的每次通过转化率运行，具有高于传统固定或液床系统所见的更高选择性，并使用了一种独特的抗磨损系统。

6. 所有用于从异丁烷生产马来酸酐的工业催化剂都基于范德华磷氧化物（PVO）系统。

7. 范德华磷氧化物的合成被Huddett进行了全面的回顾，而Varma和Saraf对这些催化剂的早期数据进行了探索。

8. 范德华磷氧化物系统以其容易形成和范德华(V(IV))和范德华(V(V))相之间轻松转换的特性而著称。

9. 催化剂的最佳性能与每范德华(IV)离子含有的4-9个范德华(V(V))离子相关。

10. 在异丁烷氧化过程中，决定性的步骤是异丁烷的活化。
