[I] "The demand for this industrially important chemical, used principally in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow over the next 5 years, due in part to new uses for this highly functionalized molecule."

[II] "The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases are transformed to (VO)2P207 by reaction with the hydrocarbon mixture. In this reduction process single V06 octahedra form pairs by loss of oxide anions."

[III] "These two very different approaches to determination of intermediates in n-butane oxidation lead to the same conclusions. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation products."

[IV] "The kinetics results of Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou fit catalysts of this type. They show very little dependence of the catalytic behavior on a change of the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio."

[V] "An increase in the oxygen concentration results in an increase in the amount of Vv and of the rate of maleic anhydride formation."

1. The demand for the industrially important chemical, which is used primarily in unsaturated polyester resin manufacturing, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is anticipated to increase in the upcoming five years, partly due to the introduction of new applications for this highly functionalized molecule.

2. The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases are converted to (VO)2P207 through interaction with the hydrocarbon mixture. In this reduction process, single V06 octahedra form pairs by losing oxide anions.

3. These two distinct methods for identifying intermediates in n-butane oxidation result in identical conclusions. The vanadium phosphorus oxides are capable of dehydrogenating n-butane to form olefins, which then undergo further reactions to produce partial oxidation products.

4. The kinetic results obtained from Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou are applicable to catalysts of this kind. These catalysts exhibit minimal dependency of catalytic behavior on alterations in the hydrocarbon/oxygen ratio.

5. An increase in the oxygen concentration leads to an increase in the amount of Vv and the rate of maleic anhydride formation.

1. 这种工业上重要的化学品的需求，主要用于不饱和聚酯树脂的制造、农业化学品、食品添加剂、润滑剂添加剂和制药，预计在未来五年内会增长，部分原因是这种高度功能化的分子有了新的应用。

2. 通过与混合烃类物质的反应，正磷酸盐（VOPO4）相转变为（VO）2P207。在这一还原过程中，单个V06八面体形成对数结构，通过失去氧离子。

3. 这两种不同的方法用于确定丁烷氧化中间体的结论是相同的。这些钒磷氧化物能够脱氢丁烷形成烯烃，这些烯烃进一步反应生成部分氧化产物。

4. 布坎南和桑德森以及勒鲁的研究结果适用于这类催化剂。这些催化剂的催化行为对混合碳氢化合物/氧气比例的变化显示出极小的依赖性。

5. 氧气浓度的增加导致Vv含量和马来酸酐形成速率的增加。
