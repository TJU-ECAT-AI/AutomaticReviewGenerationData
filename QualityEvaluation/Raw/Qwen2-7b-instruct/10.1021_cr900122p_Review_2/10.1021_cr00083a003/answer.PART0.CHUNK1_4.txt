(Figure 14a.)'33 Under these conditions,as in the case of bubl-ene, the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deac- tivate,' but becomes more selective (Figure 14b).

(legend: (1) ethane, (2) propane, (3) n-butane, (4) n-pentane, (5) n-hexane, (6) n-heptane, (7) 2-methylbutane, (8) cyclohexane.)

On the fresh catalyst used by Centi et alJO for their kinetics study, a critical factor governing the selectivity at very high butane conversions is the instability of the formed maleic anhydride in the back end of the catalytic bed. It is thus worthwhile to analyze the variations in the catalyst surface as a function of position in the catalytic bed.'"J3' 

It is known from the literature that 0- and 0,species (one oxygen molecule may be activated by accepting electrons from the solid or alternatively, 0- species may form by decomposition of N20) are very reactive in the oxidative dehydrogenation and activation of light alkane.'-lO

On (b) catalyst the two bands at 396 K (2328 and 2300 cm-') were assigned to coordinatively bonded acetonitrile on very strong Lewis sites. On (a) catalyst the two bands at 2280 and 2300 cm-' were attributed to coordinatively bonded acetonitrile on medium-strong Lewis sites.

In order to correlate the observed var- iations in the redox properties with the catalytic be- havior in n-butane oxidation on the fresh catalyst used by these authors,136 it is necessary to distinguish be- tween tests at low conversion (lower than 10%) where the reducing power of the reagent mixture is higher and catalytic tests at high conversion (Figure 17).

At low conversion, the catalysts with P:V ratio 0.95 and 1.01 show the same activity, selectivity, and kinetic behav- ior.I3l However, at high conversion of n-butane (80%) the catalyst deficient in phosphorus and with the ob- served higher rate of vanadium oxidation forms pri- marily carbon oxides. 

For these vanadyl pyrophosphate  a t a l y s t s ,    J a content of phosphorus lower than required for sto- chiometric P:V = 1.0 principally influences the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, whereas for catalysts with a higher amount of P with respect to P:V = 1.0,the predominant effect is on the rate of formation of maleic anhydride.

The strong increase of the rate of vanadium oxidation in the phosphorus-deficient catalyst leads to an enhancement of the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride (effect on the selectivity),whereas the decreased rate of reduction of vanadium in the catalyst with higher P content than a stoichiometric one leads to the reduced rate of hydrocarbon depletion (effect on the activity).

In the pulse redox studieslZ9 it was observed that on the surface of vanadyl pyro- phosphate during n-butane conversion under anaerobic conditions, strongly adsorbed species form that do not desorb at the reaction temperature (400 O C ). Sending pulses of pure O,,in fact, the formation of carbon oxides, was observed, and the amount shows a maximum as a function of the number of pulses. 

These strongly adsorbed species are significantly oxidized and that the combustion of this material is preceded by the reoxidation of the catalyst surface. A significant implication of these results is that the migrationfexchange of the oxygen-containing species in the surface layer is faster than the oxidation of these adsorbed species.

Similar conclusions may be obtained on the basis of TAP transient experiments using multipulse experi- m e n t  .   * In particular, in the pulse redox studieslZ9 it was observed that on the surface of vanadyl pyro- phosphate during n-butane conversion under anaerobic conditions, strongly adsorbed species form that do not desorb at the reaction temperature (400 O C ).
