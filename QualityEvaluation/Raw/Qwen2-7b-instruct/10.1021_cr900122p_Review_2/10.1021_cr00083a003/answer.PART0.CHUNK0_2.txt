[1] "The demand for this industrially important chemical, used principally in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester resins, agricultural chemicals, food additives, lubricating oil additives, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow over the next 5 years, due in part to new uses for this highly functionalized molecule."
[2] "Among the more significant potential new uses is its conversion to butanediol via hydrogenation of maleic acid."
[3] "This chemistry may become economically more favorable than the present acetylene-based chemistry by the 1990s."
[4] "Currently, worldwide production of maleic anhydride is based on the major feedstocks benzene, n-butane, and butenes."
[5] "Most of the capacity is produced via fixed-bed oxidation of benzene, though benzene is being displaced by butane as a feedstock."
[6] "However, productivity from n-butane is lower due to lower selectivities to maleic anhydride at higher conversions and the somewhat lower feed concentrations (less than 2 molar %) used to avoid flammability of process streams."
[7] "The use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing degrees of crystallinity and defect structure of the resulting active phase."
[8] "The final P/V ratio of the active phase may he varied and has been the subject of numerous publications."
[9] "Recent advances in understanding the solid-state chemistry of PVO have allowed studies of this reaction with well-characterized, reproducible compositions."
[10] "The reaction sequences may be determined by using controlled conditions and TAP (temporal analysis of products)."
[11] "Compared to other industrially practiced hydrocarbon selective oxidation reactions, it is the most complex."
[12] "Knowledge gained through study and understanding of this system may contribute to advances in alkane activation in general."
[13] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by the facile formation of a number of crystalline phases, both of vanadium(IV) and of vanadium(V)."
[14] "The orthophosphate (VOPO4) phases are transformed to (VO)2P2O7 by reaction with the hydrocarbon mixture."
[15] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is able to dehydrogenate the n-butane to olefins, and these olefins react further to form partial oxidation products."
[16] "The kinetics studies found an order of reaction 1 for the dependence of the rate of n-butane depletion upon hydrocarbon partial pressure."
[17] "The more relevant are the reaction order for the dependence of the rates on oxygen partial pressure and the activation energies of the different rates."
[18] "Lower activation energies were found by Wohlfahrt and Hfmann and by Centi et al., whereas higher activation energies were reported by Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou."
[19] "The dependence of the maleic anhydride yield on the conversion shows a well-defined maximum for a conversion of about 80%."
[20] "An increase in conversion drastically decreases the yield of maleic anhydride to around 10% for total conversion."
[21] "The decrease of selectivity to maleic anhydride parallels an increase of the ratio of residual concentration of oxygen to n-butane."
[22] "The rate of oxidation of V4+ to V5+ is higher than in the other catalysts utilized."
[23] "In the case of the catalytic systems utilized by Buchanan and Sundaresan and Lerou, the lower rate of vanadium surface oxidation results in the observed higher reaction order in oxygen concentration and the reduced reactivity of the surface in the rate of both n-butane depletion and maleic anhydride consecutive oxidation."
[24] "The comparison of these kinetics results stresses the importance of surface catalyst redox level in determining the catalytic behavior (selectivity to maleic anhydride) as well as the role of the redox properties of vanadium (evidenced by the different activation energies) in determining the activity of the catalyst."
