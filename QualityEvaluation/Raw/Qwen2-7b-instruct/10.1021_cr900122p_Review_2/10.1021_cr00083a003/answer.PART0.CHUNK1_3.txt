[1] "Under these conditions,as in the case of bubl-ene, the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst rapidly and irreversibly deac- tivate,' but becomes more selective (Figure 14b)."
[2] "It is thus worthwhile to analyze the variations in the catalyst surface as a function of position in the catalytic bed."
[3] "These results suggest that enhanced formation of Vv at the end of the catalyst bed is directly attributable to the more oxidizing atmosphere present."
[4] "On equilibrated catalysts, this effect is much less evident,due to the reduced rate of vanadium oxidation to Vv."
[5] "In the oxidation of both n-butane and but-l-ene, partial oxidation products (butadiene in but-l-ene oxidation,or butenes and butadiene in n-butane oxidation) are observed at low oxygen concentrations when a very limited number of vanadium(V) species are present on the surface of the catalyst."
[6] "The redox properties of the feed influence the surface oxidation state of the catalyst, which in turn profoundly affects the nature of the products formed in the reaction."
[7] "Literature results are in line with these conclusions."
[8] "The change of valence state of vanadium thus de- pends upon a balance of three factors: (1) the redox potential of the feed, (2) the rate of oxidation of the catalyst at the temperature of reaction, and (3) the rate of reduction of the catalyst at the temperature of re- action."

[12] "At low conversion, the catalysts with P:V ratio 0.95 and 1.01 show the same activity, selectivity, and kinetic behav- ior."
[13] "On the other hand, an excess of phosphorus only slightly influences the rate of oxidation, but strongly affects the rate of reduction."

[15] "For these vanadyl pyrophosphate  a t a l y s t s ,    J a content of phosphorus lower than required for sto- chiometric P:V = 1.0 principally influences the rate of consecutive oxidation of maleic anhydride, whereas for catalysts with a higher amount of P with respect to P:V = 1.0,the predominant effect is on the rate of formation of maleic anhydride."
[16] "When PVO catalysts were treated in a cyclic fashion with pure O2 followed by butenes, the selectivity in maleic anhydride formation diminished as compared with steady-state behavior."
[17] "Similar conclusions were presented recently by Wenig and Schrader41 studying the effect of phosphorus on the kinetic be- havior of PVO catalysts in n-butane oxidation."

1. The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst shows reversible deactivation under certain conditions but becomes more selective. The catalyst surface varies with position in the catalytic bed.
2. Analyzing the catalyst surface's variations across the bed is crucial for understanding the catalyst's behavior.
3. Enhanced formation of Vv at the catalyst bed's end is due to a more oxidizing atmosphere.
4. Equilibrated catalysts exhibit less pronounced effects due to reduced vanadium oxidation.
5. Partial oxidation products emerge during n-butane and but-l-ene oxidation at low oxygen concentrations.
6. Redox properties of the feed significantly impact the catalyst's surface oxidation state, influencing the products' nature.
7. Literature findings align with these conclusions about vanadium valence state changes.
