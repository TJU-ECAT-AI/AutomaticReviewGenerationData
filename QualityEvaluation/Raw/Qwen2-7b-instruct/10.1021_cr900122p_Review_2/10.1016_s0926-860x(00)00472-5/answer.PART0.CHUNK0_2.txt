[1] "In the last years, the direct conversion of methane into more valuable liquid fuels or chemical compounds has attracted great interest because of the considerable increase in the world natural gas reserves."
[2] "Among the different processes proposed, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts has been one of the most studied processes."
[3] "Several active Mo sites have been described for silica-supported molybdena catalysts. It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation."
[4] "It was shown that both methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are closely related to the dispersion and nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst."
[5] "Likewise, in order to obtain catalysts containing exclusively monomeric Mo species, another group of samples was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia aqueous solutions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to enhance methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity, which are closely related to the dispersion and nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst. By preparing catalysts containing exclusively monomeric Mo species, researchers aim to demonstrate the specificity of these monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane, thus optimizing the catalytic process for industrial applications.
