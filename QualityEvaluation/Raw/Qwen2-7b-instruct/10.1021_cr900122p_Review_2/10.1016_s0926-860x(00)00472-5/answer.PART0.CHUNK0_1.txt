[1] "In the last years, the direct conversion of methane into more valuable liquid fuels or chemical com- pounds has attracted great interest because of the considerable increase in the world natural gas reserves."
[2] "Among the different processes proposed, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts has been one of the most studied processes."
[3] "It was shown that both methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are closely related to the dispersion and nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst."
[4] "The most recent papers about the use of MoO3/SiO2 catalysts in the title reaction have been focused on the elucidation of the relationship between the structure of the supported metal oxide phase and their role in the reaction mechanism."
[5] "Several active Mo sites have been described for silica-supported molybdena catalysts. It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation."
[6] "Thus, the relative high reducibility of the poorly dispersed tungsten oxide species (mainly poly- meric species) for loading higher than 4.0 wt.% lead to a significant increase in the methane conversion values obtained for the catalysts."
[7] "On the other hand, a relation between monomeric W species and the Brnsted acid sites of the zeolite was suggested."
[8] "In this paper, we compete to demonstrate the speci- ficity of the monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane."
[9] "Likewise, in order to obtain catalysts containing exclusively monomeric Mo species, another group of samples was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia aqueous solutions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The nature of the metal oxide phase, especially the dispersion and type of active sites, plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the catalytic process. High reducibility of the metal oxide species leads to increased methane conversion, whereas a relation between monomeric metal species and the acid sites of the zeolite contributes to improved selectivity for specific products. The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the distinct role of monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane, highlighting the importance of catalyst structure in controlling the reaction outcomes.
