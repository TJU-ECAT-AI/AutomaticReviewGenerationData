1. The direct conversion of methane into valuable liquid fuels or chemical compounds has gained interest due to the rising global natural gas reserves. However, formaldehyde yields from such processes are insufficient for industrial application.

2. Several active sites for molybdenum in silica-supported catalysts have been identified, contributing to the catalytic role in methane partial oxidation.

3. Poorly dispersed tungsten oxide species, especially those containing polymeric structures, enhance methane conversion when present in high concentrations.

4. There is a correlation between monomeric tungsten species and Brnsted acid sites of the zeolite, suggesting their importance in catalytic reactions.

5. This study aims to highlight the specificity of monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in formaldehyde production from methane.

6. Catalysts containing exclusively monomeric molybdenum species were prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite through impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia aqueous solutions.

7. The structure of the supported molybdena phase was characterized for both catalyst series.

8. Methane conversion tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed setup, previously detailed in references [12,13].

9. Catalyst samples underwent in-situ treatment with oxygen from ambient to reaction temperature, held at 600°C for about 1 hour.

10. Steady-state conditions were reached after approximately 2 hours, ensuring reproducible analytical results.
