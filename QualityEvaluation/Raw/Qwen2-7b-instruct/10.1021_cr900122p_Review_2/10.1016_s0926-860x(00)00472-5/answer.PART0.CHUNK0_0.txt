<p>The most recent papers about the use of MoO3/SiO2 catalysts in the title reaction have been focused on the elucidation of the relationship between the structure of the supported metal oxide phase and their role in the reaction mechanism.</p>
<p>Baares et al. have proposed that methane activation occurs through oxygen activation on the reduced sites of the supported molybdenum oxide.</p>
<p>Parmaliana et al. showed the existence of a straight correlation between the density of the reduced sites, evaluated in steady-state conditions by O2 chemisorption, and the reaction rate.</p>
<p>It has been shown that catalyst reducibility depends on the interaction between the metal oxide phase and the support surface varying with several factors such as metal oxide loading and nature of the support.</p>
<p>Several active Mo sites have been described for silica-supported molybdena catalysts. It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation.</p>
<p>Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be specific sites for HCOH production, while MoOMo sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster would lead to the total oxidation products.</p>
<p>In the first place, we report the catalytic results obtained in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over conventional aqueous impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts.</p>
<p>Likewise, in order to obtain catalysts containing exclusively monomeric Mo species, another group of samples was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia aqueous solutions.</p>
