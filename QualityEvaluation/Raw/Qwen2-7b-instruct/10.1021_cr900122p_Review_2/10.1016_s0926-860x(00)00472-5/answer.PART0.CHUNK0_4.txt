[1] "In the last years, the direct conversion of methane into more valuable liquid fuels or chemical compounds has attracted great interest because of the considerable increase in the world natural gas reserves."
[2] "Among the different processes proposed, the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts has been one of the most studied processes."
[3] "However, in spite of the great efforts made, formaldehyde yields are too low for a possible industrial application."
[4] "It was shown that both methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are closely related to the dispersion and nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst."
[5] "On the other hand, a relation between monomeric W species and the Brnsted acid sites of the zeolite was suggested."
[6] "In this paper, we compete to demonstrate the speci- ficity of the monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane."
[7] "Likewise, in order to obtain catalysts containing exclusively monomeric Mo species, another group of samples was prepared from HZSM-5 zeolite by impregnation and subsequent washing with ammonia aqueous solutions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those involving supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively convert alkanes into more valuable liquid fuels or chemical compounds, the relationship between the dispersion and nature of the metal oxide species and catalyst performance, and the role of Brnsted acid sites in enhancing formaldehyde selectivity. The demonstration of the specificity of monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane highlights the importance of catalyst design and optimization for efficient alkane transformations.
