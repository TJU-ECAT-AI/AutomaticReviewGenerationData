<p>The most recent papers about the use of MoO3/SiO2 catalysts in the title reaction have been focused on the elucidation of the relationship between the structure of the supported metal oxide phase and their role in the reaction mechanism.</p>
<p>Baares et al. have proposed that methane activation occurs through oxygen activation on the reduced sites of the supported molybdenum oxide.</p>
<p>Parmaliana et al. showed the existence of a straight correlation between the density of the reduced sites, evaluated in steady-state conditions by O2 chemisorption, and the reaction rate.</p>
<p>It has been shown that catalyst reducibility depends on the interaction between the metal oxide phase and the support surface varying with several factors such as metal oxide loading and nature of the support.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The nature of the metal oxide phase, especially the dispersion and type of active sites, plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the catalytic process. High reducibility of the metal oxide species leads to increased methane conversion, whereas a relation between monomeric metal species and the acid sites of the zeolite contributes to improved selectivity for specific products. The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the distinct role of monomeric molybdenum oxo-species in the production of formaldehyde from methane, highlighting the importance of catalyst structure in controlling the reaction outcomes.
