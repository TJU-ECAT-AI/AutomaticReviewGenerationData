[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."
[2] "Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered."
[3] "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations."
[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions are processes of particular interest due to their industrial significance."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, which are of great industrial importance due to their ability to convert cheaper, readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products through mechanisms such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, isobutanebutene alkylation, and benzene alkylation with ethane or propane.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的氧化钒和金属交换沸石，如支撑的氧化钒和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转换的机制和效率产生了显著影响。这些催化剂在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中尤为重要，这些过程因其能够将较便宜、易于获取的C2C4烷烃转化为更有价值的产物而具有工业重要性，通过诸如正丁烷异构化、C2C4烷烃芳构化、异丁烷丁烯烷基化和苯烷基化与乙烷或丙烷等机制。
