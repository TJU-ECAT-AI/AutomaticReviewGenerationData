The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts are crucial in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions due to their ability to activate and transform C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to efficiently convert alkanes into alkenes, aromatics, and alkylates through mechanisms like disproportionation, isomerization, and alkylation. The use of metal-exchanged zeolites allows for bifunctional catalysis, enhancing the efficiency of these transformations. Additionally, the thermodynamic considerations and the choice of catalysts (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ga) affect the selectivity and yield of the desired products. These catalysts enable the conversion of inexpensive alkanes into more valuable chemical feedstocks, making them economically significant in industrial applications.
