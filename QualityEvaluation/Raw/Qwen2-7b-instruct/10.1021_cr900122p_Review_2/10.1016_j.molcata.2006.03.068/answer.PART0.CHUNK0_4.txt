[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."
[2] "Both the transformations of pure alkanes: n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization and of alkanes in mixture with alkenes: isobutanebutene alkylation or with aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene alkylation with ethane or propane are considered."
[3] "This paper focuses on the use of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, in the context of alkane transformations."
[4] "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations."
[5] "Industrial significance is attributed to the ability of these catalysts to perform oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions efficiently."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include the specific type of catalyst, its structure, and the conditions under which it operates. These catalysts enable efficient oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, contributing to their industrial significance. The paper discusses the role of these catalysts in various alkane transformations, such as n-butane isomerization, C2C4 alkane aromatization, and alkanes reacting with alkenes or aromatic hydrocarbons through alkylation processes.
