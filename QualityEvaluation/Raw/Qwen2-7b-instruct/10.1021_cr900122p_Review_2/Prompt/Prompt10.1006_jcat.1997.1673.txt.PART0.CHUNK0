Trifir o Instituto Tecnolog a Qu mica, UPV-CSIC, Avenida Los Naranjos s/n, 46071 Valencia, Spain; and Department of Industrial Chemistry and Materials, University of Bologna, V.le Risorgimento 4, 46031 Bologna, Italy Received June 11, 1996; revised January 27, 1997; accepted February 24, 1997 γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane. The vana- dium loading strongly influences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3- supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane. While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions in- creaseswiththevanadiumloading,theselectivitytothecorrespond- ing olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms.
In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane. Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading.
In this way, although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed. The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading.
Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentra- tion depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests. c 1997 Academic Press
INTRODUCTION
Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxides are well known for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, but their catalytic properties depend on the metal oxide support and on the vanadium content (15). On Al2O3-supported vana- dia catalysts, olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons are selec- tively transformed into oxygenated products on catalysts with vanadium content higher than the theoretical mono- layer; however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alka- nes, the best selectivities to the corresponding olefins are 1 On leave from the Department of Industrial Chemistry and Materials, University of Bologna, V.le Risorgimento 4, 46031 Bologna, Italy. 2 To whom correspondence should be addressed. achieved only on catalysts with low vanadium loading (69).
Furthermore, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation prod- ucts depends on the alkane fed and decreases in the order ethane > propane > n-butane (911).
Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been char- acterized by a variety of physicochemical methods. The data obtained from Raman (1216), 51V NMR (1517), ESR (1820), XPS (14, 21), UVVis reflectance (19), EXAFSXANES (22, 23), temperature-programmed re- duction (12, 14, 23, 24), and infrared and microcalorimetric studies of adsorbed probe molecules (2527) indicate that the type of vanadium species depends on the vanadium con- tent. If a vanadium oxide monolayer completely covering thesurfaceofthesupportshouldneed4.98 × 1014molecules V2O5 cm2, the appearance of V2O5 crystallites on Al2O3 occurs at a vanadium loading of about 60% of the theoret- ical monolayer (14). At lower vanadium loadings, isolated and/or associated tetrahedral and/or octahedral V5+ species have been observed.
This paper reports the influence of the vanadium load- ing of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, under submonolayer coverages, on their catalytic properties for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane us- ing low alkane/oxygen ratios. The catalyst characterization was performed with the aim of elucidating the nature of the active and the selective sites for the oxydehydrogena- tion reactions.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation A series of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of a Girdler T126 γ - Al2O3 support (SBET = 188 m2 g1), ground and sieved to
0.0420.059 cm, with an ammonium metavanadate solution
(pH = 7). The concentrations of the solutions were selected to achieve vanadium loadings ranging between 0 and 8 wt% vanadium atoms. In addition, two catalysts were prepared by percolating a 0.05 M ammonium metavanadate solution through γ -Al2O3 support (400 ml of solution for 5 g of the 203 0021-9517/97 $25.00 Copyright c 1997 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved. 204

The solutions were adjusted with nitric acid to achieve final pH values of 7 (sample B4) and 3 (sample B5).
The catalysts were finally calcined at 600C during 6 h.
The characteristics of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. The vanadium coverages indicated in Table 1 were calculated considering that 4.98 × 1018 molecules V2O5 m2 is the vanadium loading necessary to obtain a monolayer of vanadium oxide completely covering the surface of the support (14).
Catalytic Test The catalytic tests for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor (16-mm i.d., 500-mm length) equipped with a coaxial thermocouple for temperatures profiles. Cata- lyst samples 0.3 to 1.3 g and particle sizes between 0.25 and 0.42 mm were mixed with variable amounts of SiC (0.59 mm particle size) to keep a constant volume in the catalyst bed (3 cm3). The reaction was studied in the temper- ature interval 450600C using an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88. The total flow was varied from 100 to 200 ml min1 obtaining different contact times [W/F = 15 to 80 gcat h (mol-C2)1]. Analysis of reactants and products was carried out by gas chromatography, using two column types:(i)PorapakQ(3.0m × 1/8in.);(ii)molecularsieve5A (1.5 × 1/8 in.). Analysis of C4 hydrocarbons was carried out by gas chromatography, using a 23% SP-1700 Chromosorb PAW (30 × 1/8 in.) column (11).
Blank runs in the temperature interval 450600C were carried out substituting the catalyst by SiC, at the lowest to- tal flow used in the present study (100 ml min1). Under our reaction conditions the presence of homogeneous reaction can be neglected.
Catalyst Characterization The BET surface area of the samples, SBET, was obtained in an ASAP 2000 apparatus, following the BET method from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K and taking a value of
0.164 nm2 for the cross section of N2.
Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra in the UVvisible re- gion were collected with a Shimazdu UV-2010 PC spec- trophotometer equipped with a reflectance attachment.
Solid-state 51V NMR spectra were measured at ambient temperature on a Varian VXR-400S WB spectrometer at
105. 1 MHz, using a high-speed MAS Doty probe with zirco-
nia rotors (5 mm in diameter). The spectra were recorded with pulses of 1 s corresponding to a flip angle of π/18 rad, to avoid signal distortions of the I = 7/2 nuclei. The 51V chemical shifts are referred against liquid VOCl3, using Mg3(VO4)2, whose chemical shift is 554 ppm, as secondary
