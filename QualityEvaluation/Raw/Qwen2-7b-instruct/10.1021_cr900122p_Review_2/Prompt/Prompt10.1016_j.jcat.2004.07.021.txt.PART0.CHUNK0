The modification of the zeolite with gallium suppresses dealumination of the hydrogen form due to substitution of protons by gallium species. When the reduction at 773 K is followed by evacuation, coordinatively unsaturated Ga+ ions are formed. These species can be reversibly oxidized by nitrous oxide at 673 K. Alternatively, these Ga+ ions adsorb molecular hydrogen at lower temperatures resulting in several types of hydride species. The latter species are completely decomposed only in vacuum at relatively high temperatures (773 K). We propose that the oxidation of gallium upon cooling of reduced samples to room temperature in hydrogen can be attributed to an oxidative addition of H2 resulting in the formation of gallium dihydrides. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Acid ZSM-5 zeolites modified by gallium ions are known to be active catalysts for the aromatization of light paraf- fins [1]. The mechanisms associated with alkane dehydro- genation and subsequent oligomerization and aromatization of the resulting olefins have been extensively studied by several research groups [210]. However, the state of gal- lium in these catalysts has not been elucidated yet. Various studies [9,10] show that only a small part of the protons is substituted by gallium ions upon calcination of catalysts pre- pared by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation.
Instead, gallium is mostly present as small oxide particles at the external surface of the zeolite micrograins. To increase * Corresponding author. Fax: +31-40-2455054.

Hensen). the extent of proton substitution by gallium, such zeolites can be reduced in a hydrogen or hydrocarbon atmosphere at elevated temperatures, i.e., around 773 K [28]. These treat- ments facilitate the migration of the reduced gallium species into the micropores of the zeolite particles resulting in more complete substitution of the acid protons.
The high mobility of gallium upon reduction is believed to be connected to the formation of unstable gaseous Ga2O oxide [5,6]. Subsequently, this oxide can react with acid pro- tons in the zeolite micropores: Ga2O3 + 2H2 Ga2O + 2H2O, Ga2O + 2ZO···H+ 2ZO···Ga+ + H2O.
(1) It has been put forward that univalent Ga+ cations are highly unstable [2,7]. Cooling a reduced sample in a hy- drogen atmosphere to room temperature would result in the oxidation of Ga+ by traces of residual water or framework 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2004 Elsevier Inc.

oxygen atoms with formation of (Ga(OH)2)+, (GaO)+ or even Ga2O3 species.
In the present study we investigated the state of gallium in reduced Ga/HZSM-5 zeolite by highly sensitive DRIFT spectroscopy using adsorbed CO as a molecular probe. Mod- ification of HZSM-5 with gallium was achieved by incipi- ent wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of gal- lium nitrate. The amount of gallium was chosen such that a Ga/Al atomic ratio of about unity was obtained. This im- plies that in principle all protons can be replaced by cationic gallium species. Before DRIFT measurements the zeolites were reduced in hydrogen at high temperature or oxidized by nitrous oxide after preliminary reduction in hydrogen.
Previously, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed carbon monoxide has been used for the identification of gallium species in isomorphously substituted gallosilicates with the MFI struc- ture mainly by Zecchinas group [11]. However, we do not know any other works where the CO probe was used for testing of the modifying gallium ions introduced in high silica zeolites by incipient wetness impregnation or ion ex- change.
2. Experimental
The hydrogen form of ZSM-5 was prepared by decom- position of the ammonium form of SM-55 zeolite (Alsi Penta, framework SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio equal to 4048) in an oxygen flow at 773 K for 5 h. Modification of the hydrogen form by gallium was carried out by incipient wet- ness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3.
The amount of modifying gallium ions was chosen to be 5 wt% corresponding to a Ga/Al atomic ratio of about unity.
The impregnated zeolite powder was dried in air at 373 K and pressed into thin pellets with dimensions 15 × 5 mm.
The pellets were then placed into a quartz part of the vac- uum cell equipped with an CaF2 window as shown in Fig. 1a Fig. 1. Layout of DRIFT equipment: (a) position of the zeolite pellet for vac- uum or redox pretreatments; (b) position of the zeolite pellet for DRIFTS measurements. and pretreated in the following manner. At first the zeolite was evacuated at 423 K for 2 h. Then the temperature was increased to 773 K at a heating rate of 3 K/min and the samples were further evacuated for 3 h followed by calci- nation in 70 Torr oxygen for 1 h. Finally, the zeolite was evacuated at 773 K and cooled in vacuo to room temper- ature. For reduction, the samples were exposed to 50 Torr hydrogen at 773 K. The exposure time was varied between 1 and 7 h. After such pretreatment the samples were character- ized by DRIFT spectra at room temperature as prepared or probed by adsorbed carbon monoxide at room temperature (carbon monoxide pressure was varied from 10 to 200 Torr).
Before CO adsorption hydrogen was evacuated at various temperatures. For spectral measurements the zeolite pellet was transferred from the quartz part of the vacuum cell to its opposite part equipped with the CaF2 window as shown in Fig. 1b. DRIFT spectra of the thin pellets were recorded in the presence of gaseous carbon monoxide with a Nicolet Impact 410 spectrophotometer by means of a home-made diffuse reflectance attachment. All of the spectra were con- verted into KubelkaMunk units. The reflection ability of the zeolite at the wavelength of 5000 cm1 was set equal to 0.9 unit and the background spectrum of the zeolite was subtracted.
3. Results
3.1. DRIFT spectra of gallium-modified samples in the
region of OH stretching vibrations and UVvis spectra of reduced samples After calcination in oxygen and evacuation at high tem- perature the DRIFT spectra of the gallium-modified samples were similar to those of the initial hydrogen form after a similar pretreatment. This indicates that the modifying gal- lium ions mainly form small Ga2O3 particles on the external surface of the zeolite grains or small neutral particles in the micropores. Substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by gallium ions in the zeolite micropores was only of a minor importance.
After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm1 gradually decreased. This indicates substitution of the bridg- ing hydroxyl groups by the modifying gallium ions. After prolonged reduction in hydrogen substitution of the acidic protons was practically complete (Fig. 2). Simultaneously,a new weak DRIFT band at 3665 cm1 appeared after the first hour of reduction. A similar band has been earlier ob- served after reduction of Ga/HZSM-5 in hydrogen and was ascribed to GaOH groups [12]. More prolonged reduction practically did not change the intensity of this band. Un- like gallium-modified samples, a similar high-temperature vacuum pretreatment or reduction in hydrogen of the non- modified HZSM-5 results in a much lower extent of dehy- droxylation (Fig. 3). This is obviously connected with the

The dispersion of Ga2O3 upon reduction in hydrogen is also found upon comparison of UVvis spectra of oxidized and reduced samples in Fig. 4. The spectrum of Ga/HZSM after calcination in oxygen is similar to that of Ga2O3,whereas the intensity of the charge-transfer band at approx- imately 245 nm connected to Ga2O3 particles has strongly decreased after reduction in hydrogen. This reduction of gal- lium oxide is in line with the results from DRIFT spectra that show the substitution of acidic hydroxyl groups by reduced gallium ions.
3.2. Formation of gallium hydrides upon high-temperature
hydrogen adsorption by reduced gallium ions Reduction of GaZSM-5 in hydrogen at 773 K and sub- sequent prolonged evacuation at 873 K did not show any Fig. 4.

These bands were also not observed after admission of hydrogen to the evacuated samples at room temperature. However, heating of such sam- ples in a hydrogen atmosphere to 773 K with subsequent cooling of the zeolite in hydrogen to room temperature re- sulted in the appearance of two bands with maxima at 2041 and 2059 cm1 (Fig. 5). We surmise that these bands relate to two different kinds of gallium hydrides. The band with the highest GaH stretching frequency appears at lower temper- atures compared to the other one. This points to the presence of multiple adsorption sites. Above 573 K the formation of hydrides with the lower stretching frequency of 2041 cm1 was predominant.
To obtain further insight into the stability of the hy- drides, a hydrogen desorption experiment was carried out 266

The corresponding DRIFT spectra that are shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the hydrides are stable upon evacuation below 573 K. The GaH bands start to dis- appear above 573 K and are lost at 773 K. The remaining weak band is additionally split into two components indicat- ing further inhomogeneity of the adsorption sites.
We also studied the formation of gallium hydrides upon fast and slow cooling of reduced samples in a hydrogen at- mosphere from 773 K to room temperature. The correspond- ing DRIFT spectra in the region of the GaH stretching vi- brations are shown in Fig. 7. These data indicate that rapid cooling in hydrogen atmosphere results in a lower amount of hydride species when compared to slow cooling. Thus,a very slow cooling rate (from 773 K to room temperature Fig. 8.

The CO pressure was 10 Torr. in 2 h) resulted in a maximum yield of gallium hydrides. In addition, a lower cooling rate resulted in a stronger increase of the amount of hydrides with the highest GaH stretching frequency compared to those with a lower stretching fre- quency. According to these results adsorption of hydrogen by reduced gallium species occurs only at high temperatures.
The resulting gallium hydride species are inhomogeneous and thermally relatively stable.
3.3. DRIFT spectra of carbon monoxide adsorbed by
HZSM-5 and GaZSM-5 Fig. 8 shows the DRIFT spectrum of carbon monoxide adsorbed by HZSM-5 at room temperature after calcination in oxygen at 773 K. The bands with maxima at 2168 and 2120 cm1 belong to two different isomeric forms of CO adsorption on acidic hydroxyl groups [13]. Their intensi- ties only moderately decreased upon vacuum pretreatment or calcination in oxygen. This is in agreement with the only moderately lower intensity after a similar pretreatment of the band from hydroxyl groups with a stretching frequency of 3610 cm1 in Fig. 3.
Infrared bands with maxima at 2223 cm1 and at 2188 2195 cm1 have been ascribed earlier to CO molecules interacting with low-coordinated Al3+ ions on the surface of small aluminum oxide or aluminum hydroxide particles produced upon partial dealumination of the zeolite frame- work by high-temperature pretreatment [13,14]. The band at 2223 cm1 has been also assigned to carbon monoxide perturbed by (Al=O)+ oxo-ions deriving from dealumina- tion [15,16]. These species may compensate the negatively charged aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra instead of the protons that were removed via dehydroxylation. Thus,calcination of HZSM-5 in oxygen at 773 K results only in a minor degree of dehydration and dealumination resulting either in the small particles of aluminum oxide or in substitu-

267 Fig. 9. DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed at a pressure of 10 Torr by Ga/HZSM-5 at room temperature: (1) after calcination in oxygen and evac- uation at 773 K, (2) after subsequent reduction in hydrogen at 773 K for 4 h and evacuation at this temperature. tion of the removed protons by (AlO)+ oxo-ions. This could be described by the following reactions:2(AlO2)···H+ H2O + (AlO2)···AlO+,(2a) 2(AlO2)···H+ H2O + Al2O3.
(2b) This conclusion is also supported by DRIFT spectra (Fig. 3) that point to the partial removal of protons, even after prolonged calcinations of the sample in oxygen.
The DRIFT spectrum of CO adsorbed on the calcined gallium-modified sample is also shown in Fig. 8. It is very similar to the spectrum of CO adsorbed by the nonmodified HZSM-5. In agreement with DRIFT spectra of OH groups in Fig. 2, somewhat lower intensities of the bands of ad- sorbed CO with the maxima at 2168 and 2120 cm1 also indicate the minor substitution of acidic protons by modi- fying gallium ions, whereas the lower intensity of the band at 2195 cm1 is evidence of the suppression of dealumina- tion. This conclusion is also supported by the lower intensity of the high-frequency band at 2223 cm1, whereas a slight negative shift (5 cm1) of its maximum may indicate sub- stitution of some protons by GaO+ species instead of AlO+ oxo-ions.
When the gallium-modified samples were reduced in hy- drogen at 773 K, we observed that the bands from car- bon monoxide adsorbed by hydroxyl groups at 2120 and 2168 cm1 did not appear after CO exposure at room tem- perature (Fig. 9). This coheres with the complete substitution of acidic protons by reduced Ga+ ions as inferred from the absence of the band related to bridging hydroxyl groups at 3610 cm1 in Fig. 2. Concomitantly, reduction results in a much higher intensity of the band around 2188 cm1 and also strongly decreased the intensity of the band with a max- imum at 2218 cm1 when compared to the oxidized sam- ple. This is also most likely related to the transformation of the oxidized species into reduced gallium ions. A band around 2218 cm1 has been previously assigned to edge ions in Ga2O3 [18], but could be also associated with cationic Fig. 10. DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed at pressures of (1) 10, (2) 50, and (3) 200 Torr by Ga/HZSM-5 after reduction in hydrogen at 773 K for 5 h (DRIFT spectra taken at room temperature).
(GaO)+ oxo-ions. Their reduction by hydrogen may result in formation of the low-coordinated univalent gallium or in different gallium hydrides: ZO···GaO+ + H2 ZO···Ga+ + H2O,(3) ZO···GaO+ + H2 ZO···HGaOH+,(4) ZO···GaO+ + 2H2 ZO···(GaH2)+ + H2O.
(5) Indeed, as follows from Figs. 57, DRIFTS measure- ments upon reduction indicate the formation of at least two different hydrides while according to Fig. 9, CO adsorption at higher pressures indicated the existence of several differ- ent sites connected with reduced gallium species.
Spectrum 1 in Fig. 10 corresponding to room temper- ature CO adsorption at the lowest pressure of 10 Torr is similar to that presented in Fig. 9. However, upon increas- ing CO pressures, the intensities of the weak bands at 2130 and 2147 cm1 strongly increased and at the highest pres- sure of 200 Torr the band around 2147 cm1 predominates.
Simultaneously, a new band appears at 2167 cm1 that was invisible at the low CO pressure. In contrast, the intensity of the band with the maximum at 2188 cm1 increased at higher CO pressures to a much smaller extent. Thus, as fol- lows from spectrum 3 in Fig. 3, instead of only one main band of CO adsorption by the reduced sample at the lowest pressure of 10 Torr, the DRIFT spectrum of CO adsorption at the highest pressure exhibits four different bands connected with reduced gallium species. The important argument for their assignment is provided by the DRIFT spectrum of CO adsorbed by the reduced sample that was subsequently ox- idized by N2O at 673 K and evacuated at 673 K (spec- trum 2 in Fig. 11). This oxidative treatment destroyed the bands of adsorbed CO with maxima around 2130, 2147,and 2188 cm1. Therefore, these bands are definitely con- nected with reduced gallium species, presumably with CO adsorption by the low-corrdinated Ga+ ions. In contrast,upon oxidation the band of adsorbed CO with the maximum 268

Fig. 11. DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed by Ga/HZSM-5 at a pressure 50 Torr after (1) reduction in hydrogen at 773 K for 5 h, (2) oxidation in N2O at 673 K, and (3) subsequent reduction of the oxidized sample in hy- drogen (DRIFT spectra taken at room temperature). at 2167 cm1 that has been ascribed to adsorption of carbon monoxide by hydroxyl groups increased in intensity. Simul- taneously, intensities of the DRIFT bands from hydroxyl groups in the OH stretching region also increased. Therefore,this band of adsorbed carbon monoxide most likely belongs to CO adsorption by protons resulting from oxidation of gal- lium dihydrides:(HGaH)+ + N2O (HGaOH)+ + N2.
(6) Thus, for the oxidized samples we have two different kinds of gallium species: the GaO+ oxo-ions with a stretching fre- quency of adsorbed CO equal to 2218 cm1 and (HGaOH)+ species with a CO stretching frequency of 21672170 cm1.
It also follows from Fig. 11 that the subsequent reduction and oxidation of gallium species is reversible.
Finally, in order to discriminate the low-corrdinated Ga+ ions from the gallium hydrides, we studied CO adsorption on the reduced gallium-modified sample that was evacuated after reduction in hydrogen at 823 K or slowly cooled to room temperature in hydrogen. The corresponding DRIFT spectra are shown in Fig. 12. Clearly, the intensity of the CO stretching bands is lower after cooling in hydrogen due to the screening of univalent gallium cations by the resulting hydrides.
4. Discussion
The present study confirms previous findings that reduc- tion of Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen results in the substitu- tion of acid protons by cationic Ga species. Our results also show that replacement of acidic protons by reaction with Ga2O is easier and more complete than by the species result- ing from dealumination. The modification of HZSM-5 by gallium suppressed dealumination that is thought to result in the positively charged (AlO)+ oxo-ions according to Eq. (2).
Fig. 12. DRIFT spectrum of CO adsorbed at room temperature at the pres- sure of 10 Torr by GaZSM-5 that was preliminary reduced in H2 at 773 K and evacuated at 823 K.
Suppression of dealumination for the gallium-modified sam- ples is then connected with compensation of the negatively charged aluminum-centered oxygen tetrahedra by gallium oxo-ions instead of (AlO)+ species. Another point worthy of note is that for a sample with a Ga/Al atomic ratio of unity all acid protons are replaced by gallium. This means that the distantly separated acidic protons must have been sub- stituted. Therefore, it is very likely that the cationic gallium species possess a single positive electric charge since neu- tralization of distantly separated negative charges by multi- valent cations is difficult to imagine.
After evacuation at high temperature the univalent cat- ionic gallium species exhibit DRIFT bands of weakly adsorbed CO with stretching frequencies of 2130 and 2147 cm1. Furthermore, hydrogen adsorption by such re- duced Ga+ species results in the formation of cationic gal- lium dihydride species [7]: ZO···Ga+ + H2 ZO···(GaH2)+.
(7) The presently observed stretching frequencies for these hy- drides (20402060 cm1) are somewhat higher than the value reported for hydrides on reduced silica-supported gal- lium oxide, i.e., 2020 cm1 [17]. The latter hydrides were ascribed to Gaδ+H species without indication of the va- lence state of gallium. This might explain the small differ- ence in the stretching frequencies.
The formation of gallium hydrides by adsorption of hy- drogen on univalent gallium cations is reversible by evacu- ation at 773 K. This observation tallies with the desorption peak of hydrogen from GaZSM-5 at about 770 K reported earlier in Ref. [19]. On the other hand, the formation of gallium hydrides is an activated process because they are ob- served only at temperatures in excess of 573 K. This explains the higher amount of hydrides after slow cooling to room temperature as compared to a fast cooling procedure (Fig. 7).
Fig. 12 shows that the formation of these hydrides prevents subsequent adsorption of carbon monoxide. This results in a much lower intensity of the bands of adsorbed CO around 2188 cm1.

269 Oxidative treatment of univalent gallium or gallium dihy- drides with N2O results in their oxidation into singly posi- tively charged oxo-ions: Ga+ + N2O GaO+ + N2,(8) GaH2++ 2N2O GaO+ + 2N2 + H2O.
(9) When reaction (9) applies, GaHOH+ species could be also formed in parallel according to Eq. (6). CO adsorption by GaO+ oxo-ions is associated with a stretching band at 2218 cm1 whereas adsorption by GaHOH+ ions leads to a band at 2170 cm1. One more band of adsorbed CO with a stretching frequency of 2188 cm1 most likely belongs to CO adsorption by low-coordinated gallium ions on the surface of the small gallium oxide particles that are formed upon modification of the parent hydrogen form with gallium concomitant with substitution by gallium of the acidic hy- droxyl groups.
As this study provides some new insight into the chem- istry of zeolite-occluded gallium, we will compare our in- terpretation to that proposed in other studies of Ga/ZSM-5.
The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]. The authors interpreted X-ray absorption data in the following way. Reduction of oc- tahedrally coordination Ga3+ ions leads to the formation of reduced univalent Ga+ ions or Ga metal. Subsequent cool- ing in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature resulted in the formation of Ga3+ ions either by oxidation of the re- duced species by traces of water present in the hydrogen flow or due to interaction with the zeolite framework oxy- gen. Similar redox changes of gallium were observed in the present work. However, we directly observed the formation of gallium hydrides by DRIFT measurements. Moreover, DRIFT spectra of adsorbed CO gave insight into coordina- tively unsaturated gallium species. Reduction of gallium at high temperatures leads to the formation of low-coordinated Ga+ ions and to dihydride species to some extent. The amount of the latter strongly increased after slow cooling of the gallium-modified samples to room temperature in hydro- gen. Therefore, we propose that oxidation of the univalent gallium ions does not proceed via traces of water but by the oxidative addition of hydrogen giving tervalent gallium hy- dride species.
5. Conclusions
All acid protons can be replaced by univalent Ga species upon reduction at 773 K of Ga/HZSM-5. The replacement of protons by Ga suppresses dealumination to a large extent.
Evacuation of a reduced sample at 773 K leads to coordi- natively unsaturated Ga+ ions. These ions can be reversibly oxidized by nitrous oxide at 673 K. On the other hand, cool- ing of a reduced sample in molecular hydrogen leads to the formation of gallium hydride species that compensate the negative framework charge. The latter species are quite sta- ble and can only be completely decomposed at relatively high temperature (773 K). Carbon monoxide probe DRIFT spectroscopy further allows the identification of the various Ga species in the micropore space of ZSM-5 zeolite. These results suggest that the earlier observed oxidation of reduced Ga/HZSM-5 can also be related to the oxidative addition of hydrogen.
