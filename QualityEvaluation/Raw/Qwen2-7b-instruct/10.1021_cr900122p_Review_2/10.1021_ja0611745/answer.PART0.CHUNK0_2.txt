<p>Compared to the conventional nonoxidative routes, the so-called oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has many advantages. For example, the ODH is thermodynamically favored even at low temperatures; it does not lead to the formation of coke and lower-molecular weight byproducts such as CO.</p>
<p>It is established that the ODH reaction on supported vanadium catalysts proceeds via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism 14,15 and the CH bond activation step is the rate-determining step. 16-19 The reaction mechanism can be described as (i) the reduction of the oxide surface by hydrocarbon and (ii) the subsequent reoxidation by the gas-phase oxygen.</p>
<p>Generally, there are three types of lattice oxygens on vanadium surfaces. (i) Singly coordinated terminal oxygen, O(1), which is a vanadyl oxygen (VO); (ii) two-coordinated oxygen, O(2); and (iii) three-coordinated oxygen, O(3).</p>
<p>The calculated reaction barriers of the methylene CH bond activation are 27.3 and 30.4 kcal/mol on the O(1) and the O(2) sites, respectively.</p>
<p>Propene can be readily formed through an i-propoxide on the O(2) site, releasing a H atom to a nearby O(2) or O(3) atom. The energy barrier is 22.0 kcal/mol.</p>
<p>Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than is the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene.</p>

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has several advantages over conventional non-oxidative routes, including thermodynamic favorability at low temperatures and prevention of coke and low-molecular-weight byproduct formation like CO.

2. The ODH reaction on supported vanadium catalysts follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, with the CH bond activation being the rate-determining step.

3. There are three types of lattice oxygens on vanadium surfaces: terminal oxygen (O(1)), two-coordinated oxygen (O(2)), and three-coordinated oxygen (O(3)).

4. The reaction barriers for methylene CH bond activation on the O(1) and O(2) sites are 27.3 and 30.4 kcal/mol, respectively.

5. Propene formation from i-propoxide on the O(2) site is straightforward, with an energy barrier of 22.0 kcal/mol.

6. On the V2O5(001) surface, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than the O(2) atom, but the propoxide on the O(2) is more easily converted to propene.

1. 与传统的非氧化裂解路径相比，所谓的氧化脱氢（ODH）具有许多优势。例如，ODH即使在低温下也具有热力学优势；它不会导致焦炭和较低分子量副产品如CO的形成。

2. 支撑型钒催化剂上的ODH反应遵循马斯-范-克列伦机制，其中CH键活化步骤是决定性步骤。反应机理可以描述为(i)由烃类还原氧化物表面和(ii)随后由气相氧的氧化。

3. 钒表面通常有三种类型的氧原子：终端氧（O(1)），两个协同氧（O(2)）和三个协同氧（O(3)）。

4. 甲基CH键激活的反应壁垒在O(1)和O(2)点上分别是27.3和30.4 kcal/mol。

5. 从i丙酸酯在O(2)点上形成丙烯是一个直接过程，释放一个氢原子到附近的O(2)或O(3)原子上，能量壁垒为22.0 kcal/mol。

6. 在V2O5(001)表面上，端氧O(1)在CH键活化中比O(2)原子稍微活跃一些，但O(2)点上的丙酸酯更容易转化为丙烯。
