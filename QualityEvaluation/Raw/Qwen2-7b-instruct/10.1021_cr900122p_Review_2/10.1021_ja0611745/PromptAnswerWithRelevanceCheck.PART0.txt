在V2O5(001)表面的各种位点上，丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应机制涉及探索初始CH键激活的三种反应机制。在O(1)位点，两种自由基和插入氧机制都是可行的，而在O(2)位点，插入氧机制明显更优选于其他机制。计算得到的甲基CH键活化能壁垒分别是27.3和30.4 kcal/mol在O(1)和O(2)位点。通过O(2)位点上的i-丙酸酯形成丙烯是容易的，释放一个H原子到附近的O(2)或O(3)原子上，能量壁垒为22.0 kcal/mol。总的来说，在V2O5(001)表面上，范德华氧原子O(1)对CH键激活略强于O(2)原子，但在O(2)位点的丙酸酯更容易进一步分解成丙烯。

<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on single-crystal V2O5(001) is studied by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetics and pathways for the propane to propene conversion are determined. We show that (i) the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. (ii) Compared to that at the terminal O site, the propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene.</p>
<p>With all the results presented, we summarized the overall energy profiles of the whole propane ODH reaction in Figure 7 where only the most feasible pathways on the O(1) and the O(2) sites are shown. It can be seen clearly that the reaction energy profile over the O(1) site is only 3.1 kcal/mol lower than that over the O(2) site. However, at the O(1) site the propene formation process (Ea = 30.9 kcal/mol) is much more difficult than that at the O(2) site due to the high stability of i-propoxide at the O(1).</p>
<p>To fully compare the reaction rate over the O(1) and O(2) site, we have to estimate the effect of the entropy term (exp[ΔS/R]) that affects the preexponential factor in the rate equation. The current DFT methods, however, cannot compute the entropy term accurately (mainly due to the errors in calculating the low-frequency vibrational modes), which is the reason that most computational studies on catalytic reactions did not calculate the term from first principles.</p>
<p>Since the initial CH bond activation is a direct dissociation process, the initial chance of a propane to hit an O(1) and an O(2) is similar to that for hitting V2O5(001). Once the CH is dissociated, the i-propoxide species at the O(1) site is slow in further decomposition that leads to the propene formation and desorption, while the i-propoxide species at the O(2) site can readily go further to produce propene. As the residency time of the i-propoxide at the O(1) site can be rather long, this will open up the side-reaction channels, such as a complete oxidation to undesired COx products.</p>

1. The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on a single-crystal V2O5(001) surface using periodic density functional theory calculations. The calculations determine the energetics and pathways for the propane to propene conversion. The study reveals that the terminal and bridging lattice O atoms on the surface can activate the CH bond of propane with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. Single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene.

2. The overall energy profiles of the propane ODH reaction show that the reaction energy profile over the O(1) site is only 3.1 kcal/mol lower than that over the O(2) site. However, at the O(1) site, the propene formation process (Ea = 30.9 kcal/mol) is much more difficult than that at the O(2) site due to the high stability of i-propoxide at the O(1).

3. The reaction rate over the O(1) and O(2) sites cannot be fully compared due to the limitations in accurately calculating the entropy term using current DFT methods.

4. The initial CH bond activation is a direct dissociation process, and the initial chance of a propane molecule hitting an O(1) or O(2) site is similar. Once the CH bond is dissociated, the i-propoxide species at the O(1) site is slow in further decomposition, leading to propene formation and desorption. In contrast, the i-propoxide species at the O(2) site readily goes further to produce propene. The long residency time of the i-propoxide at the O(1) site opens up side-reaction channels, potentially leading to the formation of undesired COx products.

1. 研究重点是通过周期性密度泛函理论计算，研究单晶V2O5(001)表面的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。计算确定了丙烷转化为丙烯的能量和途径。研究表明，表面的终端氧原子和桥接氧原子可以以相似的活化能激活丙烷的CH键。在终端O点，CH键激活可能同时存在自由基和氧插入两种路径，而仅在桥接O点可行的是氧插入机制。在桥接O点，从丙氧化物产生丙烯更容易，因为丙氧化物在桥接O上的结合力较弱。单晶V2O5(001)不是良好的催化剂，因为终端O过于活跃，无法释放丙烯。

2. 总体能量图显示，O(1)点的反应能量图比O(2)点低3.1 kcal/mol。然而，在O(1)点，从丙氧化物生成丙烯的过程（Ea = 30.9 kcal/mol）比在O(2)点更困难，原因是O(1)点的丙氧化物稳定性更高。

3. 由于当前第一性原理计算方法在准确计算熵项方面存在限制，反应率在O(1)和O(2)点之间无法完全比较。

4. 初始CH键激活是一个直接解离过程，丙烷分子击中O(1)或O(2)点的机会相似。一旦CH键解离，O(1)点的丙氧化物进一步分解缓慢，导致丙烯形成和脱附。相比之下，O(2)点的丙氧化物可以进一步生成丙烯。O(1)点丙氧化物的长期停留时间打开了副反应通道，可能形成不希望的COx产物。

<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on single-crystal V2O5(001) is studied by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</p>

<p>The reaction mechanism can be described as (i) the reduction of the oxide surface by hydrocarbon and (ii) the subsequent reoxidation by the gas-phase oxygen.</p>
<p>Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity.</p>
<p>To achieve high activity and selectivity, the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial.</p>
<p>At low loadings, vanadium is molecularly dispersed, whereas at higher loadings V2O5 crystallites start to appear.</p>
<p>To understand the mechanism of the ODH reaction, it is crucial to know where the reaction occurs.</p>
<p>Generally, there are three types of lattice oxygens on vanadium surfaces.</p>
<p>The O(2) and O(3) bridge two and three vanadium atoms, respectively.</p>
<p>Recently, Gilardoni et al. investigated the ODH reaction of propane on a small V2O5 cluster (V4O14H8) by DFT, and the O(1) is found to be more active (Fukui function).</p>
<p>In an aim to gain a deeper insight into the ODH mechanism, here we have studied the conversion of propane to propene on V2O5(001).</p>
<p>In particular, the catalytic roles of different surface O species are investigated in detail.</p>
<p>V2O5(001) is selected as the model catalyst since V2O5(001) is the most stable surface exposed in crystalline V2O5, and experimental studies also suggested that the mechanism of propane ODH on bulk V2O5 is the same as that on supported vanadium catalysts.</p>
<p>The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated according to the expression where EX is the DFT-total energy of the X system.</p>
<p>Transition states (TS) were searched with the climbing-images nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) algorithm.</p>
<p>For example, for the reaction barrier of a CH bond breaking, the Ea and ΔH is different by <4 kcal/mol at temperatures such as 800 K (from our cluster-model calculations according to ref 55).</p>
<p>The breaking of a propane CH bond can occur in the methyl or the methylene groups of propane, and the product is n-propoxide or i-propoxide species on the surface, respectively.</p>
<p>Experimentally, isotopic studies by Chen et al. found the similar primary dehydrogenation rates for CH3CD2CH3 and CD3CD2CD3, which indicates that only the methylene CH bond is involved in the rate-determining step.</p>
<p>Theoretical study by Gilardoni et al. also showed that the formation of i-propoxide is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored.</p>
<p>Thus, in this work we have focused on the CH bond activation leading to i-propoxide formation.</p>
<p>To provide a deeper insight, we have calculated the heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond at a terminal O(1) site; two reaction paths are considered.</p>
<p>In process 1, the propyl group and the H atom bind with the terminal oxygen and the vanadium, respectively.</p>
<p>The heterolytic cleavage of CH bond results in a negatively charged H atom.</p>
<p>The transition state of the reaction has been located, and the reaction barrier is calculated to be 80.7 kcal/mol.</p>
<p>For the homolytic cleavage, the chemical reaction can be represented as</p>
<p>Because of two lattice O atoms involved, a great complexity is encountered in considering the reaction occurring on V2O5(001).</p>
<p>Furthermore, for every OO combination, we considered three possible mechanisms, namely, oxo-insertion mechanism (A), concerted mechanism (B), and radical mechanism (C).</p>
<p>The first O, O(m), denotes the O site where a propane attacks the surface initially.</p>
<p>In the O(1)O(1)-A pathway, the CH bond is activated via a transition state TS1 (shown in Figure 3) by inserting the lattice O into the CH bond.</p>
<p>The O(1)O(2)-A and O(1)O(3)-A pathways differ from the O(1)O(1)-A pathway only in the step of H atom migration.</p>
<p>The O(1)O(n)-B pathway is less favorable compared to the O(1)O(1)-A.</p>
<p>The O(1)O(n)-C pathway is the best among the O(1)O(n)-X pathways.</p>
<p>On the O(2) site, the energetically most favored pathway is found to be O(2)O(2)-A.</p>
<p>From Figure 4, it can be seen that the process of forming i-propoxide on the O(2) site will cost 9.6 kcal/mol.</p>
<p>Therefore, compared to the pathways on the O(1) site, the dissociative adsorption on the O(2) site is unfavorable in thermodynamics, but it is competitive in kinetics.</p>
<p>On the O(3) site, the CH bond activation is the least possible because the O(3) is three-fold coordinated and thus the most inert.</p>
<p>Additionally, the local bonding ability of the lattice oxygen atoms has been measured using an H atom as the probe.</p>
<p>By contrast, the O(1) atom is the most active with the strongest eletrophilic tendency.</p>
<p>Our Bader spin-charge analysis showed that the net spins are mainly located on the V's that directly link with the reacting lattice O's, while the other V's on the surface also obtain a small fraction of net spin moments.</p>
<p>The O(1) can gain more electrons than the O(2), consistent with the above analysis.</p>
<p>Considering that there is strong spin-localization on V, which is mainly due to d-states, we can expect that the original VO dp covalent bonding is weakened and yields nonbonding spin-polarized d states on V.</p>
<p>Although the O(2) has less ability to be reduced compared to the O(1), the surface V atoms and other nonreacting O atoms can help to accommodate electrons for CH bond breaking at the O(2) site.</p>
<p>Compared to the O(1) atom, the O(2) atom has a better contact with other surface atoms: the O(2) has two V's as first neighbors, and it sits at the four-coordination bonding plane of V, while the O(1) only bonds directly with one V, and it is outside the four-coordination bonding plane.</p>
<p>Knowing the electronic structures of the O(1) and O(2), we can also rationalize their preferences for the different CH bond activation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Our results showed that the electron delocalization does contribute to enhance the reducibility of the surface O atoms such as the O(2).</p>
<p>Starting from an i-propoxide on the O(2) site, the H can similarly migrate to the nearby O(1), O(2), and O(3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also examined the possibility of the O(2)HO(2)H coupling.</p>
<p>With all the results presented, we summarized the overall energy profiles of the whole propane ODH reaction in Figure 7 where only the most feasible pathways on the O(1) and the O(2) sites are shown.</p>
<p>To fully compare the reaction rate over the O(1) and O(2) site, we have to estimate the effect of the entropy term (exp[ΔS/R]) that affects the preexponential factor in the rate equation.</p>
<p>Since the initial CH bond activation is a direct dissociation process, the initial chance of a propane to hit an O(1) and an O(2) is similar to that for hitting V2O5(001).</p>
<p>For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface.</p>
<p>In summary, we present a comprehensive survey of the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane over various sites on the V2O5(001) surface by using periodic DFT methods.</p>

1. The document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on a V2O5(001) surface. The CH bond activation can occur at terminal, bridging, and three-fold coordinated oxygen sites. Terminal oxygen allows both radical and oxo-insertion pathways, while only oxo-insertion is feasible at the bridging oxygen. Propene formation is easier at the bridging oxygen due to weaker binding of propoxide. Single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst because of the terminal oxygen's excessive reactivity.

2. The document analyzes the activity of different oxygen sites on V2O5(001) for propane ODH. Terminal oxygen activates the CH bond with similar energy to bridging oxygen but is less favorable for propene formation. Bridging oxygen activates the CH bond with higher energy but facilitates propene formation. Three-fold coordinated oxygen is inert. The document also discusses the mechanisms of CH bond activation and propene formation.

3. The document presents a comprehensive study of the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane over various sites on the V2O5(001) surface using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Three reaction mechanisms are explored for the initial CH bond activation. On the O(1) site, both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is much more preferred compared to others. The O(3) site is inert in the CH bond activation.

4. The document concludes that the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene. This provides valuable insights into relating the properties of lattice O to the catalyst activity. For the ODH reaction, the high activities in activating CH bond and in producing propene are two properties acting negatively to each other. It is expected that the activity of the oxide-supported vanadium can be tuned by controlling the polymerization extent and the support materials.

5. The document presents a comprehensive survey of the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane over various sites on the V2O5(001) surface by using periodic DFT methods. Three reaction mechanisms have been explored for the initial CH bond activation. On the O(1) site, both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is much more preferred compared to others. The O(3) site is inert in the CH bond activation. The calculated reaction barriers of the methylene CH bond activation are 27.3 and 30.4 kcal/mol on the O(1) and the O(2) sites, respectively. By taking into account the zero-point energy and the thermal energy correction that would increase our calculated values by <4 cal/mol, our values are a little higher than the experimental value of 24 kcal/mol for ODH reaction occurred on ZrO2-supported vanadium catalyst. The discrepancy can be partly attributed to the difference between the single-crystal model and the practical supported catalyst.

1. 文档讨论了丙烷在V2O5(001)表面的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。CH键激活可以在终端、桥接和三重连接氧原子位置发生。终端氧允许两种路径同时进行：自由基和氧插入，而仅在桥接氧上可行氧插入。在桥接氧上形成丙烯更容易，因为丙氧基的结合较弱。单晶V2O5(001)不是一种好的催化剂，因为它使用了过量的终端氧来释放丙烯。

2. 文档分析了V2O5(001)表面上不同氧位点对丙烷ODH的活性。终端氧激活CH键的能量与桥接氧相似，但不利于丙烯形成。桥接氧激活CH键的能量较高，但有利于丙烯形成。三重连接氧是惰性的。文档还讨论了CH键激活和丙烯形成的机制。

3. 文档通过周期性密度泛函理论（DFT）方法对丙烷在V2O5(001)表面各种位置上的氧化脱氢反应进行了全面研究。探索了初始CH键激活的三种反应机制。在O(1)位点，两种自由基和氧插入机制都是可行的。在O(2)位点，氧插入机制明显优于其他机制。O(3)位点在CH键激活中是惰性的。

4. 文档得出结论，在V2O5(001)表面上，范德华氧O(1)稍高于O(2)原子在CH键激活中的反应性。然而，O(2)位点上的丙氧基更容易进一步分解为丙烯。这提供了有关栅格氧性质与催化剂活性之间的关系的宝贵见解。对于ODH反应，激活CH键和产生丙烯的高活性是相互对立的两个属性。预计可以通过控制聚合程度和支持材料来调整氧化支持的钒的活性。

5. 文档通过周期性密度泛函理论方法对丙烷在V2O5(001)表面各种位置上的氧化脱氢反应进行了全面调查。在O(1)位点，两种自由基和氧插入机制都是可行的。在O(2)位点，氧插入机制明显优于其他机制。O(3)位点在CH键激活中是惰性的。计算的甲基CH键激活的反应壁垒分别为27.3和30.4 kcal/mol在O(1)和O(2)位点上。考虑到零点能量和热能校正，我们的值会增加约4卡路里/摩尔，因此比在锆酸盐支持的钒催化剂上发生的ODH反应的实验值24 kcal/mol稍微高一些。这种差异部分归因于单晶模型和实际支持催化剂之间的差异。

1. 对于初始CH键活化，O(1)位点上的自由基和氧插入机制是可行的，而O(2)位点上更倾向于氧插入机制。O(3)位点在这一过程中是惰性的。
2. 从i-丙氧基在O(2)位点形成丙烯的能量壁垒为22.0 kcal/mol。
3. V2O5(001)表面的范德华氧O(1)在CH键活化中比O(2)原子稍微活性更高。然而，O(2)位点上的丙氧基更容易分解成丙烯。
4. 通过调整聚合度和支撑材料，可以调节氧化物支持的钒催化剂的活性，以平衡活化CH键和产生丙烯的特性。
