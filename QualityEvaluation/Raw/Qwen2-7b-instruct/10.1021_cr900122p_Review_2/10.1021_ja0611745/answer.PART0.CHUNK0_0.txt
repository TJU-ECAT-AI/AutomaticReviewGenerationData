[1] "Three reaction mechanisms have been explored for the initial CH bond activation. On the O(1) site, both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is much more preferred compared to the others."
[2] "The calculated reaction barriers of the methylene CH bond activation are 27.3 and 30.4 kcal/mol on the O(1) and the O(2) sites, respectively."
[3] "Propene can be readily formed through an i-propoxide on the O(2) site, releasing a H atom to a nearby O(2) or O(3) atom. The energy barrier is 22.0 kcal/mol."
[4] "Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than is the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene."

The mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane over various sites on the V2O5(001) surface involves exploring three reaction mechanisms for the initial CH bond activation. On the O(1) site, both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible, while on the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is much more preferred compared to the others. The calculated reaction barriers for the methylene CH bond activation are 27.3 and 30.4 kcal/mol on the O(1) and O(2) sites, respectively. Propene can be readily formed through an i-propoxide on the O(2) site, releasing a H atom to a nearby O(2) or O(3) atom, with an energy barrier of 22.0 kcal/mol. Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than the O(2) atom, but the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene.

在V2O5(001)表面的各种位点上，丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应机制涉及探索初始CH键激活的三种反应机制。在O(1)位点，两种自由基和插入氧机制都是可行的，而在O(2)位点，插入氧机制明显更优选于其他机制。计算得到的甲基CH键活化能壁垒分别是27.3和30.4 kcal/mol在O(1)和O(2)位点。通过O(2)位点上的i-丙酸酯形成丙烯是容易的，释放一个H原子到附近的O(2)或O(3)原子上，能量壁垒为22.0 kcal/mol。总的来说，在V2O5(001)表面上，范德华氧原子O(1)对CH键激活略强于O(2)原子，但在O(2)位点的丙酸酯更容易进一步分解成丙烯。
