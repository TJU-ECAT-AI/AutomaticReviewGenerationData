[1] "Three reaction mechanisms have been explored for the initial CH bond activation. On the O(1) site, both the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible. On the O(2) site, the oxo-insertion mechanism is much more preferred compared to the others. The O(3) site is inert in the CH bond activation."
[2] "Propene can be readily formed through an i-propoxide on the O(2) site, releasing a H atom to a nearby O(2) or O(3) atom. The energy barrier is 22.0 kcal/mol."
[3] "Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than is the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene."
[4] "For the ODH reaction, the high activities in activating CH bond and in producing propene are two properties acting negatively to each other. It is expected that the activity of the oxide-supported vanadium can be tuned by controlling the polymerization extent and the support materials."

1. For the initial CH bond activation, the radical and oxo-insertion mechanisms are feasible on the O(1) site, while the oxo-insertion mechanism is much more preferred on the O(2) site. The O(3) site is inert in this process.
2. Propene formation from i-propoxide on the O(2) site occurs readily with an energy barrier of 22.0 kcal/mol.
3. The vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation compared to the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) site is easier to decompose into propene.
4. The activities of the oxide-supported vanadium catalysts can be tuned by adjusting the polymerization extent and support materials to balance the properties of activating the CH bond and producing propene.

1. 对于初始CH键活化，O(1)位点上的自由基和氧插入机制是可行的，而O(2)位点上更倾向于氧插入机制。O(3)位点在这一过程中是惰性的。
2. 从i-丙氧基在O(2)位点形成丙烯的能量壁垒为22.0 kcal/mol。
3. V2O5(001)表面的范德华氧O(1)在CH键活化中比O(2)原子稍微活性更高。然而，O(2)位点上的丙氧基更容易分解成丙烯。
4. 通过调整聚合度和支撑材料，可以调节氧化物支持的钒催化剂的活性，以平衡活化CH键和产生丙烯的特性。
