<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on single-crystal V2O5(001) is studied by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetics and pathways for the propane to propene conversion are determined. We show that (i) the CH bond of propane can be activated by both the terminal and the bridging lattice O atoms on the surface with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. (ii) Compared to that at the terminal O site, the propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. It is concluded that single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene.</p>
<p>With all the results presented, we summarized the overall energy profiles of the whole propane ODH reaction in Figure 7 where only the most feasible pathways on the O(1) and the O(2) sites are shown. It can be seen clearly that the reaction energy profile over the O(1) site is only 3.1 kcal/mol lower than that over the O(2) site. However, at the O(1) site the propene formation process (Ea = 30.9 kcal/mol) is much more difficult than that at the O(2) site due to the high stability of i-propoxide at the O(1).</p>
<p>To fully compare the reaction rate over the O(1) and O(2) site, we have to estimate the effect of the entropy term (exp[ΔS/R]) that affects the preexponential factor in the rate equation. The current DFT methods, however, cannot compute the entropy term accurately (mainly due to the errors in calculating the low-frequency vibrational modes), which is the reason that most computational studies on catalytic reactions did not calculate the term from first principles.</p>
<p>Since the initial CH bond activation is a direct dissociation process, the initial chance of a propane to hit an O(1) and an O(2) is similar to that for hitting V2O5(001). Once the CH is dissociated, the i-propoxide species at the O(1) site is slow in further decomposition that leads to the propene formation and desorption, while the i-propoxide species at the O(2) site can readily go further to produce propene. As the residency time of the i-propoxide at the O(1) site can be rather long, this will open up the side-reaction channels, such as a complete oxidation to undesired COx products.</p>

1. The study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on a single-crystal V2O5(001) surface using periodic density functional theory calculations. The calculations determine the energetics and pathways for the propane to propene conversion. The study reveals that the terminal and bridging lattice O atoms on the surface can activate the CH bond of propane with similar activation energies. At the terminal O site, both the radical and the oxo-insertion pathways are likely for the CH bond activation, while only the oxo-insertion mechanism is feasible at the bridging O site. The propene production from the propoxide at the bridging O site is much easier due to the weaker binding of propoxide at the bridging O. Single-crystal V2O5(001) is not a good catalyst due to the terminal O being too active to release propene.

2. The overall energy profiles of the propane ODH reaction show that the reaction energy profile over the O(1) site is only 3.1 kcal/mol lower than that over the O(2) site. However, at the O(1) site, the propene formation process (Ea = 30.9 kcal/mol) is much more difficult than that at the O(2) site due to the high stability of i-propoxide at the O(1).

3. The reaction rate over the O(1) and O(2) sites cannot be fully compared due to the limitations in accurately calculating the entropy term using current DFT methods.

4. The initial CH bond activation is a direct dissociation process, and the initial chance of a propane molecule hitting an O(1) or O(2) site is similar. Once the CH bond is dissociated, the i-propoxide species at the O(1) site is slow in further decomposition, leading to propene formation and desorption. In contrast, the i-propoxide species at the O(2) site readily goes further to produce propene. The long residency time of the i-propoxide at the O(1) site opens up side-reaction channels, potentially leading to the formation of undesired COx products.

1. 研究重点是通过周期性密度泛函理论计算，研究单晶V2O5(001)表面的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。计算确定了丙烷转化为丙烯的能量和途径。研究表明，表面的终端氧原子和桥接氧原子可以以相似的活化能激活丙烷的CH键。在终端O点，CH键激活可能同时存在自由基和氧插入两种路径，而仅在桥接O点可行的是氧插入机制。在桥接O点，从丙氧化物产生丙烯更容易，因为丙氧化物在桥接O上的结合力较弱。单晶V2O5(001)不是良好的催化剂，因为终端O过于活跃，无法释放丙烯。

2. 总体能量图显示，O(1)点的反应能量图比O(2)点低3.1 kcal/mol。然而，在O(1)点，从丙氧化物生成丙烯的过程（Ea = 30.9 kcal/mol）比在O(2)点更困难，原因是O(1)点的丙氧化物稳定性更高。

3. 由于当前第一性原理计算方法在准确计算熵项方面存在限制，反应率在O(1)和O(2)点之间无法完全比较。

4. 初始CH键激活是一个直接解离过程，丙烷分子击中O(1)或O(2)点的机会相似。一旦CH键解离，O(1)点的丙氧化物进一步分解缓慢，导致丙烯形成和脱附。相比之下，O(2)点的丙氧化物可以进一步生成丙烯。O(1)点丙氧化物的长期停留时间打开了副反应通道，可能形成不希望的COx产物。
