[1] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great influence on the catalysts behavior. Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
[3] "Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demonstrated that the presence of vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of species without terminal V=O sites leads to the formation of complete oxidation products."
[4] "In a recent study [15], in which silica supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts were compared, it was seen that methane conversion appeared to be related to disperse isolated surface metal oxide species, with the surface vanadium oxide species being more reactive than molybdenum oxide species."
[5] "On the other hand, it has been reported that both active oxygen ions and Brönsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation [18,19]. This fact explains the difference between the results obtained in this work for the NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5 zeolites."
[6] "Likewise, it has been demonstrated that in the calcination step a partial redistribution of the tungsten species is produced."
[7] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading."

1. The direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or methanol, has been extensively researched due to its potential to replace traditional multi-step industrial processes.
2. The behavior of catalysts is significantly influenced by the nature and dispersion of metal oxide phases. Surface species dispersion and metal loading impact methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity.
3. Vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites are crucial for the oxidation to oxygenates, while species without these sites lead to complete oxidation products.
4. Surface vanadium oxide species are more reactive than molybdenum oxide species in comparison tests of silica-supported MoO3 and V2O5 catalysts.
5. Both active oxygen ions and Brönsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 zeolite act as active centers for methane activation, explaining the differences in results between NaZSM-5 and HZSM-5 zeolites.
6. Redistribution of tungsten species occurs during the calcination step.
7. Formaldehyde selectivity is dependent on the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is affected by metal loading.
