Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%.

The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, UV diffuse reectance spectroscopy, BET, TPR and TPD of ammonia. Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. At high contents, a decrease in BET areas due to the partial blocking up of the channels of the zeolite and a lessening of the number of acid sites were observed.

It was found that supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. HCOH selectivity seems to be dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst.

The nature of the supported species formed in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst, three types of tungsten species may be formed: isolated tetrahedra WO2
4 species grafted to the support, surface polymeric species such as polytungstates with W(VI) in octahedral coordination and WO3 crystallites. 

The UV diffuse reectance spectra (Fig. 1) show that these three species are formed in the W/HZSM-5 catalyst, although the relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. So, for tungsten loading lower than 4.0%, monomeric species are predominant though polymeric species and WO3 crystallites (W loading higher than 2.4%) are present to a minor extent.

For the lowest tungsten loaded catalysts (ZW0.3) the HCOH yield is noticeable. The decrease in methane conversion with respect to the HZSM-5 support obtained for the low loaded catalysts (up to 2.4%) could be due to the partial blocking of the active centers of the zeolite. For higher tungsten loading methane conversion increases indicating that the surface tungsten oxide phase generates own active sites able to activate gas-phase oxygen. 

The TOF values have been calculated under the assumption that all the supported metal is active. Supporting the above hypothesis it can be seen that methane TOF decreases sharply up to 2.4% tungsten loading and slightly for higher loading. Formaldehyde TOF also decreases sharply up to 2.4%, this decrease then being very low. This trend can be attributed to the increase in the amount of polymeric tungsten oxide species in the catalyst with increasing tungsten loading. It causes both an increase in the aggregation of polymeric tungsten species, lessening the number of exposed tungsten sites, and a decrease in the dispersion.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to selectively convert alkanes to valuable products, the stability and longevity of the catalysts, and the energy efficiency of the reactions. The presence of active sites for specific reactions, such as the ability of the W/HZSM-5 catalyst to convert methane to formaldehyde, is crucial. The dispersion and nature of the metal oxide species, as well as the interaction between the metal and the support, play significant roles in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their potential to replace or improve existing industrial processes, reducing costs and environmental impact. The characterization techniques used, such as XRD, UV diffuse reectance spectroscopy, BET, TPR, and TPD of ammonia, help in understanding the interaction between the metal oxide phase and the support, leading to optimized catalyst design and performance.
