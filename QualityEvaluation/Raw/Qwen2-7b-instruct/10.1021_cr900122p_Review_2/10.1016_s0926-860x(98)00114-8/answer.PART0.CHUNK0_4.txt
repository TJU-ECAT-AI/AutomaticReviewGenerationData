[1] "Among the different routes proposed during the previous years, the direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol, has been one of the most studied since it could potentially substitute the conventional three step' industrial process."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great influence on the catalysts behavior. Banares et al. [13,14] and Faraldos et al. [15] have reported that methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity are dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."
[3] "Likewise, it can be shown up that the total acidity of NaZW9 sample is negligible."
[4] "This latter effect would be the most important at the highest loading. Again, these observations are in agreement with the observed for Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst [18,19]."
[5] "Moreover, the active sites of the HZSM-5 lead to CO selectively and no formaldehyde formation is observed. So, it is clear that the active centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase."

1. The direct partial oxidation of methane to C1 oxygenates, formaldehyde or methanol has been extensively studied due to its potential to replace the conventional three-step industrial process.
2. The behavior of metal oxide catalysts, including their methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity, is significantly influenced by the metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species.
3. The NaZW9 sample displays negligible total acidity.
4. The aggregation of polymeric tungsten species becomes more pronounced with increasing tungsten loading, affecting the dispersion and reactivity of the catalyst.
5. The active centers for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 catalysts are located in the supported tungsten oxide phase.
