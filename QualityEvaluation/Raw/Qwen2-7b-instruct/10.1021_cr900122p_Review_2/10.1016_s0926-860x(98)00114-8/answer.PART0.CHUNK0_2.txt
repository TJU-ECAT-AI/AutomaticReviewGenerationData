[1] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahe- dral W2 4 species probably grafted to the Bro nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites. The relative amounts of these three types of species changes sig- nificantly with tungsten loading."
[2] "The catalytic result point out that the W/HZSM-5 catalyst is active for the partial oxidation to methane to formaldehyde. HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formalde- hyde production."
[3] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading."

1. Three types of supported tungsten species exist in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: tetrahedral W2 4 species grafted to the zeolite's acid sites, octahedral polymeric species like polytungstates and WO3 crystallites. Their proportions vary significantly with tungsten content.
2. W/HZSM-5 catalysts are effective for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. Zeolite HZSM-5 excels in methane conversion but doesn't generate formaldehyde.
3. Formaldehyde selectivity correlates with the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is affected by the metal loading.

1. W/HZSM-5催化剂中有三种类型的支持钨物种：可能附着在沸石酸位上的四面体W2 4物种，八面体聚钨物种如聚钨酸盐和WO3晶粒。它们的比例随钨含量显著变化。
2. W/HZSM-5催化剂适用于甲烷部分氧化为甲醛。HZSM-5沸石在甲烷转化方面表现出色，但不生成甲醛。
3. 甲醛选择性与钨氧化物相的分散度有关，后者受金属负载的影响。
