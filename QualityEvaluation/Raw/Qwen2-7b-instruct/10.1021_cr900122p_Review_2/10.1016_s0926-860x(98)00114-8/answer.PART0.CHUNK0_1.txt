Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde using molecular oxygen as oxidant was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with tungsten loading varying from 0.3% to 11.9%. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, UV diffuse reectance spectroscopy, BET, TPR and TPD of ammonia. Three different types of supported species were detected: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, octahedral polymeric species and WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. At high contents, a decrease in BET areas due to the partial blocking up of the channels of the zeolite and a lessening of the number of acid sites were observed. It was found that supported tungsten oxide phase possesses active sites to partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. HCOH selectivity seems to be dependent on the dispersion and the nature of the tungsten oxide species in the catalyst.

The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde was studied over W/HZSM-5 catalysts with different tungsten loadings. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques, revealing three types of supported tungsten species: tetrahedral monomeric, octahedral polymeric, and WO3 crystallites. The amount of each species varies with tungsten loading, affecting the catalyst's activity and selectivity for formaldehyde production.

The nature of the supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites. The relative amount of each one varies significantly with the tungsten loading. At low contents, tetrahedral species predominate and are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading, the amount and size of the polytungstate species increase gradually, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of the HZMS-5 zeolite.

The supported species can be tetrahedrally coordinated W(VI) species, octahedrally coordinated polytungstate species, or WO3 crystallites. The relative quantity of each varies greatly with the tungsten loading. At low concentrations, tetrahedral species are predominant and largely situated within the zeolite channels. For higher loading, the quantity and size of polytungstate species grow progressively, leading to dispersion reduction and partial channel blocking of the HZMS-5 zeolite.

The catalytic activity point out that the W/HZSM-5 catalyst is active for the partial oxidation to methane to formaldehyde. HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formaldehyde production. Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading.

The catalytic performance indicates that the W/HZSM-5 catalyst is effective for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The HZSM-5 zeolite exhibits greater methane conversion capability but does not generate formaldehyde. Formaldehyde selectivity appears to correlate with the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is, in turn, affected by the metal loading.

The mechanism of the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde with molecular oxygen over silica supported oxide catalysts has been widely investigated. However, the participation of lattice or surface activated gas-phase oxygen in the formaldehyde formation is not clear. It seems that the oxygen activation over the catalyst surface plays a fundamental role in the catalytic reaction. The interaction of oxygen with the catalyst activates oxygen making it more reactive thus promoting methane activation.

The mechanism for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over silica-supported oxide catalysts has been extensively studied. However, the involvement of lattice or surface-activated gas-phase oxygen in formaldehyde formation remains unclear. It is evident that oxygen activation on the catalyst surface is crucial to the catalytic process. Oxygen interaction with the catalyst enhances its reactivity, thereby facilitating methane activation.
