[Introduction The discovery that Cp*2LuCH3 (Cp* = C5Me5) activates CH4 (eqn. (1)) 1 has been a landmark in the search for new catalysts able to activate inert bonds especially those in alkanes.213 Since no electrons are available on the lanthanide, the acti- vation of the CH bond must necessarily occur without change of oxidation state at the metal center. In a related reaction, Cp*2LnH exchanges H in the presence of H2. An early MO analysis suggested the exchange of hydrogen occurs via a σ- bond metathesis between the LnH and HH bonds.14 DFT calculations of this reaction have shown it to be energetically very easy and to occur via a 4-center (4-c) transition state representative of a bond metathesis process.15 The energy of activation has been found to depend on the nature of the lanthanide although it remains low for the entire Ln series. The activation of CH4 should follow a similar pattern.]

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of methane by Cp*2LuCH3, a key finding, marks a milestone in the search for catalysts capable of activating inert bonds, particularly those in alkanes. The activation of the CH bond takes place without altering the oxidation state at the metal center. A related reaction involves Cp*2LnH exchanging hydrogen in the presence of hydrogen gas, with early MO analysis suggesting hydrogen exchange occurs through a σ-bond metathesis between LnH and HH bonds. DFT calculations indicate this process is energetically straightforward, characterized by a 4-center transition state indicative of a bond metathesis. The activation energy varies depending on the lanthanide, yet remains relatively low across the entire lanthanide series. Activation of methane should follow a comparable pattern.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
Cp*2LuCH3激活甲烷的关键发现标志着在寻找能够激活惰性键，特别是烷烃中键的催化剂的里程碑。CH键的激活在金属中心不改变氧化状态的情况下进行。相关反应涉及Cp*2LnH在氢气存在的条件下交换氢原子，早期的MO分析表明氢交换通过LnH和HH键之间的σ键重排发生。DFT计算显示这个过程非常容易，特征是一个4中心过渡态，代表了键重排的过程。激活能取决于镧系元素的性质，尽管在整个镧系系列中仍然保持较低。甲烷的激活应遵循类似模式。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of CH4 by Cl2LnH is studied, focusing on the transition states for the reactions with CH3 at α- and β-positions. The energy barriers for the α-CH3 approach are around 14 kcal mol−1 above the separated reactants, while the barrier for β-CH3 is around 73 kcal mol−1. The reaction with CH3 at the α-position is calculated to have a low activation energy, making the activation of H2 by Cp2LnCH3 nearly as feasible as with Cp2LnH. The calculated activation energy for eqn. (1) is closer to experimental conditions, differing significantly from previous studies.

DFT calculations were conducted for the activation of methane by models (Cl2LnZ) representing Cp*2LnZ across the entire lanthanide series. Cl2LnZ serves as an adequate model for Cp*2LnZ, accurately depicting the coordination around the lanthanide. The energy changes for the transformations X2LnH → CH4 and X2LnCH3 → H2 are nearly identical for X = Cl and Cp, with the variation explained by Cp's enhanced electron donation capacity.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The DFT study examines the activation of CH4 by models (Cl2LnZ) of Cp*2LnZ, where Z is either H or CH3, across the entire lanthanide series. The calculations reveal that Cl2LnZ serves as a good model for Cp*2LnZ, accurately representing the coordination around the lanthanide center. The energetics of transforming X2LnH to CH4 and then to X2LnCH3 are closely similar for X = Cl and Cp, with differences attributed to the stronger electron donating ability of Cp. The formation of the lanthanide hydride complex is calculated to be exothermic, aligning with experimental evidence. Energy profiles of various reactions, including Cl2LnH to CH4, Cl2LnH* to CH4, and Cl2LnCH*3 to CH4, are calculated, with transition states for the first and third transformations being energetically accessible. The second reaction's transition state has a very high energy, indicating an unfeasible reaction.

该DFT研究考察了d0 Cl2LnZ（Z为H或CH3）复合物激活CH4的机理，其中Ln代表镧系元素。计算结果显示，Cl2LnZ是一个良好的Cp*2LnZ模型，能够很好地模拟镧系中心的配位情况。对于X = Cl和Cp体系，从X2LnH转化为CH4以及进一步转化为X2LnCH3的能垒接近，差异主要归因于Cp较强的电子捐赠能力。镧系氢化物复合物的形成被计算为放热过程，与实验结果一致。对一系列反应的能量轮廓进行了计算，包括Cl2LnH到CH4、Cl2LnH*到CH4以及Cl2LnCH*3到CH4等，第一和第三个转换态的能垒是可接受的。而第二个反应的过渡态能量极高，表明该反应不可行。几何结构的过渡态结构暗示着两个阴离子物种（Z和CH3；Z = H和CH3）在镧系碎片的场作用下发生质子转移。

[Introduction]
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The discovery of Cp*2LuCH3 activating CH4 marked a milestone in the search for new catalysts capable of activating inert bonds, particularly those in alkanes. Previous studies suggested that the activation of the CH bond occurs without a change in the metal center's oxidation state. DFT calculations on the exchange of hydrogen with Cp*2LnH have shown that the activation is energetically favorable, with the energy of activation depending on the lanthanide element's nature. However, it was noted that CH is harder to activate than HH due to the spherical nature of the 1s H orbital and the directional nature of the Me sp3 hydrid. These findings suggest that a σ-bond metathesis involving metalH and HH bonds might be more kinetically favorable than one involving MMe and CH bonds. Experimental results support this trend, indicating that reactions involving CH4 require heating, unlike those involving HH or Me.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
Cp*2LuCH3激活CH4的发现标志着在寻找能够激活惰性键，尤其是烷烃中键的新催化剂方面的一个里程碑。早期的研究表明，CH键的激活无需金属中心氧化态的变化。DFT计算显示，Cp*2LnH中的氢交换是能量上可行的，其活化能取决于镧系元素的性质。然而，实验结果表明，CH比HH更难激活，这是由于1s H轨道的球形特性及Me sp3氢化物的方向性所致。这表明，涉及金属H和HH键的σ-键互换可能比涉及MMe和CH键的互换在动力学上更为有利。实验数据支持这一趋势，指出使用CH4进行的反应需要加热，而HH或Me相关的反应则不需要。

[Results and discussion]

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The results indicate that Cl serves as an appropriate model for Cp in the context of the study. The computational details section discusses the use of large core relativistic effective core potentials (RECPs) optimized by the Stuttgart Dresden Group, along with augmented basis sets for the lanthanide and chlorine atoms. The calculations were carried out using the DFT level with the hybrid functional B3PW91, demonstrating that the coordination around the lanthanide center is similar for Cl2LnH and Cp2LnH. The LnH bond is slightly longer in Cl2LnH, reflecting the higher electron donating power of Cp. The study also compares the activation energy for H exchange with Cl2LnZ to that with Cp2LnZ, suggesting that Cl might not be an ideal model for Cp in cerium complexes. The authors conclude that Cl is suitable for modeling Cp in these systems, despite limitations in cerium complexes.

[Activation of CH4 by Cl2LnH]
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of CH4 by Cl2LnH is discussed for the reactions shown in equations (1)-(3). The study considers the reactions where CH4 reacts with the lanthanide hydride, with a preference for the methyl group to approach the metal. The transition states for the α-CH3 approach are around 14 kcal mol−1 above the separated reactants, while the transition state for the β-CH3 approach is around 73 kcal mol−1 above the separated reactants. The reaction with CH3 at the α-position has a low activation energy (45 kcal mol−1 above separated reactants Cl2LnCH3 + H2), making it kinetically accessible. In contrast, the reaction with CH3 at the β-position has a high activation energy, making it unfeasible. The study suggests that the activation energy for the reaction with α-CH3 is similar to that of Cp2LnH, indicating that the reaction is equally feasible for most lanthanide centers.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对CH4由Cl2LnH激活的反应，即方程（1）至（3）所示，进行了讨论。研究考虑了CH4与镧系氢化物反应的情况，倾向于甲基接近金属。α-CH3接近时的过渡状态相对于分离的反应物高出约14 kcal mol−1，而β-CH3接近时的过渡状态相对于分离的反应物高出约73 kcal mol−1。当CH3位于α位置时，反应的活化能（45 kcal mol−1高于分离的反应物Cl2LnCH3 + H2），使得该反应动力学上可实现。相比之下，当CH3位于β位置时，活化能很高，使得反应不可行。研究表明，α-CH3反应的活化能类似于Cp2LnH，表明大多数镧系中心的反应同样可行。

[Influence of the oxidation state]
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The influence of the oxidation state on the activation of CH4 was explored through calculations for Ce(), Eu(), and Yb(). The study found that the oxidation state of the lanthanide metal does not vary during the σ-bond metathesis reaction. Only the most relevant systems were calculated for Ce(), Eu(), and Yb() to analyze the effect of the oxidation state on reactivity. The results showed that the oxidation state has a marginal influence on the activation energy, averaging around 13 kcal mol−1. However, the calculated activation energy for Ce() was significantly lower, possibly due to the use of Cl as a model for Cp. The study suggests that Ce() might be stable in the presence of H2 at low temperatures, as indicated by the calculations.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
镧系金属的氧化态对CH4激活的影响通过Ce()、Eu()和Yb()的计算进行了研究。研究发现，在σ-键互换反应过程中，镧系金属的氧化态保持不变。仅对Ce()、Eu()和Yb()的最相关系统进行了计算，以分析氧化态对反应性的影响。结果表明，氧化态对活化能的影响较小，平均约为13 kcal mol−1。然而，计算得到的Ce()的活化能显著较低，这可能是由于使用Cl作为Cp的模型导致的。研究表明，在低温条件下，Ce()可能在H2的存在下稳定，这是根据计算得出的结论。
