The study investigates the activation of methane (CH4) by complexes of the form d0 Cl2LnZ, where Z represents hydrogen (H) or methyl (Me). These complexes serve as models for Cp*2LnZ, demonstrating good representation of the coordination environment around the lanthanide (Ln) atom. The calculations reveal that the energy changes for the transformations X2LnH → CH4 and X2LnCH3 → H2 are comparable for X = Cl and Cp, except for the stronger electron donating capability of Cp.

这项研究探讨了由形式为d0 Cl2LnZ的复合物激活甲烷（CH4），其中Z代表氢（H）或甲基（Me）。这些复合物可以很好地作为Cp*2LnZ的模型，很好地再现镧系（Ln）原子周围的配位环境。计算结果显示，对于X = Cl和Cp，变换X2LnH → CH4和X2LnCH3 → H2的能量变化是相当的，除了Cp更强的电子捐赠能力。

DFT calculations were conducted for the activation of methane by models (Cl2LnZ) representing Cp*2LnZ across the entire lanthanide series. Cl2LnZ serves as an adequate model for Cp*2LnZ, accurately depicting the coordination around the lanthanide. The energy changes for the transformations X2LnH → CH4 and X2LnCH3 → H2 are nearly identical for X = Cl and Cp, with the variation explained by Cp's enhanced electron donation capacity.
