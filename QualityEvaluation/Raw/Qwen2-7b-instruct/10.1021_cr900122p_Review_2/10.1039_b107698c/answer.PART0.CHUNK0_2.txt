[Introduction]
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction highlights the discovery of Cp*2LuCH3 activating CH4, marking a significant milestone in finding new catalysts capable of activating inert bonds, particularly in alkanes. The focus shifts to understanding the activation mechanism of the CH bond without changing the oxidation state of the metal center, comparing it with related reactions involving Cp*2LnH exchanging H in the presence of H2. The text also discusses the differences in activation energies for various reactions, suggesting the potential to identify lanthanides that might make the activation of CH4 energetically unfavorable.

[Activation of CH4 by Cl2LnH]
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of CH4 by Cl2LnH is studied, focusing on the transition states for the reactions with CH3 at α- and β-positions. The energy barriers for the α-CH3 approach are around 14 kcal mol−1 above the separated reactants, while the barrier for β-CH3 is around 73 kcal mol−1. The reaction with CH3 at the α-position is calculated to have a low activation energy, making the activation of H2 by Cp2LnCH3 nearly as feasible as with Cp2LnH. The calculated activation energy for eqn. (1) is closer to experimental conditions, differing significantly from previous studies.

研究了Cl2LnH激活CH4的过程，重点分析了CH3处于α-和β-位置时的过渡状态。α-CH3途径的能量壁垒约为14 kcal mol−1高于分离的反应物，而β-CH3途径的能量壁垒约为73 kcal mol−1。α-位置的CH3反应被认为具有较低的活化能，使得H2由Cp2LnCH3激活几乎与Cp2LnH一样可行。计算得到的eqn. (1)的活化能更接近实验条件，与先前的研究显著不同。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The influence of the oxidation state on the activation energy is examined for Ce, Eu, and Yb. Test calculations show that Ce(III), Eu(II), and Yb(III) behave similarly to other Ln(I) elements. A comprehensive study was conducted for Ce(III), Eu(II), and Yb(III) to gain insight into the impact of the oxidation state on reactivity. The oxidation state does not change during the σ-bond metathesis reaction.

[Activation of CH4 by Cl2LnCH3]
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The activation of CH4 by Cl2LnCH3 is explored, with the reaction considered as a proton transfer between two anionic species in the field of the lanthanide fragment. The transition state for the α-CH3 approach is characterized by the alignment of CH3 with the HH vector, with the C3 axis of CH3 tilted towards the approaching H. The structure of the transition state indicates a distorted trigonal bipyramid arrangement, with the lanthanide atom occupying an apical site and the transferring hydrogen at an equatorial site.

[Conclusion]
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Calculations demonstrate that the reactions described in eqn. (1) and (2) are kinetically accessible. These reactions are best viewed as a transfer of a proton between two anionic groups in the proximity of a lanthanide center. The larger size of the lanthanide ion may contribute to the feasibility of eqn. (1), but the lanthanide is unable to stabilize the CH5 anion formed in the transition state of the reaction in eqn. (3). Replacing CH3 with stabilizing groups like SiR3 or a phenyl group could potentially make H exchange in eqn. (3) accessible.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
计算结果表明，描述在eqn. (1)和(2)中的反应是动力学上可访问的。这些反应最好被视为在镧系中心附近的两个阴离子团之间转移质子。镧系离子的较大尺寸可能有助于eqn. (1)的可行性，但镧系无法稳定eqn. (3)反应中形成的CH5阴离子。用SiR3或苯环等稳定基团替换CH3有可能使eqn. (3)中的H交换变得可行。
