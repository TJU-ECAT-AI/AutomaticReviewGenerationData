[Introduction The discovery that Cp*2LuCH3 (Cp* = C5Me5) activates CH4 (eqn. (1)) 1 has been a landmark in the search for new catalysts able to activate inert bonds especially those in alkanes.213 Since no electrons are available on the lanthanide, the acti- vation of the CH bond must necessarily occur without change of oxidation state at the metal center. In a related reaction, Cp*2LnH exchanges H in the presence of H2. An early MO analysis suggested the exchange of hydrogen occurs via a σ- bond metathesis between the LnH and HH bonds.14 DFT calculations of this reaction have shown it to be energetically very easy and to occur via a 4-center (4-c) transition state representative of a bond metathesis process.15 The energy of activation has been found to depend on the nature of the lanthanide although it remains low for the entire Ln series. The activation of CH4 should follow a similar pattern.]

The activation of methane by Cp*2LuCH3, a key finding, marks a milestone in the search for catalysts capable of activating inert bonds, particularly those in alkanes. The activation of the CH bond takes place without altering the oxidation state at the metal center. A related reaction involves Cp*2LnH exchanging hydrogen in the presence of hydrogen gas, with early MO analysis suggesting hydrogen exchange occurs through a σ-bond metathesis between LnH and HH bonds. DFT calculations indicate this process is energetically straightforward, characterized by a 4-center transition state indicative of a bond metathesis. The activation energy varies depending on the lanthanide, yet remains relatively low across the entire lanthanide series. Activation of methane should follow a comparable pattern.

Cp*2LuCH3激活甲烷的关键发现标志着在寻找能够激活惰性键，特别是烷烃中键的催化剂的里程碑。CH键的激活在金属中心不改变氧化状态的情况下进行。相关反应涉及Cp*2LnH在氢气存在的条件下交换氢原子，早期的MO分析表明氢交换通过LnH和HH键之间的σ键重排发生。DFT计算显示这个过程非常容易，特征是一个4中心过渡态，代表了键重排的过程。激活能取决于镧系元素的性质，尽管在整个镧系系列中仍然保持较低。甲烷的激活应遵循类似模式。

[The structure of Cl2LnH is remarkably independent of the nature of Z (Tables 2 and 3). The ClLnCl angle is only on average 2 smaller for Z = H. The pyramidalization at Ln, measured by the sum of the angles between the ligands, is equal for the two systems (average difference of 1). The lanthanide contraction of LnH and LnC respectively are equal to 0.160 Å and 0.165 Å. There are no α-agostic CH bonds in Cl2LnCH3.]

The structure of Cl2LnH is notably unaffected by the identity of Z (Tables 2 and 3). The ClLnCl angle differs by only 2 degrees on average when Z is hydrogen (H). The pyramidalization at Ln, quantified by the sum of the angles between the ligands, is equivalent for both systems, with an average difference of 1. The lanthanide contraction for LnH and LnC is identical, measuring 0.160 Å and 0.165 Å, respectively. No α-agostic CH bonds are found in Cl2LnCH3.

[Formation of ethane and a Cl2LnH bond is thermo- dynamically endothermic (Table 7) with an average value of 11.3 kcal mol1 for Cl and 5.7 kcal mol1 for Cp. The anionic species Cp2EuCH3 and Cp2YbCH3 would give an athermic reaction with an even greater preference for forming the LnH bond than the other lanthanide elements. Formation of ethane is thus thermodynamically unfavourable, as expected from the weaker energy of an C(sp3)C(sp3) bond in comparison to C(sp3)H.]

The formation of ethane and a Cl2LnH bond is thermodynamically endothermic (Table 7), with an average value of 11.3 kcal/mol for Cl and 5.7 kcal/mol for Cp. Anionic species such as Cp2EuCH3 and Cp2YbCH3 would undergo an athermic reaction, showing a significantly higher preference for forming the LnH bond compared to other lanthanide elements. The formation of ethane is thermodynamically unfavorable, as anticipated from the lesser energy of a C(sp3)-C(sp3) bond in relation to C(sp3)-H.
