[1] "DFT calculations of the activation of CH4 by models (Cl2LnZ) of Cp*2LnZ (Z = H, Me) have been carried out for the entire lanthanide series."

1. DFT calculations were conducted on the activation of CH4 by various models (Cl2LnZ) for the entire lanthanide series.
2. The formation of the lanthanide hydride complex is exothermic, aligning with experimental evidence.
3. The second reaction exhibits a highly energetic transition state, indicating an unfeasible reaction.
4. The transition structures suggest a proton transfer between two anionic species (Z and CH3 ; Z = H and CH3 ) in the field of the lanthanide fragment.
5. An intriguing question is whether lanthanides with the highest activation energy in equation (4) could make equation (1) energetically impractical.
6. The nature of Z has minimal impact on the structure of Cl2LnZ.
7. Systematic investigation of the β-position has not been carried out.
8. Our study yields an activation energy closer to experimental conditions (room temperature) compared to previous studies, suggesting a more favorable reaction pathway.
9. The 4-c-transition state structure is similar across all lanthanides, except for cerium.
10. The larger size of the lanthanide ion might be a contributing factor to the feasibility of equation (1).

1. 对整个镧系元素系列进行了对氯化镧-Z（Z=H,Me）模型的DFT计算，用于激活CH4。
2. 形成镧系氢化物复合物是放热的，与实验证据一致。
3. 第二个反应具有非常高的过渡态能量，表明该反应不可行。
4. 过渡结构提示在镧系片段场中存在一个质子从Z和CH3（Z=H和CH3）之间的转移。
5. 有趣的问题是，是否在等式(4)中具有最高活化能的镧系元素可以使得等式(1)变得不可行。
6. Z的性质对Cl2LnZ的结构影响较小。
7. 对β位置的系统研究尚未进行。
8. 我们的研究给出了更接近实验条件（室温反应）的活化能，比之前的值（19.6 kcal mol1）低得多，这表明更有利于反应途径。
9. 所有镧系元素的4-c过渡状态结构相似，除了铈。
10. 镧系离子较大的尺寸可能是等式(1)可行的一个因素。
