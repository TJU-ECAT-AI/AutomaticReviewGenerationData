[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."
[2] "Hydrogenation of 1-butene is also observed under these conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization."
[3] "Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins."
[4] "Isomerization of 1-butene and 1-hexene to their respective thermodynamic mixtures occurs readily at room temperature."
[5] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane."
[6] "Higher isomerization rates can be obtained at higher temperatures."
[7] "Although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst, polymerization of these olefins was not observed."
[8] "We propose a mechanism to account for the catalytic activity shown by supported species, involving supported dialkyl species."
[9] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation to butane was complete within 30 h."
[10] "Catalyst lifetime is shorter under hydrogenation conditions than that observed in isomerization experiments."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. High activity under mild conditions, allowing for efficient olefin isomerization.
2. Steric control over reaction rates, affecting the speed of isomerization.
3. Ability to perform both isomerization and hydrogenation, albeit with differing efficiencies.
4. Long catalyst lifetime during isomerization processes compared to hydrogenation.
5. Adaptability to varying temperatures to optimize reaction rates.
6. Theoretical and practical mechanisms explaining the catalyst's activity, involving supported dialkyl species.
7. Rapid hydrogenation capabilities, albeit with shorter catalyst lifetimes.

These factors enable the use of these catalysts in industrial processes where efficient and selective alkane transformations are crucial, offering both cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits.
