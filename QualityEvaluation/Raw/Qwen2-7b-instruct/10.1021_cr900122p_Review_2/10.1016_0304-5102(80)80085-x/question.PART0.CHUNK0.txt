(Received July 27.1979) Summary Silica-supported zircorium hydrides eshibit high activity towards olek isomer&&ion under mild conditions. l-Butene,l-hexene,allylbenzene uld methylenecyclohexane m each isomerized to their respective therm- dynamic mixtures rapidly. Hydrogenation of I-butene is also observed under Ei,, but rates are lower than that of isomtion;catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation thm for isomerization of oletis.
Recently it has been denonsk&ed that meti oxide-ho-d organo- zirconium complexes (1) [I, 21 undergo hydrogenolysis [3] to yiekl at- tached zirconium hydrides (2) which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization.Stice the chemisky of soluble aJkykrconium compounds formed by addition of long-chain ole6ns to ($esH& ZrHCl (3) has been extensively investig&ed [b, 51, the interaction between longchti oleGns ad the meti oxide-bound zirconium hytides was of interest to us.

We find thaz these supported organozirconium compounds inefG- ciently catalyze the isomerization of l-butene to ck- and m-2-bukne at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium akyl compounds are first hydrogenated. This can be accomplished under reiatively mild conditions (ZOO Torr, 120 C, 30 mm) (Table 1) and results in hydrogenolysis of the two remaining alkyl ligands,yielding 2 mol akane/mol Zr, as vtied by WC analysis. T-his stoichio- 1 metric observation, and hydrolysis rest&s of others [3:,indicate that (silica) ZrH, (2) is formed. Similar color, reactivity and infrared spectra (Zr-H absorptions at 1620 and 2190 cm-l) suggest that catalysts formed from either zircotium complex are identical.The isomerization c2ayst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon stiding or under isome_Tization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorou@ excluded. We find that rates of butene isomer&a- tion at room temperature are competitive with or faster than rates of other known homogeneo-us and heterogeneous olefm isomerization catalysts 17 - 12 ] ; no cocatalyst is required. (Control experimenk show that silica alone is inactive towards oleGn isomerization under these conditions.) ?i&picaI olefin isomerizat-ion experiments were performed by adding a twentyfold molar excess of olefm to a slurry of the catalyst in toluene sol-

(Experiments with I-tutene (1 atm, 25 C) shoEed isomerization also occurred at an equivalent-rate in the absence of solvent.) Rates of isomeriza- tion are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order I-butene > I-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane (Table 2). Isomerization of I-butene and I-haene to their respectke thermodynamic mixtures of o1eEn.s occurs readily s.t room temperature_ In the isomerization of L-butene ciMmn.s ratios of initially formed 2-butenes are larger than the thermodynamic ratio (==
1: I ),
suggesting that the cis olefin is kinetically prefed.
This ratio gradually decreases as the reaction proceeds, and eventually achieves the equilibrium value. Conversion of l-hexene to ck- and arcs-2hexene i.s rapid, but sub- sequent isomerization to the 3hexene isomers proceeds slowly at roam tem- perature and several days ze required for attainment of the equilibrium mixture of iinear hexenes under these conditions. Higher isomerization rates can be obtain& at higher temperature Indeed, such higher reaction tempera- tures (55 C) are necm to effect the isomerization of allylbenzene and methylenecyclohexane to cis- and tins-methyls@rene and l-metbykyclo- herene, respectively, in a convenient time period. It shot-18 be noted that although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization catalyst [3], polymerization of these oleefins was not observed For example,when isomeriza,ion expekimenk with %(I mol of I-butene/mal Zr were per- formed, the komerized butenes were recovered in 90 - 95% yield (95% is the theoreticEll yieid since one equivalent of butene per mol Zr remains bound to the meti as an a&y1 &and, vi& infm).It would appear that olefin double-bond isomerrtion involves the intermediacy of alh@Crconium species. The relative rates of isomerization noted above probably correlate with the relative stabilities of these inter- mediary organozirconium compounds. Et is noteworthy chat with methylene- cyclohexane isomerization the double-bond isomerization past the terkiary center, x&ich reqrkas an intermediary tertiary a&y1 spies,vrorrid be expected to be sterically unfavorable. Isomerization occurs, though, albeit slowly.

This indicates that the active zirconium specie; present in these isomerization experiments is a supported Zr(IV) al&l hydride, 4. It has been demons&ted that Cp,Zr(R)H

longchain aikyl, undergoes olefin exchange while Cp, Zr(R)Cl does not 11-31; insertion of o!efin into the metal hydride bond of 5 to give a dialkyl species followed by B-hydride elimination to free one equivalent of the olefin is implied.
We propose a mechanism to account for the catiytic activCQ shown by supported species 4 which involves supported dial@1 species 6 {reaction 2). According to this hypothesis,supportt zirconium neopentyl and ally1 species (1) are inefficient isomerization catalysts -because they do not rediiy decompose to give hydridic species such as 4.Since both 1 [3] <and 5 [14] undergo hydrogenolysis readily, it was decided to investigate the catalytic hydrogenation efficiency of 2 towards olefins. When a twentyTold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catiysr;, hydrogenation (He, 1 atzn, 25 C) to butane was com- plete within 30 h. Similarly,
CCS-
and tins-2-butene can be completely hydrogenated within two days. Hydrogenation of 1-butene is poorly com- petitive v&h isomerization under OIL conditions.
After 3 h under hydro- genation conditions,the concentration of Bbutenes reach= a maximum (57% of he total hydrocarbon present) and then diminishes as the olefins are hydrogenated.
The rest of the mixture at this time is comprked of butane (40%) and 1-buterre (3%).
