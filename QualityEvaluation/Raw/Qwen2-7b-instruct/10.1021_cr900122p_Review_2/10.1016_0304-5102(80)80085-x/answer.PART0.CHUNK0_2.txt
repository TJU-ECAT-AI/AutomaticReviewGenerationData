Summary Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions. l-Butene, l-hexene, allylbenzene, and methylenecyclohexane each isomerized to their respective thermodynamic mixtures rapidly. Hydrogenation of I-butene is also observed under mild conditions, but rates are lower than that of isomerization. Catalyst lifetime is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. Recently, it has been demonstrated that metallocene-oxide-bound organo-zirconium complexes undergo hydrogenolysis to yield attached zirconium hydrides, which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization. The interaction between long-chain olefins and the metallocene-bound zirconium hydrides was of interest to the researchers. In the course of their studies, they found that these supported organo-zirconium compounds efficiently catalyze the isomerization of long-chain olefins. When finely divided silica is treated with tetrabutylzirconium or tetramethylzirconium, supported organo-zirconium species result. The supported organo-zirconium compounds efficiently catalyze the isomerization of I-butene to cis- and trans-2-butenes at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated. This can be accomplished under relatively mild conditions and results in hydrogenolysis of the two remaining alkyl ligands, yielding 2 mol alkane/mol Zr as verified by WC analysis.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides demonstrate high efficiency in olefin isomerization at mild conditions, with rapid conversion of l-Butene, l-hexene, allylbenzene, and methylenecyclohexane to their respective thermodynamic mixtures. While hydrogenation of I-butene is observed, the rates are lower compared to isomerization. The lifetime of the catalyst is shorter for hydrogenation than for isomerization of olefins. It is discovered that metallocene-oxide-bound organo-zirconium complexes undergo hydrogenolysis, producing active zirconium hydrides suitable for ethylene polymerization. These compounds effectively catalyze the isomerization of long-chain olefins. Upon treatment of finely divided silica with tetrabutylzirconium or tetramethylzirconium, supported organo-zirconium species are formed. At room temperature, these supported organo-zirconium compounds efficiently catalyze the isomerization of I-butene to cis- and trans-2-butenes. However, achieving higher rates of isomerization necessitates the hydrogenation of the supported zirconium alkyl compounds first. Under mild conditions, this process leads to hydrogenolysis of the two remaining alkyl ligands, resulting in the production of 2 mol alkane/mol Zr, as confirmed through WC analysis.

硅负载的锆化氢在温和条件下对烯烃异构化表现出高效率，迅速将l-丁烯、l-己烯、苯乙烯和甲基环己烷二烯转化为各自的热力学混合物。虽然观察到I-丁烯的氢化，但速率低于异构化。催化剂的寿命在氢化和烯烃异构化时较短。已证实，金属簇-氧化物结合的有机锆化合物在氢解离过程中产生附着的锆化氢，这些活性较高的催化剂适用于乙烯聚合。这些化合物有效地催化长链烯烃的异构化。通过将细粉二氧化硅与四丁基锆或四甲基锆处理，形成支持的有机锆物种。在室温下，这些支持的有机锆物种能够有效地催化I-丁烯异构化为顺式和反式-2-丁烯。然而，要实现更高的异构化速率，则需要先对支持的锆烷基化合物进行氢化。在温和条件下，这一过程导致剩余两个烷基配体的氢解离，产生2 mol 烷烃/mol Zr，通过WC分析得到验证。
