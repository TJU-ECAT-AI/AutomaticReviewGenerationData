The dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane on modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts has been studied under non-oxidizing conditions with a fixed bed continuous-flow reactor and with a temperature programmed reactor.
The results show that benzene is the only hydrocarbon product of the catalytic conversion of methane at high temperature (973 K).
The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn).
HE and ethene have been directly detected in the products with a mass spectrometer during TPAR.
A carbenium ion mechanism for the activation of methane is suggested.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The incorporation of metal cations like molybdenum (Mo) or zinc (Zn) into zeolites notably enhances the catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane. This is evidenced by the increased conversion of methane observed in the presence of these metals, with the best activity demonstrated by the MoHZSM-5 catalyst. The detection of ethene and hydrogen during the temperature-programmed aromatization reaction (TPAR) further supports the role of these metals in activating methane through a carbenium ion mechanism. The high selectivity towards benzene, even at lower temperatures, is attributed to the thermodynamic favorability of dehydro-aromatization compared to dehydro-dimerization. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to efficiently convert methane to benzene under non-oxidizing conditions, which is crucial for the utilization of natural gas resources.

金属基催化剂，特别是包含支持的钒氧化物和改性沸石的催化剂，对烷烃转换过程的机制和效率产生了显著影响，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。钼（Mo）或锌（Zn）等金属离子的引入显著提高了ZSM-5沸石催化剂的催化活性，用于甲烷的脱氢和芳构化。这在这些金属的存在下观察到的甲烷转化率的增加得到了证明，最佳活性由MoHZSM-5催化剂展示。在温度程序化的芳构化反应（TPAR）期间检测到乙稀和氢气进一步支持了这些金属通过碳正离子机制激活甲烷的作用。即使在较低温度下也能实现高选择性苯的生成，这是由于脱氢芳构化相对于脱氢二聚化的热力学有利性。这些催化剂在非氧化条件下高效地将甲烷转化为苯对于利用天然气资源具有工业重要性。
