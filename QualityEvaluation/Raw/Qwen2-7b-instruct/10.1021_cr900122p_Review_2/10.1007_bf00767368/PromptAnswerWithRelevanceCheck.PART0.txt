The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, in the context of dehydrogenation and aromatization, incorporating metal cations like molybdenum (Mo) or zinc (Zn) into ZSM-5 zeolites enhances catalytic activity. This improvement leads to the efficient conversion of methane to benzene at high temperatures (973 K), where only benzene is produced as the hydrocarbon product. The activation of methane occurs via a carbenium ion mechanism, and both ethene and hydrogen can be directly detected in the products using a mass spectrometer. The thermodynamic data indicate that dehydroaromatization of methane is favored over dehydrodimerization, contributing to the high selectivity towards benzene at higher temperatures. Under the given conditions, the Mo-modified ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate excellent activity and selectivity, achieving a conversion rate of 7-8% and maintaining a benzene selectivity of 100%. This stability and efficiency make these catalysts industrially significant for alkane transformation processes.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly those including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The incorporation of metal cations like molybdenum (Mo) or zinc (Zn) into zeolites notably enhances the catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane. This is evidenced by the increased conversion of methane observed in the presence of these metals, with the best activity demonstrated by the MoHZSM-5 catalyst. The detection of ethene and hydrogen during the temperature-programmed aromatization reaction (TPAR) further supports the role of these metals in activating methane through a carbenium ion mechanism. The high selectivity towards benzene, even at lower temperatures, is attributed to the thermodynamic favorability of dehydro-aromatization compared to dehydro-dimerization. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to efficiently convert methane to benzene under non-oxidizing conditions, which is crucial for the utilization of natural gas resources.
