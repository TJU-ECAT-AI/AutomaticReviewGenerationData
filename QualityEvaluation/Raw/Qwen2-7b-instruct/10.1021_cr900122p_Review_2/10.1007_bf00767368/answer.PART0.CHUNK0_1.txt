The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, in the context of dehydrogenation and aromatization, incorporating metal cations like molybdenum (Mo) or zinc (Zn) into ZSM-5 zeolites enhances catalytic activity. This improvement leads to the efficient conversion of methane to benzene at high temperatures (973 K), where only benzene is produced as the hydrocarbon product. The activation of methane occurs via a carbenium ion mechanism, and both ethene and hydrogen can be directly detected in the products using a mass spectrometer. The thermodynamic data indicate that dehydroaromatization of methane is favored over dehydrodimerization, contributing to the high selectivity towards benzene at higher temperatures. Under the given conditions, the Mo-modified ZSM-5 catalysts demonstrate excellent activity and selectivity, achieving a conversion rate of 7-8% and maintaining a benzene selectivity of 100%. This stability and efficiency make these catalysts industrially significant for alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转换的机制和效率产生了显著影响。在脱氢化和芳构化的过程中，将钼（Mo）或锌（Zn）离子引入ZSM-5沸石中显著提高了催化活性。这种改善使得在973 K的高温下高效地将甲烷转化为苯，此时仅生成苯作为碳氢化合物产物。甲烷的激活通过卡宾离子机制进行，使用质谱仪可以直接检测到产品中的乙烯和氢。热力学数据表明，甲烷的脱氢芳构化比脱氢二聚化更为有利，这有助于在较高温度下实现苯的高度选择性。在给定条件下，Mo改性的ZSM-5催化剂表现出出色的活性和选择性，实现了7-8%的转化率和100%的苯选择性。这种稳定性和效率使这些催化剂在烷烃转换过程中具有工业重要性。
