[1] "We have shown that different catalytic processes occur involving different surface hydrides."
[2] "Since the amount of monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH present in the system is always much larger than that of dihydrides, the former should be considered as the major catalytic species for the polymerization reaction."
[3] "Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable."
[4] "In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al. [911]."
[5] "The main distinctions between dihydrides and monohydrides are a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an additional site for binding the substrate in the former."
[6] "Relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation of the surface species in all the systems studied is respon- sible for rather low regioselectivity of the process."

1. Different catalytic processes occur involving various surface hydrides.
2. Monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH are considered the major catalytic species for ethylene polymerization due to their abundance compared to dihydrides.
3. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides is thermodynamically unfavorable.
4. Dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, present in real catalytic systems, can act as catalysts for hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in experimental studies.
5. Dihydrides and monohydrides differ by the higher coordinative unsaturation of the Zr atom and the presence of an additional substrate binding site in dihydrides.
6. High coordinative unsaturation of surface species in all systems leads to low regioselectivity in the processes.

1. 不同的催化过程涉及不同的表面氢化物。
2. 在聚乙烯聚合反应中，被认为是主要催化物种的是（B SiAO）3ZrH，因为其相对于二氢化物的丰富程度。
3. 直链烷烃在单氢化物（B SiAO）3ZrH上的氢解反应是热力学上不利的。
4. 真实催化剂系统中存在的二氢化物（B SiAO）2ZrH2可以在与巴斯艾特等人报告的实验研究中相同温度下作为直链烷烃的氢解催化剂。
5. 二氢化物和单氢化物的区别在于Zr原子更高的配位不饱和度和二氢化物中的额外基团结合位点。
6. 所有系统中高配位不饱和度导致过程的低区域选择性。
