<p>Despite the fact that Basset et al. reliably proved that monohydrides (B SiAO)3ZrH were the major type of the surface metal hydrides in the samples of catalysts employed in their study [10], we believe that additional experimental investigations are required.

1. Three types of catalytic species were studied: (BSiAO)3ZrIVH, (BSiAO)2ZrIVH2, and (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH. Different catalytic processes occur depending on the type of surface hydride. Ethylene polymerization rates on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 are comparable.

2. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically unfavorable. Dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2, present in real catalytic systems, can act as catalysts for hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at similar temperatures to those reported in experimental studies by Basset et al. These dihydrides have a higher degree of coordinative unsaturation.

3. The process has low regioselectivity due to the relatively high degree of coordinative unsaturation across all studied systems.

4. An earlier study showed that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides is lower than the energy barrier for dihydrides reacting with methane, suggesting contributions from other reactive species.

5. Basset et al. found (BSiAO)3ZrH to be the predominant type of surface metal hydride. Additional experimental investigations are needed to confirm this, focusing on varying amounts of monohydrides and dihydrides, kinetic measurements for hydrogenolysis of alkanes and ethylene polymerization, and clarification of trivalent zirconium compounds.

1. 研究了三种催化物种：(BSiAO)3ZrIVH、(BSiAO)2ZrIVH2和(BSiAO)2ZrIIIH。根据表面氢化物的类型，不同的催化过程发生。在单氢化物(BSiAO)3ZrH和二氢化物(BSiAO)2ZrH2上，乙烯聚合的速率是相近的。

2. 直链烷烃在单氢化物(BSiAO)3ZrH上的氢解反应是热力学不可逆的。而在实际催化系统中，存在的二氢化物(BSiAO)2ZrH2可以作为直链烷烃氢解的催化剂，在与巴斯艾特等人报告的实验研究中报道的相同温度下进行。这些二氢化物具有较高的配位不饱和度。

3. 这个过程的区域选择性较低，这是由于所有研究系统中相对较高的配位不饱和度造成的。

4. 早先的研究表明，锆氢化物上甲烷的同位素交换的活化能低于二氢化物与甲烷反应的能量壁垒，暗示了其他反应性物种的贡献。

5. 巴斯艾特等人发现(BSiAO)3ZrH是表面金属氢化物的主要类型。需要进一步的实验调查来确认这一点，重点关注不同含量的单氢化物和二氢化物、氢解直链烷烃和乙烯聚合的动态测量以及三价锆化合物的性质。
