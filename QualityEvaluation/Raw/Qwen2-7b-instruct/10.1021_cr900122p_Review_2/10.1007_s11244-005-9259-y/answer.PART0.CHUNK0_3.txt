[5] "In contrast to this, the dihydrides (B SiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in the real catalytic systems (this was reliably proved earlier [4,8]), can act as the catalysts of hydrog- enolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al.

1. Three types of catalytic species have been studied, which are (BSiAO)3ZrIVH, (BSiAO)2ZrIVH2, and (BSiAO)2ZrIIIH, and they were observed experimentally.
2. Different catalytic processes take place involving various surface hydrides.
3. The rates of ethylene polymerization on the monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH and dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2 are approximately equal.
4. Hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes on monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH is thermodynamically disadvantageous.
5. Contrarily, the dihydrides (BSiAO)2ZrH2, which are present in real catalytic systems, can function as catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes at the same temperatures as those reported in the experimental studies by Basset et al.
6. Although Basset et al. confirmed that monohydrides (BSiAO)3ZrH were the predominant type of surface metal hydrides in the catalyst samples used in their study, further experimental investigations are deemed necessary.
7. Previously, it was shown that the activation energy for isotope exchange in methane on zirconium hydrides, as reported in the experimental study by Hall et al., is lower than the energy barrier for the reaction of dihydrides with methane, as calculated in our studies (7 vs. 911 kcal mol−1, respectively).

1. 已研究了三种催化物种，它们分别是(BSiAO)3ZrIVH、(BSiAO)2ZrIVH2和(BSiAO)2ZrIIIH，并且在实验中观察到了这些物种。
2. 不同的催化过程涉及不同的表面氢化物。
3. 在(BSiAO)3ZrH和(BSiAO)2ZrH2两种单氢化物上进行的乙烯聚合的速率大致相等。
4. 线性烷烃在(BSiAO)3ZrH单氢化物上的氢解是热力学不利的过程。
5. 相反，存在于实际催化剂体系中的双氢化物(BSiAO)2ZrH2可以作为线性烷烃氢解的催化剂，在与Basset等人报道的实验研究相同的温度下工作。
6. 尽管Basset等人证实了在他们使用的催化剂样品中，表面金属氢化物的主要类型是(BSiAO)3ZrH，但还需要进一步的实验调查。
7. 之前的研究表明，对于Hall等人报告的实验研究中zirconium hydrides上的同位素交换激活能，比我们计算的二氢化物与甲烷反应的能量壁垒（7 vs. 911 kcal mol−1）要低。
