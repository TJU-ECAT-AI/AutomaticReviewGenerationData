A DFT study of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium hydrides shows that only the latter are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions.

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides draw recently much attention due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin polymerization, CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes.

The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides, which is consistent with that proposed by Basset et al., is presented in Scheme 1.

The thermodynamic restriction of the alkane hydrogenolysis could be overcome if the considerable energy loss for the CC bond cleavage is compensated by the formation of two ethane molecules in the catalytic cycle.

Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al., unlike zirconium monohydrides, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

Basset et al. undoubtedly proved that monohydrides are mainly formed on the silica surface under conditions used for catalyst preparation. Nevertheless, it is of no doubt that dihydrides could coexist with monohydrides on the silica surface.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of silica-supported zirconium hydrides influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions. Unlike zirconium monohydrides, zirconium dihydrides are capable of catalyzing this process. This capability is due to their unique structure, which allows for the efficient cleavage of CC bonds in alkanes. The presence of both monohydrides and dihydrides on the silica surface suggests that they might coexist and potentially interact in the catalytic system. However, the detailed structure of the active centers in this system requires further experimental investigation. The catalysts' ability to catalyze low-temperature olefin polymerization and H/D isotope exchange also highlights their potential industrial significance.

组成、结构和反应条件对二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物影响轻烷氢解的机制和效率，在温和条件下。与单氢锆化合物不同，双氢锆化合物能够催化这一过程。这种能力归因于它们独特的结构，允许高效地裂解烷烃中的CC键。表面同时存在单氢锆和双氢锆表明它们可能共存并潜在地在催化体系中相互作用。然而，确定该系统中活性中心的详细结构需要进一步的实验研究。催化剂催化低温烯烃聚合和H/D同位素交换的能力也突出了其工业应用的潜力。
