A DFT study of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium hydrides shows that only zirconium dihydrides are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions.

On the other hand, Basset et al. considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides.

Yermakov et al. considered grafted zirconium dihydrides as the catalytic sites in this system.

The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides, consistent with that proposed by Basset et al., involves the transformation of the initial hydride into n-butyl derivative with the elimination of a hydrogen molecule, followed by C2C3 bond cleavage and the migration of a β-ethyl fragment to zirconium.

The thermodynamic restriction of the alkane hydrogenolysis could be overcome if the considerable energy loss for the CC bond cleavage is compensated by the formation of two ethane molecules.

Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al., unlike zirconium monohydrides, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of silica-supported zirconium dihydrides enable them to efficiently catalyse the hydrogenolysis of alkanes under mild conditions, whereas zirconium monohydrides are not capable of this process under similar conditions. This capability is attributed to the unique structure and energetics of zirconium dihydrides, which allow for the thermodynamic facilitation of alkane cleavage into ethane molecules. The existence of zirconium dihydrides was postulated by Yermakov et al. in 1977, and recent studies confirm their role as active catalytic sites in alkane hydrogenolysis.

硅负载的锆二氢化物的组成、结构和反应条件使它们能够在温和条件下有效地催化烷烃的氢解，而锆单氢化物不具备这一过程。这种能力归因于锆二氢化物的独特结构和能量特性，允许烷烃裂解成乙烷分子的热力学促进作用。锆二氢化物的存在由Yermakov等人在1977年提出，并且最近的研究证实了它们作为烷烃氢解活性中心的作用。

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides draw recently much attention due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin polymerization, CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes. 

Zirconium dihydrides, however, were found to be much more active in the isotope exchange reaction. 

Moreover, we calculated the activation parameters of H/D exchange for zirconium dihydrides, which are in a much better agreement with experimental data than those for monohydrides.

The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides, which is consistent with that proposed by Basset et al., is presented in Scheme 1. 

The process begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative 10 (E = 3.8 kcal mol1, G298 = 2.2 kcal mol1) via transition state 9 (E = 12.6 kcal mol1, G298 = 22.5 kcal mol1 relative to free reagents).

Unlike zirconium monohydrides, zirconium dihydrides 2, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al., are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

Nevertheless, it is of no doubt that dihydrides 2 could coexist with monohydrides 1 on the silica surface.

In our opinion, a more detailed experimental study has to be performed to determine the structure of real active centres in this catalytic system.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

Zirconium dihydrides, compared to monohydrides, demonstrate higher activity in isotope exchange reactions and are capable of catalyzing alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢化和沸石催化反应等过程中。工业上这些催化剂的重要意义在于它们能够催化低温烯烃聚合、在温和条件下进行烷烃的CC键氢解以及实现烷烃同位素交换。锆二氢化合物与单氢化合物相比，在同位素交换反应中表现出更高的活性，并且能够催化烷烃在温和条件下的氢解。然而，催化体系中活性中心的确切结构需要进一步的实验研究来确定。

Silica-supported zirconium hydrides15 draw recently much atten- tion due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin poly- merization,12 CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes3 and polyole- fins4 under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes.56 Basset et al.36 considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH.
On the other hand, Yermakov et al.1,2 considered grafted zir- conium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the catalytic sites in this system.
The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides 1, which is consistent with that proposed by Basset et al.,36 is presented in Scheme 1. The energy profile is shown in Figure 1.
The process begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative 10 (E = 3.8 kcal mol1, G298 = 2.2 kcal mol1) via transition state 9 (E = 12.6 kcal mol1, G298 = 22.5 kcal mol1 relative to free reagents).

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of silica-supported zirconium hydrides influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH were considered by Basset et al. as the catalytic sites for alkane hydrogenolysis, while Yermakov et al. proposed zirconium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the active centers. For instance, the hydrogenolysis of butane on supported zirconium monohydrides follows a catalytic cycle involving the formation of n-butyl derivative, subsequent C2C3 bond cleavage, and the migration of a β-ethyl fragment. In contrast, the hydrogenolysis process on zirconium dihydrides begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative, followed by C2C3 bond cleavage leading to the formation of diethyl derivative. These findings highlight the role of different zirconium hydride compositions in facilitating alkane transformations under mild conditions.

硅基载金锆氢化物的组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。具体而言，Basset等人将金锆单氢化物（SiO）3ZrH视为烷烃氢解的催化位点，而Yermakov等人则认为金锆双氢化物（SiO）2ZrH2是活性中心。例如，丁烷在支持的金锆单氢化物上的氢解遵循一个催化循环，涉及丁基衍生物的形成，随后的C2-C3键断裂以及β-乙基片段的迁移。相比之下，在金锆双氢化物上进行的氢解过程以形成丁基衍生物开始，随后进行C2-C3键断裂，形成二乙基衍生物。这些发现突出了不同金锆氢化物组成的角色在温和条件下促进烷烃转化中的作用。

The cleavage of the C2C3 bond in the n-butyl fragment (10  12) requires the overcoming of the top-most energy barrier on the reaction path, transition state 11 (E = 31.9 kcal mol1, G298 = 33.0 kcal mol1 relative to 10).

We concluded that zirconium dihydrides 2, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al., unlike zirconium monohydrides 1, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

Nevertheless, it is of no doubt that dihydrides 2 could coexist with monohydrides 1 on the silica surface.

In our opinion, a more detailed experimental study has to be performed to determine the structure of real active centres in this catalytic system.
