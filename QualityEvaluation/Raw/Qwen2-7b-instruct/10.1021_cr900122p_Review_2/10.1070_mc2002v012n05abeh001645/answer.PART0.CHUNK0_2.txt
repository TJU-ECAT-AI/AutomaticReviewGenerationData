Silica-supported zirconium hydrides15 draw recently much atten- tion due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin poly- merization,12 CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes3 and polyole- fins4 under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes.56 Basset et al.36 considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH.
On the other hand, Yermakov et al.1,2 considered grafted zir- conium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the catalytic sites in this system.
The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides 1, which is consistent with that proposed by Basset et al.,36 is presented in Scheme 1. The energy profile is shown in Figure 1.
The process begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative 10 (E = 3.8 kcal mol1, G298 = 2.2 kcal mol1) via transition state 9 (E = 12.6 kcal mol1, G298 = 22.5 kcal mol1 relative to free reagents).

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of silica-supported zirconium hydrides influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH were considered by Basset et al. as the catalytic sites for alkane hydrogenolysis, while Yermakov et al. proposed zirconium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the active centers. For instance, the hydrogenolysis of butane on supported zirconium monohydrides follows a catalytic cycle involving the formation of n-butyl derivative, subsequent C2C3 bond cleavage, and the migration of a β-ethyl fragment. In contrast, the hydrogenolysis process on zirconium dihydrides begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative, followed by C2C3 bond cleavage leading to the formation of diethyl derivative. These findings highlight the role of different zirconium hydride compositions in facilitating alkane transformations under mild conditions.

硅基载金锆氢化物的组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。具体而言，Basset等人将金锆单氢化物（SiO）3ZrH视为烷烃氢解的催化位点，而Yermakov等人则认为金锆双氢化物（SiO）2ZrH2是活性中心。例如，丁烷在支持的金锆单氢化物上的氢解遵循一个催化循环，涉及丁基衍生物的形成，随后的C2-C3键断裂以及β-乙基片段的迁移。相比之下，在金锆双氢化物上进行的氢解过程以形成丁基衍生物开始，随后进行C2-C3键断裂，形成二乙基衍生物。这些发现突出了不同金锆氢化物组成的角色在温和条件下促进烷烃转化中的作用。
