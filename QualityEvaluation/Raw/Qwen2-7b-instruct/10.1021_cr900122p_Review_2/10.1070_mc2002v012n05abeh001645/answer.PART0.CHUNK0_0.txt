A DFT study of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium hydrides shows that only zirconium dihydrides are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions.

On the other hand, Basset et al. considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides.

Yermakov et al. considered grafted zirconium dihydrides as the catalytic sites in this system.

The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides, consistent with that proposed by Basset et al., involves the transformation of the initial hydride into n-butyl derivative with the elimination of a hydrogen molecule, followed by C2C3 bond cleavage and the migration of a β-ethyl fragment to zirconium.

The thermodynamic restriction of the alkane hydrogenolysis could be overcome if the considerable energy loss for the CC bond cleavage is compensated by the formation of two ethane molecules.

Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al., unlike zirconium monohydrides, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of silica-supported zirconium dihydrides enable them to efficiently catalyse the hydrogenolysis of alkanes under mild conditions, whereas zirconium monohydrides are not capable of this process under similar conditions. This capability is attributed to the unique structure and energetics of zirconium dihydrides, which allow for the thermodynamic facilitation of alkane cleavage into ethane molecules. The existence of zirconium dihydrides was postulated by Yermakov et al. in 1977, and recent studies confirm their role as active catalytic sites in alkane hydrogenolysis.

硅负载的锆二氢化物的组成、结构和反应条件使它们能够在温和条件下有效地催化烷烃的氢解，而锆单氢化物不具备这一过程。这种能力归因于锆二氢化物的独特结构和能量特性，允许烷烃裂解成乙烷分子的热力学促进作用。锆二氢化物的存在由Yermakov等人在1977年提出，并且最近的研究证实了它们作为烷烃氢解活性中心的作用。
