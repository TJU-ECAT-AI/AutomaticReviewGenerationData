Silica-supported zirconium hydrides draw recently much attention due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin polymerization, CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes. 

Zirconium dihydrides, however, were found to be much more active in the isotope exchange reaction. 

Moreover, we calculated the activation parameters of H/D exchange for zirconium dihydrides, which are in a much better agreement with experimental data than those for monohydrides.

The catalytic cycle for the C2C3 bond hydrogenolysis in butane on supported zirconium monohydrides, which is consistent with that proposed by Basset et al., is presented in Scheme 1. 

The process begins with the formation of n-butyl derivative 10 (E = 3.8 kcal mol1, G298 = 2.2 kcal mol1) via transition state 9 (E = 12.6 kcal mol1, G298 = 22.5 kcal mol1 relative to free reagents).

Unlike zirconium monohydrides, zirconium dihydrides 2, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al., are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions.

Nevertheless, it is of no doubt that dihydrides 2 could coexist with monohydrides 1 on the silica surface.

In our opinion, a more detailed experimental study has to be performed to determine the structure of real active centres in this catalytic system.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to catalyze low-temperature olefin polymerization, CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes under mild conditions, and H/D isotope exchange. Zirconium dihydrides, compared to monohydrides, demonstrate higher activity in isotope exchange reactions and are capable of catalyzing alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions. However, the exact structure of active centers in the catalytic system requires further experimental investigation.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢化和沸石催化反应等过程中。工业上这些催化剂的重要意义在于它们能够催化低温烯烃聚合、在温和条件下进行烷烃的CC键氢解以及实现烷烃同位素交换。锆二氢化合物与单氢化合物相比，在同位素交换反应中表现出更高的活性，并且能够催化烷烃在温和条件下的氢解。然而，催化体系中活性中心的确切结构需要进一步的实验研究来确定。
