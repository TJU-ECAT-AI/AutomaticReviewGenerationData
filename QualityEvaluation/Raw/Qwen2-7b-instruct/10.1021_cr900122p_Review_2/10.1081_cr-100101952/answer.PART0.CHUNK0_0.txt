The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include high selectivity, stability, and activity under reaction conditions that promote the desired transformation while minimizing side reactions. These catalysts are engineered to optimize surface properties, acidity, and metal-support interactions to enhance the conversion of ethane to aromatic hydrocarbons. The choice of promoters in modified H-ZSM-5 further tunes these properties, enhancing the catalyst's ability to efficiently transform ethane through the desired reaction pathways.
