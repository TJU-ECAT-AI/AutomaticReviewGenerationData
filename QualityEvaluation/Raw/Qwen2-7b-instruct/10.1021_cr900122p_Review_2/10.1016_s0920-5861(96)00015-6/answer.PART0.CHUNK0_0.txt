[1] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane."
[2] "Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."
[3] "The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment."
[4] "Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity."
[5] "These physical and chemical transformations of gallium species are responsible for the activity-selectivity changes in the initial reaction-regeneration cycles of propane aromatisation at 823 K."
[6] "The enhancement in catalytic performance is mostly due to Ga redispersion as evidenced by RBS data."
[7] "As seen from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3, the improvement in activity is much more drastic for Z356 SL1 than for Z234 SL2 after the first H2-O2 treatment."
[8] "The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity and average H/C ratio are consistent with the view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BriSnsted sites favour propane activation and aromatisation whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. Ga2O3, at the outer surface of the crystallites is mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) the need for carbon chain growth via acid-catalysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisation."
[9] "Our results confirm earlier findings that HE pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, by affecting the dispersion and chemical state of the metal modifier. Reductive atmospheres like hydrogen enhance the dispersion of metals like gallium, generating more dual active sites that combine gallium species and Brönsted sites from the zeolite, enhancing overall catalytic performance. Oxidative atmospheres like oxygen stabilize and anchor these highly dispersed metal species, often reoxidizing them to the +3 oxidation state, which appears to be responsible for their optimum activity. The interplay between the dispersion of the metal modifier and the reaction conditions determines the efficiency of alkane transformations, such as the aromatization of propane, with reductive and oxidative pretreatments playing crucial roles in preactivating and stabilizing the catalysts before their use in industrial processes.

In the context of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used for propane aromatization, hydrogen treatment increases the dispersion of gallium, generating more dual active sites that combine gallium species with Brönsted sites from the zeolite, enhancing overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment further enhances activity and aromatics selectivity, stabilizing and anchoring the highly dispersed gallium species. This process eliminates the induction period typically observed in the absence of such pretreatment, making the catalysts more efficient and stable for industrial use.

The factors contributing to the industrial significance of these metal-based catalysts include their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into valuable aromatic compounds, the cost-effectiveness of the catalysts, and their stability under harsh industrial conditions. The specific mechanisms of action, such as the synergistic interaction between the metal modifier and the zeolite framework, enable these catalysts to perform complex transformations with high selectivity and efficiency, making them indispensable in the petrochemical industry for processes like propane aromatization.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钨氧化物和金属交换沸石，如在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中，通过影响金属修饰剂的分散性和化学状态，影响烷烃转化的机制和效率。还原性气氛如氢气可以增强金属（如镓）的分散度，产生更多结合了镓物种和沸石骨架上的Brönsted酸位的双功能活性位点，从而增强整体催化性能。氧化性气氛如氧气可以稳定并锚定这些高度分散的金属物种，并且常常将它们氧化至+3价态，这似乎是对其最佳活性负责的状态。金属修饰剂的分散程度与反应条件之间的相互作用决定了烷烃转化的效率，其中还原和氧化预处理在预激活和稳定催化剂以供工业使用时扮演着关键角色。

在使用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂进行丙烷芳香化的情况下，氢气处理可以增加镓的分散度，产生更多结合了镓物种与沸石骨架上的Brönsted酸位的双功能活性位点，从而增强整体催化性能。氧处理进一步增强了活性和芳构化选择性，稳定并锚定了高度分散的镓物种。这一过程消除了在没有这种预处理的情况下通常观察到的诱导期，使催化剂在工业应用中更加高效和稳定。

这些金属基催化剂在工业中的重要性因素包括它们能够高效地将烷烃转化为有价值的芳香化合物的能力、催化剂的成本效益以及它们在苛刻工业条件下的稳定性。特定的作用机制，如金属修饰剂与沸石框架之间协同作用，使这些催化剂能够以高选择性和效率执行复杂转换，使之成为石油化工行业必不可少的，用于如丙烷芳香化等过程的催化剂。
