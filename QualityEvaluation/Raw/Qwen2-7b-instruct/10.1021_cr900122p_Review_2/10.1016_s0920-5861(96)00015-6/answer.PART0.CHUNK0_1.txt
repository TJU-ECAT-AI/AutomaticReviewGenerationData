[1] "The aromatisation of propane was investigated at 823 K on two Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts differing by their aluminum content (Si/A1 = 18 and 128, respectively), i.e. their BrSnsted acid site concentration, and having similar gallium content (1.6 wt%) as a function of successive pretreatments by hydrogen and oxygen."
[2] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane."
[3] "Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."
[4] "These improvements of catalytic performance are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby enhanced."
[5] "The effect of H2-O 2 pretreatment on the catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used to aromatise propane affects dramatically the catalytic performance, the major effect being observed for the first H2-O 2 cycle."
[6] "The first treatment in hydrogen increases activity and aromatics selectivity, and reduces methane formation."
[7] "The subsequent first treatment in oxygen does not affect methane selectivity but boosts further activity and aromatics selectivity."
[8] "The effect of hydrogen is clearly to increase the dispersion of the gallium modifier, thereby generating more dual active sites combining intimately gallium species [(Ga 3+, 0 2-) ion pairs) and Br/3nsted sites from the zeolite, enhancing overall catalytic performance, and dispersed gallium species acting as portholes to release dihydrogen, thus reducing methane production."
[9] "The effect of oxygen may be to stabilise and anchor these highly dispersed gallium species, in addition to reoxidising them to the 3 + oxidation state which appears to be responsible for their optimum activity."
[10] "Pretreating Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites firstly in hydrogen and secondly in oxygen at about 800- 850 K appears as a promising and convenient way to preactivate and stabilise them as catalysts prior to their use in aromatisation units."

1. The study focused on investigating the effects of hydrogen and oxygen treatments on the activity and selectivity of propane aromatization using two Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with different aluminum contents and similar gallium content.
2. Hydrogen treatment leads to increased activity and selectivity for the formation of aromatics, while decreasing the formation of methane.
3. Oxygen treatment further enhances the activity and aromatics selectivity of the catalysts without affecting the methane selectivity.
4. The improvements in catalytic performance are attributed to gallium migration under reducing conditions, which increases the concentration of highly dispersed gallium species.
5. Pretreatment with hydrogen and oxygen significantly affects the catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts used for propane aromatization.
6. The first hydrogen treatment increases activity and aromatics selectivity, reducing methane formation.
7. Subsequent oxygen treatment boosts activity and aromatics selectivity without changing methane selectivity.
8. Hydrogen treatment enhances dispersion of the gallium modifier, creating more dual active sites that combine gallium species and BrSnsted sites from the zeolite, improving overall catalytic performance and facilitating hydrogen release.
9. Oxygen treatment stabilizes and anchors the highly dispersed gallium species, reoxidizing them to the 3+ oxidation state, which appears to optimize their activity.
10. Pretreatment with hydrogen followed by oxygen at temperatures around 800-850 K seems to be an effective method for preactivating and stabilizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts before their use in propane aromatization units.
