The effect of reductive and oxidative atmospheres on the propane aromatisation activity and selectivity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts was studied. Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing methane formation. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further activity and aromatics selectivity, with little effect on methane selectivity. These improvements are attributed to gallium migration in reducing conditions, enhancing the concentration of highly dispersed gallium species, which together with BrSnsted centers, constitute the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation.

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷芳构化过程中的活性和选择性，通过还原性和氧化性气氛进行了研究。氢处理增加了活性和芳香族选择性，减少了甲烷的形成。随后的氧气处理进一步提高了活性和芳香族选择性，而对甲烷选择性影响较小。这些改进归因于在还原条件下镓迁移，增强了高度分散的镓物种的浓度，这些物种与BrSnsted中心结合，构成了负责烷烃活化的双重催化剂位点。

The role of reductive (hydrogen) and oxidative (oxygen) atmospheres in the activation of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane aromatisation was clarified. The first hydrogen treatment increases activity and aromatics selectivity, reduces methane formation. The subsequent first treatment in oxygen does not affect methane selectivity but boosts further activity and aromatics selectivity. The effect of hydrogen is to increase the dispersion of the gallium modifier, generating more dual active sites that combine gallium species and BrSnsted sites from the zeolite, enhancing overall catalytic performance. Oxygen treatment may stabilize and anchor these highly dispersed gallium species, in addition to reoxidizing them to the 3+ oxidation state, which appears to be responsible for their optimal activity. The gallium species cycle between the Ga(III) and Ga(I) states under these reaction conditions.

明确了还原性（氢）和氧化性（氧气）气氛在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于丙烷芳构化过程中的作用。首次氢处理增加了活性和芳香族选择性，减少了甲烷生成。随后的第一步氧气处理不影响甲烷选择性但进一步提升了活性和芳香族选择性。氢的作用是增加镓修饰剂的分散度，生成更多结合了镓物种和沸石中BrSnsted位点的双重活性位点，从而增强整体催化性能。氧气处理可能稳定并锚定这些高度分散的镓物种，并重新氧化它们至3+氧化态，这似乎是其最佳活性的原因。在这些反应条件下，镓物种在Ga(III)和Ga(I)状态之间循环。
