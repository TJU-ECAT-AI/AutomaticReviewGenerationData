2.1. "The conversion of propane and the aromatisation selectivity increase significantly when the catalysts are exposed to H2 pretreatment: after the first H2 exposure, activity increases by 15% for Z234 SL2 and 200% for Z356 SL1. The first O2 treatment also increases catalyst activity and aromatisation selectivity: activity increases by 30% for Z234 SL2 and 100% for Z356 SL1."
2.2. "Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is decreased by the first H2 treatment but not by the first O2 treatment whereas both the first H2 and O2 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity."
2.3. "Subsequent H2 and O2 treatments have only a marginal effect on catalyst activity and selectivity."
2.4. "The effect of H2 exposure is summarised hereabove. The subsequent effect of oxygen has received less attention in the past."
2.5. "The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity and average H/C ratio are consistent with the view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BrSnsted sites favour propane activation and aromatisation whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. Ga2O3, at the outer surface of the crystallites is mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) the need for carbon chain growth via acid-catalysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisation."
2.6. "Our results confirm earlier findings that H2-O2 pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and hydrogen release properties."
2.7. "The new observations are that activity and aromatics selectivity are further increased upon oxygen treatment whereas methane selectivity remains unchanged, and that only the first H2-O2 treatment affects dramatically the catalysts performance."
2.8. "H2-O2 pretreatment thus appear to be a promising way to preactivate and stabilise Ga-modified aromatisation catalysts in commercial operation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, hydrogen (H2) pretreatment increases the dispersion of the gallium modifier, enhancing overall catalytic performance and generating more dual active sites that combine gallium species with BrSnsted sites from the zeolite. Oxygen (O2) treatment stabilizes and anchors these highly dispersed gallium species, reoxidizing them to the 3+ oxidation state, which is responsible for optimum activity. The combination of H2-O2 pretreatment is a promising method to preactivate and stabilize Ga-modified aromatisation catalysts, eliminating the induction period typically observed in the absence of such pretreatment. This approach increases activity and aromatisation selectivity while maintaining stable methane selectivity, making it industrially significant for alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转换机制和效率。具体来说，氢（H2）预处理可以增加镓修饰剂的分散度，从而增强整体催化性能，并生成结合了沸石中BrSnsted位点与镓物种的更多双功能活性位点。氧气（O2）处理可以稳定并锚定这些高度分散的镓物种，并将它们氧化回3+氧化状态，这一状态对最佳活性负责。H2-O2预处理的组合是预先激活和稳定改性芳构化催化剂的一种有前景的方法，可以消除在没有这种预处理的情况下通常观察到的诱导期。这种方法显著增加了活性和芳构化选择性，同时保持稳定的甲烷选择性，对于烷烃转换过程具有工业重要性。
