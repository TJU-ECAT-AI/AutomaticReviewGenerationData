<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a critical role in the transformation of alkanes through oxidative processes. Their composition, structure, and reaction conditions significantly affect the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, the presence of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix enhances catalytic activity, while the stability of the product ensures consistent performance over time. Acidic and basic sites within the catalyst facilitate the activation of C-H bonds and the subsequent oxidation reactions, respectively.
