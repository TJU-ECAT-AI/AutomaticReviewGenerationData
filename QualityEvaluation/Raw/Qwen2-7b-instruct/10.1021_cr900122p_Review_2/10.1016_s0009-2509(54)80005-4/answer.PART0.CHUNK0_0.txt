[1] "In various manufacturing processes vanadium catalysts play an important part. In particular, the oxidation of sulphur dioxide with air (the .. contact process "), the oxidation of naphthalene to phthalic anhydride and, to a less degree, the oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride over this type of catalyst arc widely applied in tech- nical processes."
[2] "The reaction may be viewed as an oxidation- reduction process: the substance to be oxidized reduces the catalyst, which Was oxidizedby oxygen from the air."
[3] "However, a catalyst which is in interaction with an oxidizable sub- stance and air willalso be partly in the tetravalent state."
[4] "By comparing the activities of one catalyst in various reactions, additional information about the reaction mechanism may be obtained."
[5] "Precisely those reactions which arc of great importance in chemical industry arc strongly exothermic."
[6] "Because of the fact that oxidation by means of vanadium oxide catalysts finds much applica- tion in the authors' organisation, it was considered important to investigate the technological bases of these processes."
[7] "The oxidation of the following substances:benzene,toluene, naphthalene, and anthracene has been studied, The partial pressures of the reacting substances were varied to the greatest possible extent."
[8] "Both reaction components appeared to influence the reaction rate."
[9] "A formula depicting this influence is derived."
[10] "The formula may be interpreted by assuming two successive reactions,namely the reaction between the aromatic and the oxygen on the surface, and the re-oxldatlon of the partly reduced surface by means of oxygen."
[11] "Using kinetic data it is possible to determine the optimum temperature distribution in a fixed bed reactor used for the oxidation of sulphur dioxide and to make calculations of the ratio be- tween the amounts of catalyst to be used in the various stages of a multiple-stage reactor."
[12] "The conclusions, how- ever, have a much wider scope and in principle apply also to reversible reactions."
[13] "The dynamic situation in a large catalyst bed may diffcr considerably from the situation in a small bcd, it seemed possible that the mixing in a fluid bed of smaller diameter is not so thorough."
[14] "For this reason we consider the reactor to be an integrating converter in the circumstances applied in our experiments."
[15] "Neither docs the diffusion in the pores of the catalyst restrict the reaction rate, as appeared from an application of the formulae developed by TIIIELE [7] and WAGNER [8]."
[16] "This formula proves to describe the results with satisfactory accuracy."
[17] "It appears that both in the first and in the second converter the reactor rate is strongly reduced by the rate of diffusion in the pores: the effectiveness factor of the catalyst grains in the layers we examined did not exceed 45% and 20% for the two converters."
[18] "For the re-oxidation reaction of a vanadium oxide catalyst not retarded by diffusion we found 22 kcal/mol (see page 7)."
[19] "Conformable to theory, it appears that the activation energy decreases by about a factor 2 if there is internal diffusion."
[20] "The question arises as to whether this deviation is attended by a great drop in potential product-:ion. An approximative calculation shows that under optimum temperature conditions the pro- duction may be appreciably higher than under the actual conditions."
