1. The reaction can be seen as a combination of oxidation and reduction processes. The substance being oxidized reduces the catalyst, which was previously oxidized by oxygen from the air.
2. Oxidation reactions can occur without oxygen presence. For instance, anthracene can be oxidized to anthraquinone using manganese peroxide in an oxygen-free environment.
3. The temperature of the catalyst does not depend on the substance being oxidized, suggesting that the rate of the reaction is mainly determined by the re-oxidation of the catalyst.
4. The amount of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) was quantified by converting CO to CO2 using potassium, binding the CO2 to lime soda, and measuring the weight.
5. J. W. ASKINS et al. conducted measurements on a large catalyst bed to analyze the composition of gases at various heights within the bed.
6. Considering the circumstances of our experiments, the reactor is deemed to function as an integrating converter.
7. It seems likely that the mixing in a fluid bed of smaller diameter might not be as efficient as in larger beds, potentially affecting the reaction kinetics.
8. Neither does the diffusion in the catalyst pores limit the reaction rate, as indicated by the formulas developed by THELE and WAGNER.
9. It is hypothesized that the reaction takes place between the aromatic compound and the oxygen present on the underlying catalyst surface.
10. Under specific conditions, such as high oxygen pressure and low aromatic substance pressure, the catalyst color might change to yellowish-brown, while at lower oxygen pressure and higher aromatic substance pressure, the color could shift to greenish-blue.
11. The alignment of our experimental data with theoretical predictions encouraged us to adopt this kinetic equation as the foundation for further exploration of the process.

1. 反应可以被视为氧化和还原过程的组合。被氧化的物质会还原催化剂，该催化剂先前由空气中的氧气氧化。
2. 氧化反应可以在没有氧气的情况下进行。例如，可以通过在无氧环境中使用二氧化锰来氧化蒽醌以获得蒽醌。
3. 催化剂的温度与被氧化的物质无关，这表明反应速率主要由催化剂的重新氧化决定。
4. 碳一氧化合物（CO）和二氧化碳（CO2）的量通过将CO转化为CO2，然后将其与石灰结合并称重来量化。
5. J. W. ASKINS等人对大型催化剂床进行了测量，以分析床内不同高度处气体的组成。
6. 在我们实验条件下，反应器被认为是一个集成转换器。
7. 可能是小直径的流化床混合不如大床那样彻底，这可能影响反应动力学。
8. 催化剂孔内的扩散不会限制反应速率，这是THELE和WAGNER开发的公式的体现。
9. 假设反应发生在芳香化合物和位于基底催化剂表面的氧气之间。
10. 在特定条件下，如高氧压和低芳香物质压强，催化剂的颜色可能会变为黄褐色，而在低氧压和高芳香物质压强下，颜色可能会变为绿色或蓝色。
11. 我们发现实验数据与理论预测的一致性促使我们将此动力学方程作为进一步探讨过程的基础。
