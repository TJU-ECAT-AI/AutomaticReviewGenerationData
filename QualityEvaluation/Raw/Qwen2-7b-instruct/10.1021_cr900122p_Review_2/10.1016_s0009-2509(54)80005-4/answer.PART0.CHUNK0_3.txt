[1] "The reaction may be viewed as an oxidation- reduction process: the substance to be oxidized reduces the catalyst, which Was oxidizedby oxygen from the air."
[2] "The fact that the operating tcmperature of a catalyst proves to be independent of the substance to be oxidized, justifies the presumption that the rate is mainly determined by the reoxidation of the catalyst."
[3] "The dynamic state ofthefluid bed The gas velocity in these experiments was kept constant, because the conversion changed in a manner difficult to describe if variations occurred in the gas vclocity or in the amount of catalyst."
[4] "The dynamic situation in a large catalyst bed may diffcr considerably from the situation in a small bcd, it seemed possible that the mixing in a fluid bed of smaller diameter is not so thorough and that in elaborating the kinetics of reactions carried out in such ri. bed the usual mathematical methods might be followed."
[5] "Neither docs the diffusion in the pores of the catalyst restrict the reaction rate, as appeared from an application of the formulae developed by TIIIELE [7] and WAGNER [8]."
[6] "As such a maximum rate was never found we imagine the reaction to take place between the aromatic compound and the oxygen present on the underlying catalyst surface."
[7] "For the degree of occupation will automatically be fixed at a certain value, depend- ing on the rate of the reaction of the oxygen on the surface with the substance to be oxidized and the rate of re-oxidation of the reduced surface."
[8] "If, for the oxidation of one aromatic molecule, fJ molecules of oxygen are required, the following formula also holds :"
[9] "The structure of crystalline vanadium pentoxide induces us to attribute a catalytic action to certain oxygen ions."
[10] "In order to * Composition: 0% by weight V:P4' 21% by weight Hil0.j,;carrier: silica gel."
[11] "The experimental results are expressed by formula (6) with n = ! (see Fig. 12)."
[12] "From the strong influence exerted by SOs on the reaction rate we may conclude that this third reaction proceeds at a high rate."
[13] "From the values found for K*, it appears that equation (13) is, indeed, a good approximation at high conversion."
[14] "Also here a satisfactory agreement is found."
[15] "This formula provcs to describe the results with satisfactory accuracy."
[16] "In this manner a better approximation to the optimum temperature curve can be obtained (Simon-Carves Monsanto)."
[17] "It appeared that reduction of the grain size, while aiming at the same degree of conversion, made it possible to increase the production capacity [20]."

The document discusses the oxidation processes carried out using vanadium oxide catalysts, emphasizing the highly exothermic nature of these reactions, which can hinder the investigation of their kinetics. The fluid bed technique was employed to maintain a uniform temperature in the catalyst bed. The oxidation of various aromatic compounds was studied, and it was observed that both the concentration of the reactants influenced the reaction rate. A formula describing this influence was derived, suggesting that the reaction occurs between the aromatic compound and the oxygen present on the surface of the catalyst. The document also examines the effect of temperature distribution and catalyst usage in fixed-bed reactors, providing insights into optimizing the process. The kinetics of the reactions were used to determine the optimal temperature distribution in the reactor and the ratio between the amounts of catalyst used in different stages of a multi-stage reactor. The findings were compared with practical experiences. The document further explores the oxidation of sulfur dioxide by vanadium oxide catalysts, highlighting the importance of understanding the reaction mechanism for designing efficient reactors and optimizing the process parameters. Various aspects of technical reaction design, including the development of converter designs, are also discussed, showing trends in bringing the temperature distribution closer to the optimum, as economically feasible. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and optimization strategies for oxidation processes using vanadium oxide catalysts.
