[2] "Oxidations carried out by means of vanadium oxide catalysts"
[3] "The reaction may be viewed as an oxidation- reduction process: the substance to be oxidized reduces the catalyst, which Was oxidizedby oxygen from the air."
[4] "The fact that the operating tcmperature of a catalyst proves to be independent of the substance to be oxidized, justifies the presumption that the rate is mainly determined by the reoxidation of the catalyst."
[5] "Because of the above-mentioned difficulties a fluid bed was applied."
[6] "With this method, the tem- perature differences in the catalyst bed are negligible, while the temperature level can be adjusted in a simple manner."
[7] "Apparatus A diagram of the apparatus used is given in Fig. 1."
[8] "The reaction pro- ducts (together with the non-converted aromatic substance) were condensed by cooling them to - BOC (in the case of benzene - 90C), and subsequently analyzed."
[9] "The amount of CO and CO2 was measured by converting the CO into CO 2 with hopealite, binding the CO 2 to soda lime, and weighing."
[10] "As the dynamic situation in a large catalyst bed may diffcr considerably from the situation in a small bcd, it seemed possible that the mixing in a fluid bed of smaller diameter is not so thorough and that in elaborating the kinetics of reactions carried out in such ri. bed the usual mathematical methods might be followed."
[11] "For this reason we consider the reactor to be an integrating converter in the circumstances applied in our experiments."
[12] "Calculations of the mass transfer in a fluid bed,using the known relations, show that in the border- line case, where the external diffusion of the aromatic component would determine the gross reaction rate, the number of molecules reacting in a given period surpasses the number actually reacting in the experiments by at least 100 times."
[13] "Neither docs the diffusion in the pores of the catalyst restrict the reaction rate, as appeared from an application of the formulae developed by TIIIELE [7] and WAGNER [8]."
[14] "The structure of crystalline vanadium pentoxide induces us to attribute a catalytic action to certain oxygen ions."
[15] "This formula may be interpreted by assuming two successive reactions,namely the reaction between the aromatic and the oxygen on the surface, and the re-oxldatlon of the partly reduced surface by means of oxygen."
[16] "For the degree of occupation by the oxygen it may be expressed in the following formula:"
[17] "By combining formulae (1) and (5) we find for the reaction rate :"
[18] "The numerical values of the reaction constants are such that under technical conditions the influence of the oxygen pressure will be greater than that of the partial pressure of the aromatic compound."
[19] "In an analogous manner toluene can be oxidised to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid,anthracene to anthraquinone, methyl alcohol to formaldehyde,whereas from aliphatic hydro- carbons a large number of oxidation products (aldehydes, ketones and acids) can be derived."
[20] "Precisely those reactions which arc of great importance in chemical industry arc strongly exothermic."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways. Specifically:

1. Supported vanadium oxides are characterized by their high reactivity and selectivity in oxidation processes. Their structure allows for the adsorption of reactants and facilitates the transfer of electrons during the oxidation reaction. The catalysts are often applied in fluid bed configurations, ensuring uniform temperature distribution and allowing for high conversion rates of substrates like benzene, toluene, naphthalene, and anthracene. 

2. The reoxidation of the catalyst plays a crucial role in the reaction rate. The temperature of the catalyst does not change significantly with the substrate, suggesting that the reaction rate is primarily determined by the reoxidation of the catalyst rather than the equilibrium position. 

3. Fluid beds are employed in the experiments to minimize temperature variations within the catalyst bed and enable easier adjustment of the temperature level. This ensures consistent and efficient conversion of substrates.

4. The dynamic state of the catalyst particles is maintained constant throughout the experiments to ensure thorough mixing and prevent fluctuations in reaction rates due to changes in gas velocity or catalyst amount.

5. The dynamic situation in a larger catalyst bed can differ from that in a smaller bed, indicating that the mixing in a smaller fluid bed might not be as thorough. This affects the kinetics of reactions carried out in such beds.

6. The catalyst structure of crystalline vanadium pentoxide suggests a catalytic action attributed to certain oxygen ions within the lattice structure. These ions interact with aromatic molecules at the surface, influencing the rate of oxidation.

7. The reaction rate depends on the concentration of oxygen ions available for reaction and the amount of aromatic molecules adsorbed on the surface. The degree of coverage by oxygen ions is automatically fixed based on the rates of oxygen surface reactions and re-oxidation of the reduced surface.

8. The influence of the oxygen pressure on the reaction rate is greater than that of the partial pressure of the aromatic compound under technical conditions. 

9. Alkanes can undergo various transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, depending on the specific catalyst, reaction conditions, and desired products. These transformations are significant in chemical industries due to their ability to produce valuable chemicals from hydrocarbons.

10. Metal-exchanged zeolites offer selective catalysis for alkane transformations, enabling the production of specific alcohols, ketones, and acids from aliphatic hydrocarbons. The structure and properties of these catalysts allow for efficient and controlled reactions.

11. The selectivity and efficiency of these catalysts in alkane transformations are influenced by factors such as catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of oxygen. These factors collectively determine the mechanisms and efficiency of the transformations.
