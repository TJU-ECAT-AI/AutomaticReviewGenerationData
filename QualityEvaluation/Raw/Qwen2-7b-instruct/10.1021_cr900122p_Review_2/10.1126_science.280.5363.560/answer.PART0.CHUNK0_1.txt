1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to control the morphology of the catalysts, which affects their activity and selectivity. These catalysts enable efficient conversion of alkanes to more valuable products under mild conditions, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact compared to traditional methods. The use of amphiphilic dopants or oligomers in main-chain conjugated polymers, similar to those found in these metal-based catalysts, introduces processibility while maintaining electronic conductivity, facilitating the manipulation of dimensionality transitions towards on-off switching.
