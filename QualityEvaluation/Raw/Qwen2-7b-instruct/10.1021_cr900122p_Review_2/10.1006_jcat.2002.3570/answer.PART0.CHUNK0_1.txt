[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
[3] "The rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation (k1) and its ratio with alkane and alkene combustion (k2/k1 and k3/k1, respectively) were compared for both alkane reactants as a function of vanadia surface density."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[5] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions (<800 K)."
[7] "The picture of the sample surfaces evolving from isolated and sparsely distributed monovanadates, to nearly complete polyvanadate monolayers, followed by the gradual building of additional layers would lead to low areal ODH rates at low surface densities, because most of the surface is inactive Al2O3."
[8] "Ethane and propane dehydrogenation show similar activation energies, and the value decreases slightly for both reactants with increasing VOx surface density."
[9] "Dehydrogenation rates are much lower for ethane than for propane (Fig. 4) even though activation energies are similar (Fig. 6)."
[10] "The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH."

1. The catalytic properties of supported vanadia were studied for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.
2. Propene formation rates are significantly higher than ethene rates at the same temperature, yet activation energies for both are similar and insensitive to vanadia surface density.
3. Rate constants for oxidative dehydrogenation and alkane/alkene combustion were compared for ethane and propane as functions of vanadia surface density.
4. Activation energies for alkane combustion and oxidative dehydrogenation are comparable.
5. For ethane, the ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density, whereas it increases slightly for propane with increasing density.
6. The highest alkene yield is achieved with catalysts having predominantly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures avoiding homogeneous reactions.
7. At low surface densities, low areal ODH rates are due to most of the surface being inactive Al2O3.
8. Ethane and propane show similar activation energies, which slightly decrease with increased VOx surface density.
9. Although activation energies are similar, dehydrogenation rates for ethane are lower than for propane.
10. For ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, the ratio of k2/k1 remains unaffected by both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density.
