1. The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadium oxides with various vanadium oxide (VOx) surface densities and structures were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

2. As the vanadium surface density increases, two-dimensional polyvanadates emerge, alongside growing amounts of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities exceeding 7.0 V/nm2.

3. The ratio of alkane combustion to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction rate constants (k2/k1) remains constant regardless of reaction temperature.

4. The ratio of k2/k1, which represents alkane combustion to ODH reactions, shows only slight variation with reaction temperature.

5. The ratio of alkene combustion to ODH (k3/k1) drops significantly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane ODH.

6. The highest alkene yield is achieved with catalysts featuring mainly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures to prevent homogeneous reactions below 800 K.

1. 对不同范德瓦尔氧化物（VOx）表面密度和结构的氧化脱氢化作用，进行了铝酸盐支持的钒氧化物的催化性质研究。

2. 随着范德华表面密度的增加，出现了二维聚钒酸盐，并伴随着表面密度超过7.0 V/nm2时的V2O5结晶体增加。

3. 在反应温度下，烷烃燃烧到氧化脱氢化（ODH）反应速率常数比（k2/k1）保持不变。

4. k2/k1比率，代表烷烃燃烧与ODH反应，显示出仅轻微的温度依赖性。

5. 乙烷和丙烷ODH中，烷基燃烧与ODH（k3/k1）比率随反应温度的升高而显著降低。

6. 在避免800 K以下的均相反应的情况下，主要由孤立的单范德瓦尔物种构成的催化剂，以高温度操作，可获得最高的烯烃产率。
