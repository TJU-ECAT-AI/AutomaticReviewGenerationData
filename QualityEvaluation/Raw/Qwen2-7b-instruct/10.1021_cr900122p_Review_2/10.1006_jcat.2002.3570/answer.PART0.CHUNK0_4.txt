[4] "The vanadia surface density that produces the highest ethane and ethene rates per V has been variously reported to occur at 33 (9), 50 (7), or 70% (2) of the polyvanadate monolayer coverage."
[5] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[6] "The ratio of k3/k1 decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane ODH."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the catalytic properties of vanadia with different VOx surface densities and structures, which affect the rates and selectivities of ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The activation energies for alkane dehydrogenation and combustion are similar, while the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion is higher than that for alkane dehydrogenation, with the difference decreasing with increasing vanadia surface density. High yield of alkene is achieved with catalysts having predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures avoiding homogeneous reactions. The local structure of supported VOx domains plays a significant role in influencing reaction rates and selectivity. The efficiency of these catalysts is optimized by controlling the vanadia surface density and operating conditions, such as temperature, to achieve desired alkene selectivity and yield.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转化机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中的过程。这些因素对其工业意义的贡献包括不同VOx表面密度和结构下范德亚的催化性质，这影响了乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢的速率和选择性。烷烃脱氢和燃烧的活化能相似，而烷基化合物燃烧的显式活化能高于烷烃脱氢，且随着钒氧化物表面密度的增加差异减小。在高温度下使用主要由孤立单钒酸盐物种组成的催化剂，并避免同质反应，可以获得高丙烯收率。支持的VOx簇的局部结构对反应速率和选择性有显著影响。通过控制钒氧化物表面密度和操作条件，如温度，来优化催化剂效率，以实现所需的丙烯选择性和产率。
