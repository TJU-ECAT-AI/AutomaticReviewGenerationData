The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, play crucial roles in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, such as oxidative dehydrogenation. Higher vanadia surface densities lead to the formation of two-dimensional polyvanadates and V2O5 crystallites. The rate constants for oxidative dehydrogenation and alkane combustion vary with vanadia surface density, affecting the selectivity towards propene over ethene. Activation energies for these reactions are similar for ethane and propane, showing weak dependence on vanadia surface density. The ratio of alkane combustion rate to oxidative dehydrogenation rate depends on reaction temperature and vanadia surface density, with propane undergoing slightly more selective dehydrogenation at lower densities. Achieving the highest yield of alkene requires catalysts with predominantly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures to avoid homogeneous reactions.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently transform low-molecular-weight alkenes via oxidative dehydrogenation, offering a potentially attractive alternative to non-oxidative routes due to their exothermic nature and avoidance of carbon deposition. The selectivity towards specific alkenes, influenced by the local structure and surface density of the catalyst, enables tailored production of desired products in chemical synthesis and petrochemical industries.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持的钒氧化物，对于烷烃转换机制和效率的影响至关重要。较高的钒表面密度导致二维聚钒酸盐和V2O5晶粒的形成。氧化脱氢化和烷烃燃烧的速率常数随钒表面密度变化，影响丙烯对乙烯的选择性。脱氢化和烷烃燃烧的活化能相似，对钒表面密度的依赖性较弱。烷烃燃烧速率与氧化脱氢化速率的比值受反应温度和钒表面密度的影响，丙烷在较低密度下表现出更高的选择性脱氢化。通过使用主要由孤立的单钒酸盐物种构成的催化剂并在避免均相反应（<800 K）的高温下操作，可以获得最高的烯烃产率。

这些催化剂在工业中的重要性在于它们能够高效地通过氧化脱氢化将低分子量烯烃转化为所需产物，由于其放热性质和避免碳沉积，这提供了一种替代非氧化性途径的有吸引力的选择。特定烯烃的选择性受到催化剂局部结构和表面密度的影响，这使得在化学合成和石油化工行业中定制生产所需产品成为可能。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the catalytic properties of vanadia with different VOx surface densities and structures, which affect the rates and selectivities of ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The activation energies for alkane dehydrogenation and combustion are similar, while the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion is higher than that for alkane dehydrogenation, with the difference decreasing with increasing vanadia surface density. High yield of alkene is achieved with catalysts having predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures avoiding homogeneous reactions. The local structure of supported VOx domains plays a significant role in influencing reaction rates and selectivity. The efficiency of these catalysts is optimized by controlling the vanadia surface density and operating conditions, such as temperature, to achieve desired alkene selectivity and yield.
