[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "As V surface densities increase,two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
[3] "The apparent turnover rates for propane reactants is approximately eight times higher than for ethane, but the effects of vanadia surface density and the higher surface reactivity of the VOx oligomers are observed for both alkane reactants."
[4] "The initial selectivity to ethene is 75% for ethane ODH on VOx/Al2O3 and it does not change significantly with increasing VOx surface density."
[5] "The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reaction temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane ODH."

1. The catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadium oxides were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane across a range of vanadium oxide surface densities and structures.
2. As the vanadium oxide surface density increases, two-dimensional polyvanadates form through reactions involving VOV bonds connecting neighboring vanadium oxide species.
3. The propene formation rate is approximately eight times higher than the ethene formation rate for both reactants at a given reaction temperature.
4. The initial selectivity for ethene remains at 75% for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation on vanadium oxide/alumina catalysts, regardless of increasing vanadium oxide surface density.
5. The ratio of the rate constant for alkane combustion to the rate constant for dehydrogenation (k2/k1) is independent of both reaction temperature and vanadium oxide surface density for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.
