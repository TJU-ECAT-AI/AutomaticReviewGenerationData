1. The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity.

2. The catalytic cycle begins with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion. The introduction of water reduces the energy barrier for hydrogen recombination, which is essential for initiating the catalytic cycle. The increased acidity of the OH group in the hydroxylated structures facilitates this process, making hydrogen recombination more efficient.

3. EXAFS spectra at the Ga K-edge provided structural information about the Ga species in Ga/ZSM-5. It revealed the presence of a Ga2O2 core structure coordinating to zeolite oxygen anions, with a structure consistent with DFT calculations. The computations for this structure were performed for one specific ring configuration, indicating potential variations in site preference for bivalent cations within the ZSM-5 zeolite structure.

4. The dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer involves an initial heterolytic dissociation facilitated by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom. This process leads to olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination, resulting in the production of olefins and hydrogen.

5. The EXAFS analysis provided averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1. The computed structure for the Ga2O2 core is in reasonable agreement with the DFT calculations.

1. 添加蒸汽到烃类原料中，显著提高了Ga/ZSM-5上的丙烷脱氢反应活性，主要原因是稳定态反应中间体羟基化浓度的增加。这一改善归因于在Ga3+双核氧桥连复合物中氢气重新结合的条件比单核GaO+离子更为有利。水的存在促进了反应性部分水合镓物种的形成，从而增强了催化活性。

2. 催化循环从[H3Ga+(H)(OH)]+上的氢气脱附开始，形成GaO+离子。引入水降低了氢气重新结合的能量壁垒，这是启动催化循环所必需的。OH基团的酸性增强使这一过程更加有效，从而提高了氢气重新结合的效率。

3. 在Ga K边的EXAFS光谱提供了关于Ga/ZSM-5中Ga物种的结构信息。结果显示存在一个与框架氧阴离子配位的Ga2O2核心结构，结构与DFT计算一致。这些计算是基于特定环结构进行的，表明可能存在不同类型的双价离子配置。

4. 通过Ga2O2二聚体的烷烃脱氢涉及由Ga3+和额外框架氧原子形成的路易斯酸对的初始异裂化，导致烯烃脱附和氢气重新结合，最终生成烯烃和氢气。

5. EXAFS分析提供了Ga+/ZSM-5的平均结构数据，显示四个氧原子位于1.84 Å的距离，Ga-Ga协调为2.98 Å，协调数接近1，以及一个Ga-Al散射器位于2.72 Å的距离，协调数为1.1。计算得到的Ga2O2核心结构与DFT计算的结果相符。
