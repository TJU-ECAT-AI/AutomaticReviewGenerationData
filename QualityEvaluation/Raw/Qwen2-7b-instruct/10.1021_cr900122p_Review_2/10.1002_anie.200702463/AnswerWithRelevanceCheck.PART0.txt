          "The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity."
          "As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered."
          "The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide was ascribed to formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions."
          "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."
          "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."
          "The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom."
          "For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."
          "Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic (ΔE=102kJmol−1) and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion."
          "The strong decrease in the activation energy for H2 recombination on the Ga dimer is due to the increased acidity of the OH group."
          "The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data for Ga+/ZSM-5, indicating four oxygen atoms at a distance of 1.84 Å, a Ga-Ga coordination at 2.98 Å with a coordination number close to one, and a Ga-Al backscatterer at a distance of 2.72 Å with a coordination number of 1.1."
          "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

          The addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed significantly enhances propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. This improvement is attributed to the more favorable conditions for hydrogen recombination in binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes compared to mononuclear GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity. Mononuclear Ga-containing cations have been considered as potential active sites for alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The experimentally observed increase in activity of Ga+ species in ZSM-5 upon oxidation at 473K by nitrous oxide is attributed to the formation of gallyl (GaO+) ions. Adding water to the feed strongly increases the activity, with the main product remaining propylene, though with increasing water content, slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed. The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high (305kJmol−1), which is due to the very low acidity of the hydrogen atom attached to the oxygen atom. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion.

          添加蒸汽到烃类原料中显著提高了Ga/ZSM-5上的丙烷脱氢反应活性，导致稳定态反应中间体羟基化浓度的增加。这一改进归因于在Ga3+双核氧桥连复合物中氢气重新结合的条件比单核GaO+离子更为有利。水的存在促进了反应性部分水合镓物种的形成，从而增加了催化剂的活性。单核镓含镓离子被视为单核GaLewis酸位点的潜在活性位点，用于烷烃活化。实验观察到在473K时，通过亚硝酸氧化ZSM-5中的Ga+物种，活动性增加归因于形成gallyl（GaO+）离子。向流体中添加水显著增加了活性，主要产品仍然是丙烯，但随着水含量的增加，少量甲烷和乙烷的生成量有所增加。水的促进作用归因于形成反应性部分水合镓物种。氢气重新结合的能量壁垒非常高（305kJmol−1），这是由于附着在氧原子上的氢原子的极低酸度造成的。对于单核镓位点，催化循环由从 [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ 上的氢气脱附开始，形成GaO+离子。水在簇I的解离是放热的（ΔE=102kJmol−1），导致形成结构II，其中包含一个与相邻的Ga+离子相互作用的 [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ 离子。Ga二聚体上氢气重新结合的活化能强烈降低，这是由于OH基团酸性的增加。EXAFS分析提供了Ga+/ZSM-5的平均结构数据，表明四个氧原子位于1.84 Å的距离，Ga-Ga协调为2.98 Å，协调数接近1，以及一个Ga-Al散射器位于2.72 Å的距离，协调数为1.1。通过Ga3+和额外框架氧原子形成的路易斯酸对（方案1）的异裂化导致烷烃在Ga2O2二聚体上的初始异裂化，随后是烯烃脱附和氢气重新结合。

          Recent experimental studies and computational analyses have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. The primary product remains propylene, but with an increase in water content, there is a slight increase in the formation of methane and ethylene. The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites starts with the desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+. StructureIV features a nearly square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively. To sustain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate, continuous water addition is necessary.

          最近的实验研究和计算分析已经增进了我们对单核GaLewis酸位点的烷烃活化机制的理解。主要产品仍然是丙烯，但随着水含量的增加，甲烷和乙烷的生成量略有增加。对于单核镓位点的催化循环，从 [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ 上的氢气脱附开始。结构IV包含一个几乎方形和平面的Ga2O2核心，其中质子和氢离子分别被固定在额外框架的Ga原子和氧原子上。为了维持高稳定态浓度的羟基化反应中间体，需要连续添加水。
