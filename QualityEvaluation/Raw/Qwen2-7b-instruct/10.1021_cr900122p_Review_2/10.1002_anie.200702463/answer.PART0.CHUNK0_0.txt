"Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters."
"Propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 is substantially improved upon addition of steam to the hydrocarbon feed, which is due to an increase of the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates."
"Quantum-chemical computations indicate that H2 recombination, required to initiate the catalytic cycle, is more favorable over binuclear oxygen-bridged Ga3+ complexes than over mononuclear GaO+ ions."
"Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity."
"StructureIV contains an almost square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively."
"In contrast, the effect on H2O desorption is much smaller."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The presence of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters in zeolites can profoundly affect hydrocarbon activation. Adding steam to the hydrocarbon feed enhances the dehydrogenation process over gallium-containing zeolites, leading to an increase in the steady-state concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates. Quantum-chemical computations show that hydrogen recombination is more favorable over binuclear oxygen-bridged gallium complexes compared to mononuclear gallium oxygen ions. The introduction of water into the reaction system stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged gallium-containing cationic reaction intermediates, facilitating hydrogen desorption. The structure of these intermediates includes a Ga2O2 core with hydride and proton binding, while the effect on water desorption is less pronounced.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率有着显著影响，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。在沸石中的额外框架过渡金属离子簇可以深刻地影响烃类活化。将蒸汽添加到碳氢化合物进料中可以极大地增强镓基沸石的脱氢过程，导致反应中间体羟基化状态的稳态浓度增加。量子化学计算表明，与单一核镓氧离子相比，二核氧桥接的镓复合物中的氢重新组合更为有利。向反应系统中引入水可以稳定二核羟基桥接的镓含离子反应中间体，并促进氢气的释放。这些中间体的结构包括一个Ga2O2核心，其中含有氢化物和质子绑定，而水的脱附效果较小。
