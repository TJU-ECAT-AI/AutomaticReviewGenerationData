Water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5 relates to transformation of single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core.

Recent experimental and computational studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. Various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered as candidate active sites.

Addition of water to the feed leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. 

The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion.

StructureIV contains an almost square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively. Rearrangement of structureIV to the conventional situation with two isolated [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ions (structureV) interacting through a hydrogen bond costs 68kJmol1.

Hydrogen evolution is observed around 600K over Ga+/ZSM-5 in an atmosphere of 0.3vol% H2O in He.

Four O atoms are detected at a distance of 1.84Å in the EXAFS fit parameters for a model catalyst obtained by oxidation of Ga+/ZSM-5 by nitrous oxide at 473K.

The EXAFS analysis provides averaged structural data attesting to the presence of a Ga2O2 core structure coordinating to the zeolite oxygen anions with a structure in reasonable agreement with the DFT calculations.
