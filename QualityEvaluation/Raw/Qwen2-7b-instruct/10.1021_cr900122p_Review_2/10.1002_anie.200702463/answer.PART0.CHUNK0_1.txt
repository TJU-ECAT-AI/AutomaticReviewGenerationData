Water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5 relates to the transformation of single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core.
Recent experimental and computational studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites.
Addition of water to the feed leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion.
The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species.
The energy barrier for hydrogen recombination is prohibitively high for mononuclear gallium sites.
Water dissociation at clusterI is exothermic and leads to formation of structureII, which contains a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion in which the hydroxyl group coordinates to the neighboring Ga+ ion.
StructureIV contains an almost square and planar Ga2O2 core with hydride ions and protons bound to the extraframework Ga cations and O anions, respectively.
Continuous addition of water is required to maintain a high steady-state concentration of the hydroxylated reaction intermediate.

1. The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5 involves the transformation of single Ga+ centers into binuclear cationic Ga complexes with a Ga2O22+ core, which facilitates hydrogen desorption and initiates the catalytic cycle.

2. The mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites includes the formation of a Lewis acid-base pair between the Ga+ ion and a zeolite-framework basic oxygen anion, leading to CH bond activation.

3. Addition of water to the propane feed over Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst leads to a substantial increase in propane conversion, indicating enhanced alkane activation.

4. The promotion effect of water is attributed to the formation of reactive partially hydrolyzed gallium species, which lowers the activation energy for alkane dehydrogenation.

5. For mononuclear gallium sites, hydrogen recombination requires an excessively high energy barrier, which is why water formation is strongly favored over hydrogen desorption.

6. Upon water adsorption, a cluster of gallium and aluminum ions forms, allowing for the exothermic dissociation of water and the formation of structureII containing a [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ ion.

7. The final structureIV comprises a stable Ga2O2 core, where hydride ions and protons are bound to the gallium cations and oxygen anions, respectively, facilitating alkane dehydrogenation.

8. Continuous water addition is essential to maintain a high concentration of hydroxylated reaction intermediates, supporting the steady-state performance of the Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst in alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 水诱导增强的Ga/ZSM-5对烷烃活化速率与单个Ga+中心转化为涉及Ga2O22+核心的双核阳离子Ga复合物有关，这促进了氢离解并启动催化循环。

2. 单个GaLewis酸位点的烷烃激活机制包括Ga+离子与沸石框架基本氧阴离子形成的Lewis酸-碱对，导致CH键活化。

3. 在Ga/ZSM-5催化剂上添加水到丙烷进料中导致丙烷转化率显著增加，表明增强了烷烃活化。

4. 水的促进效果归因于形成反应活性部分水解镓物种，降低了烷烃脱氢的活化能。

5. 对于单核镓位点，氢离解需要过高的能量壁垒，因此水形成比氢脱附更为有利。

6. 在水吸附下，由镓和铝离子组成的簇形成，允许水的热裂解并形成包含[Ga3+(H)(OH)]+离子的结构II。

7. 最终结构IV包含一个稳定的Ga2O2核心，其中质子和氢离子分别被固定在镓原子和氧原子上，支持烷烃脱氢。

8. 连续水添加对于维持高浓度羟基化反应中间体至关重要，支撑Ga/ZSM-5催化剂在烷烃脱氢过程中的稳定性能。
