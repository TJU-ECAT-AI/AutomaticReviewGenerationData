In situ 1H MAS NMR monitoring of the kinetics of the H/D hydrogen exchange between small alkanes, methane and ethane, and acidic form (H-BEA) and Zn-loaded form of zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA) allowed us to draw the following conclusions.

Kinetic parameters of the exchange between methane and H-BEA are similar to those earlier obtained for this alkane on acid zeolites. The activation energy is 138 kJ mol1 and the re- action occurs slowly at temperatures in the range 548563 K.

Hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of Zn/H-BEA and small alkanes (methane and ethane) occurs with a notable rate at a temperature 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA.

The rate of exchange is more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to that on H-BEA. The decrease of the tem- perature of the reaction and the essentially higher rate and lower activation energy (8688 kJ mol1) compared to H-BEA are attributed to the promoting effect of zinc in zeolite. The pro- motion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups.

1. The exchange between methane and H-BEA has similar kinetic parameters to previous studies on acid zeolites, with an activation energy of 138 kJ mol1 occurring at temperatures between 548 and 563 K.

2. The hydrogen exchange between the Brnsted acid sites of Zn/H-BEA and small alkanes happens at a notably faster rate at a temperature 100 K lower than that on H-BEA.

3. The rate of exchange on Zn/H-BEA is over two orders of magnitude faster compared to H-BEA, with lower activation energy of 8688 kJ mol1. This is attributed to the catalytic effect of zinc, which may involve the formation of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange process.

1. 甲烷与H-BEA之间的交换具有与先前在酸性沸石上的研究相似的动力学参数，激活能为138 kJ mol1，在温度范围为548至563 K之间。

2. Zn/H-BEA上小烷烃（甲烷和乙烷）的氢交换速率在比H-BEA低100 K的温度下明显更快。

3. Zn/H-BEA上的交换速率相对于H-BEA超过两个数量级，激活能为8688 kJ mol1。这归因于锌的催化作用，可能涉及交换过程中形成Zn-烷基物种。
