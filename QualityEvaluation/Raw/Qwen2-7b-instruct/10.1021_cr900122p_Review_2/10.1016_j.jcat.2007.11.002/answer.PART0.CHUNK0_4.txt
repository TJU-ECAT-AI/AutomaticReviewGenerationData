The role of possibly formed Zn-alkyl species, as well as the Brnsted acid sites, in small alkane activation requires further clarification. A reaction of hydrogen H/D exchange between acid sites of the zeolite and alkane molecule could help to establish the mechanism of alkane activation on Zn-loaded zeolites.

<quotes>
The rate of exchange is more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to that on H-BEA. The decrease of the tem- perature of the reaction and the essentially higher rate and lower activation energy (8688 kJ mol1) compared to H-BEA are attributed to the promoting effect of zinc in zeolite.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The exchange rate is over two orders of magnitude higher than on H-BEA. The reduction in reaction temperature and the significantly higher rate along with lower activation energy (8688 kJ/mol) compared to H-BEA are attributed to zinc's promotional effect in the zeolite.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
交换速率比H-BEA高两个数量级以上。反应温度的降低以及与H-BEA相比，显著更高的速率和更低的激活能量（8688 kJ/mol）归因于锆在沸石中的促进效应。
