[1] "The rate of exchange is more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to that on H-BEA."
[2] "The decrease of the tem- perature of the reaction and the essentially higher rate and lower activation energy (8688 kJ mol1) compared to H-BEA are attributed to the promoting effect of zinc in zeolite."
[3] "The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

1. The rate of hydrogen exchange between small alkanes and acidic sites of Zn/H-BEA is significantly faster than on H-BEA.
2. The reduction in reaction temperature and the lower activation energy (8688 kJ mol1) compared to H-BEA are explained by zinc's promoting effect in the zeolite.
3. Zinc promotes the exchange by facilitating the formation of Zn-alkyl species, which can originate from either ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located near or distant from SiO()Al groups.

1. 小烷烃与酸性位点之间在Zn/H-BEA上的氢交换速率比在H-BEA上快两个数量级。
2. 反应温度的降低以及与H-BEA相比更低的活化能（8688 kJ mol1）归因于锌在沸石中的促进作用。
3. 锌通过促进形成Zn-烷基物种来促进交换，这些物种可以来源于靠近或远离SiO()Al组的ZnO簇或Zn2+离子。
