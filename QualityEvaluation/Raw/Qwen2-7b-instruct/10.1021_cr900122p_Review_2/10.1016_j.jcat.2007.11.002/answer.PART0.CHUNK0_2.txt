[1] "The kinetic parameters of the exchange between methane and H-BEA are similar to those earlier obtained for this alkane on acid zeolites. The activation energy is 138 kJ mol−1 and the re- action occurs slowly at temperatures in the range 548−563 K."
[2] "Hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of Zn/H-BEA and small alkanes (methane and ethane) occurs with a notable rate at a temperature 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."
[3] "The rate of exchange is more than two orders of magnitude higher compared to that on H-BEA. The decrease of the tem- perature of the reaction and the essentially higher rate and lower activation energy (8688 kJ mol−1) compared to H-BEA are attributed to the promoting effect of zinc in zeolite."
[4] "The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

1. The activation energy for the hydrogen exchange between methane and the acidic form of zeolite H-BEA is 138 kJ mol−1, and the reaction occurs slowly at temperatures between 548 and 563 K.
2. The hydrogen exchange between the Brnsted acid sites of Zn/H-BEA and small alkanes happens at a notable rate at a temperature 100 K lower than on H-BEA.
3. The rate of exchange on Zn/H-BEA is over two orders of magnitude faster compared to H-BEA, with a significantly decreased activation energy of 8688 kJ mol−1 attributed to zinc's promoting effect in the zeolite.
4. Zinc promotes the exchange by involving Zn-alkyl species, which can form on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located near or far from SiO()Al groups.

1. 等离子H-BEA型沸石上甲烷与酸性沸石之间的氢交换的活化能为138 kJ mol−1，在548至563 K的温度范围内反应缓慢进行。
2. 在温度低100 K的情况下，Zn/H-BEA的Brnsted酸位点与小烷烃的氢交换发生明显速率更快，相较于纯H-BEA。
3. Zn/H-BEA上的交换速率超过H-BEA的两个数量级，与活化能降低到8688 kJ mol−1（相较于H-BEA）相关，锌在沸石中的促进作用归因于此。
4. 锌通过涉及Zn-烷基物种促进交换，这些物种可以在靠近或远离SiO()Al组分的ZnO簇或Zn2+离子上形成。
