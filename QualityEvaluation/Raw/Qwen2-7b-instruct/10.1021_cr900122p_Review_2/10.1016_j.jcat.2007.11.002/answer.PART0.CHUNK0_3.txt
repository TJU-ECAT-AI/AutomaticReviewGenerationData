Abstract Hydrogen (H/D) exchange between Brnsted acid sites of both the acidic form of zeolite beta (H-BEA) and Zn-loaded zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA) and small alkanes (methane and ethane) has been studied by monitoring the kinetics of the exchange in situ with 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy within the temperature range of 433563 K. On Zn/H-BEA, the exchange has been found to be more than two orders of magnitude faster compared to that on H-BEA. The decrease of reaction temperature and activation energy of the exchange on Zn/H-BEA (8688 kJ mol1) compared to the acidic form of zeolite H-BEA (138 kJ mol1) has been rationalized by the promoting effect of zinc. We propose that the mechanism of the H/D exchange on Zn/H-BEA involves Zn-alkyl species as intermediates.

2. Experimental

2.1. Materials characterization and samples preparation

The acidic form of the zeolite beta (H-BEA) (Si/Al = 18,average crystal size 0.10.2 m) was synthesized using tetra- ethyl-ammonium hydroxide as template with subsequent calci- nations at 823 K in an air flow for 6 h [29].

Zinc-loaded zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA) was prepared by im- penetrant of the zeolite H-BEA with a saturated solution of zinc formate, subsequent drying at 473 K for 14 h and further calcination at 673 K for 4 h in a flow of air. The Zn con- tent in the obtained zeolite Zn/H-BEA was 7.2 wt%.

2.2. NMR measurements

NMR spectra were recorded at 9.4 T on a Bruker Avance- 400 spectrometer equipped with high temperature broad-band double-resonance MAS probe. Zirconia rotors (7 mm outer diameter) with the inserted sealed glass tube were spun at 3 5 kHz by dried compressed air at 300568 K. 1H MAS spectra were recorded by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence (π/2τπτ acquire), where τ equals to one rotor period (200333 s).

The excitation pulse length was 4.5 s (π/2), and typically 624 scans were accumulated with a 626 s delay. In double- resonance 1H{27Al} TRAPDOR experiments [32,33] a Hahn- echo sequence was applied to the 1H channel with irradiation of aluminum during the both τ periods. The 27Al nutation fre- quency of the irradiation field was about 70 kHz. 27Al MAS spectra were acquired with a short π/12 radio-frequency pulse (0.6 s), and about 1000 scans were accumulated with a 0.5 s recycle delay. 29Si MAS spectra were recorded with π/2 exci- tation pulse of 5.0 s duration, and 1015 s repetition time, and 1000 scans for signal accumulation. Both 27Al and 29Si NMR spectra were recorded using 4 mm rotors and a spinning rate of 10 kHz. The chemical shifts were referenced to TMS for 1H and 29Si NMR and to 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 solution for 27Al NMR. The sample temperature was controlled by the Bruker BVT-2000 variable-temperature unit. The calibration of the temperature inside the rotor was performed with an accuracy of 2 K by us- ing lead nitrate, located inside the rotor, as a 207Pb MAS NMR chemical shift thermometer [34].

3. Results

3.1. Characteristics of hydroxyl groups of the H-BEA and
Zn/H-BEA with IR and NMR

The IR spectrum of OH groups of H-BEA zeolite exhibits well-known [3646] five signals, see Fig. 1. The signal at 3745 cm1 belongs to the terminal and internal at frame- work defects SiOH groups. The signal at 3610 cm1 is due to strongly acidic bridging hydroxyl groups. The broad band at 36003300 cm1 is assigned to bridged hydroxyls which are perturbed by H-bond interactions with the zeolitic frame- work [43,45]. The signal at 36603680 cm1 belongs to the acid OH groups connected to Al partially attached to the frame- work and located on external surfaces [37,38]. The band at 3790 cm1 is attributed to low-acidity OH groups bonded to extra-lattice aluminum [37,39]. Similar bands are observed for Zn/H-BEA.

3.2. Which OH groups of the zeolites are involved in the
exchange?

During the H/D exchange between zeolitic OH groups and fully deuterated alkane molecules, the intensities of OH groups involved in the reaction should decrease, while the intensity of the alkane molecule signals increases in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum. Fig. 3 shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of H-BEA with adsorbed CD4 recorded before and after H/D exchange.

The negative peaks in the difference spectrum (Fig. 3c) belong to the OH groups of the zeolite which are involved in the ex- change. It is evident that both the acidic SiOHAl groups with chemical shift of 4.05.1 ppm and non-acidic SiOH groups with the chemical shift of 1.7 ppm are involved in the H/D exchange. For Zn/H-BEA both SiOHAl and SiOH groups are involved in the exchange as well.

3.3. Kinetics model

The kinetics of the exchange was analyzed assuming a par- allel scheme of H/D exchange. In this scheme, all deuterium atoms in alkane exchange consecutively by the protium of the SiOHAl groups. In parallel, there is also a hydrogen ex- change between SiOHAl and SiOH groups. Reactions (R1) (R5) in Table 1 were used for modeling the H/D exchange of methane-d4. Reactions (R1)(R4) describe a consecutive ex- change with SiOHAl groups. Reaction (R5) takes into account a transfer of hydrogen atoms between SiOHAl and SiOH groups.

For each of the alkanes under study, the reaction rate constants were assumed to be equal for all consecutive stages of the exchange of the SiOHAl groups with alkane, i.e., the rate constants kSiOHAl were similar for the Reactions (R1)(R4) or the Reactions (R6)(R11).

3.4. H/D exchange of methane-d4 on zeolite H-BEA

Fig. 4 shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of methane-d4 ad- sorbed on zeolite H-BEA in dependence on reaction time. An increasing signal at 0.0 ppm belongs to methane CDmH4m (m = 03). Two decreasing signals at 4.0 and ca. 5.1 ppm arise from SiOHAl groups. The signal at 1.7 ppm has mainly a con- tribution from terminal SiOH groups and decreases also with the reaction time. The growth of the signal at 0.0 ppm and si- multaneous decrease of the signals at 4.0, 5.1 and 1.7 ppm is due to a transfer of protium from SiOHAl to CD4 and due to intra-zeolite H/D exchange between SiOHAl and SiOH groups.

Simulation of experimentally obtained kinetic curves for the alkane and both acidic and non-acidic hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5) in accordance to the parallel scheme of the exchange (Table 1) offers the rate constants for both the alkane exchange with Brnsted acid sites and intra-zeolite exchange between SiOH and SiOHAl. The obtained values of kintra are at least 4 times higher than kSiOHAl (Table 2).

3.5. H/D exchange of methane-d4 and ethane-d6 on Zn/H-BEA

1H MAS NMR spectra of methane-d4 (or ethane-d6) ad- sorbed on Zn/H-BEA show similar changes like for methane-d4 adsorbed on H-BEA. The intensity of the signal from the alkane increases while the intensities of both SiOHAl and SiOH de- crease (Fig. 7). A profound difference between the zeolites is that for Zn/H-BEA the exchange is already notable at 430 K.

The exchange approaches equilibrium within 20 min at 508 K,whereas for H-BEA this equilibrium would be reached only af- ter 30 days at 508 K.

The kinetics of the H/D exchange was monitored for methane-d4 and ethane-d6 in the temperature range of 433 548 K, see Figs. 8 and 9. The obtained values of kSiOHAl and kintra are given in Table 2. For Zn/H-BEA, the rates of the H/D exchange between SiOHAl groups and the alkanes are compa- rable with rate of intra-zeolite exchange (kSiOHAl kintra). The rate kintra can be determined with a better accuracy than for ze- olite H-BEA.

The study investigates the hydrogen (H/D) exchange between Brnsted acid sites of zeolite beta (H-BEA) and Zn-loaded zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA) with small alkanes (methane and ethane) through in situ 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy. The exchange rate on Zn/H-BEA is significantly faster, over two orders of magnitude, compared to H-BEA. This faster reaction rate and lower activation energy (8688 kJ/mol) compared to H-BEA's 138 kJ/mol, attributed to zinc's promoting effect, suggests that the mechanism involves Zn-alkyl species as intermediates.

The materials preparation includes synthesizing H-BEA using tetraethylammonium hydroxide and preparing Zn/H-BEA via impregnation with zinc formate, followed by drying and calcination. The characteristics of hydroxyl groups are explored through IR and NMR methods.

The exchange process is modeled using a parallel scheme of H/D exchange, considering the consecutive exchange with SiOHAl groups and a transfer of hydrogen atoms between SiOHAl and SiOH groups. The reaction rate constants are determined by fitting the experimental kinetic curves, with the rate constants for the alkane exchange with Brnsted acid sites and intra-zeolite exchange being at least 4 times higher for H-BEA.

For Zn/H-BEA, the exchange is notably faster even at lower temperatures, with the exchange approaching equilibrium within 20 minutes at 508 K, compared to 30 days at 508 K for H-BEA. The study also observes a comparable rate of hydrogen exchange between SiOHAl groups and the alkanes on Zn/H-BEA with the intra-zeolite exchange rate, allowing for a better determination of the rate constant for the intra-zeolite exchange on Zn/H-BEA.

The mechanism of hydrogen exchange on Zn/H-BEA is proposed to involve Zn-alkyl species as intermediates, which can be formed on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located in the zeolite framework. This promotes the exchange process, leading to faster reaction kinetics and lower activation energy compared to H-BEA.

研究通过原位1H MAS NMR光谱法研究了酸性沸石β（H-BEA）和锌负载型β沸石（Zn/H-BEA）上小烷烃（甲烷和乙烷）之间的氢（H/D）交换。在433至563 K的温度范围内，Zn/H-BEA上的交换速率比H-BEA快两个数量级。这种更快的反应速率和较低的活化能（8688 kJ/mol，与H-BEA的138 kJ/mol相比），归因于锌的促进作用，表明机制涉及锌-烷基物种作为中间体。

材料制备包括使用四乙基氨化物合成H-BEA，以及通过锌草酸盐浸渍、干燥和煅烧制备Zn/H-BEA。通过红外和核磁共振方法探索了羟基团的特性。

交换过程采用平行方案进行建模，考虑了与SiOHAl组分的连续交换以及SiOHAl和SiOH组分之间的氢原子转移。通过拟合实验动力学曲线确定反应速率常数，发现用于烷烃与酸性位点交换的速率常数和内沸石交换速率常数至少比H-BEA高4倍。

对于Zn/H-BEA，即使在较低温度下，交换也明显更快，在508 K时达到平衡仅需20分钟，而H-BEA则需要30天。研究还观察到Zn/H-BEA上烷基与SiOHAl之间的氢交换速率与内沸石交换速率相当，使得对Zn/H-BEA内的交换速率常数的确定更加准确。

Zn/H-BEA上的氢交换机制被提议涉及形成位于沸石框架内的锌-烷基物种作为中间体。这促进了交换过程，导致与H-BEA相比更快的反应速率和更低的活化能。
