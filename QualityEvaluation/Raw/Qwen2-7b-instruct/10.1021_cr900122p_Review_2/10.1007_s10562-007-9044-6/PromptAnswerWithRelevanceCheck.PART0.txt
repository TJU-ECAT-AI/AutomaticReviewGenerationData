<p>Analysis of kinetics of the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of zeolite Zn/H-MFI and deuterated propane-d 8 by 1H MAS NMR in situ in the temperature range of 420490 K pointed to the regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of propane.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms are suggested to account for this result.

The study investigates the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of the Zn/H-MFI zeolite and deuterated propane-d 8. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the regioselective hydrogen exchange in the methyl groups of propane. One mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites, followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups according to the Markovnikovs rule, with deuterium abstraction by isopropyl carbenium ion from the next propane molecule. The alternative mechanism includes a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane onto ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, resulting in the formation of Zn-propyl species and acidic sites. The rate constants and activation energy for this regioselective hydrogen exchange were determined through kinetic measurements and an Arrhenius plot.

该研究探讨了Zn/H-MFI沸石与去氘化丙烷-d 8之间的氢交换。提出了两种机制来解释丙烷甲基中选择性的氢交换。一种机制涉及在Zn位点上进行丙烷脱氢，随后通过酸性OH基团对丙烯的质子化遵循马洛尼科夫规则，并由另一个丙烷分子的异丙基碳正离子从下一个丙烷分子抽象脱氘。另一种机制包括丙烷在ZnO簇或Zn2+离子上的可逆离解吸附，形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性位点。通过动力学测量和Arrhenius图确定了这种选择性氢交换的速率常数和活化能。

The regioselectivity of the hydrogen exchange between propane-d 8 and the acidic hydroxyl groups of Zn/H-MFI zeolite is explained by two mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of propane on Zn-sites, followed by the protonation of propene by acidic OH groups according to Markovnikov's rule, and the abstraction of deuterium from another propane molecule by isopropyl carbenium ion. The second mechanism proposes a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane onto ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations to form Zn-propyl species and acidic sites.

The activation energy for the regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups of propane-d 8 on Zn/H-MFI was estimated to be 80 kJ/mol. This value differs significantly from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting that the mechanism of H/D exchange on Zn/H-MFI might be different.

The presence of carbon monoxide suppresses the H/D exchange between the bridged SiOHAl groups of Zn/H-MFI and the methyl groups of propane-d 8. This suggests that the interaction of CO with either isopropyl cation or Zn-sites could prevent the exchange through the proposed mechanisms.

Kinetic studies of the hydrogen exchange process allowed estimating the rate constants and the activation energy of the reaction, which were found to be different from those reported for other catalysts, indicating a distinct mechanism for the H/D exchange on Zn/H-MFI.

在Zn/H-MFI沸石上，丙烷-d 8与酸性羟基之间的氢交换的区域选择性由两种机制解释。第一种机制涉及在Zn位点上的丙烷脱氢，随后丙烯通过酸性OH基团按照马可尼科夫规则进行质子化，并从另一个丙烷分子中抽象出氘离子。第二种机制提出了一种可逆的异裂吸附过程，丙烷吸附到ZnO簇或Zn2+离子上形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性基团。

该反应的激活能被估算为80 kJ/mol。这个值与对于H-MFI和硫化锆的研究报告中的值有很大不同，这表明Zn/H-MFI催化剂上的H/D交换机制可能不同。

一氧化碳的存在抑制了Zn/H-MFI与丙烷-d 8甲基基团之间的氢交换。这表明CO与异丙基离子或Zn位点的相互作用可能会阻止通过所提出的机制进行交换。

通过动力学研究氢交换过程，可以估算出反应的速率常数和活化能，这些值与其它催化剂报告的不同，表明Zn/H-MFI上H/D交换的机制不同。

The regioselective hydrogen exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite is influenced by the zeolite's structure, specifically the presence of zinc cations acting as strong Lewis sites. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane followed by protonation of propene according to the Markovnikov's rule, leading to the selective abstraction of deuterium from another propane molecule. Alternatively, the exchange can occur through a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane onto zinc oxide clusters or zinc cations, forming Zn-propyl species and acidic sites. The activation energy for this process is estimated to be 80 kJ/mol, differing significantly from other catalysts like H-MFI and sulfated zirconia.

<p>The activation energy for the direct H/D exchange between the methyl groups of propane and SiOHAl of H-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 35) via a pentavalent carbonium ion-type transition state was found to be 107 kJ mol1 and the rate constant was one order of magnitude lower within the same temperature range [12, 13]. For regioselective H/D exchange between deuterated propane and sulfated zirconia, the activation energy was reported to be 54 kJ mol1 [20].

The document discusses the regioselective hydrogen exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain this phenomenon: propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene and abstraction of deuterium by isopropyl carbenium ion, or a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations forming Zn-propyl species and acidic sites. The activation energy for this process is significantly different compared to other catalysts, indicating unique kinetic parameters.

The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites lies in their ability to efficiently facilitate alkane transformations through mechanisms like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial importance include high activity, selectivity, stability, and cost-effectiveness. The document does not provide specific details about the composition, structure, and reaction conditions affecting these catalysts, but suggests that the nature of the metal, its incorporation into the catalyst matrix, and the zeolite structure play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance. The differences in kinetic parameters observed across various catalysts indicate the complexity of these systems and the need for tailored design strategies to optimize their performance for specific applications.
