<p>Analysis of kinetics of the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of zeolite Zn/H-MFI and deuterated propane-d 8 by 1H MAS NMR in situ in the temperature range of 420490 K pointed to the regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of propane.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms are suggested to account for this result. The first one involves propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by the protonation of propene with acidic OH groups in accordance to the Markovnikovs rule and abstraction of deuterium from the next propane molecule by isopropyl carbenium ion. The alternative mechanism involves a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations to offer Zn-propyl species and acidic sites.</p>
<p>Measurements of the intensity of the NMR signal of the methyl groups versus the reaction time allowed us to estimate the rate constants for regioselective H/D exchange in the temperature range of 420490 K (figure 3).</p>
<p>Basing on kinetic data of figure 3, the activation energy for this reaction was estimated. Apparent activation energy of 80 kJ mol1 was derived from the Arrhenius plot presented in figure 4.</p>

The study investigates the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of the Zn/H-MFI zeolite and deuterated propane-d 8. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the regioselective hydrogen exchange in the methyl groups of propane. One mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites, followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups according to the Markovnikovs rule, with deuterium abstraction by isopropyl carbenium ion from the next propane molecule. The alternative mechanism includes a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane onto ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, resulting in the formation of Zn-propyl species and acidic sites. The rate constants and activation energy for this regioselective hydrogen exchange were determined through kinetic measurements and an Arrhenius plot.

该研究探讨了Zn/H-MFI沸石与去氘化丙烷-d 8之间的氢交换。提出了两种机制来解释丙烷甲基中选择性的氢交换。一种机制涉及在Zn位点上进行丙烷脱氢，随后通过酸性OH基团对丙烯的质子化遵循马洛尼科夫规则，并由另一个丙烷分子的异丙基碳正离子从下一个丙烷分子抽象脱氘。另一种机制包括丙烷在ZnO簇或Zn2+离子上的可逆离解吸附，形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性位点。通过动力学测量和Arrhenius图确定了这种选择性氢交换的速率常数和活化能。
