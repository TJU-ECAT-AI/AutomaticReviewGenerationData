<p>Analysis of kinetics of the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of zeolite Zn/H-MFI and deuterated propane-d 8 by 1H MAS NMR in situ in the temperature range of 420490 K pointed to the regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of propane. Two mechanisms are suggested to account for this result. The first one involves propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by the protonation of propene with acidic OH groups in accordance to the Markovnikovs rule and abstraction of deuterium from the next propane molecule by isopropyl carbenium ion. The alternative mechanism involves a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations to offer Zn-propyl species and acidic sites.</p>
<p>The activation energy for the direct H/D exchange between the methyl groups of propane and SiOHAl of H-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 35) via a pentavalent carbonium ion-type transition state was found to be 107 kJ mol1 and the rate constant was one order of magnitude lower within the same temperature range [12, 13]. For regioselective H/D exchange between deuterated propane and sulfated zirconia, the activation energy was reported to be 54 kJ mol1 [20]. The comparison with the literature data shows that kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d 8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI [12, 13] and sulfated zirconia [20].</p>

The document discusses the regioselective hydrogen exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain this phenomenon: propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene and abstraction of deuterium by isopropyl carbenium ion, or a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations forming Zn-propyl species and acidic sites. The activation energy for this process is significantly different compared to other catalysts, indicating unique kinetic parameters.

The industrial significance of metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites lies in their ability to efficiently facilitate alkane transformations through mechanisms like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial importance include high activity, selectivity, stability, and cost-effectiveness. The document does not provide specific details about the composition, structure, and reaction conditions affecting these catalysts, but suggests that the nature of the metal, its incorporation into the catalyst matrix, and the zeolite structure play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's performance. The differences in kinetic parameters observed across various catalysts indicate the complexity of these systems and the need for tailored design strategies to optimize their performance for specific applications.

文档讨论了Zn/H-MFI沸石上丙烷的区域选择性氢交换。提出了两种机制来解释这一现象：丙烷在Zn位点上的脱氢，随后是丙烯的质子化和由异丙基碳正离子抽象脱氘，或者在ZnO簇或Zn2+离子上进行可逆的离解吸附，形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性位点。此过程的活化能与其它催化剂存在显著差异，表明其具有独特的动力学参数。

金属基催化剂如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的工业重要性在于它们能够高效地通过氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应促进烷烃转化。影响这些催化剂的因素包括高活性、选择性、稳定性和成本效益。文档并未提供关于催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的具体细节，但指出金属的性质、其在催化剂基质中的引入以及沸石结构对催化剂性能起着关键作用。不同催化剂的动力学参数之间的差异表明了这些系统的复杂性，并强调了针对特定应用优化其性能所需的设计策略的重要性。
