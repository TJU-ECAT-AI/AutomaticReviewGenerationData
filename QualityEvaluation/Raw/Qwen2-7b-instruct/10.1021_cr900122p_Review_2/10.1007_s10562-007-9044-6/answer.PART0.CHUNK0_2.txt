<p>The hydrogen exchange for propane-d 8 adsorbed on zeolite Zn/H-MFI has been studied by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy in situ within the temperature range of 420-490 K.</p>
<p>Kinetic measurements of the H/D exchange between the acidic hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the adsorbed deuterated propane molecules show that only methyl groups of the alkane are involved in the exchange.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms are proposed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the exchange: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance to the Markovnikovs rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups.</p>
<p>For regioselective H/D exchange for propane on Zn/H-MFI, the activation energy was estimated to be 80 kJ mol−1, with the rate constant being one order of magnitude lower within the same temperature range compared to other catalysts.</p>
<p>The comparison with the literature data shows that kinetic parameters for the H/D exchange in propane-d 8 on Zn/H-MFI are different from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia.</p>

The regioselective hydrogen exchange of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite is influenced by the zeolite's structure, specifically the presence of zinc cations acting as strong Lewis sites. These sites facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane followed by protonation of propene according to the Markovnikov's rule, leading to the selective abstraction of deuterium from another propane molecule. Alternatively, the exchange can occur through a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane onto zinc oxide clusters or zinc cations, forming Zn-propyl species and acidic sites. The activation energy for this process is estimated to be 80 kJ/mol, differing significantly from other catalysts like H-MFI and sulfated zirconia.

Zn/H-MFI沸石上丙烷的区域选择性氢交换受沸石结构的影响，特别是嵌入锌离子作为强路易斯位点。这些位点促进丙烷的脱氢，随后根据马可尼科夫规则由酸性羟基团质子化丙烯，导致从另一个丙烷分子中选择性地移除氘。另一种交换方式可以通过锌氧化物簇或锌离子的可逆异裂吸附丙烷形成形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性位点来实现。此过程的活化能估计为80 kJ/mol，与H-MFI和其他催化剂如硫化锆不同。
