<p>Hydrogen exchange for propane-d 8 adsorbed on zeolite Zn/H-MFI has been studied by1H MAS NMR spectroscopy in situ within the temperature range of 420490 K. Kinetic measurements of the H/D exchange between the acidic hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the adsorbed deuterated propane molecules show that only methyl groups of the alkane are involved in the exchange.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms are proposed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the exchange: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance to the Markovnikovs rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups.</p>
<p>Analysis of kinetics of the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of zeolite Zn/H-MFI and deuterated propane-d 8 by 1H MAS NMR in situ in the temperature range of 420490 K pointed to the regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of propane. Two mechanisms are suggested to account for this result.</p>

The regioselective hydrogen exchange in methyl groups of propane on Zn/H-MFI zeolite is explained by two mechanisms. One involves propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups, and abstraction of deuterium from another propane molecule. The other mechanism suggests a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups.

在Zn/H-MFI沸石上，丙烷分子中仅甲基参与了选择性氢交换。这一结果可以用两种机制来解释。一种是通过Zn位点上的脱氢反应，随后丙烯由酸性OH基团质子化，并从另一个丙烷分子中抽象出氘离子。另一种机制涉及丙烷的可逆离解吸附形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性OH基团。
