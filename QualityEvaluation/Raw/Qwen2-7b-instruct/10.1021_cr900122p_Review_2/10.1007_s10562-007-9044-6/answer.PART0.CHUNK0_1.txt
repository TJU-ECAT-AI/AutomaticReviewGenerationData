<p>The hydrogen exchange for propane-d 8 adsorbed on zeolite Zn/H-MFI has been studied by1H MAS NMR spectroscopy in situ within the temperature range of 420490 K. Kinetic measurements of the H/D exchange between the acidic hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the adsorbed deuterated propane molecules show that only methyl groups of the alkane are involved in the exchange.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms are proposed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the exchange: (i) propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by protonation of propene by acidic OH groups in accordance to the Markovnikovs rule and abstraction of deuteride ion from another propane molecule; (ii) the reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane to form Zn-propyl species and acidic OH groups.</p>
<p>Analysis of kinetics of the hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of zeolite Zn/H-MFI and deuterated propane-d 8 by 1H MAS NMR in situ in the temperature range of 420490 K pointed to the regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of propane. Two mechanisms are suggested to account for this result.</p>
<p>The first one involves propane dehydrogenation on Zn-sites followed by the protonation of propene with acidic OH groups in accordance to the Markovnikovs rule and abstraction of deuterium from the next propane molecule by isopropyl carbenium ion. The alternative mechanism involves a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations to offer Zn-propyl species and acidic sites.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide has been demonstrated to exhibit no notable effect on the rate of non-regioselective H/D exchange for propane on H-MFI, which proceeds in a concerted step with involvement of pentacoordinated carbon atom in a transition state.</p>
<p>Measurements of the intensity of the NMR signal of the methyl groups versus the reaction time allowed us to estimate the rate constants for regioselective H/D exchange in the temperature range of 420490 K (figure 3).</p>
<p>Basing on kinetic data of figure 3, the activation energy for this reaction was estimated. Apparent activation energy of 80 kJ mol1 was derived from the Arrhenius plot presented in figure 4.</p>

The regioselectivity of the hydrogen exchange between propane-d 8 and the acidic hydroxyl groups of Zn/H-MFI zeolite is explained by two mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the dehydrogenation of propane on Zn-sites, followed by the protonation of propene by acidic OH groups according to Markovnikov's rule, and the abstraction of deuterium from another propane molecule by isopropyl carbenium ion. The second mechanism proposes a reversible heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane onto ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations to form Zn-propyl species and acidic sites.

The activation energy for the regioselective H/D exchange in the methyl groups of propane-d 8 on Zn/H-MFI was estimated to be 80 kJ/mol. This value differs significantly from those reported for H-MFI and sulfated zirconia, suggesting that the mechanism of H/D exchange on Zn/H-MFI might be different.

The presence of carbon monoxide suppresses the H/D exchange between the bridged SiOHAl groups of Zn/H-MFI and the methyl groups of propane-d 8. This suggests that the interaction of CO with either isopropyl cation or Zn-sites could prevent the exchange through the proposed mechanisms.

Kinetic studies of the hydrogen exchange process allowed estimating the rate constants and the activation energy of the reaction, which were found to be different from those reported for other catalysts, indicating a distinct mechanism for the H/D exchange on Zn/H-MFI.

在Zn/H-MFI沸石上，丙烷-d 8与酸性羟基之间的氢交换的区域选择性由两种机制解释。第一种机制涉及在Zn位点上的丙烷脱氢，随后丙烯通过酸性OH基团按照马可尼科夫规则进行质子化，并从另一个丙烷分子中抽象出氘离子。第二种机制提出了一种可逆的异裂吸附过程，丙烷吸附到ZnO簇或Zn2+离子上形成Zn-丙基物种和酸性基团。

该反应的激活能被估算为80 kJ/mol。这个值与对于H-MFI和硫化锆的研究报告中的值有很大不同，这表明Zn/H-MFI催化剂上的H/D交换机制可能不同。

一氧化碳的存在抑制了Zn/H-MFI与丙烷-d 8甲基基团之间的氢交换。这表明CO与异丙基离子或Zn位点的相互作用可能会阻止通过所提出的机制进行交换。

通过动力学研究氢交换过程，可以估算出反应的速率常数和活化能，这些值与其它催化剂报告的不同，表明Zn/H-MFI上H/D交换的机制不同。
