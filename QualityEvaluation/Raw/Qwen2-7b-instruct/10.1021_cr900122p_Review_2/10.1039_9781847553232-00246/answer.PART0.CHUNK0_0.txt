[1] "In selective oxidation of paraffins, the following three main questions are addressed: How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"
[2] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."
[3] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, Nontoxicity."
[4] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects': Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), Type of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and System for the purification of maleic anhydride."
[5] "The aim of this review is to confirm, modify, complete, or reject the main conclusions reported in a previous review based on the results reported in the scientific literature of the last few years."
[6] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystalline vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours."
[7] "A fresh catalyst has been designated2 as a "nonequilibrated" one, while a catalyst after prolonged time-on-stream has been designated as an "equilibrated" one."

1. The main challenges in selective oxidation of paraffins include stopping the oxidation at intermediate products without significantly reducing the contact time, as intermediates tend to be more reactive than the paraffin.
2. The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the sole industrially applied process for selective oxidation of paraffins.
3. Since 1974, n-butane has gained popularity over benzene for maleic anhydride production due to its lower price and non-toxic nature.
4. Various processes have been developed for n-butane oxidation, differing in reactor type (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and purification system.
5. This review aims to validate, adjust, or update previous conclusions on selective oxidation of paraffins based on recent scientific literature.
6. Activating catalysts in air results in a transformation from an amorphous phase to a nearly fully crystalline vanadylpyrophosphate within the reactor, taking more than 100 hours.
7. A fresh catalyst is termed "nonequilibrated", while a catalyst after extended operation is labeled "equilibrated".

1. 在选择性氧化烷烃中，主要挑战是如何在中间产物氧化停止的同时避免整个过程完全氧化，而接触时间不会显著减少，因为中间产物比烷烃更活泼。
2. 将丁烷氧化为马来酸酐是唯一工业应用的选择性烷烃氧化过程。
3. 自1974年以来，由于其较低的价格和无毒性，丁烷逐渐取代苯作为马来酸酐生产的原料。
4. 已开发出多种丁烷氧化工艺，它们在反应器类型（固定床、流化床或移动床）、马来酸酐回收（干法或水法）以及净化系统方面存在差异。
5. 本次回顾旨在基于近年来的科学文献验证、调整或更新关于选择性烷烃氧化的主要结论。
6. 在空气中激活催化剂需要超过100小时，以从无定形相转变为反应器内几乎完全结晶的钒磷酸盐。
7. 新鲜催化剂被称为“非平衡化”，而经过长期运行的催化剂则标记为“平衡化”。
