[1] "The aim of this review is to report on current information available in the scientific literature about the selective oxidation of C, paraffins."
[2] "In selective oxidation of paraffins, the following three main questions are addressed: How is it possible to stop the oxidation at some intermediate products (avoiding its total oxidation) without operating at very low contact time, when the intermediates are more reactive than the paraffin?"
[3] "For the gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, the catalytic performance of different metal oxide-based catalysts has been compared, and the best operative conditions to achieve the highest yield to olefins have been analyzed."
[4] "For the liquid-phase hydroxylation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol, the performance of different classes of catalysts, the nature of the active sites, and their analogy to enzymes at a molecular level have been studied."
[5] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, Nontoxicity."
[6] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects: Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed), Type of recovery of maleic anhydride (anhydrous or aqueous), and System for the purification of maleic anhydride."
[7] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."
[8] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystalline vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours."
[9] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of V+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)."
[10] "It is now possible to modify the previous explanation that has been given on the role of defects in nonequilibrated catalysts prepared in an organic medium. It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation."
