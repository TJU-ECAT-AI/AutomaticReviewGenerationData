The review aims to provide insights into the selective oxidation of C4 paraffins, focusing on four reactions: the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes, oxidation of isobutane to methacrylic acid, and oxidation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol. Three main questions regarding selective oxidation are addressed: how to control oxidation to intermediate products without using very low contact time, considering the reactivity of intermediates compared to paraffins. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts' industrial significance is influenced by factors such as their ability to activate paraffins selectively, the presence of defects that enhance their activity, and the optimal phosphorus-to-vanadium (P/V) ratio that avoids catalyst oxidation.

本文旨在报告科学文献中关于C4烷烃选择性氧化的当前信息，重点关注四种反应：正丁烷氧化为马来酸酐、正丁烷氧化为丁烯的氧化脱氢、异丁烷氧化为甲基丙烯酸以及异丁烷氧化为叔丁醇。三个主要问题涉及选择性氧化：如何在不使用非常低接触时间的情况下控制氧化至中间产物，考虑到中间产物与烷烃的反应性。金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，在烷烃转化机制和效率方面起着关键作用，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。这些催化剂的工业意义受到诸如其激活烷烃的选择性、缺陷增强其活性的能力以及最优磷/钒（P/V）比例避免催化剂氧化等因素的影响。
