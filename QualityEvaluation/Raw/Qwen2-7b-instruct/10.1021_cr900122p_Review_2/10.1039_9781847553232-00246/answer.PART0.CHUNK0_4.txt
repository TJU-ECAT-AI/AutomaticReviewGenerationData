[1] "The aim of this review is to report on current information available in the scientific Four reactions are examined:and patent literature about the selective oxidation of C, paraffins."
[2] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."
[3] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons3: Lower price, Nontoxicity."
[4] "Several processes have been developed in recent years for n-butane oxidation which differ in regard to the following aspects': Type of reactor (fixed, fluidized, or moving bed),"
[5] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature?"
[6] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P- based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio;"
[7] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
[8] "There is large consensus274*6,10-15 that the necessary conditions to obtain an optimal catalyst are the following: Synthesis of microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent,characterized by a preferential exposure of the basal plane (001);"
[9] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include cost-effectiveness, environmental compatibility, and the ability to perform multiple reaction steps. The review confirms, modifies, completes, or rejects the main conclusions regarding the preparation and performance of these catalysts based on the latest scientific literature.
