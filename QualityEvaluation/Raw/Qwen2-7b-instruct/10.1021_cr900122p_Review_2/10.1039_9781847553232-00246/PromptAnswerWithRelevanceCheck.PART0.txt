The review aims to provide insights into the selective oxidation of C4 paraffins, focusing on four reactions: the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes, oxidation of isobutane to methacrylic acid, and oxidation of isobutane to t-butyl alcohol. Three main questions regarding selective oxidation are addressed: how to control oxidation to intermediate products without using very low contact time, considering the reactivity of intermediates compared to paraffins. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts' industrial significance is influenced by factors such as their ability to activate paraffins selectively, the presence of defects that enhance their activity, and the optimal phosphorus-to-vanadium (P/V) ratio that avoids catalyst oxidation.

[7] "The catalyst and the reaction have been thoroughly investigated in the scientific literature?"
[8] "Knowledge of the type of active sites and the features of the activation mechanism that allow high selectivity to be obtained can be useful in improving selectivity and activity in the oxidation of other paraffins."
[9] "The many different factors involved in the chemistry of preparation of the active phase can account for the differences and the lack of reproducibility of the data reported in the literature for this catalytic system."
[10] "There is large consensus274*6,10-15 that the necessary conditions to obtain an optimal catalyst are the following: Synthesis of microcrystalline (V0)HPO4.O.5H20 prepared in organic solvent, characterized by a preferential exposure of the basal plane (001); Presence of defects in stacking of the platelets; and Slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount, an atomic P/V ratio in the range of 1.01 to 1.10 (the excess phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric amount remains strongly bound with the acid vanadylphosphate; in fact, it is not removed by washing the precipitate)."
[11] "Only when a considerable excess of phosphorus is used, (P/V>2), may another phase appear, VO(H2P04)2."
[12] "In summary, the effect of several parameters on the properties of (VO)HP04.0.5H20 is to vary the exposure of the (001) plane, create strain in the crystallite, and influence the extent of reduction of V5+."
[13] "In the preparation with benzyl alcohol as the reducing agent, many authors report the formation of platelets with stacking faults (deduced from the preferential broadening of the [Ool] reflection) attributed to the trapping of alcohol between the layers of the precursor and its release during actiation."
[14] "Different types of VOPO,, some of which can be reversibly reduced to (VO),P207,have been the 6 and aIr,2027 the y-25 and the 6*-19 VOPO."
[15] "Very likely these findings are less important for the most active and selective catalysts, where only one phase has been detected, but they can be important in the formation, and in the catalytic properties, of the vanadylpyrophosphate during the activation procedure."
[16] "In catalysts activated in air, the transformation from an amorphous phase to an almost completely crystal- line vanadylpyrophosphate inside the reactor (in the presence of the reactant's mixture) requires more than 100 hours."
[17] "In the same review: warning has been given against extrapolation of the initial activity of the catalyst to its behavior in industrial-like conditions."
[18] "A nonequilibrated catalyst is more active and has lower selectivity to maleic anhydride, especially at high conversion, owing to the easier oxidation of V+ to V5+ in the last part of the reactor (the reactant mixture becomes more oxidizing due to the considerable decrease in n-butane concentration, which is the limiting reactant)?"
[19] "However, they did not observe changes in the P/V ratio during the conditioning, but only a decrease of the P/V ratio in the bulk and a slight oxidation of vanadium, with an increase of the average oxidation degree from 4.000 to 4.004."
[20] "It has been proposed that defects increase the Lewis acidity of calcined catalysts, which is necessary for n-butane activation? Even though it is not yet possible to rule out that the defects are responsible for the higher activity of nonequilibrated catalysts, it seems that their main role may be in directing or facilitating the transformation of the surface of a fresh catalyst (and perhaps also of the bulk) during the conditioning step to a situation more favorable for the optimal catalytic behavior."
[21] "Optimal catalyst composition presents a slight excess of phosphorus with respect to the stoichiometric value of the precursor."
[22] "In catalysts with a slight defect of phosphorus (P/V=0.95), a considerable increase of the ease of oxidation (with respect to the catalyst with P/V=l.O) occurs, and the reducibility remains high."
[23] "For P/V ratios higher than 1, both the reoxidizability and the reducibility of the catalyst decrease considerably."
