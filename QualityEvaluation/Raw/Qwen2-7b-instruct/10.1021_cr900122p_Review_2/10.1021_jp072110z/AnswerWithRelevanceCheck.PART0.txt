          <p>The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach.</p>
          <p>Initial activation of ethane occurs either via heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or via oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom resulting in formation of an adsorbed ethanol molecule.</p>
          <p>Both these paths are kinetically and thermodynamically favored as compared to the initial CH activation over reduced gallium species.</p>
          <p>However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult.</p>
          <p>In addition, possible side reactions involving conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites were discussed.</p>
          <p>Although several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path, these sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

          The study investigates the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by the extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. These pathways are thermodynamically and kinetically favored over activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Possible side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles can occur over the gallyl ions, these sites do not account for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

          研究使用密度泛函理论簇建模方法，探讨了氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石中Gallyl离子（GaO+）作为活性位点对乙烷的催化脱氢。初始激活乙烷可以通过Gallyl离子上的烷基型机制的异裂，或者通过外层氧原子的氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子。这些途径相对于还原镓物种上的活性激活在热力学和动力学上更具优势。然而，Gallyl离子的再生非常困难。还讨论了涉及乙醇在GaO+位点的可能副反应。尽管在Gallyl离子上可以发生多个催化循环，但这些位点并不能解释氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石的合理稳定的催化活性。
