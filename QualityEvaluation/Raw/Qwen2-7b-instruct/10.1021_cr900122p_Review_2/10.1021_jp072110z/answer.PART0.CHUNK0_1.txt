The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these catalysts in promoting the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and subsequent aromatization of alkenes is well-established. For instance, high silica zeolites modified with gallium have proven to be effective catalysts for this purpose. In particular, the gallyl ions (GaO+) in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites serve as models for active sites, demonstrating kinetic and thermodynamic advantages over reduced gallium species. However, discrepancies exist between current theoretical predictions and experimental observations regarding the activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts. The evaluation of the stability of resulting stationary points provides insights into the dynamics of the reaction. Moreover, the decomposition of intermediates, such as the dihydroxylgallium ion, offers a pathway for the transformation of alkoxyl groups. Despite the potential for multiple catalytic cycles over isolated GaO+ species, the efficient dehydrogenation of light alkanes through these sites is limited, indicating that gallyl ions are not considered catalytically active for alkane dehydrogenation.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转换过程的机制和效率，如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。这些催化剂促进轻烷烃脱氢和随后生成的烯烃芳构化的能力已经被广泛证实。例如，高硅含量的沸石通过镓改性显示出良好的催化性能。在特定情况下，氧化Ga/ZSM-5中的镓离子（GaO+）作为活性位点的模型，显示出与还原镓物种相比，初始C-H键裂解的热力学和动力学优势。然而，理论预测与实验观察之间存在差异，这涉及到氧化Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的活性。通过分析反应过程中形成的稳定态点的性质，可以提供有关反应动态性的见解。此外，中间体的分解，例如二羟基镓离子，为烷氧基团的转换提供了途径。尽管可能存在多个催化循环过孤立的GaO+物种，但通过这些位点有效地进行轻烷烃脱氢的效率有限，表明镓离子不被视为轻烷烃脱氢的催化活性位点。
