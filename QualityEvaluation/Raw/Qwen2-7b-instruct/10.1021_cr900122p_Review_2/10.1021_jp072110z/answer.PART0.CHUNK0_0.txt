The study examines the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through either heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by an extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. Both these pathways are favored thermodynamically and kinetically over the activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles might occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving the conversion of additional ethane molecules, these sites do not sustain the stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

研究使用密度泛函理论簇建模方法，探讨了氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石中镓离子（GaO+）模型在脱氢乙烷过程中的催化作用。初始激活乙烷可以通过烷基型机制在GaO+离子上进行异裂，或者通过外层氧原子氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子。这两种途径在热力学和动力学上都优于在还原态镓物种上的活性。然而，GaO+离子的再生非常困难。还讨论了乙醇在GaO+位点的可能副反应。虽然通过反应通道利用稳定中间体途径可以预期发生多个催化循环，将额外的乙烷分子转化为GaO+离子，但这些位点无法维持氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石的稳定催化活性。
