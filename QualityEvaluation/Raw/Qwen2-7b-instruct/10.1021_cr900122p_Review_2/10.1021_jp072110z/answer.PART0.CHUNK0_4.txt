[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions (GaO+) as a model for the active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite was studied using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach."
[2] "The gallyl ions (GaO+) were shown to be highly active for the initial CH bond cleavage."
[3] "However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is very difficult."
[4] "Reduction of the gallyl ions upon the catalytic reaction is strongly preferred over the regeneration of the active sites."
[5] "Several catalytic cycles can be expected to occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving one-step conversion of additional ethane molecules over the stable intermediates of the primary dehydrogenation path."
[6] "These sites cannot be responsible for the reasonably stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, through the activity and stability of the active sites. In the context of the study on gallyl ions (GaO+) as active sites in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites, the initial activation of ethane over these sites involves the heterolytic dissociation of the CH bond, leading to the formation of stable intermediates. However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is challenging, and the reduction of the gallyl ions is more favorable than regenerating the active sites. This implies that while multiple catalytic cycles can occur, the gallyl ions themselves are not the primary active sites for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, contributing to the reasonable stability of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites' catalytic activity.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，通过活性中心的活性和稳定性影响烷烃转化机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。在关于GaO+作为氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石活性位点的研究中，乙烷的初始活化涉及到CH键的异裂，导致稳定中间体的形成。然而，GaO+离子的再生非常困难，其还原比重新生成活性位点更有利。这意味着虽然可以发生多个催化循环，但GaO+离子本身并不是轻烷基脱氢的主要活性位点，这有助于氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石催化剂活性的合理稳定性。
