The study examines the dehydrogenation of ethane over gallyl ions in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites using a density functional theory cluster modeling approach. The initial activation of ethane can occur through either heterolytic dissociation over the gallyl ion following an alkyl-type mechanism or oxidation by an extralattice oxygen atom forming an adsorbed ethanol molecule. Both these pathways are favored thermodynamically and kinetically over the activation over reduced gallium species. However, the regeneration of the gallyl ion is difficult. Side reactions involving the conversion of ethanol over GaO+ sites are also discussed. While several catalytic cycles might occur over the gallyl ions via a reaction channel involving the conversion of additional ethane molecules, these sites do not sustain the stable catalytic activity of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites.

研究使用密度泛函理论簇建模方法，探讨了氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石中镓离子（GaO+）模型在脱氢乙烷过程中的催化作用。初始激活乙烷可以通过烷基型机制在GaO+离子上进行异裂，或者通过外层氧原子氧化形成吸附的乙醇分子。这两种途径在热力学和动力学上都优于在还原态镓物种上的活性。然而，GaO+离子的再生非常困难。还讨论了乙醇在GaO+位点的可能副反应。虽然通过反应通道利用稳定中间体途径可以预期发生多个催化循环，将额外的乙烷分子转化为GaO+离子，但这些位点无法维持氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石的稳定催化活性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these catalysts in promoting the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and subsequent aromatization of alkenes is well-established. For instance, high silica zeolites modified with gallium have proven to be effective catalysts for this purpose. In particular, the gallyl ions (GaO+) in oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites serve as models for active sites, demonstrating kinetic and thermodynamic advantages over reduced gallium species. However, discrepancies exist between current theoretical predictions and experimental observations regarding the activity of oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts. The evaluation of the stability of resulting stationary points provides insights into the dynamics of the reaction. Moreover, the decomposition of intermediates, such as the dihydroxylgallium ion, offers a pathway for the transformation of alkoxyl groups. Despite the potential for multiple catalytic cycles over isolated GaO+ species, the efficient dehydrogenation of light alkanes through these sites is limited, indicating that gallyl ions are not considered catalytically active for alkane dehydrogenation.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转换过程的机制和效率，如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。这些催化剂促进轻烷烃脱氢和随后生成的烯烃芳构化的能力已经被广泛证实。例如，高硅含量的沸石通过镓改性显示出良好的催化性能。在特定情况下，氧化Ga/ZSM-5中的镓离子（GaO+）作为活性位点的模型，显示出与还原镓物种相比，初始C-H键裂解的热力学和动力学优势。然而，理论预测与实验观察之间存在差异，这涉及到氧化Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的活性。通过分析反应过程中形成的稳定态点的性质，可以提供有关反应动态性的见解。此外，中间体的分解，例如二羟基镓离子，为烷氧基团的转换提供了途径。尽管可能存在多个催化循环过孤立的GaO+物种，但通过这些位点有效地进行轻烷烃脱氢的效率有限，表明镓离子不被视为轻烷烃脱氢的催化活性位点。

[1] "Two different reaction paths were found for the initial CH activation. The first one is the heterolytic dissociation of ethane on the gallyl ion following the alkyl (Cδ-Hδ+) polarization mechanism."
[2] "Another possible reaction path for ethane dehydrogenation is initiated by partial oxidation of an ethane molecule by the extralattice oxygen atom. The resulting ethanol molecule then interacts with the adsorption site (Ga+), leading to formation of a product of carbenium mechanism [HGaOC2H5]+."
[3] "Although catalytic cycles of these primary dehydrogenation routes cannot be closed because of formation of very stable intermediates, several catalytic cycles may occur via a concerted dehydrogenation mechanism."
[4] "Involvement of these secondary reactions over the intermediates formed via the primary route leads to estimation of the overall activation energy for the catalytic ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ ions below 150 kJ mol-1."
[5] "However, despite this facile pathway gallyl ions reduce very rapidly via water desorption to produce univalent gallium ions."
[6] "From the results presented, one cannot expect formation of more than three ethylene molecules per GaO+ site before being reduced to Ga+."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways. The specific catalyst composition affects the type of active sites available for alkane reactions, which in turn influences the reaction pathways and products formed. For example, in the context of the document, gallyl ions (GaO+) in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites serve as active sites for ethane dehydrogenation. The structure of these catalysts determines the accessibility of alkane molecules to the active sites and the stability of the intermediates formed during the reactions. Reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, can alter the kinetic and thermodynamic favorability of different reaction pathways.

The efficiency of alkane transformations is also influenced by the stability of the intermediates and the ease of regeneration of the active sites. In the case of gallyl ions, the formation of stable intermediates via the primary dehydrogenation routes prevents the catalytic cycles from closing. However, secondary reactions, such as concerted dehydrogenation, allow for multiple catalytic cycles to occur before the active site is reduced. The overall activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ ions is estimated to be below 150 kJ mol-1, facilitated by these secondary reactions. Despite this, the gallyl ions reduce rapidly to produce univalent gallium ions, limiting the formation of ethylene molecules per active site to no more than three.

The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to efficiently transform alkane molecules into more valuable products, such as alkenes, through processes like oxidative dehydrogenation. The mechanisms and efficiencies of these transformations can be tailored by optimizing the catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions, leading to enhanced productivity and selectivity in industrial applications.

在金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的情况下，催化烷烃转化的机制和效率受到多种因素的影响。催化剂的组成影响可用活性位点的类型，进而影响反应途径和产物的形成。例如，在文档中提到的背景下，Ga/ZSM-5沸石中的Gallyl离子（GaO+）作为乙烷脱氢的活性位点。催化剂的结构决定了烷烃分子到达活性位点的可接近性以及中间体的稳定性。反应条件，如温度和压力，可以改变不同反应途径的热动力学和动力学优势。

烷烃转化的效率还受到中间体的稳定性和活性位点再生的简便性的影响。对于Gallyl离子而言，通过主脱氢路径形成的稳定中间体阻止了催化循环的闭合。然而，二级反应，如协同脱氢，允许在活性位点还原之前发生多个催化循环。乙烷脱氢过GaO+离子的整体活化能估计低于150 kJ mol-1，这得益于这些二级反应。尽管如此，Gallyl离子迅速还原为单价镓离子，限制了每个活性位点生成的乙烯分子数量不超过三个。

这些催化剂在工业上的重要性在于它们能够高效地将烷烃分子转化为更有价值的产品，如烯烃，通过过程如氧化脱氢。通过优化催化剂组成、结构和反应条件，可以调整这些转化的机制和效率，从而提高工业应用的产率和选择性。

However, the subsequent regeneration of the gallyl ion is challenging, and the reduction of the gallyl ions is more favorable than regenerating the active sites. This implies that while multiple catalytic cycles can occur, the gallyl ions themselves are not the primary active sites for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, contributing to the reasonable stability of the oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites' catalytic activity.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，通过活性中心的活性和稳定性影响烷烃转化机制和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。在关于GaO+作为氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石活性位点的研究中，乙烷的初始活化涉及到CH键的异裂，导致稳定中间体的形成。然而，GaO+离子的再生非常困难，其还原比重新生成活性位点更有利。这意味着虽然可以发生多个催化循环，但GaO+离子本身并不是轻烷基脱氢的主要活性位点，这有助于氧化Ga/ZSM-5沸石催化剂活性的合理稳定性。
