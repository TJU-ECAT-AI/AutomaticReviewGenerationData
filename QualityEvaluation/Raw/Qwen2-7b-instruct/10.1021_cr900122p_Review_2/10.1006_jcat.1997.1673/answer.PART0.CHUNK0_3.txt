Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and n-Butane on VOx/Al2O3 Catalysts

In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane.

Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading.

Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests.

The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were ob- served mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The vanadium loading affects the catalytic behavior, with increased activity observed as the loading increases. However, the selectivity to corresponding olefins peaks at a specific vanadium loading. Lower loading yields higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products compared to higher loading, especially when transforming n-butane versus ethane. The nature of acid sites changes with vanadium loading: predominantly Lewis acid sites are found on low-loading catalysts, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites are observed on high-loading catalysts. The presence of V4+ species on tested catalysts indicates that these species play a role in the catalytic process, with their concentration influenced by alkane conversion rates.

金属基催化剂，特别是支持的氧化钒，对烷烃转换的机制和效率有显著影响。钒负载量会影响催化行为，随着负载量增加，活性提高。然而，对应烯烃的选择性在特定的钒负载量下达到峰值。较低的负载量导致更高的选择性，用于氧脱氢化反应，尤其是将丁烷转化为乙烷相比。酸性位点的数量和性质随钒负载量变化：主要为Lewis酸性位点在低负载量催化剂上观察到，而在高负载量催化剂上则同时存在Lewis和Brnsted酸性位点。测试催化剂上的存在V4+物种表明这些物种在催化过程中起作用，其浓度受烷烃转化率的影响。
