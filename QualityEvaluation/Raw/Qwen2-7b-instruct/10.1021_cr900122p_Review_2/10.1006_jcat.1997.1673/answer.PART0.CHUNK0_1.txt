[1] "Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxides are well known for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, but their catalytic properties depend on the metal oxide support and on the vanadium content (15)."
[2] "On Al2O3-supported vanadia catalysts, olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons are selectively transformed into oxygenated products on catalysts with vanadium content higher than the theoretical monolayer; however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the best selectivities to the corresponding olefins are achieved only on catalysts with low vanadium loading (69)."
[3] "Furthermore, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depends on the alkane fed and decreases in the order ethane > propane > n-butane (911)."
[4] "This paper reports the influence of the vanadium loading of alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, under submonolayer coverages, on their catalytic properties for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane using low alkane/oxygen ratios."
[5] "The catalyst characterization was performed with the aim of elucidating the nature of the active and the selective sites for the oxydehydrogenation reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation. The selectivity of these catalysts towards producing corresponding olefins increases with vanadium loading, reaching a peak around 34 wt% V atoms. However, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the highest selectivities for the corresponding olefins are observed on catalysts with low vanadium loading. The selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products varies depending on the alkane fed, with ethane showing the highest selectivity followed by propane and then n-butane. Catalyst characterization aimed to identify the active and selective sites for oxydehydrogenation reactions.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持型氧化钒，对烷烃转换过程（如氧化脱氢）的机制和效率有着显著的影响。随着钒含量的增加，这些催化剂对生成相应烯烃的选择性也随之提高，达到约34 wt% V原子的峰值。然而，对于烷烃的氧化脱氢，使用低钒含量的催化剂可以获得对应烯烃的最高选择性。根据所使用的烷烃不同，脱氢产物的选择性也有所不同，其中乙烷的选择性最高，随后是丙烷，然后是丁烷。催化剂的表征旨在确定脱氢反应的活性和选择性位点。
