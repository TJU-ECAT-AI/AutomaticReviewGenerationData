[1] "Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxides are well known for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons, but their catalytic properties depend on the metal oxide support and on the vanadium content (15)."
[2] "On Al2O3-supported vanadia catalysts, olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons are selectively transformed into oxygenated products on catalysts with vanadium content higher than the theoretical monolayer; however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the best selectivities to the corresponding olefins are achieved only on catalysts with low vanadium loading (69)."
[3] "Furthermore, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products depends on the alkane fed and decreases in the order ethane > propane > n-butane (911)."
[4] "Vanadia catalysts supported on Al2O3 have been characterized by a variety of physicochemical methods."
[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."
[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation. The selectivity towards specific products varies depending on the vanadium content within the catalyst, with higher selectivity to corresponding olefins achieved at lower vanadium loadings. The type of acid sites on the catalyst surfaces, which can be Lewis or both Lewis and Brnsted, also changes with the vanadium loading. Additionally, the presence of both V4+ and V5+ species on the catalysts affects their activity and selectivity. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts in processes requiring efficient alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂，尤其是支持的二氧化钒，对烷烃转化机制和效率的影响显著。催化剂中钒含量的不同显著影响选择性，特别是对于相应的烯烃的选择性，在较低的钒负载下可以实现更高的选择性。催化剂表面的酸位类型，既可以是Lewis酸位也可以是Lewis和Brnsted酸位，也随钒负载变化。此外，催化剂上存在的V4+和V5+物种的存在及其浓度影响其活性和选择性。这些因素共同决定了这些催化剂在需要高效烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。
