JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS 169, 203211 (1997)

The vana- dium loading strongly influences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3- supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane. While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, theselectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms.

In addition, the selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products during the ODH of butane was lower than the selectivity to ethene during the ODH of ethane.

Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading.

Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed.

The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading.

Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, significantly impact the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation. The vanadium loading plays a crucial role in influencing both the catalytic activity and selectivity towards olefin production. For instance, the selectivity to corresponding olefins peaks at a specific vanadium content. Moreover, the selectivity for oxydehydrogenation products varies depending on the alkane being processed, showing distinct differences in selectivity between ethane and butane. The structure of the catalyst, characterized by the presence of VO4 tetrahedra at lower vanadium loadings and VO6 octahedra at higher loadings, also affects the catalyst's performance. Notably, catalysts featuring predominantly tetrahedral V5+ species exhibit higher selectivity for oxydehydrogenation reactions compared to those with octahedral species. Furthermore, the nature of the acid sites on the catalyst changes with the vanadium loading, with Lewis acid sites predominating at lower loadings and the coexistence of Lewis and Brnsted acid sites at higher loadings. The presence of both V4+ and V5+ species on the catalyst indicates their dynamic role in the catalytic process, with their concentrations influenced by the alkane conversion rates during the tests.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的五氧化二钒，对烷烃转化过程的机制和效率产生显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢化等过程中。钒含量在很大程度上影响催化活性和向烯烃的择优性。例如，在特定钒含量下，对于对应的烯烃的择优性达到峰值。此外，不同烷烃处理时的择优性存在明显差异，以乙烷和丁烷为例。催化剂的结构特征，如在较低钒负载下出现VO4四面体，在较高负载下主要为VO6八面体，也会影响催化剂性能。值得注意的是，主要含有四面体V5+物种的催化剂表现出更高的氧脱氢化反应择优性，与具有八面体物种的催化剂相比。进一步，催化剂上的酸性位点的性质随钒负载变化，低负载下主要为Lewis酸性位点，而高负载下则同时存在Lewis和Brnsted酸性位点。催化剂中存在两种V4+和V5+物种，其浓度受到测试期间烷烃转化率的影响。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation. The selectivity of these catalysts towards producing corresponding olefins increases with vanadium loading, reaching a peak around 34 wt% V atoms. However, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, the highest selectivities for the corresponding olefins are observed on catalysts with low vanadium loading.

The vanadium loading affects the catalytic behavior, with increased activity observed as the loading increases. However, the selectivity to corresponding olefins peaks at a specific vanadium loading. Lower loading yields higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation products compared to higher loading, especially when transforming n-butane versus ethane. The nature of acid sites changes with vanadium loading: predominantly Lewis acid sites are found on low-loading catalysts, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites are observed on high-loading catalysts. The presence of V4+ species on tested catalysts indicates that these species play a role in the catalytic process, with their concentration influenced by alkane conversion rates.

1. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation. Higher vanadium loading enhances catalytic activity but may decrease selectivity to the corresponding olefins. The type of vanadium species (tetrahedral or octahedral) affects both activity and selectivity. Catalyst characterization methods like Raman spectroscopy, 51V NMR, and ESR provide insights into the nature of active and selective sites.

2. The efficiency of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, especially oxidative dehydrogenation, is influenced by the metal loading, the type of metal oxide support, and the reaction conditions. Supported vanadium oxides can selectively transform hydrocarbons into oxygenated products, depending on the metal content and the structure of vanadium species. Catalyst characterization techniques offer valuable information about the active sites involved in the reactions.

3. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition, play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of alkane transformations catalyzed by metal-based catalysts. Optimizing these conditions can enhance the selectivity and yield of desired products. For instance, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and n-butane is influenced by the vanadium loading, with higher loading increasing activity but potentially reducing selectivity to olefins.

4. Supported vanadium oxides, when used as catalysts for alkane transformations, exhibit distinct catalytic properties due to the interplay between the metal oxide support and the vanadium content.
