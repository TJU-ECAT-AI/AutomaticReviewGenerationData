[1] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[2] "The catalytic (C2H5dHd),cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane CH bond on the ZndOd pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."
[3] "Formation of ethene occurs due to the reaction [ZnC2H5] ] C2H4 ] [ZnH]."
[4] "The catalytic cycle found for ethane transformation to ethene and dihydrogen in the Zn-doped zeolites consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of the ethane CH bond and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the zeolite oxygen; (ii) rupture of the ethane CN bond and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the zeolite oxygen; (iii) formation of ethene from the ethyl group bound to Zn; (iv) formation of dihydrogen from the Brnsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as those involving zinc or gallium doping in zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of the ethane-to-ethene conversion using zinc-exchanged zeolites, the zinc ion acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group during the alkane activation process. This leads to the cleavage of the ethane CH bond, forming ethene from the alkyl group bound to zinc, and dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to zinc. These findings highlight the importance of metal doping in enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of zeolite catalysts for alkane aromatisation processes. The specific mechanism and efficiency of these transformations are influenced by the interaction of the alkane with the metal ion, leading to the formation of specific intermediates and products.

金属基催化剂，如锌或镓掺杂的沸石，对烷烃转换的机制和效率有显著影响。在使用锌交换沸石进行乙烷转化为乙烯的过程中，锌离子作为烷基团的接受者，在烷烃激活过程中起作用。这导致乙烷CH键的断裂，形成乙烯从连接到锌的烷基组分，以及氢气从与锌和氧结合的质子形成。这些发现突出了金属掺杂在提高烷烃芳香化过程催化剂的选择性和效率方面的关键作用。这些转化的具体机制和效率受烷烃与金属离子的相互作用的影响，导致特定中间体和产品的形成。
