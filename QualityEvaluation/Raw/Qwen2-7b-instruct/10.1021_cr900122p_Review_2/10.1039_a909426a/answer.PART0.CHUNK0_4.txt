[1] "A theoretical study of the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites was undertaken."
[2] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[3] "The computed activation energies for these three steps Brnsted are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively."
[4] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high (C2H5dHd),activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1)."
[5] "The catalytic cycle found for ethane transformation to ethene and dihydrogen in the Zn-doped zeolites consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of the ethane CH bond and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the zeolite oxygen; (ii) rupture of the ethane CN bond and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the zeolite oxygen; (iii) formation of ethene from the ethyl group bound to Zn; (iv) formation of dihydrogen from the Brnsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."
[6] "The activation energies of the three elementary steps involved in the alkyl route computed at the MP2/BS2/ B3LYP/BS1 level (the highest in this work) are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. In the case of Zn-doped zeolites, the results show that the reaction mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation starts with the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The activation energies for the three elementary steps involved in this mechanism are 18.4, 53.4, and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation is less favorable due to a higher activation barrier for the first step. The catalytic cycle for ethane transformation to ethene and dihydrogen in Zn-doped zeolites consists of three elementary steps, involving the rupture of the ethane CH bond, binding of the ethyl group to zinc and the proton to the zeolite oxygen, followed by the formation of ethene from the ethyl group bound to Zn and dihydrogen from the Brnsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. These findings highlight the importance of the specific conditions and interactions in metal-based catalysts for efficient alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石的组成、结构和反应条件，对烷烃转换过程（如氧化脱氢）的机制和效率有重要影响。对于Zn掺杂沸石而言，研究结果表明，乙烷脱氢反应机制从乙烷CH键的烷基断裂开始，锌离子作为烷基集团的接受体发挥作用。涉及的三个基本步骤的活化能分别为18.4、53.4和20.5 kcal mol1。从卡宾激活的替代机制由于第一步较高的活化能壁垒而不利。乙烷转化为乙烯和氢气在Zn掺杂沸石中的催化循环包括三个基本步骤：断裂乙烷CH键并使乙基团与锌结合，质子与沸石氧原子结合；然后形成乙烯通过结合到锌上的乙基团，以及氢分子通过结合到锌上的质子和氢原子释放出来。这些发现强调了特定条件和金属基催化剂之间相互作用的重要性，以实现高效的烷烃转换。
