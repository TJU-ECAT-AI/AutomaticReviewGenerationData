[1] "Quantum-chemical calculations on the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites have been undertaken."
[2] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[3] "The catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane CH bond on the Zn2 pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."
[4] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high activation barrier for the first step."
[5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol−1, respectively."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly in the context of Zn-doped zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene and the production of dihydrogen. The zinc cation acts as an acceptor for the alkyl group during the process, facilitating the rupture of the ethane CH bond and the subsequent formation of ethene and dihydrogen through three key steps. The quantum-chemical calculations demonstrate that the alkyl route, characterized by lower activation barriers, is more likely to occur compared to the carbenium route. This finding underscores the importance of the zinc cation's role in the catalytic process, enhancing the efficiency of alkane transformations in industrial applications.

[2] "The catalytic cycle found for ethane transformation to ethene and dihydrogen in the Zn-doped zeolites consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of the ethane CH bond and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the zeolite oxygen; (ii) rupture of the ethane CN bond and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the zeolite oxygen; (iii) formation of ethene from the ethyl group bound to Zn; (iv) formation of dihydrogen from the Brnsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."
[3] "The computed heats of the dehydrogenation reaction are within 30.832.1 kcal mol1 (Table C2H6 ] C2H4 ] H2 1). This is in good agreement with the experimental value of 30.9 kcal mol1 derived from the heats of formation at 0 K (C2H6 , C2H4 , H2 , nd reports on the experimental activation energy for the dehydrogenation of ethane in Zn zeolites."

The reaction mechanism for ethane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Zn-doped zeolites begins with the rupture of the ethane CH bond. The zinc cation acts as an acceptor for the alkyl group, facilitating the conversion to ethene and dihydrogen through a series of three steps. The first step involves the rupture of the ethane CH bond, with the ethyl group binding to zinc and the proton to a zeolite oxygen. The second step entails the rupture of the ethane CN bond, with the ethyl group binding to zinc and the proton to a zeolite oxygen again. Ethene is formed in the third step from the ethyl group bound to zinc, and dihydrogen is generated in the final step from the Brnsted proton and hydrogen bound to zinc. The computed heats of the dehydrogenation reaction closely match the experimental value, indicating good agreement.

反应机制从乙烷CH键的断裂开始。锌离子作为烷基团的接受者，通过三个步骤促进乙烷转化为乙烯和氢气。第一步涉及乙烷CH键的断裂，乙基团与锌结合，质子与沸石氧原子结合。第二步是乙烷CN键的断裂，乙基团与锌结合，质子再次与沸石氧原子结合。第三步中，从与锌结合的乙基团形成乙烯。最后一步是从与锌和氢结合的布恩斯德质子生成氢气。计算得到的脱氢反应热与实验值相匹配，表明良好的一致性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as those involving zinc or gallium doping in zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of the ethane-to-ethene conversion using zinc-exchanged zeolites, the zinc ion acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group during the alkane activation process. This leads to the cleavage of the ethane CH bond, forming ethene from the alkyl group bound to zinc, and dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to zinc. These findings highlight the importance of metal doping in enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of zeolite catalysts for alkane aromatisation processes. The specific mechanism and efficiency of these transformations are influenced by the interaction of the alkane with the metal ion, leading to the formation of specific intermediates and products.
