[1] "Quantum-chemical calculations on the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites have been undertaken."
[2] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."
[3] "The catalytic cycle for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane CH bond on the Zn2 pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."
[4] "The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium activation with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high activation barrier for the first step."
[5] "The computed activation energies for these three steps are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol−1, respectively."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly in the context of Zn-doped zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. These catalysts enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene and the production of dihydrogen. The zinc cation acts as an acceptor for the alkyl group during the process, facilitating the rupture of the ethane CH bond and the subsequent formation of ethene and dihydrogen through three key steps. The quantum-chemical calculations demonstrate that the alkyl route, characterized by lower activation barriers, is more likely to occur compared to the carbenium route. This finding underscores the importance of the zinc cation's role in the catalytic process, enhancing the efficiency of alkane transformations in industrial applications.
