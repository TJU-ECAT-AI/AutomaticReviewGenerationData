1. Early attempts to utilize zeolites in oxidation catalysis did not yield favorable outcomes due to the inability of transition metals within the zeolite matrix to effectively activate molecular dioxygen.

2. The effectiveness of zeolite catalysts in oxidation processes improved notably in the past decade, primarily due to the synthesis of high silica zeolites of the pentasil type and their metal silicate analogs, along with the utilization of chemically bound oxygen from various molecules as an oxidant.

3. Hydrogen peroxide and dinitrogen monoxide emerged as highly efficient oxidants in this context.

4. The most promising outcomes were achieved through the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol using Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and their ferrisilicate counterparts.

5. The distinctive performance of these catalytic systems is attributed to the specific surface oxygen form generated upon the decomposition of dinitrogen monoxide.

6. This environmentally friendly methodology possesses significant advantages, such as simplicity, high selectivity, and the ease of regenerating the utilized catalyst, potentially capturing the interest of phenol manufacturers.

7. Utilizing catalytic processes in the gas phase typically offers technological benefits over liquid phase processes, especially considering the thermal instability and difficulty in desorbing complex molecules from the catalyst surface.

1. 1960-70年代进行的早期尝试，利用沸石作为氧化催化剂，并没有取得令人满意的结果。原因是引入到沸石矩阵中的过渡金属失去了激活分子氧的能力。

2. 过去十年，沸石催化剂在氧化反应中的效果显著提升，主要得益于高硅含量的五硅酸盐类型沸石及其金属硅酸盐同系物的合成，以及从各种分子中获取化学结合氧作为氧化剂的应用。

3. 氢过氧化物和二氮化一氧化碳被证明是最有效的氧化剂。

4. 直接将苯氧化为对苯酚的最优结果是在含有铁的ZSM-5沸石和其铁硅酸盐类衍生物上实现的。

5. 这些催化系统的独特性能归因于分解二氮化一氧化碳时在表面生成的特定氧形式。

6. 由于其简单性、高选择性和催化剂的易于再生，这种环保方法可能吸引苯酚制造商的注意。

7. 在气相中使用催化过程通常比液相过程具有技术优势，尤其是在合成精细化学品和中间体时，考虑到这些复杂分子的热不稳定性以及从催化剂表面脱附的困难。
