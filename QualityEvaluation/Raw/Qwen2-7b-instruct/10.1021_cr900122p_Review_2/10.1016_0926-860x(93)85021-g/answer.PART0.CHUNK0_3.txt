[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."
[2] "Though the curves in Figs. 4 and 5 are rather similar, a lo-fold difference in their abscissa scales can be noticed."
[3] "The reaction rate over Fe-0.003 containing 0.003 wt.-% Fe203 (silicalite) is hardly detectable at 50°C, while in the case of samples containing 2 wt.-% FeZO, or more the conversion of benzene attains 25% at 350°C."
[4] "The oxidation of halogenobenzenes and toluene results in the formation of all three stereo isomers, whereas the oxidation of phenol yields only ortho- and para-isomers, i.e. catechol and hydroquinone (benzoquinone)."

1. The oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites showed excellent results with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion.
2. The graphs in Figs. 4 and 5 show a significant difference in their x-axis scales, despite having similar trends.
3. The reaction rate over Fe-0.003 zeolite (with 0.003 wt.-% Fe203) is barely noticeable at 50°C, whereas samples with 2 wt.-% or more Fe203 can convert benzene to 25% at 350°C.
4. The oxidation of halogen-substituted benzenes and toluene produces all three stereo isomers, whereas phenol oxidation yields only ortho- and para-isomers (catechol and hydroquinone).

1. 在Fe含有的ZSM-5沸石上进行苯氧化为苯酚的反应表现出优异的结果，几乎在25-30%苯转化率时选择性达到100%。
2. 图4和图5中的图表显示了它们在x轴尺度上的显著差异，尽管趋势相似。
3. 含有0.003 wt.-% Fe203的Fe-0.003沸石（Fe-0.003 zeolite）在50°C下的反应速率几乎不可检测，而含有2 wt.-%或更多Fe203的样品可以在350°C时将苯转化为25%。
4. 对卤代苯和甲苯的氧化产生所有三个立体异构体，而对苯的氧化仅产生间位和对位异构体（对羟基苯酚和氢醌）。
