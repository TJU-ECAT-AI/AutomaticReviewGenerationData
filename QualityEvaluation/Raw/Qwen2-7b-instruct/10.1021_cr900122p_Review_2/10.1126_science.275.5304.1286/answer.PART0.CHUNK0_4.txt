[1] "therefore subtncrorneter structures should be possble,especally when photocheml- cally enhanced processes are used instead of purely thertnal growth."
[2] "The latter was used here because t allows a h  g h growth rate (up to 100 pln/s)."

The document suggests that subnanometer structures could potentially be created, especially when photochemically enhanced processes are employed over purely thermal growth. In the specific case discussed, thermal growth was utilized due to its capability to achieve a high growth rate, reaching up to 100 pm/s.
