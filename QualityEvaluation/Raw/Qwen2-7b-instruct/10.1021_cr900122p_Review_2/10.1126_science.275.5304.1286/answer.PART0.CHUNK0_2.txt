[1] "therefore subtncrorneter structures should be possble,especially when photocheml- cally enhanced processes are used instead of purely thertnal growth."
[2] "The latter was used here because t allows a h  g h growth rate (up to 100 pln/s)."

Answer: The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Factors contributing to their industrial significance include the ability to achieve high growth rates, which is facilitated by photochemically enhanced processes, leading to the formation of submicron structures. These structures enable more efficient alkane transformations due to increased surface area and reactivity, enhancing the overall performance of the catalytic systems in industrial applications.
