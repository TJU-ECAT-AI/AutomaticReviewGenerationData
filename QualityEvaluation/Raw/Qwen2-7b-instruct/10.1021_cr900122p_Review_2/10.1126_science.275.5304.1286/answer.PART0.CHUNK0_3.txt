[1] "therefore subtncrorneter structures should be possble,especally when photocheml- cally enhanced processes are used instead of purely thertnal growth."
[2] "The latter was used here because t allows a h  g h growth rate (up to 100 pln/s)."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, photochemically enhanced processes, which allow for a high growth rate up to 100 pm/s, enable the formation of subnanometer structures. These conditions contribute to their industrial significance by enhancing the efficiency of alkane transformations through oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.
