[1] "therefore subtncrorneter structures should be possble,especally when photocheml- cally enhanced processes are used instead of purely thertnal growth."
[2] "The latter was used here because t allows a h  g h growth rate (up to 100 pln/s)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, especially when photochemically enhanced processes are utilized instead of thermal growth, enable the possibility of creating subnanometer structures. This is particularly advantageous due to the high growth rate achievable (up to 100 pm/s) with such methods.
