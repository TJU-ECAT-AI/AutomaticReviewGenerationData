The partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol with molecular oxygen was studied using ZSM-5 molecular sieves with iron and silicon tetrahedral frameworks as catalysts. The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging from 350 to 650 °C. Different Si/Fe molar ratios, specifically 45, 34, and 22, were utilized. The catalysts were available in both sodium and hydrogen forms. Among the catalysts tested, Fe-HZSM-5 with a Si/Fe ratio of 22 demonstrated the highest methane conversion rate, reaching 31.51%. Meanwhile, Fe-NaZSM-5 with the same Si/Fe ratio showed the highest selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol, achieving 74%. Increasing the temperature and contact time enhanced the conversion of methane to methanol, although it reduced the selectivity for methanol formation. The iron content in the catalyst influenced the reaction kinetics of the carried out processes.

在大气压和350至650°C的温度范围内，使用具有铁和硅四面体骨架的ZSM-5分子筛作为催化剂，研究了甲烷与分子氧的部分氧化以生成甲醛和甲醇。不同的Si/Fe摩尔比，即45、34和22，被使用。催化剂有钠和氢两种形式。在所测试的催化剂中，Si/Fe比为22的Fe-HZSM-5表现出最高的甲烷转化率，达到31.51%。同时，Si/Fe比相同的Fe-NaZSM-5表现出对甲烷氧化到甲醇的最高选择性，达到74%。提高温度和接触时间增加了甲烷转化为甲醇的效率，但降低了甲醇形成的选性。催化剂中的铁含量影响了进行过程的反应动力学。
