"Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol with molecular oxygen has been investigated. The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
"Methane conversion over Fe-HZSM-5 catalysts turned out to exceed the one over the Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts, displaying the same iron content."
"Increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."
"The highest values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol were attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
"Increasing the iron content in molecular sieves leads to the rise of the catalyst activity, and furthermore, to the increase of methane conversion."

The study focused on the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen. The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure between 350 to 650°C. Fe-ZSM-5 molecular sieves with varying iron to silicon molar ratios (45, 34, and 22) were utilized as catalysts. It was found that increasing the temperature and contact time enhanced the conversion of methane to methanol, albeit at the expense of selectivity. The highest selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol was achieved with a catalyst containing the least amount of iron. Higher iron content in the catalyst increased its activity and methane conversion.

研究重点是通过分子氧对甲烷进行部分氧化以生成甲醛和甲醇。实验在大气压下于350至650°C进行。使用了铁和硅四面体框架的Fe-ZSM-5分子筛作为催化剂，铁与硅的摩尔比分别为45、34和22。研究发现，提高温度和接触时间可以增加甲烷转化为甲醇的比例，但同时降低了选择性。在催化剂中含铁量最低的情况下，可以获得最高的甲烷氧化为甲醛的选择性。催化剂中铁含量的增加提高了其活性和甲烷转化率。
