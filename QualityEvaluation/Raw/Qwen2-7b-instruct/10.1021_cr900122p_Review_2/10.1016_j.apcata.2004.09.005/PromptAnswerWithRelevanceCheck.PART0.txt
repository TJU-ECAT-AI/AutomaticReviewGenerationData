The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study focused on the effects of iron content, temperature, and contact time on the catalysts' activity and selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol. The Si/Fe molar ratio of ZSM-5 molecular sieves varied among 45, 34, and 22. Higher methane conversion was observed with Fe-HZSM-5 catalysts, especially at a Si/Fe ratio of 22. The Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts showed higher selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol compared to the Fe-HZSM-5 counterparts. The research revealed that increasing temperature and contact time enhanced the conversion of methane to methanol but reduced the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. The iron content influenced the kinetic behavior of the reactions.

金属基催化剂，如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。研究主要关注铁含量、温度和接触时间对催化剂活性和甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性的影响。ZSM-5分子筛的Si/Fe摩尔比分别为45、34和22。在Si/Fe比为22的情况下，Fe-HZSM-5催化剂表现出更高的甲烷转化率。Fe-NaZSM-5催化剂对于甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性高于Fe-HZSM-5同类催化剂。研究表明，提高温度和接触时间可以增加甲烷到甲醇的转化率，但同时降低甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性。铁含量影响了反应的动力学行为。

"Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol with molecular oxygen has been investigated. The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."
"Methane conversion over Fe-HZSM-5 catalysts turned out to exceed the one over the Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts, displaying the same iron content."
"Increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."
"The highest values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol were attained while a catalyst with the lowest iron content was administered."
"Increasing the iron content in molecular sieves leads to the rise of the catalyst activity, and furthermore, to the increase of methane conversion."

The study focused on the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen. The experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure between 350 to 650°C. Fe-ZSM-5 molecular sieves with varying iron to silicon molar ratios (45, 34, and 22) were utilized as catalysts. It was found that increasing the temperature and contact time enhanced the conversion of methane to methanol, albeit at the expense of selectivity. The highest selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol was achieved with a catalyst containing the least amount of iron. Higher iron content in the catalyst increased its activity and methane conversion.

The study investigates the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen. The reaction is performed at atmospheric pressure between 350 to 650 degrees Celsius. ZSM-5 molecular sieves, featuring iron and silicon tetrahedral frameworks, serve as catalysts. Notably, the use of Fe-HZSM-5 with a specific Si/Fe molar ratio of 22 yields the highest methane conversion rate of 31.51%. Raising the temperature and extending the contact time enhances methane conversion to methanol but simultaneously reduces the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Despite extensive research, satisfactory outcomes have yet to be achieved with this process.

Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen over Fe-ZSM-5 Beata Michalkiewicz* Institute of Chemical and Environment Engineering, Technical University of Szczecin, ul. Pulaskiego 10, 70-322 Szczecin, Poland Received 5 February 2004; received in revised form 16 July 2004; accepted 6 September 2004 Abstract Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol with molecular oxygen has been investigated. The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form. Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45). It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol.
