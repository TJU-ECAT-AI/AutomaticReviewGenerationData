2.1. "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22."
2.2. "Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used."
2.3. "Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45)."
2.4. "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."
2.5. "The influence of the iron content on the kinetics of the carried out reactions was discussed."

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study focused on the effects of iron content, temperature, and contact time on the catalysts' activity and selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol. The Si/Fe molar ratio of ZSM-5 molecular sieves varied among 45, 34, and 22. Higher methane conversion was observed with Fe-HZSM-5 catalysts, especially at a Si/Fe ratio of 22. The Fe-NaZSM-5 catalysts showed higher selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol compared to the Fe-HZSM-5 counterparts. The research revealed that increasing temperature and contact time enhanced the conversion of methane to methanol but reduced the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. The iron content influenced the kinetic behavior of the reactions.

金属基催化剂，如支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机制和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中。研究主要关注铁含量、温度和接触时间对催化剂活性和甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性的影响。ZSM-5分子筛的Si/Fe摩尔比分别为45、34和22。在Si/Fe比为22的情况下，Fe-HZSM-5催化剂表现出更高的甲烷转化率。Fe-NaZSM-5催化剂对于甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性高于Fe-HZSM-5同类催化剂。研究表明，提高温度和接触时间可以增加甲烷到甲醇的转化率，但同时降低甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性。铁含量影响了反应的动力学行为。
