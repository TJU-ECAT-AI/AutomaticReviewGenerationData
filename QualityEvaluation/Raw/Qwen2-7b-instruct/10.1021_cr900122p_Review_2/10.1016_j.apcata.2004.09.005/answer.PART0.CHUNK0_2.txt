[4] "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."

The study investigates the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen. The reaction is performed at atmospheric pressure between 350 to 650 degrees Celsius. ZSM-5 molecular sieves, featuring iron and silicon tetrahedral frameworks, serve as catalysts. Notably, the use of Fe-HZSM-5 with a specific Si/Fe molar ratio of 22 yields the highest methane conversion rate of 31.51%. Raising the temperature and extending the contact time enhances methane conversion to methanol but simultaneously reduces the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. Despite extensive research, satisfactory outcomes have yet to be achieved with this process.

研究了在大气压下，使用分子氧对甲烷进行部分氧化以生成甲醛和甲醇的过程。反应温度范围为350至650摄氏度。使用含有铁和硅四面体框架的ZSM-5分子筛作为催化剂。值得注意的是，在Si/Fe摩尔比为22的Fe-HZSM-5中，可以获得最高的甲烷转化率31.51%。提高温度和延长接触时间可以增加甲烷转化为甲醇的比例，但同时降低了甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性。尽管进行了大量研究，但尚未获得满意的结果。
