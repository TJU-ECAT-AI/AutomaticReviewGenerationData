Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen over Fe-ZSM-5 Beata Michalkiewicz* Institute of Chemical and Environment Engineering, Technical University of Szczecin, ul. Pulaskiego 10, 70-322 Szczecin, Poland Received 5 February 2004; received in revised form 16 July 2004; accepted 6 September 2004 Abstract Partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol with molecular oxygen has been investigated. The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form. Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45). It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol. The influence of the iron content on the kinetics of the carried out reactions was discussed.

The study investigated the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol using molecular oxygen over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. The reaction was conducted at atmospheric pressure between 350-650°C. The catalysts were characterized by their iron and silicon tetrahedral framework, with different Si/Fe molar ratios. Fe-ZSM-5 was used in both sodium and hydrogen forms. The results showed higher methane conversion when using Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22). Meanwhile, Fe-NaZSM-5 demonstrated higher selectivity for the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45). The study found that increasing the temperature and contact time increased the conversion of methane to methanol while decreasing the selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol. The iron content influenced the reaction kinetics.

研究了在铁硅四面体框架的ZSM-5分子筛上甲烷部分氧化生成甲醛和甲醇的过程，氧气作为氧化剂。反应在大气压下于350-650°C进行。催化剂由不同硅/铁摩尔比的铁和硅组成。Fe-ZSM-5被用作钠型和氢型。结果表明，当使用Fe-HZSM-5（Si/Fe = 22时为31.51%）时，可以获得更高的甲烷转化率。同时，Fe-NaZSM-5显示出甲烷氧化到甲醇的更高选择性（Si/Fe = 45时为74%）。研究发现，提高温度和接触时间可以增加甲烷转化为甲醇的比例，同时降低甲烷氧化为甲醇的选择性。铁含量影响了反应的动力学。
