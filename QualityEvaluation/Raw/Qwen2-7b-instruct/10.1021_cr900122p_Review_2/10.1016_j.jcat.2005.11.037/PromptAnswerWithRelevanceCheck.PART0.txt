The initial stages of propane activation over zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts involve the formation of zinc propyl species and zinc hydroxide groups. Propane is activated through dissociative adsorption onto zinc oxide species, leading to propene production and hydrogen recombinative desorption. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while hydrogen can either evolve as a final product or participate in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane. At low pressure, hydrogenolysis is favored, but at high pressure, recombinative desorption becomes more dominant.

锌改性的H-MFI催化剂上，丙烷激活的初期阶段涉及到锌丙基物种和锌羟基组分的形成。丙烷通过锌氧化物物种的离散吸附激活，导致丙烯生成和氢重组脱附。丙烯随后在酸性位点上发生多聚化，而氢可以作为最终产物蒸发，或者参与丙烷氢解生成乙烷和甲烷。在低压力下，氢解是首选，但在高压下，重组脱附更占优势。

The early stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts were studied using in situ 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques. The results showed the formation of zinc propyl species and ZnOH groups at the onset of propane conversion. This finding demonstrates that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species. The overall reaction mechanism includes propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane. The mechanism proposed for propane activation over Zn/H-MFI catalysts differs from those proposed for Ga/H-MFI catalysts, explaining the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity toward aromatics.

对Zn改性H-MFI催化剂上丙烷激活的早期阶段进行了研究，使用了原位13C MAS NMR和IR光谱技术。结果表明，在丙烷转化的初期，形成了锌丙基物种和ZnOH组分。这一发现证明了Zn含有的沸石催化剂上丙烷转化的初始步骤是锌氧化物物种上的离解吸附。整体反应机制包括丙烷的离解，随后是丙烯的产生和氢原子的重组脱附。丙烯进一步在酸性位点上发生缩聚，而氢原子要么作为最终产物释放，要么参与丙烷的氢解生成乙烷和甲烷。在Zn/H-MFI催化剂上进行的丙烷激活机制与Ga/H-MFI催化剂上的机制不同，这解释了Zn/H-MFI催化剂相对于H-MFI的更高活性和对芳烃选择性的较低选择性。

The early stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts involve the formation of zinc propyl species and the simultaneous formation of ZnOH groups. Propane is activated through dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species, leading to propene production and the recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen can either evolve as a final product or participate in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane.

[1] "Understanding the interplay between the acidic and dehydrogenation catalytic functions in these catalysts is of key importance to further improving their selectivity, activity, and lifetime."
[2] "According to Ono et al. [1], the initial step in propane activation involves acidic sites only implying carbonium ion mechanism, while the metal sites are participating in olefin-to- aromatics conversion with no influence on the initial stages of * Corresponding author."
[3] "Guisnet et al. [2] proposed that metal-containing sites play the main role in the initial propane dehydrogenation leading to propene, which is further converted to higher hydrocarbons over acidic sites."
[4] "In contrast, Kazansky et al. proposed that the ini- tial step on Zn-containing catalysts proceeds through propane dissociative adsorption, resulting in formation of zinc alkyl and acidic hydroxyl fragments."

Understanding the interaction between acidic and dehydrogenation catalytic functions in these catalysts is crucial for enhancing their selectivity, activity, and lifespan. Ono et al. suggest that the initial step of propane activation involves acidic sites, leading to a carbonium ion mechanism, while metal sites do not affect the early stages of propane transformation. Guisnet et al. argue that metal-containing sites are the primary factor in the initial propane dehydrogenation, producing propene that is later converted to higher hydrocarbons over acidic sites. Contrarily, Kazansky et al. propose that on Zn-containing catalysts, propane activation occurs via dissociative adsorption, forming zinc alkyl and acidic hydroxyl fragments.

理解这些催化剂中酸性和脱氢催化功能之间的相互作用对于提高它们的选择性、活性和寿命至关重要。Ono等人认为，丙烷激活的初始步骤仅涉及酸性位点，导致碳离子机制，而金属位点对早期丙烷转换没有影响。Guisnet等人提出，在金属含有的位点起主要作用的初始丙烷脱氢过程产生丙烯，随后在酸性位点转化为更高碳数的烃类。相反，Kazansky等人认为，在Zn含有的催化剂上，通过丙烷的解离吸附进行丙烷激活，形成锌烷基和酸性羟基片段。
