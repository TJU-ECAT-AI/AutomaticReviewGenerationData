[1] "The early stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts were studied by in situ 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic tech- niques."
[2] "Both techniques pointed to the formation of zinc propyl species at the onset of propane conversion."
[3] "Moreover, formation of ZnOH groups simultaneously to zinc propyl species was evidenced by IR spectroscopic techniques."
[4] "The results point to the propane activation through dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen."
[5] "Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihy- drogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."
[6] "At low partial pressure of reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution are favoured, whereas at high pressures, the hydrogenolysis route is preferable."

The initial stages of propane activation over zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts involve the formation of zinc propyl species and zinc hydroxide groups. Propane is activated through dissociative adsorption onto zinc oxide species, leading to propene production and hydrogen recombinative desorption. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while hydrogen can either evolve as a final product or participate in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane. At low pressure, hydrogenolysis is favored, but at high pressure, recombinative desorption becomes more dominant.

锌改性的H-MFI催化剂上，丙烷激活的初期阶段涉及到锌丙基物种和锌羟基组分的形成。丙烷通过锌氧化物物种的离散吸附激活，导致丙烯生成和氢重组脱附。丙烯随后在酸性位点上发生多聚化，而氢可以作为最终产物蒸发，或者参与丙烷氢解生成乙烷和甲烷。在低压力下，氢解是首选，但在高压下，重组脱附更占优势。
