The early stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts involve the formation of zinc propyl species and the simultaneous formation of ZnOH groups. Propane is activated through dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species, leading to propene production and the recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen can either evolve as a final product or participate in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane.

锌改性H-MFI催化剂上丙烷激活的早期阶段涉及锌丙基物种的形成和ZnOH组的同步形成。丙烷通过锌氧化物物种的解离吸附激活，导致丙烯生成和氢分子的重组脱附。丙烯随后在酸性位点上进行缩聚，而氢分子可以作为最终产物蒸发，或者参与丙烷的氢解反应生成甲烷和乙烷。
