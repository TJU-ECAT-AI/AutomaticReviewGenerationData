[1] "The early stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts were studied by in situ 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic tech- niques."
[2] "The results point to the propane activation through dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen."
[3] "At low partial pressure of reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, the hydrogenolysis route is preferable."
[4] "Understanding the nature of the intermediate species formed at the onset of the reaction may provide the key to answering this question."

The early stages of propane activation over zinc-modified H-MFI catalysts involve dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species. This leads to propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. At low partial pressures, hydrogenolysis is favored, while at higher pressures, the hydrogen evolution route is preferred.

在锌改性H-MFI催化剂上，丙烷激活的早期阶段涉及锌氧化物物种的离解吸附。这导致丙烯的生成和氢分子的重新组合脱附。在低分压下，氢化反应更占优势，而在高压下，氢气的生成途径更优选。
