[1] "The early stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts were studied by in situ 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic tech- niques."
[2] "The results point to the propane activation through dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen."
[3] "Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while di- hydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."
[4] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch condi- tions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

The initial stages of propane activation over Zn-modified H-MFI catalysts involve propane dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide species, leading to propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen can either evolve as a final product or participate in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane. The choice between hydrogen evolution and hydrogenolysis depends on the partial pressure of the reactants; at low pressures, hydrogen evolution is favored, while at high pressures, hydrogenolysis is preferred.

在Zn改性H-MFI催化剂上，丙烷激活的早期阶段涉及丙烷在锌氧化物物种上的解离吸附，导致丙烯生成和氢分子的重组脱附。随后丙烯在酸性位点进一步缩合，而氢分子可以作为最终产物释放，或者参与丙烷的氢解反应生成甲烷和乙烷。反应物分压较低时，氢分子释放占主导；而较高分压下，即核磁共振批次条件时，氢解途径更优。

[1] "Understanding the interplay between the acidic and dehydrogenation catalytic functions in these catalysts is of key importance to further improving their selectivity, activity, and lifetime."
[2] "According to Ono et al. [1], the initial step in propane activation involves acidic sites only implying carbonium ion mechanism, while the metal sites are participating in olefin-to- aromatics conversion with no influence on the initial stages of * Corresponding author."
[3] "Guisnet et al. [2] proposed that metal-containing sites play the main role in the initial propane dehydrogenation leading to propene, which is further converted to higher hydrocarbons over acidic sites."
[4] "In contrast, Kazansky et al. proposed that the ini- tial step on Zn-containing catalysts proceeds through propane dissociative adsorption, resulting in formation of zinc alkyl and acidic hydroxyl fragments."

Understanding the interaction between acidic and dehydrogenation catalytic functions in these catalysts is crucial for enhancing their selectivity, activity, and lifespan. Ono et al. suggest that the initial step of propane activation involves acidic sites, leading to a carbonium ion mechanism, while metal sites do not affect the early stages of propane transformation. Guisnet et al. argue that metal-containing sites are the primary factor in the initial propane dehydrogenation, producing propene that is later converted to higher hydrocarbons over acidic sites. Contrarily, Kazansky et al. propose that on Zn-containing catalysts, propane activation occurs via dissociative adsorption, forming zinc alkyl and acidic hydroxyl fragments.

理解这些催化剂中酸性和脱氢催化功能之间的相互作用对于提高它们的选择性、活性和寿命至关重要。Ono等人认为，丙烷激活的初始步骤仅涉及酸性位点，导致碳离子机制，而金属位点对早期丙烷转换没有影响。Guisnet等人提出，在金属含有的位点起主要作用的初始丙烷脱氢过程产生丙烯，随后在酸性位点转化为更高碳数的烃类。相反，Kazansky等人认为，在Zn含有的催化剂上，通过丙烷的解离吸附进行丙烷激活，形成锌烷基和酸性羟基片段。
