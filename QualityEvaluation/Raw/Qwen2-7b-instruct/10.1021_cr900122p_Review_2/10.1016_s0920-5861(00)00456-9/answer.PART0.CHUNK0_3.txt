2.2. Synthesis of methanol: a route to dimethyl ether (DME), gasoline and ethylene A major advance in methanol synthesis occurred in 1966 when ICI introduced a lower pressure process that was based on a more active copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst. The mechanism for the reaction and the active phase of the catalyst have been reviewed by Chinchen et al. [7]. Surprisingly, methanol is actually formed from CO2 that is produced during the water gas shift reaction. Under normal operating conditions, CO2 is added to the feed gas. Although there appear to be limited opportunities for further development of the copper-based catalyst, other more robust and sulfur tolerant catalysts may utilize supported palladium as the active component. Palladium on several basic oxide supports, including La2O3 [8] and lithium-promoted palladium on SiO2 [9,10], is an active and selective catalyst for methanol synthesis that could find application in slurry reactors.

With respect to methane utilization, the major advance has been in the scale of methanol synthesis plants which are consistent with the production of fuels (see below).

Two other potential large scale chemical products from methane, via methanol, are ethylene and propylene. Methanol may be converted to these chemicals over a moderately acidic SAPO-34 molecular sieve, and a methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process has been developed by UOP [14]. Ethylene, which is the primary product, oligomerizes and cracks to propylene. The catalyst deactivates rapidly and regeneration is required. This is achieved in a fluidized bed-reactor which is similar to those employed in conventional catalytic cracking. Utilization of this technology probably will occur in integrated petrochemical complexes (e.g., in Saudi Arabia) rather than in remote locations.

从甲烷合成甲醇的过程涉及使用ICI在1966年引入的较低压力过程和更活跃的铜/锌氧化物/氧化铝催化剂。该催化剂通过水煤气转换反应产生的二氧化碳形成甲醇。在典型操作条件下，向进料气体中添加二氧化碳。虽然铜基催化剂的发展机会有限，但其他更坚固且抗硫的催化剂可以使用负载钯作为活性成分。La2O3和锂促进的钯/SiO2等基本氧化物支持上的钯催化剂是甲醇合成的活性和选择性催化剂，并且可以在悬浮床反应器中应用。 

另外两种通过甲醇从甲烷产生的大型化学产品是乙烯和丙烯。甲醇可以通过适度酸性的SAPO-34分子筛转化为这些化学品，UOP开发了一种甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程。乙烯是主要产物，然后裂解和聚合为丙烯。这个过程中的催化剂快速失效并需要再生，这通常在类似于常规催化裂化使用的流化床反应器中完成。这项技术的应用可能发生在沙特阿拉伯等国家的集成石油化工综合体中，而不是在偏远地区。
