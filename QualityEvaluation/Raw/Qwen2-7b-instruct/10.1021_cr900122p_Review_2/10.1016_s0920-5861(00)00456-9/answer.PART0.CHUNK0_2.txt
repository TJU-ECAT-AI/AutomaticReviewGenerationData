[1] "A major advance in methanol synthesis occurred in 1966 when ICI introduced a lower pressure process that was based on a more active copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst."
[2] "Surprisingly, methanol is actually formed from CO2 that is produced during the water gas shift reaction."
[3] "Under normal operating conditions, CO2 is added to the feed gas."
[4] "Although there appear to be limited opportunities for further development of the copper-based catalyst, other more robust and sulfur-tolerant catalysts may utilize supported palladium as the active component."
[5] "Large scale methanol synthesis plants have recently been constructed to meet the demand for methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), which is a fuel additive."
[6] "Nevertheless, the technical success demonstrates that methane can be converted to fuels and chemicals (aromatics) via methanol on a commercial scale."
[7] "The catalyst deactivates rapidly and regeneration is required."
[8] "Ethylene, which is the primary product, oligomerizes and cracks to propylene."
[9] "The catalyst deactivates rapidly and regeneration is required."
[10] "Oxidative coupling reaction, CH4 and O2 react over a catalyst at elevated temperatures to form C2H6 as a primary product and C2H4 as a secondary product."
[11] "Unfortunately, both the CH4 and the C2H4 may be converted to CO2, and the single-pass combined yield of C2H4 and C2H6 (C2 products) is limited to about 25%."
[12] "Over the better catalysts, which include SrO/La2O3 and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2, a C2 selectivity of about 80% can be achieved at a CH4 conversion of 20%."
[13] "About half of the C2 is C2H4 and half is C2H6, although the C2H4/C2H6 ratio can be enhanced by using a second catalyst."
[14] "In order to avoid the cost associated with the use of pure O2 in the feed gas, attempts were made by ARCO to use the catalyst for oxygen storage."
[15] "A NaMnO4/MgO catalyst was found to be suitable for this purpose in that separate pulses of air and methane resulted in favorable C2 selectivities."
[16] "By operating in a recycle mode with continuous removal of ethylene, a considerable improvement in the ethylene yield can be achieved."
[17] "Vayenas and co-workers [32] demonstrated this concept by using a closed-loop recycle system with continuous removal of C2+ olefins."
[18] "As a variation of this recycle system, the membrane contactor was replaced by a Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst that operated at 520C."
[19] "This zeolite catalyst effectively converted the C2H4 from the OCM reactor mainly to benzene and toluene, which were continuously removed by an in-line trap."
[20] "The aromatic product yield as a function of the O2 flow rate is given in Fig. 5."
[21] "Again, product (aromatic) yields in excess of 70% could be achieved."
[22] "To attain these yields, the conversion of the recycled C2H6 to C2H4 must be highly selective."
[23] "In this case, the productivity could be increased simply by increasing the amounts of the catalysts, the flow rates and the efficiencies of the traps, thus scale up would be easier with the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst than with the membrane contactor."
[24] "Several bifunctional catalysts are known to promote this reaction, with the most thoroughly studied being a Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite."
[25] "Representative results, reported by Wang et al. [40], are shown in Figs. 7 and 8."
