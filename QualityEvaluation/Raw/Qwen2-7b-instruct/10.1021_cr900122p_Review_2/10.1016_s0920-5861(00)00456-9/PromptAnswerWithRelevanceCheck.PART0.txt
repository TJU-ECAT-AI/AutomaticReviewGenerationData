[1] "Steam reforming, with the use of nearly pure O2, circumvents the coking problem, but requires the separation of oxygen from air and involves the hazards of handling large quantities of undiluted oxygen, as well as O2/CH4 mixtures."
[2] "Partial oxidation, with the use of nearly pure O2, is slightly exothermic, but requires oxygen or air."
[3] "Methane reforming reactions involve the production of CO and H2 in the appropriate ratios."
[4] "The process, however, requires elevated temperatures and high pressures of steam in order to favor H2 and CO at equilibrium."
[5] "Catalytic partial oxidation, with the use of nearly pure O2, circumvents the coking problem, but requires the separation of oxygen from air and involves the hazards of handling large quantities of undiluted oxygen, as well as O2/CH4 mixtures."
[6] "Heat management issues are common to both processes; with steam reforming, large quantities of heat must be supplied, whereas, with catalytic partial oxidation, a large amount of heat is released during the front end of the catalyst bed as the CH4 undergoes total oxidation."
[7] "The only commercial methanol-to-fuel process was carried out for a period of several years in New Zealand as a response to the energy crises in the early 1970s."
[8] "A single-train methanol plant with a capacity in the range of 5000–10,000 metric tons per day is possible."
[9] "As a consequence, there is a large oversupply of methanol from which alternative fuels could be produced."
[10] "One such conceivable process is the conversion of methanol to DME, which has been touted by Amoco as a fuel for the 21st century."
[11] "DME has several properties that make it attractive as a fuel for diesel engines, including no sulfur and very low particulate emission."
[12] "Nevertheless, the technical success demonstrates that methane can be converted to fuels and chemicals (aromatics) via methanol on a commercial scale."
[13] "The catalyst deactivates rapidly and regeneration is required."
[14] "Utilization of this technology probably will occur in integrated petrochemical complexes (e.g., in Saudi Arabia) rather than in remote locations."
[15] "Direct methods for the conversion of methane to the desired products circumvent the expensive syngas step; however, in two of the examples described here, oxygen separation from air is still required."
[16] "Perhaps, the greatest potential for a major advance in methane conversion technology is in the discovery of a direct route for the formation of the oxygenates methanol and formaldehyde."
[17] "The enzyme activates O2 at iron centers with the aid of a reductant known as NADH."
[18] "Using this example, Otsuka et al. have shown that FePO4 is an interesting model catalyst for the production of CH3OH and HCHO when H2 is added to the CH4 and O2 reagents."
[19] "At 220C, 90% of the methane reacted with H2SO4 in a catalytic manner to form methyl bisulfate at 81% selectivity."
[20] "In the single-pass mode, the HCHO yields do not exceed 34%; however, respectable spacetime-yields (STY) of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity have been achieved over a 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst at 600C."
[21] "At 690C with a recycle ratio of 64, a formaldehyde yield of 24.5% was attained."
[22] "These methoxide ions could either react with water to form methanol or they could decompose to form formaldehyde."
[23] "Clearly, these oxygenates could be produced in high yields by the activation of methane at low temperatures (<300C)."
[24] "In order to avoid the cost associated with the use of pure O2 in the feed gas, attempts were made by ARCO to use the catalyst for oxygen storage."
[25] "But the oxygen storage capacity was limited so that a very large mass of catalyst would have to be used to achieve a reasonable amount of C2 products."
[26] "By operating in a recycle mode with continuous removal of ethylene, a considerable improvement in the ethylene yield can be achieved."
[27] "Aromatic product yields in excess of 70% could be achieved."
[28] "To attain these yields, the conversion of the recycled C2H6 to C2H4 must be highly selective."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a critical role in the efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors influencing these processes include:

1. **Mechanism**: Catalysts enable specific chemical reactions by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy, facilitating the transformation of alkanes into various products like methanol, formaldehyde, ethylene, or aromatics.

2. **Temperature and Pressure**: For steam reforming and partial oxidation, high temperatures and pressures are crucial to achieve the desired conversion of alkane to synthesis gas (CO and H2). However, these conditions can lead to issues like coking, which is the deposition of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface, reducing its activity.

3. **Oxygen Supply**: In partial oxidation and direct methods, the supply of oxygen (either pure or from air) is essential. Handling large quantities of pure oxygen involves safety risks due to its flammability and potential for explosive mixtures with methane.

4. **Separation Technology**: Efficient separation of oxygen from air, hydrogen from dilute product streams, and the targeted products themselves (like methanol, formaldehyde, or aromatics) is critical for the economic viability of these processes.

5. **Catalyst Development**: Advances in catalyst development, especially in terms of increasing selectivity towards desired products and extending catalyst life, are vital for improving the efficiency and sustainability of alkane transformations.

6. **Process Engineering**: Alongside catalyst innovation, improvements in process engineering, including reactor design, control systems, and energy management, are necessary to optimize the entire conversion process.

7. **Industrial Significance**: The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to convert methane, a vast and underutilized resource, into valuable chemicals and fuels. Successful industrial applications demonstrate the potential for economic benefits, environmental impact mitigation, and resource efficiency.

These factors collectively contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, highlighting the need for ongoing research and development to enhance their performance and applicability in a wide range of industrial processes.

2.2. Synthesis of methanol: a route to dimethyl ether (DME), gasoline and ethylene A major advance in methanol synthesis occurred in 1966 when ICI introduced a lower pressure process that was based on a more active copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst. The mechanism for the reaction and the active phase of the catalyst have been reviewed by Chinchen et al. [7]. Surprisingly, methanol is actually formed from CO2 that is produced during the water gas shift reaction. Under normal operating conditions, CO2 is added to the feed gas. Although there appear to be limited opportunities for further development of the copper-based catalyst, other more robust and sulfur tolerant catalysts may utilize supported palladium as the active component. Palladium on several basic oxide supports, including La2O3 [8] and lithium-promoted palladium on SiO2 [9,10], is an active and selective catalyst for methanol synthesis that could find application in slurry reactors.

With respect to methane utilization, the major advance has been in the scale of methanol synthesis plants which are consistent with the production of fuels (see below).

Two other potential large scale chemical products from methane, via methanol, are ethylene and propylene. Methanol may be converted to these chemicals over a moderately acidic SAPO-34 molecular sieve, and a methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process has been developed by UOP [14]. Ethylene, which is the primary product, oligomerizes and cracks to propylene. The catalyst deactivates rapidly and regeneration is required. This is achieved in a fluidized bed-reactor which is similar to those employed in conventional catalytic cracking. Utilization of this technology probably will occur in integrated petrochemical complexes (e.g., in Saudi Arabia) rather than in remote locations.

从甲烷合成甲醇的过程涉及使用ICI在1966年引入的较低压力过程和更活跃的铜/锌氧化物/氧化铝催化剂。该催化剂通过水煤气转换反应产生的二氧化碳形成甲醇。在典型操作条件下，向进料气体中添加二氧化碳。虽然铜基催化剂的发展机会有限，但其他更坚固且抗硫的催化剂可以使用负载钯作为活性成分。La2O3和锂促进的钯/SiO2等基本氧化物支持上的钯催化剂是甲醇合成的活性和选择性催化剂，并且可以在悬浮床反应器中应用。 

另外两种通过甲醇从甲烷产生的大型化学产品是乙烯和丙烯。甲醇可以通过适度酸性的SAPO-34分子筛转化为这些化学品，UOP开发了一种甲醇到烯烃（MTO）过程。乙烯是主要产物，然后裂解和聚合为丙烯。这个过程中的催化剂快速失效并需要再生，这通常在类似于常规催化裂化使用的流化床反应器中完成。这项技术的应用可能发生在沙特阿拉伯等国家的集成石油化工综合体中，而不是在偏远地区。
