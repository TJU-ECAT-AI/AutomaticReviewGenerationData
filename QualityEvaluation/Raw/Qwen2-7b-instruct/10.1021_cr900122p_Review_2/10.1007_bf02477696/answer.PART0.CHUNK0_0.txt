[METHANE DIRECT CONVERSION TO AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS AT LOW REACTION TEMPERATURE]

Conversion of pure methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature. Methane conversion of about 10,20% is obtained at 773 K.

Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed. Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained. Thus, the reaction can be initiated by C2+ higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed.

Furthermore, aromatic product distribution is also controlled by the reaction temperature. High benzene selectivity can be obtained at the high temperature of 873 K but toluene is the leading product at lower temperature of 773 K.

In this way, C2 + carbenium ions (eq. 1) would be more easily formed than Cl carbenium ions. Moreover, Mo would act as hydride acceptor more reactive toward C2+ than C1 hydrocarbons. Thus the conversion of natural gas to aromatics may be initiated at lower temperature than that for pure methane conversion.

Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2.

We suggested [7] that natural gas containing some higher hydrocarbons is converted to aromatics by the reaction mechanism shown in the following schemes: C2+ Hydrocarbons + Mo/HZSM-5 , Cz+ Carbenium ions (1) CH4 + C2+ Carbenium ions , Aromatics (2) C2+ Carbenium ions , Coke (3) CH4 + Coke , Aromatics (4)

Coke or its precursor formed on the catalysts may act as an initiator for pure methane conversion, which have the same effect as the Cz+ additive in the feed (eq. 4).

On the other hand, since the coke was in a different phase from that of methane and products (aromatics), the phase transformation process takes place during the methane aromatization process. The phase transformation process can be described as follows: CH4(gas phase) , coke(solid phase ) ,aromatics (gas phase)

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts enable the conversion of pure methane to aromatics at low temperatures, initiating through the presence of higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed or special coke on the catalyst. The conversion efficiency is influenced by factors such as reaction temperature, with benzene being more selectively produced at higher temperatures while toluene becomes the leading product at lower temperatures. The use of these catalysts circumvents thermodynamic limitations, allowing for effective alkane transformations at lower temperatures.

In conclusion, the efficiency of alkane transformations is significantly enhanced by the selection of appropriate catalyst compositions and structures, along with optimized reaction conditions. These catalysts enable the conversion of methane to aromatics at low temperatures, which is crucial for industrial applications, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional high-temperature processes.
