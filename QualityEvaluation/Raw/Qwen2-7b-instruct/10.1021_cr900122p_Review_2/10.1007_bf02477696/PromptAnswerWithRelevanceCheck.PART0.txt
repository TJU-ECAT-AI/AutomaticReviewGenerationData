[METHANE DIRECT CONVERSION TO AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS AT LOW REACTION TEMPERATURE]

Conversion of pure methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature. Methane conversion of about 10,20% is obtained at 773 K.

Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed. Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained. Thus, the reaction can be initiated by C2+ higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed.

Furthermore, aromatic product distribution is also controlled by the reaction temperature. High benzene selectivity can be obtained at the high temperature of 873 K but toluene is the leading product at lower temperature of 773 K.

In this way, C2 + carbenium ions (eq. 1) would be more easily formed than Cl carbenium ions. Moreover, Mo would act as hydride acceptor more reactive toward C2+ than C1 hydrocarbons. Thus the conversion of natural gas to aromatics may be initiated at lower temperature than that for pure methane conversion.

Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2.

We suggested [7] that natural gas containing some higher hydrocarbons is converted to aromatics by the reaction mechanism shown in the following schemes: C2+ Hydrocarbons + Mo/HZSM-5 , Cz+ Carbenium ions (1) CH4 + C2+ Carbenium ions , Aromatics (2) C2+ Carbenium ions , Coke (3) CH4 + Coke , Aromatics (4)

Coke or its precursor formed on the catalysts may act as an initiator for pure methane conversion, which have the same effect as the Cz+ additive in the feed (eq. 4).

On the other hand, since the coke was in a different phase from that of methane and products (aromatics), the phase transformation process takes place during the methane aromatization process. The phase transformation process can be described as follows: CH4(gas phase) , coke(solid phase ) ,aromatics (gas phase)

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. These catalysts enable the conversion of pure methane to aromatics at low temperatures, initiating through the presence of higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed or special coke on the catalyst. The conversion efficiency is influenced by factors such as reaction temperature, with benzene being more selectively produced at higher temperatures while toluene becomes the leading product at lower temperatures. The use of these catalysts circumvents thermodynamic limitations, allowing for effective alkane transformations at lower temperatures.

In conclusion, the efficiency of alkane transformations is significantly enhanced by the selection of appropriate catalyst compositions and structures, along with optimized reaction conditions. These catalysts enable the conversion of methane to aromatics at low temperatures, which is crucial for industrial applications, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional high-temperature processes.

Conversion of pure methane and natural gas with different methane purity to aromatic hydrocarbons at 773 and 873 K have been investigated.

Methane conversion of about 10,20% is obtained at 773 K.

The reaction of pure methane and natural gas over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst is initiated by C2+ additives in the feed and some special coke on Mo-containing ZSM-5 catalysts.

The possible reaction mechanism and product phase transformation process for conversion of pure methane and natural gas at lower temperature are proposed.

Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K.

Coke deposited on the catalysts may act as an initiator for pure methane conversion, which have the same effect as the C2+ additive in the feed.

A high methane conversion is obtained at lower temperature without thermodynamic limitation.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of the literature provided, the key factors influencing these processes are:

1. The presence of C2+ mixtures in the feed or special coke on Mo/HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts enables the effective conversion of methane to aromatics at low temperatures (773-873 K). This demonstrates the importance of catalyst structure and the specific interaction between the catalyst and reactants.

2. The reaction mechanisms involve the formation of carbenium ions through the activation of methane and other hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface. This indicates the role of catalyst functionality and the ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions.

3. The conversion of methane to aromatics is facilitated by the coke deposited on the catalysts. This suggests that coke or its precursor plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction, similar to the effect of C2+ additives in the feed.

4. The phase transformation process during methane aromatization contributes to achieving high methane conversion at lower temperatures without thermodynamic limitations. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions in optimizing alkane transformations.

These factors collectively contribute to the industrial significance of using such metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, as they enable efficient and selective conversions under milder conditions, potentially reducing energy consumption and environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include the presence of specific metal species, the zeolite framework's pore size and acidity, and the reaction temperature. For instance, the selective conversion of methane to benzene over Mo-containing zeolites at 973 K suggests that the carbenium ion mechanism is effective for methane activation, indicating the importance of the catalyst's structure and reactivity. Low reaction temperatures are critical for practical applications, extending existing industrial processes. The presence of higher hydrocarbons in the feed and the formation of special coke on the catalyst surface initiates the conversion of methane to aromatics at lower temperatures, demonstrating how catalyst composition and conditions can influence reaction pathways and product distributions. These findings highlight the potential for developing efficient catalysts and reaction conditions for the conversion of alkanes to more valuable compounds, contributing to industrial significance.
