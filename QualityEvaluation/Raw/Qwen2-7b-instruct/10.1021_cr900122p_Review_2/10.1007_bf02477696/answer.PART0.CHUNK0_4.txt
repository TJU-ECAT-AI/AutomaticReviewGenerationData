The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play crucial roles in influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include the presence of specific metal species, the zeolite framework's pore size and acidity, and the reaction temperature. For instance, the selective conversion of methane to benzene over Mo-containing zeolites at 973 K suggests that the carbenium ion mechanism is effective for methane activation, indicating the importance of the catalyst's structure and reactivity. Low reaction temperatures are critical for practical applications, extending existing industrial processes. The presence of higher hydrocarbons in the feed and the formation of special coke on the catalyst surface initiates the conversion of methane to aromatics at lower temperatures, demonstrating how catalyst composition and conditions can influence reaction pathways and product distributions. These findings highlight the potential for developing efficient catalysts and reaction conditions for the conversion of alkanes to more valuable compounds, contributing to industrial significance.
