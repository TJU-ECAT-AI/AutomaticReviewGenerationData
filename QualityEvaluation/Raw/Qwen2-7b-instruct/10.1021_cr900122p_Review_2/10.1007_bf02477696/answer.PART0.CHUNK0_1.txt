Conversion of pure methane and natural gas with different methane purity to aromatic hydrocarbons at 773 and 873 K have been investigated.

Methane conversion of about 10,20% is obtained at 773 K.

The reaction of pure methane and natural gas over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst is initiated by C2+ additives in the feed and some special coke on Mo-containing ZSM-5 catalysts.

The possible reaction mechanism and product phase transformation process for conversion of pure methane and natural gas at lower temperature are proposed.

Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K.

Coke deposited on the catalysts may act as an initiator for pure methane conversion, which have the same effect as the C2+ additive in the feed.

A high methane conversion is obtained at lower temperature without thermodynamic limitation.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the context of the literature provided, the key factors influencing these processes are:

1. The presence of C2+ mixtures in the feed or special coke on Mo/HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts enables the effective conversion of methane to aromatics at low temperatures (773-873 K). This demonstrates the importance of catalyst structure and the specific interaction between the catalyst and reactants.

2. The reaction mechanisms involve the formation of carbenium ions through the activation of methane and other hydrocarbons on the catalyst surface. This indicates the role of catalyst functionality and the ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions.

3. The conversion of methane to aromatics is facilitated by the coke deposited on the catalysts. This suggests that coke or its precursor plays a crucial role in initiating the reaction, similar to the effect of C2+ additives in the feed.

4. The phase transformation process during methane aromatization contributes to achieving high methane conversion at lower temperatures without thermodynamic limitations. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions in optimizing alkane transformations.

These factors collectively contribute to the industrial significance of using such metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, as they enable efficient and selective conversions under milder conditions, potentially reducing energy consumption and environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

在文档提供的背景下，金属基催化剂（包括二氧化钒支持体和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转换的机制和效率。关键因素如下：

1. 燃料气体中的C2+混合物或催化剂上沉积的特殊焦炭能促进甲烷在较低温度（773-873 K）下转化为芳香烃。这表明催化剂结构及其与反应物的特定相互作用的重要性。

2. 反应机制涉及通过催化剂表面激活甲烷和其他碳氢化合物形成碳正离子。这表明催化剂功能性和促进所需化学反应的能力的重要性。

3. 甲烷转化为芳香烃得益于催化剂上的焦炭。这表明焦炭或其前体在启动反应中起着关键作用，类似于燃料气体中C2+添加剂的作用。

4. 甲烷芳构化过程中的相转变有助于在较低温度下实现高甲烷转化，而无需热力学限制。这强调了考虑反应物、催化剂和反应条件之间的相互作用在优化烷烃转换时的重要性。

这些因素共同决定了使用此类金属基催化剂进行烷烃转换的工业意义，因为它们允许在更温和条件下实现高效和选择性的转换，可能降低能耗并减少环境影响，与传统方法相比。
