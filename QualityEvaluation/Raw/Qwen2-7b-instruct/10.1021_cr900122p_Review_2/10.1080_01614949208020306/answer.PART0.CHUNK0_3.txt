Answer: The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include the type of metal, its loading, the zeolite framework, and the operating temperature and pressure. These catalysts enable oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, which are industrially significant due to their ability to produce high-value aromatic products from lighter hydrocarbons. The acidic properties of gallium- and zinc-containing ZSM-5 zeolites enhance alkane activation, leading to improved aromatization rates. The mechanism of alkane activation typically involves acid-catalyzed dehydrogenation and subsequent ring formation, facilitated by the catalyst's surface properties. The use of Ag-loaded ZSM-5 further optimizes the conversion of alkenes into aromatics, showcasing the versatility and adaptability of these materials in industrial applications.
