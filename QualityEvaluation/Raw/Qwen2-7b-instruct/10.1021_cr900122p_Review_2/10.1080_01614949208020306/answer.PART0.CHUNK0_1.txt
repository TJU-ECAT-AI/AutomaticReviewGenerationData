[1] "The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations."
[2] "In processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the presence of metals like gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) in zeolites can enhance the conversion rates of alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons."
[3] "Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites play crucial roles in facilitating these transformations due to their unique properties and reactivity."
[4] "Industrial significance is attributed to the ability of these catalysts to efficiently convert lower alkanes into aromatic hydrocarbons, which are valuable feedstocks for the petrochemical industry."
[5] "Factors contributing to their industrial significance include high selectivity, stability under harsh conditions, and the ability to operate at moderate temperatures and pressures, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact."
