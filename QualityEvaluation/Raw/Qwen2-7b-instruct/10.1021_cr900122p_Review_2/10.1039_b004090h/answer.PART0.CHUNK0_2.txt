The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites has been studied theoretically by DFT. Diverse types of active sites have been employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation on different rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer configuration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer species. The Zn(II) cation is most exposed to probe molecules when sitting on the 4T ring of zeolites. In this position, the cation activates strongly both the forbidden symmetric stretching IR band and the observed asymmetric stretching IR band l1 l3. This activation is not observed when the cation is placed in larger rings, for instance a 5T ring.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically, the location of the metal cation within the zeolite framework affects the activation of methane's IR bands. The Zn(II) cation, when situated on the 4T ring, strongly activates the symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands of methane. This is not observed when the cation is in larger rings like the 5T ring.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机制和效率产生重大影响。具体来说，沸石笼中金属离子的位置会影响甲烷红外谱带的活化。位于4T环上的Zn(II)离子能强烈激活甲烷的对称和不对称伸缩谱带。而当该离子位于较大的环如5T环时，这一现象不会出现。

None of these models, however, could describe this large experimental shift. The same results were also observed when these systems were embedded in a solvent cage, which mimicked the zeolite environment around the active site.

Despite the theoretical models predicting significant shifts in the methane adsorption spectrum, none of them accurately described the substantial experimental spectral shift observed. Similar findings were replicated when these systems were placed within a solvent cage that resembled the environment around the active site in a zeolite.

然而，这些模型都无法解释实验观察到的巨大谱线位移。当将这些系统嵌入模拟活性位点周围沸石环境的溶剂笼中时，也得到了相同的结果。
