The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The efficiency is influenced by factors such as the type of metal, its location within the catalyst structure, and the specific chemical properties of the alkane being transformed. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to perform these transformations efficiently, often leading to increased yield and selectivity. The specific examples given in the document pertain to the adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites, where the presence and position of Zn(II) cation significantly affects the adsorption mechanism and the IR spectral shifts observed. The Zn(II) cation in the 4T ring shows stronger activation of methane IR bands compared to other positions. Additionally, the [ZnOZn]2 site is identified as an active form on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio, contributing to the overall efficiency of the catalytic process.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is evident in their ability to enhance the conversion rates and product yields in various chemical processes. The detailed understanding of the interactions between the catalysts and the reactants, as well as the effects of different reaction conditions, allows for the optimization of these processes. This leads to cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and increased productivity in industries relying on alkane transformations, such as petrochemical and chemical manufacturing.

The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites has been studied theoretically by DFT. Diverse types of active sites have been employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation on different rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer configuration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer species. The Zn(II) cation is most exposed to probe molecules when sitting on the 4T ring of zeolites. In this position, the cation activates strongly both the forbidden symmetric stretching IR band and the observed asymmetric stretching IR band l1 l3. This activation is not observed when the cation is placed in larger rings, for instance a 5T ring.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include the type of metal cation, its position within the zeolite framework, and the specific interactions with the probe molecule like methane. The efficiency is enhanced when the metal cation is optimally positioned to activate alkane molecules through strong interactions, such as the Zn(II) cation in the 4T ring of zeolites. This leads to effective activation pathways, like the alkyl path for methane dissociation, and results in increased transformation rates. The industrial significance lies in the ability to selectively transform alkanes into valuable products with high yields and minimal side reactions, contributing to the economic viability and environmental sustainability of chemical processes.
