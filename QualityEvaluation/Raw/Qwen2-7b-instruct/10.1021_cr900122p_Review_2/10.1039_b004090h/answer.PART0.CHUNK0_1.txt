<p>The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites was studied theoretically by density functional theory (DFT).</p>
<p>Diverse types of active sites were employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation, which was placed on different rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer configuration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex.</p>
<p>The Zn(II) cation is the most exposed to probe molecules when situated on the 4T ring of zeolites.</p>
<p>In this position, the cation activates strongly two IR bands of methane and This activation is not observed when Zn(II) sits on (l1 l3).</p>
<p>Larger shifts are associated with the cationic position at small rings.</p>
<p>Methane prefers to adsorb physically in a 3-fold configuration on Zn(II) at both 4T and 5T rings.</p>
<p>This is not the case for ZnO and [ZnOZn]2 sites, in which the dissociative adsorption is more favorable.</p>
<p>The [ZnOZn]2 site appears to be one of the active forms of the Zn cation on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio.</p>
<p>This site is more thermodynamically stable than both Zn(II) on 5T and In the absence of (ZnO)4.</p>
<p>Brnsted sites,does not decompose into Zn(II) or [ZnOZn]2.</p>
<p>None of these models, however, could describe this large experimental shift.</p>
<p>The same results were also observed when these systems were embedded in a solvent cage, which mimicked the framework environment around the active site.</p>

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The efficiency is influenced by factors such as the type of metal, its location within the catalyst structure, and the specific chemical properties of the alkane being transformed. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to perform these transformations efficiently, often leading to increased yield and selectivity. The specific examples given in the document pertain to the adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites, where the presence and position of Zn(II) cation significantly affects the adsorption mechanism and the IR spectral shifts observed. The Zn(II) cation in the 4T ring shows stronger activation of methane IR bands compared to other positions. Additionally, the [ZnOZn]2 site is identified as an active form on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio, contributing to the overall efficiency of the catalytic process.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is evident in their ability to enhance the conversion rates and product yields in various chemical processes. The detailed understanding of the interactions between the catalysts and the reactants, as well as the effects of different reaction conditions, allows for the optimization of these processes. This leads to cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and increased productivity in industries relying on alkane transformations, such as petrochemical and chemical manufacturing.
