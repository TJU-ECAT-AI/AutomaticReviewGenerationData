1. Methane adsorption on Zn-exchanged zeolites was explored through theoretical density functional theory studies.
2. In the absence of (ZnO)4, specific active sites were identified.
3. The zinc(II) cation is maximally accessible to probe molecules when positioned on the 4-membered ring.
4. Greater shifts correlate with the zinc(II) cation's location at smaller ring sizes.
5. Methane tends to adsorb physically in a 3-fold configuration on zinc(II) at both 4T and 5T rings.
6. None of the modeled systems adequately explained the significant experimental shift observed.
7. The [ZnOZn]2 site is considered one of the active zinc forms on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio.
8. This site is thermodynamically more stable than zinc(II) on the 5T ring and (ZnO)4.
9. Due to its size, the oxide cluster might only be stable in specific pore positions.
10. The highest calculated shifts were for 3-fold physisorption on ZnO and zinc(II) (4T ring), and dissociative adsorption on the [ZnOZn]2 site.

1. 研究人员通过密度泛函理论对锌交换沸石上甲烷吸附进行了理论研究。
2. 在没有(ZnO)4的情况下，识别了一些活性位点。
3. 锌(II)离子在四元环位置时最易接触探针分子。
4. 更大的偏移与锌(II)离子位于较小环的位置有关。
5. 甲烷倾向于在4T和5T环上的锌(II)处以3折配置物理吸附。
6. 模型中的任何系统都无法充分解释观察到的大实验偏移。
7. [ZnOZn]2位点被认为是锌在低Si/Al比沸石中的活性形式之一。
8. 这个位点比5T环上的锌(II)和(ZnO)4更热力学稳定。
9. 由于其大小，氧化物簇可能只能在特定孔位置稳定。
10. 最高的计算偏移出现在3折物理吸附在ZnO和锌(II)（4T环）以及[ZnOZn]2位点的解离吸附上。
