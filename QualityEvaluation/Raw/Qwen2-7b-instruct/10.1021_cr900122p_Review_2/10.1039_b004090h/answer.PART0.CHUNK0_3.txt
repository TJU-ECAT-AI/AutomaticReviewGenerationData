<p>The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites was studied theoretically by density functional theory (DFT). Diverse types of active sites were employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation, which was placed on different rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer configuration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex.</p>
<p>The Zn(II) cation is the most exposed to probe molecules when situated on the 4T ring of zeolites. In this position, the cation activates strongly two IR bands of methane and This activation is not observed when Zn(II) sits on (l1 l3). larger rings.</p>
<p>This work presents systematically some insights into methane adsorption on Zn-loaded zeolites. Applying ab initio density functional theory (DFT) studies at a molecular level, the infrared (IR) frequencies and the interaction energies for methane adsorption on different active sites are calculated and discussed.</p>

The study investigates the adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites using density functional theory (DFT). Various active sites are considered, including a Zn(II) cation on different rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO cluster in a tetramer configuration, and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex. The Zn(II) cation on the 4T ring shows strong activation of methane's IR bands, unlike larger rings. The research provides insights into methane adsorption on Zn-loaded zeolites through DFT calculations at the molecular level.

这项研究使用密度泛函理论（DFT）探讨了Zn改性的沸石上甲烷的吸附。考虑了不同的活性位点，包括4T和5T环上的Zn(II)离子、四聚体配置的ZnO簇以及[ZnOZn]2二聚体复合物。4T环上的Zn(II)离子显示出对甲烷红外谱带的强烈激活，而在较大的环上则未观察到这种现象。该研究通过分子水平的DFT计算为Zn负载沸石上甲烷吸附提供了见解。
