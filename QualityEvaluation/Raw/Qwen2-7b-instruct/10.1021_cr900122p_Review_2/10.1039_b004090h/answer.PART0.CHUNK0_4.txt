[1] "The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites was studied theoretically by density functional theory (DFT)."
[2] "Diverse types of active sites were employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation, which was placed on different rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer configuration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex."
[3] "The Zn(II) cation is most exposed to probe molecules when sitting on the 4T ring of zeolites."
[4] "In this position, the cation activates strongly both the forbidden symmetric stretching IR band and the observed asymmetric stretching IR band."
[5] "Larger shifts are associated with the cationic position at small rings."
[6] "Methane prefers to adsorb physically in a 3-fold configuration on Zn(II) at both 4T and 5T rings."
[7] "None of these models, however, could describe this large experimental shift."
[8] "The [ZnOZn]2 site appears to be one of the active forms of the Zn cation on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio."
[9] "This site is more thermodynamically stable than both Zn(II) on 5T and In the absence of (ZnO)4 Brnsted sites,does not decompose into Zn(II) or [ZnOZn]2."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include the type of metal cation, its position within the zeolite framework, and the specific interactions with the probe molecule like methane. The efficiency is enhanced when the metal cation is optimally positioned to activate alkane molecules through strong interactions, such as the Zn(II) cation in the 4T ring of zeolites. This leads to effective activation pathways, like the alkyl path for methane dissociation, and results in increased transformation rates. The industrial significance lies in the ability to selectively transform alkanes into valuable products with high yields and minimal side reactions, contributing to the economic viability and environmental sustainability of chemical processes.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，如沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件影响烷烃转换的机制和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应过程中。关键因素包括金属离子的类型、其在沸石框架内的位置以及与探针分子（如甲烷）的特定相互作用。效率的提高体现在金属离子在沸石笼中的最佳定位，以激活烷烃分子并通过强相互作用进行有效激活，如4T环中的Zn(II)离子。这导致有效的活化路径，如甲烷的解离途径，并且结果是提高了转化速率。工业意义在于能够选择性地将烷烃转化为有价值的产物，同时保持高产率并最小化副反应，从而增加化学过程的经济性和环境可持续性。
