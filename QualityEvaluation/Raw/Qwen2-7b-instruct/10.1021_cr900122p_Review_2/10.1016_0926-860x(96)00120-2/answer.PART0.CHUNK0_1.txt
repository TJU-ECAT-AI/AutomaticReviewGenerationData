[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."
[2] "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ."
[3] "The relative amounts of each complex resultant from the reaction was determined by (a) reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 to produce quantitatively a mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 which in turn were discriminated by mass spectroscopy, and (b) reaction of (--SiO)3Zrf3H 7 with 02 followed by HC1 yielding 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield."
[4] "Each of these methods indicated that ( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation."
[5] "The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."
[6] "To confirm that these subtle changes in the infrared spectrum were indeed due to the formation of a ( SiO)3Zr-H species, we synthesised the complex under analogous conditions but on a larger scale (1 g of silica)."
[7] "Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS."
[8] "In another study of the stoichiometric reaction of the hydride with propane,800 mg of (= SiO)3Zr-H (0.78 wt.-% Zr) was divided into three reactors."
[9] "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."
[10] "For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C."
[11] "Kinetic analysis of the catalytic deuteration experiment lends credence to the hypothesis that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane is regiose- lective."
[12] "If the primary and secondary C-H bonds react at different rates, the model considers these to be two parallel first order reactions producing a two term rate law for the disappearance of v(C-H) intensity and appearance of v(C-D) intensity (Eq. (c))."
[13] "The experimental data were fitted to these two models. The result for the decay of v(C-H) intensity is depicted in Fig. 3."
[14] "The measured decay runs faster than the model early in the reaction, and much slower at longer times."
[15] "Nevertheless, we must point out that the mechanism of catalytic deuteration does not need to be the same as that of the stoichiometric reactions."
[16] "Reports of the extensions of this work to the analogous hafnium hydride complexes and studies of the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond activation are in preparation."

The study demonstrates that silica supported zirconium hydride species can activate carbon-hydrogen bonds at room temperature and facilitate the hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. The relative amounts of products resulting from the reaction with propane are determined using two methods: reaction with D2O and reaction with oxygen followed by HCl. The results indicate that (SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3 is the major product. The catalytic deuteration of propane shows that primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds by (-SiO)3ZrH is selective for primary over secondary C-H bonds. The study suggests that the activation step in the catalytic deuteration reaction can be degenerative, where it is the hydrogen of the C-H bond that approaches zirconium and the deuterium is transferred simultaneously to propane. The selectivity observed in all reactions might reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of (-SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. Extensive studies on analogous hafnium hydride complexes and the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond activation are currently being developed.

研究表明，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物物种能够在室温下激活碳氢键，并促进烷烃到甲烷和乙烷的氢解。从反应产物的相对量来看，确定了两种方法：与D2O反应和与氧气反应后用HCl处理。结果表明（SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3是主要产物。催化脱氘反应显示，主碳氢键比次碳氢键快七倍反应。丙烷碳氢键的激活通过（-SiO）3ZrH对选择性较高的是主碳氢键。研究建议，在催化脱氘反应中，激活步骤可能是退化的，其中氢原子靠近锆并同时将氘转移至丙烷。所有反应中观察到的选择性可能反映了（-SiO）3ZrCH(CH3)2和（-SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3的热平衡混合物。正在开发类似铪氢化物复合物的广泛研究以及碳碳键激活机制。
