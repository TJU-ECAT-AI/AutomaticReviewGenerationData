2. "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane. A mixture of propane gas (44 torr, 7.46. 10 .4 mol) and deuterium (760 torr, 1.29. 10 .2 mol, D2/propane = 17.3) prepared in an airtight infrared cell attached to a sealed sample tube containing 85 mg of (--- SiO)3Zr-H (1.5 wt.-% Zr, 1.4 • 10 .5 mol, propane/Zr-- 53)."
3. "The half-life of this catalytic deuteration was approximately 3 min representing about 200 turnovers."
