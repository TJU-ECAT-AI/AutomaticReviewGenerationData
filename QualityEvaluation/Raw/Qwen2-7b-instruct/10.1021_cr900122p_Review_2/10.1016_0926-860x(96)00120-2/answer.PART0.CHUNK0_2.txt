The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The relative amounts of each complex resultant from the reaction was determined by (a) reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 to produce quantitatively a mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 which in turn were discriminated by mass spectroscopy, and (b) reaction of (--SiO)3ZrC3H7 with 02 followed by HC1 yielding 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield. Each of these methods indicated that ( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation. The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds. A mechanism of degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation is invoked for the latter reaction.

The literature demonstrates that when propane reacts with the catalyst (=- SiO)3ZrH, it forms a mixture of two compounds: (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The relative proportions of these products were determined using two methods. Firstly, the reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 produced a quantifiable mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3, which were then analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Secondly, reacting (--SiO)3ZrC3H7 with 02 followed by HC1 resulted in the formation of 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield. Both methods confirmed that (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3 was the predominant product. Furthermore, the catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature, catalyzed by (=- SiO)3ZrH, revealed that the primary C-H bonds of propane react seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds. This observation supports a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism for the latter reaction.

文献表明，当丙烷与催化剂（=- SiO）3ZrH反应时，会形成两种化合物的混合物：（=- SiO）3ZrCH（CH3）2和（-= SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3。通过两种方法确定了这些产物的比例。首先，将（=- SiO）3ZrC3H7与D20反应生成了可量化的混合物CH3CH3CH2D和CH3CHDCH 3，然后通过质谱法对其进行分析。其次，将(--SiO)3ZrC3H7与02反应后，再用HC1处理，最终得到少量的1-丙醇和2-丙醇。这两种方法都证实了（-= SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3是主要产物。此外，室温下由（=- SiO）3ZrH催化进行的丙烷脱氘反应显示，丙烷的主碳氢键比次级碳氢键快七倍反应。这支持了后者反应中碳氢键的退化激活机制。

The activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by d o transition metal hydrides is normally described as a r-bond metathesis, that is,the C-H bond approached the Zr-H bond to form a four centered, four-electron intermediate. The selectivity determined by the analysis of the mass spectrum of propane-d 1 derived from the deuterolysis of (= SiO)3Zr-Pr and that determined by the conversion of (- SiO)3Zr-Pr to the corresponding alcohols necessarily pass through an intermediate zirconium-carbon bond, thus the selectivity is that on the formation of a zirconium-carbon bond (Scheme 3,upper right).

The literature explains that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by d-block transition metal hydrides typically involves a r-bond metathesis mechanism, where the C-H bond approaches the Zr-H bond to form a four-centered, four-electron intermediate. The selectivity determined by analyzing the mass spectrum of propane-d1, which is derived from the deuterolysis of (= SiO)3Zr-Pr, and the selectivity determined by converting (- SiO)3Zr-Pr to corresponding alcohols, necessarily involve passing through an intermediate zirconium-carbon bond. Therefore, the selectivity reflects the formation of a zirconium-carbon bond (as illustrated in Scheme 3, upper right).

文献指出，d块过渡金属氢化物激活碳氢键通常涉及r键互换机制，其中C-H键接近Zr-H键形成一个四中心、四个电子的中间体。通过分析从脱氘化得到的丙烷-d1的质谱，以及通过将(- SiO)3Zr-Pr转化为相应的醇来确定的活性，都必须经过一个中间锆碳键的过程。因此，选择性反映了形成锆碳键（如方案3，上右所示）。
