[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."
[2] "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ."
[3] "The relative amounts of each complex resultant from the reaction was determined by (a) reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 to produce quantitatively a mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 which in turn were discriminated by mass spectroscopy, and (b) reaction of (--SiO)3Zrf3H 7 with 02 followed by HC1 yielding 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield."
[4] "Each of these methods indicated that ( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation."
[5] "The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."
[6] "To confirm that these subtle changes in the infrared spectrum were indeed due to the formation of a ( SiO)3Zr-H species, we synthesised the complex under analogous conditions but on a larger scale (1 g of silica)."
[7] "Propane was removed and each sample was exposed to D20 vapor. Gases given off were quantified by GC. The unique product in each case was propane-d as determined by GC/MS."
[8] "In another study of the stoichiometric reaction of the hydride with propane,800 mg of (= SiO)3Zr-H (0.78 wt.-% Zr) was divided into three reactors."
[9] "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."
[10] "For propane, they report 10 turnovers of deuteration after reaction of an equimolar mixture of propane and deuterium in the presence of their catalyst for 72 h at 120C."
[11] "Kinetic analysis of the catalytic deuteration experiment lends credence to the hypothesis that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane is regiose- lective."
[12] "If the primary and secondary C-H bonds react at different rates, the model considers these to be two parallel first order reactions producing a two term rate law for the disappearance of v(C-H) intensity and appearance of v(C-D) intensity (Eq. (c))."
[13] "The experimental data were fitted to these two models. The result for the decay of v(C-H) intensity is depicted in Fig. 3."
[14] "The measured decay runs faster than the model early in the reaction, and much slower at longer times."
[15] "Nevertheless, we must point out that the mechanism of catalytic deuteration does not need to be the same as that of the stoichiometric reactions."
[16] "Reports of the extensions of this work to the analogous hafnium hydride complexes and studies of the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond activation are in preparation."

The study demonstrates that silica supported zirconium hydride species can activate carbon-hydrogen bonds at room temperature and facilitate the hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. The relative amounts of products resulting from the reaction with propane are determined using two methods: reaction with D2O and reaction with oxygen followed by HCl. The results indicate that (SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3 is the major product. The catalytic deuteration of propane shows that primary C-H bonds react seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. The activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds by (-SiO)3ZrH is selective for primary over secondary C-H bonds. The study suggests that the activation step in the catalytic deuteration reaction can be degenerative, where it is the hydrogen of the C-H bond that approaches zirconium and the deuterium is transferred simultaneously to propane. The selectivity observed in all reactions might reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of (-SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. Extensive studies on analogous hafnium hydride complexes and the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond activation are currently being developed.

研究表明，二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物物种能够在室温下激活碳氢键，并促进烷烃到甲烷和乙烷的氢解。从反应产物的相对量来看，确定了两种方法：与D2O反应和与氧气反应后用HCl处理。结果表明（SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3是主要产物。催化脱氘反应显示，主碳氢键比次碳氢键快七倍反应。丙烷碳氢键的激活通过（-SiO）3ZrH对选择性较高的是主碳氢键。研究建议，在催化脱氘反应中，激活步骤可能是退化的，其中氢原子靠近锆并同时将氘转移至丙烷。所有反应中观察到的选择性可能反映了（-SiO）3ZrCH(CH3)2和（-SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3的热平衡混合物。正在开发类似铪氢化物复合物的广泛研究以及碳碳键激活机制。

The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The relative amounts of each complex resultant from the reaction was determined by (a) reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 to produce quantitatively a mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 which in turn were discriminated by mass spectroscopy, and (b) reaction of (--SiO)3ZrC3H7 with 02 followed by HC1 yielding 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield.

The literature demonstrates that when propane reacts with the catalyst (=- SiO)3ZrH, it forms a mixture of two compounds: (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The relative proportions of these products were determined using two methods. Firstly, the reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 produced a quantifiable mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3, which were then analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Secondly, reacting (--SiO)3ZrC3H7 with 02 followed by HC1 resulted in the formation of 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield. Both methods confirmed that (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3 was the predominant product. Furthermore, the catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature, catalyzed by (=- SiO)3ZrH, revealed that the primary C-H bonds of propane react seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds. This observation supports a degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation mechanism for the latter reaction.

文献表明，当丙烷与催化剂（=- SiO）3ZrH反应时，会形成两种化合物的混合物：（=- SiO）3ZrCH（CH3）2和（-= SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3。通过两种方法确定了这些产物的比例。首先，将（=- SiO）3ZrC3H7与D20反应生成了可量化的混合物CH3CH3CH2D和CH3CHDCH 3，然后通过质谱法对其进行分析。其次，将(--SiO)3ZrC3H7与02反应后，再用HC1处理，最终得到少量的1-丙醇和2-丙醇。这两种方法都证实了（-= SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3是主要产物。此外，室温下由（=- SiO）3ZrH催化进行的丙烷脱氘反应显示，丙烷的主碳氢键比次级碳氢键快七倍反应。这支持了后者反应中碳氢键的退化激活机制。

The activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by d o transition metal hydrides is normally described as a r-bond metathesis, that is,the C-H bond approached the Zr-H bond to form a four centered, four-electron intermediate. The selectivity determined by the analysis of the mass spectrum of propane-d 1 derived from the deuterolysis of (= SiO)3Zr-Pr and that determined by the conversion of (- SiO)3Zr-Pr to the corresponding alcohols necessarily pass through an intermediate zirconium-carbon bond, thus the selectivity is that on the formation of a zirconium-carbon bond (Scheme 3,upper right).

The literature explains that the activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by d-block transition metal hydrides typically involves a r-bond metathesis mechanism, where the C-H bond approaches the Zr-H bond to form a four-centered, four-electron intermediate. The selectivity determined by analyzing the mass spectrum of propane-d1, which is derived from the deuterolysis of (= SiO)3Zr-Pr, and the selectivity determined by converting (- SiO)3Zr-Pr to corresponding alcohols, necessarily involve passing through an intermediate zirconium-carbon bond. Therefore, the selectivity reflects the formation of a zirconium-carbon bond (as illustrated in Scheme 3, upper right).
