[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."

The silica supported zirconium hydride catalyst is capable of activating carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane at room temperature, leading to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The primary C-H bonds of propane react seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds during the catalytic deuteration process. The catalyst shows strong selectivity for primary C-H bonds over secondary C-H bonds, indicating degenerate carbon-hydrogen bond activation. The mechanism involves the hydrogen of the C-H bond approaching the zirconium-deuteride bond to form the four-centered intermediate, rather than the carbon approaching the metal as in traditional C-H activation.

二氧化硅支持的锆氢化物催化剂能够在室温下激活丙烷中的碳氢键，产生（=- SiO）3ZrCH（CH3）2和（-= SiO）3ZrCH2CH2CH3的混合物。丙烷的主要C-H键比次级C-H键快七倍在催化脱氘过程中反应。该催化剂对主C-H键的选择性远高于次级C-H键，表明存在退化的碳氢键激活机制。机制涉及C-H键上的氢接近锆-氘键形成四中心中间体，而不是碳接近金属如传统C-H激活过程那样。
