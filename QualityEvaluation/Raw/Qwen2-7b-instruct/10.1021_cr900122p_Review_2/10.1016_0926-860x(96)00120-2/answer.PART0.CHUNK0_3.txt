The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3. The relative amounts of each complex resultant from the reaction was determined by (a) reaction of (-= SiO)3ZrC3H7 with D20 to produce quantitatively a mixture of CH3CH3CH2D and CH3CHDCH 3 which in turn were discriminated by mass spectroscopy, and (b) reaction of (--SiO)3ZrC3H7 with 02 followed by HC1 yielding 1-propanol and 2-propanol in low yield. Each of these methods indicated that ( SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3 was the major product of propane activation.

The model displayed in Scheme 2 assumes that there is no kinetic isotope effect in the ionisation of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer; ionization here was by E1 at 70 eV and thus we neglect any kinetic isotope effect on this step.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The model illustrated in Scheme 2 assumes no kinetic isotope effect during the ionization of propane molecules in the mass spectrometer; ionization occurred at 70 eV, leading us to disregard any kinetic isotope effect for this step.

We would be remiss if we did not point out that we cannot eliminate the possibility that the selectivity observed for all of these reactions reflects a thermally equilibrated mixture of (= SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We must acknowledge that the selectivity observed for all these reactions might not solely reflect a thermally equilibrated mixture of (= SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH 3, as other factors could also contribute.
