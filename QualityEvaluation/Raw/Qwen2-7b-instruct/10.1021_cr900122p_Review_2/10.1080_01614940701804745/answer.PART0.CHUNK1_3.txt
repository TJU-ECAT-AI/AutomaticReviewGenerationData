[1] "The current challenge lies in extending this understanding to longer and branched hydrocarbon molecules, both experimentally and theoretically."
[2] "The effects of local zeolite geometry on the reaction mechanism and the corresponding energetics have still not been addressed in the literature."
[3] "We note that each of the theoretical studies described above was done on clusters that did not specifically mimic any particular zeolite lattice structure, hence, local relaxation effects that have been shown to have a significant effect on the energy of the adsorbed alkoxide intermediate, may also significantly alter the energy profile for the b-scission and oligomerization reactions."
[4] "In summary, although several modified ZSM-5 formulations have been developed to enhance the para-selectivity for toluene disproportionation, only recently theoretical studies have elucidated the novel reaction pathways involving physisorbed intermediates for alkylation and dealkylation of aromatic species."
[5] "In an additional study Sanchez-Castillo et al. (259) have extended the study of isobutane conversion over USY zeolites, to describe isobutane reactivitity over H-MOR and H-BEA zeolites."

1. The current challenge in understanding alkane transformations lies in expanding this comprehension to longer and branched hydrocarbon molecules, both experimentally and theoretically.
2. The impact of local zeolite geometry on the reaction mechanism and the associated energetics has not been explored in the literature.
3. The theoretical studies described were conducted on clusters that did not accurately replicate zeolite lattice structures, thus ignoring the effects of local relaxation on the energy of adsorbed intermediates.
4. Several ZSM-5 modifications have been created to improve toluene disproportionation selectivity, but recent theoretical studies have clarified the unique reaction pathways involving physisorbed intermediates for aromatic alkylation and dealkylation.
5. Sanchez-Castillo et al. (259) expanded their study of isobutane conversion over USY zeolites to investigate isobutane reactivity over H-MOR and H-BEA zeolites.

1. 当前挑战在于通过实验和理论方法扩展对更长链和分支烃分子转化的理解。
2. 关于局部沸石结构几何形状对反应机制及其相应能垒的影响，文献中尚未有探讨。
3. 所描述的理论研究是在没有精确模仿特定沸石晶格结构的簇上进行的，因此忽略了局部松弛对吸附中间体能量的影响。
4. 已经开发了几种修改后的ZSM-5形式以提高对二甲苯的对位选择性，但最近的理论研究表明涉及物理吸附中间体的新反应途径，用于芳香族烷基化和脱烷基化。
5. Sanchez-Castillo等（259）扩展了他们在USY沸石上的异丁烷转化研究，以研究异丁烷在H-MOR和H-BEA沸石上的活性。
