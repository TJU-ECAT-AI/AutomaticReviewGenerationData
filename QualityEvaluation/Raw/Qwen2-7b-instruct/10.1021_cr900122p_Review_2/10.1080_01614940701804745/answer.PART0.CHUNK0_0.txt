The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, by affecting the acidity of the catalyst surfaces. The acidity is influenced by the structural effects such as Al-O (T-O) distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si (T-O-T) group. The longer Al-O bond lengths lead to a preference for the Al to be sited at the T-sites with the longest T-O bond length. The inclusion of the Madelung field alters the electronic structure, significantly depleting the charge of the proton, which is attributed to an artifact of the calculation method. The relationship between the T-O-T angle and the proton affinity can be analyzed using simple chemical arguments. Several experimental studies have confirmed that the acidity of zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, is influenced by the structure of the catalyst. Early work in alkane cracking over low-silica faujasites, like H-Y, observed that catalytic activity increased as aluminum was removed from the lattice. This suggests that the presence of aluminum in zeolite catalysts plays a crucial role in enhancing the acidity and thus the catalytic activity. The data collected by Hall et al. (109) were consistent with the Haag-Dessau hypothesis, supporting the idea that the observed product distributions were indicative of carbonium ion-like species in the reaction mechanisms. Researchers have also used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5, observing that several oligomerization-cracking cycles were part of a single catalytic turnover, and that H/D exchange reactions occurred, indicating the dynamic nature of the interaction between the propane molecules and the catalyst surface.

金属基催化剂，包括支持的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，如范德华氧化物和金属交换沸石，通过影响催化剂表面的酸性，进而影响烷烃转化机制和效率，特别是氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应。结构效应，如Al-O（T-O）距离和Al-OH-Si（T-O-T）组中的键角，对酸性的影响至关重要。由于Al-O键长比对应的Si-O键长长，因此铝倾向于位于T位点中T-O键最长的位置。引入Madelung场会显著改变电子结构，使质子的电荷显著减少，这被归因于计算方法的误差。T-O-T角度与质子亲和力之间的关系可以通过简单的化学论据进行分析。多项实验研究表明，特别是对于HZSM-5，沸石的结构对其酸性有重要影响。早期在低硅含量的faujasites如H-Y上的烷烃裂解工作发现，随着铝从晶格中去除，催化活性增加。这表明铝在沸石催化剂中的存在对增强酸性和催化活性具有关键作用。Hall等人的数据（109）与Haag-Dessau假说一致，支持观察到的产品分布是碳离子类似物在反应机制中的表现。研究者使用同位素示踪技术研究了在HZSM-5上丙烷激活的情况，发现多个寡聚化-裂解周期构成了单个催化循环的一部分，并且观察到了H/D交换反应，这表明了丙烷分子与催化剂表面之间动态相互作用的性质。
