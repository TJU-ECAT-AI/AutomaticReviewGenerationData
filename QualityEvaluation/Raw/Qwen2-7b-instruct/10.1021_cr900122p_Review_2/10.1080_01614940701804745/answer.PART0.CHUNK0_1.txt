[1] "The complexity of the aromatization chemistry makes it difficult to unravel reaction mechanisms; hence, mechanistic information is largely derived from interpreting experimental product distributions in terms of carbocationic chemistry."
[2] "Several groups have used computational methods to determine the influence of structural effects such as Al-O (T-O) distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si (T-O-T) group on the acidity of the hydroxyl group."
[3] "In a series of studies, researchers (132134) have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5."
[4] "Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa rcas iu and Lukinskas (140, 141) have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species."

1. The complexity of the aromatization chemistry makes it hard to understand reaction steps, so scientists mostly infer mechanisms by looking at what products are formed during experiments. 

2. Researchers use computer models to see how the structure of the material, like distances between certain atoms, influences the acidity of the material's surfaces.

3. Scientists have used techniques like adding special isotopes to propane and observing what happens to them to study how propane activates on HZSM-5.

4. New computer studies suggest that some aluminum atoms outside the main structure of the material might play a role in breaking down hydrocarbons.
