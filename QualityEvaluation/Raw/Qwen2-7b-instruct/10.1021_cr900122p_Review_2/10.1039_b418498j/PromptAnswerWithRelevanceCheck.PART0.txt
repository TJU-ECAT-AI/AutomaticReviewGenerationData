[1] "Our recent investigations of hydrogen or light alkanes adsorption by different cationic forms of zeolites showed that the ion exchanged transition metal cations usually exhibit very similar adsorption properties both with respect to H2 and to light paraffin adsorption (see for instance refs. 26 and 28)."
[2] "The interest in Cu1 as a compensating ion in zeolite framework is firstly connected with its ability to form the very unusual s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and, secondly, with its high affinity to light alkanes."
[3] "Indeed, as follows from Table 2, the calculated CH stretching frequencies for [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes are close to those experimentally observed in the obtained DRIFT spectra."
[4] "The nature of such bonding can be reasonably described by the synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals."
[5] "However, only formation of the Z2 adsorption complex results in an unusually strong red shift of the CH stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, since both the dona- tion and the back-donation in this case are much more effective."

2. Copper-I (Cu1) is of interest in zeolite frameworks due to its ability to form unique s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and its strong affinity for light alkanes.

3. The calculated CH stretching frequencies for the [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes closely match the experimentally observed frequencies in the DRIFT spectra.

4. The bonding between the ethane molecule and Cu1 ion can be reasonably explained by a synergistic combination of ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the partially occupied Cu1 s-orbital, along with metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals.

5. Only the formation of the Z2 adsorption complex leads to an unusually high red shift in the CH stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, due to the enhanced effectiveness of both the donation and back-donation processes.

The adsorption of dihydrogen by the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 zeolites causes a 1000 cm1 low-frequency shift of the HH stretching vibration, an unprecedented phenomenon. This shift is attributed to the synergetic combination of ligand-to-metal donation and metal-to-ligand back donation. The ethane molecules adsorbed by Cu1 ions experience a strong perturbation but do not undergo heterolytic dissociative adsorption at elevated temperatures. The bonding with Cu1 ions is described as a synergetic combination of donation from the ethane's s(CH) orbitals to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital and back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals. DFT modeling reveals that the formation of the Z2 adsorption complex results in significant changes in the adsorption site's geometry, with the Cu1 ion partially leaving the cationic site and its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms decreasing to 2. In contrast, the Z1 complex only slightly increases the CuO bond lengths.

The study highlights the unique adsorption properties of Cu1 cations in zeolite frameworks. Specifically, it demonstrates that Cu1 forms unusually strong s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen, leading to significant low-frequency shifts in the hydrogen stretching vibrations. It also shows that Cu1 has a high affinity for light alkanes, forming stable s-type complexes with them. The research employs both DRIFTS and DFT methods to elucidate the mechanism of ethane adsorption by Cu1, revealing a preference for the alkane to bind end-on through two hydrogen atoms of one of the methyl groups. The bonding can be described by a synergistic combination of ligand-to-metal donation and metal-to-ligand back donation, resulting in a strong weakening of the CH bonds and a large bathochromic shift of the CH stretching frequencies.

The preparation of the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample involves reacting the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 with CuCl vapor at 573 K, utilizing the same quartz cell for DRIFT spectrum recording. The most favorable adsorption geometry is identified as end-on binding via two hydrogen atoms from one of the methyl groups. The bonding is attributed to a combination of ligand-to-metal donation and metal-to-ligand back donation, which leads to a significant weakening of the CH bonds and a large bathochromic shift in the CH stretching frequencies of the methyl group interacting with the Cu1 ion.

This study contributes to understanding the unique interactions between Cu1 cations and alkanes in zeolite frameworks, providing insights into the formation of stable s-type complexes and the underlying bonding mechanisms.
