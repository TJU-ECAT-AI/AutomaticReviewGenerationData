<p>Recently, another very unusual adsorption property of CuZSM-5 zeolites has been reported by Serykh and Kazansky in refs. 12 and 13. They found that adsorption of dihydrogen by the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 results in more than 1000 cm1 low-frequency shift of the HH stretching vibration,which has never been observed before for H2 adsorbed by any other cationic forms of zeolites or by oxides.</p>
<p>Indeed, analysis of the components of the adsorption energy of H2 by Cu1 species, carried out within the cluster approach by Solans-Monfort et al.,23 revealed the s-bonding of adsorbed hydrogen. In this case the electron donation from the H2(sg) bonding orbital to the partially occupied Cu(4s) orbital com- bined with the electron back-donation from the (3dp) Cu1 orbital to the antibonding H2(s* u) orbital and also the orbital polarization play a significant role in the H2 adsorption energy,and cause the above mentioned very large bathochromic HH frequency shift.</p>
<p>Our recent investigations of hydrogen or light alkanes adsorption by different cationic forms of zeolites2429 showed that the ion exchanged transition metal cations usually exhibit very similar adsorption properties both with respect to H2 and to light paraffin adsorption (see for instance refs. 26 and 28).</p>
<p>However, most of these works were aimed on the interaction of adsorbed molecules with the strong Lewis acids when no s-type complexes were formed upon adsorption.</p>
<p>Although many H2 s-complexes have been previously re- ported, no similar series of the stable complexes with transition metals have been obtained for light alkanes.30,31 All the alkane complexes so far detected are unstable at room temperature and rather specialized methods are required for their prepara- tion and detection.</p>
<p>In the present study we report the results of the combined DRIFTS and DFT study of ethane adsorption by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 zeolite. The interest in Cu1 as a compensating ion in zeolite framework is firstly connected with its ability to form the very unusual s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and,secondly, with its high affinity to light alkanes.</p>
<p>As shown by the gas-phase DFT calculations, CH4Cu1 binding energy is equal to 16.821.43 kcal mol1.40 This is significantly larger than that for the other cations, such as Li1 (8.2 kcal mol1)38 or Mg21 (7.6 kcal mol1).41</p>
<p>Experimental The SN-300 ZSM-5 zeolite from Alsi Penta with an Si/Al ratio in the framework of about 150 was prepared by decom- position of the corresponding ammonium form in flowing oxygen at 773 K.</p>
<p>By the analogy with the procedure previously described in ref. 8, the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample was prepared directly by reaction of HZSM-5 with the CuCl vapour at 573 K. This was done in the same quartz optical cell that was subsequently used for recordings of DRIFT spectra.</p>
<p>The results obtained indicated that the most preferential adsorption geometry is when the alkane bound in an end-on fashion through two hydrogen atoms of one of the methyl groups.</p>
<p>The nature of such bonding can be reasonably described by the synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals. Both these interactions result in a very strong weakening of the CH bonds and, therefore, in a very large bathochromic shift of the CH stretching frequencies of methyl group contacting with Cu1 ion.</p>

The study highlights the unique adsorption properties of Cu1 cations in zeolite frameworks. Specifically, it demonstrates that Cu1 forms unusually strong s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen, leading to significant low-frequency shifts in the hydrogen stretching vibrations. It also shows that Cu1 has a high affinity for light alkanes, forming stable s-type complexes with them. The research employs both DRIFTS and DFT methods to elucidate the mechanism of ethane adsorption by Cu1, revealing a preference for the alkane to bind end-on through two hydrogen atoms of one of the methyl groups. The bonding can be described by a synergistic combination of ligand-to-metal donation and metal-to-ligand back donation, resulting in a strong weakening of the CH bonds and a large bathochromic shift of the CH stretching frequencies.

The preparation of the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample involves reacting the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 with CuCl vapor at 573 K, utilizing the same quartz cell for DRIFT spectrum recording. The most favorable adsorption geometry is identified as end-on binding via two hydrogen atoms from one of the methyl groups. The bonding is attributed to a combination of ligand-to-metal donation and metal-to-ligand back donation, which leads to a significant weakening of the CH bonds and a large bathochromic shift in the CH stretching frequencies of the methyl group interacting with the Cu1 ion.

This study contributes to understanding the unique interactions between Cu1 cations and alkanes in zeolite frameworks, providing insights into the formation of stable s-type complexes and the underlying bonding mechanisms.

研究强调了Cu1阳离子在沸石框架中独特的吸附性质。具体来说，它展示了Cu1能够形成与氢非常强的s型吸附复合物，导致氢伸缩振动频率的显著低频偏移。它还表明Cu1对轻烷烃有很高的亲和力，形成了稳定的s型复合物。通过结合DRIFTS和DFT方法，研究揭示了Cu1与乙烷吸附的机制，发现最有利的吸附几何结构是乙烷通过一个甲基组中的两个氢原子以末端插入的方式绑定。这种结合可以描述为从乙烷的s(CH)轨道到部分占据的Cu1 s轨道的配体到金属捐赠和从铜dp轨道到CH s*轨道的金属到配体回捐赠的协同组合，这两种相互作用导致了CH键的强烈减弱，并因此导致了CH伸缩频率的极大红移。
