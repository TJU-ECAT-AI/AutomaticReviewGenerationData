[1] "Recently, another very unusual adsorption property of CuZSM-5 zeolites has been reported by Serykh and Kazansky in refs. 12 and 13. They found that adsorption of dihydrogen by the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 results in more than 1000 cm1 low-frequency shift of the HH stretching vibration,which has never been observed before for H2 adsorbed by any other cationic forms of zeolites or by oxides."
[2] "Despite such a strong perturbation, the adsorbed ethane molecules are not involved in heterolytic dissociative adsorption at elevated temperatures."
[3] "The nature of such bonding can be reasonably described by the synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals."
[4] "Formation of the Z2 adsorption complex leads to the very significant changes in the geometry of the adsorption site: the Cu1 ion partially leaves the cationic site while its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2."
[5] "On the other hand,formation of the Z1-complex results in only slight increase of the CuO bond lengths (Table 1)."

The adsorption of dihydrogen by the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 zeolites causes a 1000 cm1 low-frequency shift of the HH stretching vibration, an unprecedented phenomenon. This shift is attributed to the synergetic combination of ligand-to-metal donation and metal-to-ligand back donation. The ethane molecules adsorbed by Cu1 ions experience a strong perturbation but do not undergo heterolytic dissociative adsorption at elevated temperatures. The bonding with Cu1 ions is described as a synergetic combination of donation from the ethane's s(CH) orbitals to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital and back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals. DFT modeling reveals that the formation of the Z2 adsorption complex results in significant changes in the adsorption site's geometry, with the Cu1 ion partially leaving the cationic site and its coordination number to the lattice oxygen atoms decreasing to 2. In contrast, the Z1 complex only slightly increases the CuO bond lengths.

最近，Serykh和Kazansky在引用12和13中报告了CuZSM-5沸石的一种非常不寻常的吸附性质。他们发现，通过过交换还原的CuZSM-5吸附氢气时，HH伸缩振动的频率降低超过1000 cm1，这是任何其他阳离子形式的沸石或氧化物吸附的氢气所未见的现象。尽管这种强烈的扰动，吸附的乙烷分子在高温下并未经历异裂性吸附。这种结合可以合理地描述为乙烷的s(CH)轨道向部分占有的Cu1 s轨道捐赠电子与铜dp轨道向CH s*轨道的反捐赠之间的协同作用。DFT模型显示，形成Z2吸附复合物导致吸附位点几何结构的显著变化：Cu1离子部分离开阳离子位点，其与晶格氧原子的配位数降至2。相反，Z1复合物仅轻微增加了CuO键长（表1）。
