[1] "Our recent investigations of hydrogen or light alkanes adsorption by different cationic forms of zeolites showed that the ion exchanged transition metal cations usually exhibit very similar adsorption properties both with respect to H2 and to light paraffin adsorption (see for instance refs. 26 and 28)."
[2] "The interest in Cu1 as a compensating ion in zeolite framework is firstly connected with its ability to form the very unusual s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and, secondly, with its high affinity to light alkanes."
[3] "Indeed, as follows from Table 2, the calculated CH stretching frequencies for [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes are close to those experimentally observed in the obtained DRIFT spectra."
[4] "The nature of such bonding can be reasonably described by the synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals."
[5] "However, only formation of the Z2 adsorption complex results in an unusually strong red shift of the CH stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, since both the dona- tion and the back-donation in this case are much more effective."

1. Ion exchanged transition metal cations in zeolites show similar adsorption properties for hydrogen and light paraffins, as seen in studies on hydrogen and light alkane adsorption by various zeolite forms (refs. 26 and 28).

2. Copper-I (Cu1) is of interest in zeolite frameworks due to its ability to form unique s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and its strong affinity for light alkanes.

3. The calculated CH stretching frequencies for the [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes closely match the experimentally observed frequencies in the DRIFT spectra.

4. The bonding between the ethane molecule and Cu1 ion can be reasonably explained by a synergistic combination of ligand-to-metal donation from the s(CH) orbitals of ethane to the partially occupied Cu1 s-orbital, along with metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the CH s*-orbitals.

5. Only the formation of the Z2 adsorption complex leads to an unusually high red shift in the CH stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, due to the enhanced effectiveness of both the donation and back-donation processes.

1. 交换离子的过渡金属在沸石中的离子形式在氢和轻烷烃吸附方面显示出了相似的吸附性质，这一点可以从对不同沸石形式的氢和轻烷烃吸附的研究中看出（参考文献26和28）。

2. 铜-I（Cu1）在沸石框架中具有兴趣，因为它能够形成与氢的独特s型吸附复合物，并且对轻烷烃具有很强的亲和力。

3. 计算得到的[Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z吸附复合物的CH伸缩频率与实验获得的DRIFT光谱中的频率非常接近。

4. 乙烷分子与Cu1离子之间的结合可以合理地解释为从乙烷的s(CH)轨道向部分填充的Cu1 s轨道的配体到金属的捐赠，以及铜dp轨道向CH s*-轨道的金属到配体反捐赠的协同组合。

5. 只有形成Z2吸附复合物才导致吸附乙烷的CH伸缩IR光谱带出现异常高的红移，这是由于在该情况下捐赠和反捐赠过程的有效性大大提高。
