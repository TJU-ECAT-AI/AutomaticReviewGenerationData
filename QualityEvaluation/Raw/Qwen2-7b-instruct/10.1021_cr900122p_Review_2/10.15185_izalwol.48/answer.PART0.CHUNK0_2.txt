The document highlights several pros and cons of using anonymous job applications in the hiring process. The pros include preventing discrimination during the initial screening stage, potentially boosting job offer rates for minority candidates, signaling a strong employer commitment to focusing solely on skills and qualifications, and achieving comparability among job applicants through standardized anonymous application forms. However, the cons noted are that this approach might only reduce discrimination significantly when discrimination is already high, could merely delay discrimination to later stages of the hiring process, might undermine other efforts to promote diversity, and can lead to costly, time-consuming, and error-prone implementations if not handled properly.

文档提到了匿名求职申请在招聘过程中的一些利弊。优点包括防止招聘初期的歧视，可能提升少数族裔候选人的录用率，表明雇主专注于技能和资质的承诺，以及通过标准化的匿名申请表实现申请者之间的可比性。然而，需要注意的是，这种做法仅在歧视程度较高时才有可能显著减少歧视，可能会将歧视延迟到招聘过程的后期阶段，可能会破坏其他促进多样性的积极措施，并且如果实施不当，可能会导致成本高昂、耗时、费力且容易出错。
