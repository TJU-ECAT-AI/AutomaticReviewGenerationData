The use of anonymous job applications has the potential to reduce discriminatory barriers to hiring for minority and other disadvantaged groups. By preventing discrimination during the initial screening stage, boosting job offer rates for minority candidates, signaling a strong employer commitment to focusing solely on skills and qualifications, and increasing job applicant comparability, anonymous job applications can level the playing field in access to jobs. However, they should not be seen as a universal solution and may not prevent all forms of discrimination.
