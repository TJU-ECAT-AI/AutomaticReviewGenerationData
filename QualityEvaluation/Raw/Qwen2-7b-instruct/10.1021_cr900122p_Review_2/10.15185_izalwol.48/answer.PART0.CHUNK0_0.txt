The use of anonymous job applications, also known as blind recruitment, has the potential to mitigate hiring discrimination. It prevents discrimination during the initial screening phase of recruitment, boosts job offer rates for minority candidates, and signals a strong employer commitment to focusing solely on skills and qualifications. Standardized anonymous job application forms are an efficient method for implementation. However, this approach may only reduce discrimination when discrimination is high, and it could potentially delay discrimination to later stages of the hiring process. Additionally, blind recruiting might undermine other efforts to promote diversity and restrict affirmative action programs. Poorly executed anonymous job application procedures can be expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors.

匿名求职申请，也被称为盲招，有可能减轻招聘歧视。它能够在招聘筛选阶段防止歧视，提高少数群体求职者的录用率，并表明雇主专注于技能和资格。标准化的匿名求职申请表是实施的有效方法。然而，这种方法仅在存在高歧视时才可能减少歧视，并且可能会将歧视推迟到招聘过程的后续阶段。此外，盲招可能会削弱其他促进多元化努力的效果，并限制积极行动措施的范围。执行不当的匿名求职申请程序可能会带来高昂的成本、耗费时间、需要大量人力投入，并且容易出错。
