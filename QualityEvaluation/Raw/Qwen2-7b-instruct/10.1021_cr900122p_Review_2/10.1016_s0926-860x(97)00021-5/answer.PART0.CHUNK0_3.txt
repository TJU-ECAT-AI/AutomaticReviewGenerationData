[1] "The higher surface density of surface vanadia species increases the number of catalytic active sites and minimizes unwanted side reactions from exposed oxide support sites."
[2] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[3] "Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species."
[4] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[5] "The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude."
[6] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."
[7] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."
[8] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule."
