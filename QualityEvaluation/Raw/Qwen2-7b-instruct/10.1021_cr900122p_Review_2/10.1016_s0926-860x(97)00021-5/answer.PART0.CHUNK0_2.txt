[1] "The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts [4]."
[2] "However, the combination of in situ Raman and hydrocarbon oxidation reactivity studies have recently suggested that the reaction properties are not related to the characteristics of the terminal V=O bonds in supported vanadia catalysts."
