[1] "There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. Much has been learned about the structures of the surface V(5+) species. In contrast, there is still little known about the molecular structures of the reduced surface V(4+) and V(3+) species because these structures are more difficult to characterize."
[2] "The reactivity per site, the TOE for the surface vanadia species in oxidation reactions is generally significantly greater than the corresponding TOF over supported molybdenum and chromium catalysts."
[3] "The weak acidic character of bulk vanadia relative to other transition metal oxides (e.g., oxides of Mo, Cr, Re, etc.) may also minimize unwanted side reactions."
[4] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[5] "Comparison of the molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species."
[6] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[7] "The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude."
[8] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."
[9] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."
[10] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule."
[11] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
[12] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
[13] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
[14] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."
