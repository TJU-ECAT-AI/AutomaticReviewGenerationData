          [1] "There has been significant progress in recent years in the determination of the molecular structures of the surface vanadia species present in supported metal oxide catalysts."
          [2] "Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species."
          [3] "The terminal V=O bond does not appear to critically influence the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
          [4] "The bridging V-O-V bond also does not affect many oxidation reactions, but for those reactions that may be influenced by this bridging bond the TOF may only increase by as much of an order of magnitude."
          [5] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."

          [7] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule."
          [8] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [9] "Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."
          [10] "However, interacting additives influence all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they modify the surface vanadia sites."
          [11] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

          在过去几年里，已经取得了一些关于支持型金属氧化物催化剂中表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构的显著进展。比较表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构信息与对应的反应性/选择性信息，为我们提供了对表面钒酸盐物种反应性性质的一些见解。终端V=O键在烃氧化反应中对表面钒酸盐物种的反应性影响不大。跨桥V-O-V键可能不会影响许多氧化反应，但对于那些可能受到这种跨桥键影响的反应，TOF仅可能增加一个数量级。然而，跨桥V-O-支持键似乎是最重要的键，因为它可以改变烃氧化反应的TOF高达四个数量级。氧化物支持的特定相以及特定制备方法似乎不影响表面钒酸盐物种的分子结构或反应性。所需表面钒酸盐位点的数量取决于特定的反应物分子。仅需要一个表面钒酸盐位点的氧化反应通常对表面钒酸盐覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在不敏感。需要多个表面钒酸盐位点的氧化反应对表面钒酸盐覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的存在非常敏感。然而，相互作用的添加剂影响所有烃氧化反应，因为它们修改了表面钒酸盐位点。酸性和碱性添加剂也影响烃氧化反应的选择性，但其影响似乎是反应特异性的，并且由于目前的数据有限，不能进行概括。
