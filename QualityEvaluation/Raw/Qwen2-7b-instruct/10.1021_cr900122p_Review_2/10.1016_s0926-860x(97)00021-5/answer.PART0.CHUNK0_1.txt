[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "Comparison of the molecular structure and reactivity information provides new fundamental insights into the catalytic properties of surface vanadia species during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions: (1) the role of terminal V=O, bridging V-O-V and bridging V-O-support bonds, (2) the number of surface vanadia sites required, (3) the influence of metal oxide additives, (4) the influence of surface acidic and basic sites, (5) the influence of preparation methods and (6) the influence of the specific oxide support phase."
[3] "The role of terminal V=O bonds has been proposed by many investigators to contain the critical oxygen involved in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."
[4] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF."
[5] "The number of surface vanadia sites required for a hydrocarbon oxidation reaction is dependent on the specific reactant molecule."
[6] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are widely used in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions due to their unique properties. 
2. The structure and reactivity of surface vanadia species provide insights into their catalytic properties, influencing factors include terminal V=O bonds, bridging bonds, the number of vanadia sites, metal oxide additives, surface acidic/basic sites, preparation methods, and oxide support phase.
3. Terminal V=O bonds were once thought to be crucial for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but recent studies suggest they do not play a critical role.
4. The bridging V-O-support bond is more critical, as changing the oxide support can dramatically affect the reaction rate.
5. The number of surface vanadia sites required varies depending on the specific reactant molecule being oxidized.
6. Additives like acids and bases can impact the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but their effects are specific to individual reactions and have not been widely generalized.
