1. The nature of vanadium species on alumina is influenced not just by vanadium loadings but also by calcination temperature.
2. After calcination at 873 K, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are dominant in V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3.
3. As vanadium loadings increase up to 13.2 wt.%, the portion of dispersed VOx species reduces and the portion of vanadium in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increases.
4. The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the quantity of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.
5. Propene selectivity is dependent on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; higher dispersion leads to higher propene selectivity.

1. 铀氧化物上的钒物种的性质不仅取决于钒负载，还取决于煅烧温度。
2. 在873 K的煅烧下，分散的孤立和聚合的四面体配合V5+物种在V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3中占主导地位。
3. 当钒负载增加到13.2 wt.%时，分散的VOx物种的比例减少，并且在结晶的AlVO4相中的钒比例增加。
4. 丙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性由分散的孤立和聚合的四面体配合V5+物种的数量决定。
5. 丙烯选择性依赖于四面体配合的V5+物种的分散程度；更高的分散度导致更高的丙烯选择性。
