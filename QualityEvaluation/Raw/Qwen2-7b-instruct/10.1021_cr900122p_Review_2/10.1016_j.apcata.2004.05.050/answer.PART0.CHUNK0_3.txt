1. Supported vanadium oxides calcined at 873 K show dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination, with polymerized species being the dominant type.
2. Up to a vanadium loading of 13.2 wt.%, the portion of dispersed VOx species decreases, while the AlVO4 phase increases in presence.
3. For a sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium, calcination at 773 and 873 K reveals that the AlVO4 phase forms at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species.
4. The catalytic activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is influenced by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.
5. Propene selectivity is determined by the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species, with higher dispersion leading to higher selectivity.

1. 在873 K条件下热处理后，支持的五氧化二钒显示出分散的孤立和聚合的五价钒(V5+)物种，在四面体配位中占主导地位，其中聚合物种是主要类型。
2. 在高达13.2 wt.%的五氧化二钒负载下，分散的VOx物种的比例下降，而AlVO4相的比例增加。
3. 对于含8.9 wt.%五氧化二钒的样品，在773和873 K下进行热处理显示AlVO4相形成，以牺牲八面体配位的V5+物种。
4. 烷烃氧化脱氢化催化活性由分散的孤立和聚合的四面体配位的V5+物种的数量决定。
5. 丙烯选择性取决于四面体配位的V5+物种的分散程度，分散度越高，选择性越高。
