[1] "The nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."
[2] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species."
[3] "With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."
[4] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."
[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

1. The nature of vanadium species on alumina is influenced by both vanadium loadings and calcination temperature.
2. At 873 K calcination, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are dominant.
3. Higher vanadium loadings lead to a decrease in dispersed VOx species and an increase in the AlVO4 phase.
4. The activity of propane oxidative dehydrogenation is determined by the amount of dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.
5. Propene selectivity is influenced by the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species, with higher dispersion leading to higher selectivity.

1. 铀酸铝上的钒物种的性质不仅取决于钒负载量，还取决于煅烧温度。
2. 在873 K的煅烧下，分散的孤立和聚合的V5+物种以四面体配位为主导。
3. 较高的钒负载导致分散的VOx物种减少，并且AlVO4相的含量增加。
4. 烯烃氧化脱氢反应的活性由分散的四面体配合的V5+物种的数量决定。
5. 丙烯选择性依赖于四面体配合的V5+物种的分散程度，分散度越高，选择性越高。
