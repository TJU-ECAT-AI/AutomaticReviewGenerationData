<p>The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. It is concluded that the AlVO4 phase has only a low catalytic activity since an increase of their amount leads to a decrease of catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites. In contrast, CO2 formation is approximately independent from the dispersion of the VOx species.</p>

1. The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, such as oxidative dehydrogenation. The key factor affecting the catalytic activity in this process is the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. The AlVO4 phase shows a low catalytic activity, leading to a decrease in activity as its amount increases. 

2. Propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation is closely tied to the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species on the catalyst surface. Higher dispersion results in higher propene selectivity. Conversely, CO formation, the main product of propene oxidation, increases with a decrease in the dispersion of active sites. CO2 formation, however, is largely unaffected by the dispersion of the VOx species.

1. 金属基催化剂，特别是支持的五氧化二钒的组成和结构，对烷烃转化机制和效率有着显著影响，特别是在氧化脱氢化过程中。催化活性的关键因素是分散的孤立和聚合四面体配位的V5+物种的数量。AlVO4相表现出较低的催化活性，随着其数量增加，活性会下降。

2. 在氧化脱氢化过程中，丙烯选择性与催化剂表面四面体配位的V5+物种的分散程度密切相关。分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。相反，丙烯氧化的主要产物CO的形成随活性位点分散度的降低而增加。然而，CO2的形成在很大程度上不受VOx物种分散度的影响。
