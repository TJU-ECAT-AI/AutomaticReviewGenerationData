<p>Results of characterization for the sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium calcined at 773 and 873 K show that the AlVO4 phase was formed at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Therefore, it is suggested that disturbed VOx polyhedra, mainly in octahedral coordination, have to be considered as a precursor for the AlVO4 phase. Its formation should depend on the dispersion of the adsorbed vanadium species on alumina after drying. After calcinations at 973 K the AlVO4 phase decomposed in vanadia and alumina.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. It is concluded that the AlVO4 phase has only a low catalytic activity since an increase of their amount leads to a decrease of catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahe-drally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites.

1. The nature of vanadium species on alumina is influenced by both the vanadium loadings and the calcination temperature.

2. At a calcination temperature of 873 K, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are dominant, with the polymerized species being the main type.

3. As the vanadium loadings increase up to 13.2 wt.%, the portion of dispersed VOx species decreases, and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increases.

4. The domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species remains relatively constant regardless of the vanadium loadings.

5. Results indicate that the AlVO4 phase forms at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Disturbed VOx polyhedra, primarily in octahedral coordination, are considered a precursor for the AlVO4 phase. Its formation is influenced by the dispersion of the adsorbed vanadium species on alumina after drying. 

6. The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. The AlVO4 phase has a low catalytic activity, and its increase leads to a decrease in catalytic activity.

7. Propene selectivity is dependent on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; higher dispersion leads to higher propene selectivity. CO formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites, while CO2 formation is relatively unaffected by the dispersion of the VOx species.

1. 铀氧化物上钒物种的性质不仅取决于钒负载，还取决于煅烧温度。

2. 在873 K的煅烧温度下，分散的孤立和聚合的V5+物种在四面体配位中占主导地位，后者的数量最多。

3. 当钒负载增加到13.2 wt.%时，分散的VOx物种的比例下降，存在于结晶的AlVO4相中的钒比例增加。

4. 四面体协调的聚合V5+物种的域大小在不同的钒负载下大致保持不变。

5. 结果表明，AlVO4相是在八面体配合的V5+物种消耗的情况下形成的。扰动的VOx多面体，主要是八面体配位，被认为是AlVO4相的前体。其形成依赖于吸附在氧化铝上的钒物种的分散性干燥后的分散性。

6. 丙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性由分散的孤立和聚合的四面体协调的V5+物种的数量决定。AlVO4相具有较低的催化活性，其增加导致催化活性降低。

7. 丙烯选择性依赖于四面体协调的V5+物种的分散性；分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。CO的形成随着活性位点分散性的降低而增加，而CO2的形成与VOx物种的分散性相对无关。
