[1] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydrogenation."
[2] "High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C."
[3] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromat- ics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
[4] "Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems."
[5] "Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
[6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."
[7] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."
[8] "We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs."
[9] "The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ reduction portion shown in Fig. 6."
[10] "Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen;however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor."

1. The primary function of extra-framework gallium is to increase the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation.

2. High surface area Ga2O3 and steamed gallosilicates can catalyze the aromatization of aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates within the temperature range of 500-600°C.

3. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels significantly impact the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, indicating the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio.

4. Propane aromatization poses challenges as secondary products like C a+ aromatics are easily formed, leading to issues like coking.

5. The catalysts' performance varies notably in terms of aromatics and methane selectivities among different MFI materials.

6. The initial reduction of gallium-exchanged materials was insufficient, and reoxidation did not fully regenerate crystalline Ga2O3.

7. The redox cycle of sample B was accurately replicated through DSC analysis, demonstrating the drying and reduction phases.

8. Excess heat during reoxidation likely comes from hydrogen oxidation, though not solely attributed to this factor.

1. 额外框架镓的主要作用是提高烯烃、二烯烃或环烷烃脱氢的速度。

2. 高表面积Ga2O3和热处理后的镓硅酸盐能够在500-600°C温度范围内以显著速率催化异构化顺式-1-己烯、环己烯以及一系列的脂族二烯烃。

3. 镓在沸石通道中的分散程度及其氧化状态对烷烃脱氢和裂解的相对速率有很大影响，而芳烃与甲烷的选择性比率则可以作为这些相对速率的指标。

4. 丙烷异构化作为镓-沸石催化剂的测试反应存在一些问题，因为容易形成如Ca+芳烃这样的副产物，并且还会产生焦炭。

5. 不同准备方法的MFI材料在选择性方面表现出明显的差异，尤其是对于芳烃和甲烷的选择性。

6. 加入镓交换材料的初始还原过程不完全，再氧化过程未能完全再生结晶态的Ga2O3。

7. 样品B的氧化还原周期通过DSC分析准确复制，显示了干燥和还原阶段。

8. 再氧化过程中过量的热量可能来源于吸附氢的氧化，但不可能完全归因于这一因素。
