(1) "Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts contain Ga3+/Ga+ in the form of a redox pair."
(2) "Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase."
(3) "A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and selective for aromatics formation."
(4) "TGA reduction studies suggest that [ Ga (OH),] + is the exchanging ion in ion-exchanged (from aqueous solution) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, and that these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen."

1. Gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 catalysts exists in a redox pair of Ga3+/Ga+ states, limited by the availability of anionic lattice sites for reduction to Ga+.
2. Catalysts optimized for ethane aromatization are made by dispersing gallium through hydrogen reduction, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase.
3. Substantially reduced catalysts, with a Ga+/Z- ratio close to 1, exhibit lower activity and selectivity for aromatics formation compared to unreduced or reoxidized materials.
4. TGA reduction studies indicate that [Ga(OH),]+ ions are involved in ion-exchange processes in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, capable of being reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen.

1. 离子交换的ZSM-5催化剂中的镓以Ga3+/Ga+的氧化还原对形式存在，受限于可用的阴离子晶格位点进行Ga+的还原。
2. 优化用于乙烷芳构化的催化剂是通过氢还原分散镓，随后氧化到分散的Ga3+相来制备的。
3. 显著减少的催化剂，Ga+/Z-比接近1，与未处理或再氧化材料相比，显示出更低的活性和选择性形成芳香族化合物。
4. TGA还原研究表明，在水溶液中交换的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂中涉及[Ga(OH),]+离子，能够用氢还原为Ga+。
