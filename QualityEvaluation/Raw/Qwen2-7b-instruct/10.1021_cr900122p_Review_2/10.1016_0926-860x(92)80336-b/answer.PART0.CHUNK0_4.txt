[1] "Additional evidence is presented for the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization."
[2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without addi- tional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
[3] "An ion-exchanged,reduced catalyst exhibits similar redox behavior,and is as active for propane aromatization,as catalysts prepared from purely physical mixtures of Ga203 and H- ZSM-5."
[4] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
[5] "We propose that at the higher drying temperature used here (650 C ) a small amount of GazOs was reduced prior to the introduction of hydrogen, in agreement with the chemistry of bulk Ga203 at > 600 C [ 171."
[6] "For sample A there was a short 300C purge in helium only; sample B was contacted with air for 5 h at 550 C; sample C with helium for 5 h at 550C; and for D the same treatment was used as for B, but then followed by a second standard reduction."
[7] "The activity and aromatics selectivity for the series of Ga/HMFI catalysts generally followed the order B (reduced/oxidized) > C (reduced/He ) > A (re- duced) > D (reduced/oxidized/reduced)."
[8] "The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ reduction portion shown in Fig. 6."

1. Gallium reduction plays a crucial role in preparing active gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5 can be reduced to Ga+, up to a limit set by the number of anionic framework sites. An ion-exchanged, reduced catalyst shows similar redox behavior and is as active for propane aromatization as catalysts made from physical mixtures of Ga2O3 and H-ZSM-5. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, reduced Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared with hydrogen are not as active or selective compared to those that have been significantly reoxidized using air or traces of oxygen in inert gases.

2. The gallium in the catalysts was partially reduced before hydrogen introduction at a higher drying temperature (650°C), aligning with the bulk gallium oxide chemistry at temperatures greater than 600°C. Different pretreatment conditions affected the catalysts' performance, with a series of experiments showing that catalysts treated with air, helium, and a second reduction followed the order of reduced/oxidized > reduced/He > reduced > reduced/oxidized/reduced in terms of activity and aromatics selectivity.

3. The redox behavior of sample B was replicated in the DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), with the drying/reduction process illustrated in Figure 6.

1. 镓的还原在制备用于烷烃芳香化反应的活性镓/ZSM-5催化剂中起着关键作用。离子交换的ZSM-5中的镓可以被还原为Ga+，其限制由框架结构上的阴离子位点数量决定。经过还原的离子交换催化剂表现出与物理混合的Ga2O3和H-ZSM-5制备的催化剂相似的氧化还原行为，并且对于丙烷的芳香化具有相同的活性。然而，在使用氢气还原后，用于乙烯脱氢转化为芳香族化合物的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的活性和选择性不如经过空气或惰性气体中微量氧气进行充分氧化的材料。

2. 在更高的干燥温度（650°C）下，催化剂在引入氢气之前部分还原，这与大于600°C时的纯固体镓氧化物化学一致。不同的预处理条件影响了催化剂的性能，一系列实验显示，在用空气、氦气和第二次还原处理后的催化剂按顺序排列的活性和芳香族选择性为：还原/氧化＞还原/氦＞还原＞还原/氧化/还原。

3. 样本B的氧化还原行为在DSC（差示扫描量热法）中得到复制，干燥/还原过程在图6中展示。
