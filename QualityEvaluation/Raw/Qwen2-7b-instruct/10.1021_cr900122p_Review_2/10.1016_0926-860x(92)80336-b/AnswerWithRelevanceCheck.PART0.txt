          [1] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene,diene,or cycloalkene dehydrogenation."
          [2] "High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates by themselves can aromatize aliphatic dienes,1-hexene,and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range 500-600 C."
          [3] "Therefore the dispersion and the oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels should greatly affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking;the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio should be a good indicator of these relative rates."
          [4] "Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts presents some problems."
          [5] "Secondary products such as C a+ aromatics are readily formed [5,6,9-111, and there- fore coking is also a problem."
          [6] "The aims of the work presented in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence that gallium-exchanged materials also fall into our stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction;and (2) to demonstrate that although the reduction of Ga& is necessary to disperse gallium within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst which is most active and selective for the production of aromatics does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations."
          [7] "For this probe reaction,differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials,especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane,are often pronounced [ 12,131."
          [8] "We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs."
          [9] "The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ reduction portion shown in Fig. 6."
          [10] "Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen;however, it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor."

          The primary role of extra-framework gallium in materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation. High surface area Gaz03 and steamed gallosilicates can aromatize aliphatic dienes, 1-hexene, and cyclohexene at significant rates over the temperature range of 500-600°C. The dispersion and oxidation state of gallium within zeolite channels affect the relative rates of alkane dehydrogenation and hydrocracking, with the aromatics/methane selectivity ratio serving as a good indicator of these rates. Propane aromatization as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts faces challenges due to the formation of secondary products like C a+ aromatics, which can lead to coking. The work presented aimed to provide evidence that gallium-exchanged materials adhere to the stoichiometric theory on gallium reduction and demonstrate that while reduction of Ga& is necessary for dispersing gallium within the zeolite, the most active and selective catalyst for aromatic production does not consist of reduced Ga+ as framework cations. Differences in the catalytic performance of differently prepared MFI materials, especially in their selectivities to aromatics and methane, are often pronounced. The redox cycle of sample B was reproduced in the DSC analysis, showing the drying/reduction phase depicted in Fig. 6. Some of the excess heat during reoxidation came from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen, but it is unlikely that the entire excess can be attributed to this factor alone.

          额外框架镓在材料中的主要作用是提高烯烃、二烯烃或环烷烃脱氢的速度。高表面积Ga2O3和热处理后的镓硅酸盐在500-600°C的温度范围内以显著速率催化异构化顺式-1-己烯、环己烯以及一系列的脂族二烯烃。镓在沸石通道中的分散程度及其氧化状态影响烷烃脱氢和裂解的相对速率，而芳烃与甲烷的选择性比率是这些相对速率的良好指标。作为镓-沸石催化剂测试反应的丙烷异构化存在一些问题，因为易于形成如Ca+芳烃之类的副产品，并且因此也会出现结焦的问题。工作旨在提供证据，证明镓交换材料遵循镓还原的定量理论，并展示虽然Ga&的还原是分散镓在沸石中所必需的，但最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂用于生产芳香族并不包含作为框架阳离子的还原Ga+。不同制备方法的MFI材料在选择性方面表现出明显的差异，尤其是在它们对芳烃和甲烷的选择性上。样本B的氧化还原周期在DSC分析中得到了复制，显示了干燥/还原阶段在图6中的描绘。再氧化过程中多余的热量部分来自吸附氢的氧化，但整个多余的热量不太可能归因于这个单一因素。

          [1] "Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts contain Ga3+/Ga+ in the form of a redox pair."
          [2] "Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase."
          [3] "A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and selective for aromatics formation."
          [4] "TGA reduction studies suggest that [ Ga (OH),] + is the exchanging ion in ion-exchanged (from aqueous solution) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, and that these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen."

          Gallium/ZSM-5 catalysts feature a redox pair of Ga3+/Ga+. Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are created by reducing the gallium with hydrogen to disperse it, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase. A significantly reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- approximately 1) is less active and selective for aromatic formation. TGA reduction studies indicate that [Ga(OH),]+ is the ion involved in the ion-exchange process in Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts from aqueous solutions, and these ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen.

          镓/ZSM-5催化剂包含Ga3+/Ga+的氧化还原对。优化用于乙烷芳构化的催化剂是通过用氢气还原镓以分散镓，然后通过再氧化至分散的Ga3+相来制备的。显着减少的催化剂（Ga+/Z-大约1）在芳香族形成方面既不那么活跃也不那么选择性。TGA还原研究表明，在水溶液中交换的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂中涉及的离子是[Ga(OH),]+，并且这些离子也可以用氢气还原为Ga+。

          [1] "Additional evidence is presented for the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization."
          [2] "The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, both with and without addi- tional Ga203,can be reduced to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined by the number of anionic framework sites."
          [3] "Although reduction generates dispersed,active gallium species in zeolite channels,it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."
          [4] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) , differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxi- dation takes place at 550C. However,the reoxidation does not regenerate /I-GasO,,but rather a higher energy,dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."
          [5] "This form of Ga3+ is stable under reaction conditions typical of ethane dehydrogenation,but can be reduced by hydrogen."

          Additional evidence supports the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization. The gallium in ion-exchanged ZSM-5, with or without additional Ga2O3, can be reduced to Ga+ up to a limit set by the number of anionic framework sites. Reduction results in dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are less active or selective compared to materials that have been substantially reoxidized using air or traces of oxygen in inert gases. Studies involving TGA, DSC, and XRD confirm rapid reoxidation at 550°C. The reoxidation does not regenerate Ga2O3 but rather a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+, which seems optimal for producing aromatics from ethane. This form of Ga3+ remains stable under typical ethane dehydrogenation conditions but can be reduced by hydrogen.

          对于烷烃芳香化反应，额外的证据支持镓的还原在准备活性镓/ZSM-5催化剂中的作用。离子交换的ZSM-5中的镓，无论是有还是没有额外的Ga2O3，都可以被还原至Ga+，其上限由阴离子框架位点的数量决定。还原会产生在沸石通道中分散的活性镓物种。然而，对于乙烷脱氢转化为芳香族化合物，用氢还原的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的活性和选择性不如经过空气或惰性气体中微量氧气进行充分氧化的材料。涉及TGA、DSC和XRD的研究证实了在550°C进行快速氧化。再氧化过程不生成Ga2O3，而是生成一种更高能量、分散的Ga3+，这似乎是最适合从乙烷生产芳香族化合物的形式。这种Ga3+在典型的乙烷脱氢条件下保持稳定，但可以通过氢还原。
