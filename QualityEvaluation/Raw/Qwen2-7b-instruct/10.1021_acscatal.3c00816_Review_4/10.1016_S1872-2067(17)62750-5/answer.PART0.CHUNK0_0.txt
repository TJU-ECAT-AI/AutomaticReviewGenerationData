<p>Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene.</p>
<p>However, there have not yet been any reports concerning the application of SUZ-4-supported catalysts to propane dehydrogenation, while ZSM-5-supported catalysts have attracted significant attention in this regard.</p>
<p>It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>The characterization of the two catalysts indicates that the distribution of Pt on the porous support affects the activity.</p>
<p>In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition.</p>
<p>This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite.</p>
<p>These results indicate that there might be some other reasons for the rapid deactivation of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst.</p>
<p>To further assess the interaction of each component in the PtSnNa catalyst, TPR with H2 was performed.</p>
<p>Compared with the PtSn/SUZ-4, the Sn(II) to Sn(0) reductive peak of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was increased in intensity and situated at a lower temperature (400 C).</p>
<p>The coverage of surface Pt by metallic Sn species in the Pt-Sn alloys may lead to decreased H2 uptake and lower catalytic activity during hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation.</p>

1. Propane dehydrogenation is a critical process in petrochemical industries due to the increasing demand for propylene.
2. There is a lack of research on the use of SUZ-4 zeolites in propane dehydrogenation, unlike ZSM-5 zeolites.
3. The SUZ-4-supported catalyst, PtSnNa/SUZ-4, demonstrated superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, thanks to its enhanced catalytic activity and stability.
4. The distribution of Pt on the porous support significantly impacts the catalyst's activity.
5. On the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst, Pt particles are predominantly dispersed on the external surface, making them less prone to deactivation by carbon deposition.
6. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite prevent the impregnation of the Pt precursor into the zeolite.
7. The deactivation mechanism of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst remains unclear.
8. The interaction between catalyst components was further evaluated through TPR with H2.
9. The addition of Na to the catalyst promotes the reduction of Sn species and enhances the dispersion of Pt.
10. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst showed higher activity and better stability in propane dehydrogenation compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5.

1. 烷基脱氢化是石油化学工业中最重要的过程之一，因为对丙烯的需求正在快速增长。
2. 尚未有关于使用SUZ-4沸石在烷基脱氢化方面的研究，而ZSM-5沸石在这方面受到了广泛关注。
3. 与ZSM-5支持的催化剂相比，SUZ-4支持的PtSnNa（PtSnNa/SUZ-4）催化剂在烷基脱氢化过程中表现出更高的活性和稳定性。
4. 催化剂上Pt的分布显著影响其活性。
5. 在PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂上，Pt颗粒主要分布在外部表面，因此不易因碳沉积而失活。
6. SUZ-4沸石的强酸位点阻止了Pt前体进入沸石。
7. PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂失活机制尚不明确。
8. 通过H2的TPR进一步评估了催化剂组分之间的相互作用。
9. 添加Na到催化剂中促进了Sn物种的还原并增强了Pt的分散。
10. PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在烷基脱氢化过程中显示出比PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂更高的活性和更好的稳定性。
