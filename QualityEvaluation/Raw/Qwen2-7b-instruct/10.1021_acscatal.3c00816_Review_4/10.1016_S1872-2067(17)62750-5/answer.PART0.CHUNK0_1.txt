<p>It is well reported that supported bi-component Pt-Sn catalysts can be employed in many reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation [ 1 ,2 ,3 ], hydrocarbon rearrangement [ 4 ], low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation [ 5 ], and alcohol electro-oxidation [ 6 ].</p>
<p>Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene [ 2 ,7 ,8 ,9 ]. Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics [ 1 ,2 ].</p>
<p>Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is the most common support for these materials, owing to its high surface area and acidity. However, Al2O3-supported Pt-Sn catalysts are deficient in terms of poor stability and lack of durability during recovery [ 1 ,10 ,11 ].</p>
<p>SUZ-4 is a new type of synthetic zeolite patented by the British Petroleum Company in 1992. In the three dimensional topological structure of this material, straight ten-membered channels intersect with two eight-membered channels at an angle of approximately 74, which is similar to the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite [ 15 ,16 ].</p>
<p>Despite this, the ZSM-5-based catalysts were still easily deactivated by carbon deposition under the chosen reaction conditions.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, our own group developed the SUZ-4-supported catalyst PtSnNa/SUZ-4, which afforded a 20% propylene yield. Although propylene can be obtained in similar 18%23% yields by increasing the Sn loading when using a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst [ 22 ], our catalyst has the advantage of being more robust and undergoing very little deactivation due to carbon deposition.</p>
<p>The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores.</p>
<p>In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.</p>

1. The use of bi-component Pt-Sn catalysts in various chemical reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation, hydrocarbon rearrangement, low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation, and alcohol electro-oxidation, is well documented. Propane dehydrogenation is particularly important due to the growing demand for propylene. These catalysts are known for their high activity and environmental friendliness.

2. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is commonly used as a support for Pt-Sn catalysts due to its high surface area and acidity. However, Al2O3-supported catalysts suffer from poor stability and durability during recovery. 

3. SUZ-4 is a novel synthetic zeolite characterized by a unique three-dimensional structure with intersecting ten-membered and eight-membered channels. It is similar to the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite.

4. ZSM-5-based catalysts are prone to carbon deposition, which leads to deactivation under specific reaction conditions.

5. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst developed by the research group showed superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts, offering higher stability and propylene yield without the need for increased Sn loading.

6. The enhanced activity and stability of PtSnNa/SUZ-4 can be attributed to the presence of a larger amount of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation caused by carbon deposition blocking the zeolite pores.

7. In the case of PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the reduced acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite allows for easier reduction of dispersed Sn oxides to metallic state, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

1. 在各种化学反应中，如烷烃脱氢、烃类重排、低温一氧化碳氧化和醇电氧化，双组分Pt-Sn催化剂的应用已被广泛报道。丙烷脱氢因其对丙烯需求的增长而被认为是最重要的一种石油化工过程。这些催化剂以其高活性和环保特性而闻名。

2. 铝酸盐（Al2O3）通常用作Pt-Sn催化剂的支持物，因为它具有高的比表面积和酸性。然而，Al2O3支持的催化剂在恢复过程中表现出稳定性差和耐用性差的问题。

3. SUZ-4是一种新型合成沸石，其三维结构由交联的十元环和八元环通道组成，类似于ZSM-5沸石的结构。

4. 基于ZSM-5的催化剂容易因碳沉积而失活，在特定的反应条件下。

5. 研究小组开发的PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面的性能优于PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂，提供更高的稳定性和丙烯产率，无需增加Sn负载。

6. PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂增强的活性和稳定性可归因于其外部表面存在较大的Pt量，这最小化了由碳沉积堵塞沸石孔洞引起的失活。

7. 对于PtSnNa/ZSM-5，由于ZSM-5沸石的较低酸性，分散的Sn氧化物更容易被还原为金属状态，导致烃类脱氢催化活性下降。
