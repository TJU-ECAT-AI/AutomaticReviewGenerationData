<p>Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene.</p>
<p>However, there have not yet been any reports concerning the application of SUZ-4-supported catalysts to propane dehydrogenation, while ZSM-5-supported catalysts have attracted significant attention in this regard.</p>
<p>It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.</p>
<p>The characterization of the two catalysts indicates that the distribution of Pt on the porous support affects the activity.</p>
<p>In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition.</p>
<p>This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite.</p>
<p>These results indicate that there might be some other reasons for the rapid deactivation of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst.</p>
<p>To further assess the interaction of each component in the PtSnNa catalyst, TPR with H2 was performed.</p>
<p>Compared with the PtSn/SUZ-4, the Sn(II) to Sn(0) reductive peak of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was increased in intensity and situated at a lower temperature (400 C).</p>
<p>The coverage of surface Pt by metallic Sn species in the Pt-Sn alloys may lead to decreased H2 uptake and lower catalytic activity during hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation.</p>

<p>It is well reported that supported bi-component Pt-Sn catalysts can be employed in many reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation [ 1 ,2 ,3 ], hydrocarbon rearrangement [ 4 ], low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation [ 5 ], and alcohol electro-oxidation [ 6 ].</p>
<p>Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene [ 2 ,7 ,8 ,9 ]. Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics [ 1 ,2 ].</p>
<p>Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is the most common support for these materials, owing to its high surface area and acidity. However, Al2O3-supported Pt-Sn catalysts are deficient in terms of poor stability and lack of durability during recovery [ 1 ,10 ,11 ].</p>
<p>SUZ-4 is a new type of synthetic zeolite patented by the British Petroleum Company in 1992. In the three dimensional topological structure of this material, straight ten-membered channels intersect with two eight-membered channels at an angle of approximately 74, which is similar to the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite [ 15 ,16 ].</p>
<p>Despite this, the ZSM-5-based catalysts were still easily deactivated by carbon deposition under the chosen reaction conditions.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, our own group developed the SUZ-4-supported catalyst PtSnNa/SUZ-4, which afforded a 20% propylene yield. Although propylene can be obtained in similar 18%23% yields by increasing the Sn loading when using a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst [ 22 ], our catalyst has the advantage of being more robust and undergoing very little deactivation due to carbon deposition.</p>
<p>The higher catalytic activity and stability of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst can possibly be attributed to a greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, and the minimal deactivation of this Pt by carbon deposition that blocked the zeolite pores.</p>
<p>In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened because of the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.</p>

1. The use of bi-component Pt-Sn catalysts in various chemical reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation, hydrocarbon rearrangement, low temperature carbon monoxide oxidation, and alcohol electro-oxidation, is well documented. Propane dehydrogenation is particularly important due to the growing demand for propylene. These catalysts are known for their high activity and environmental friendliness.

2. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is commonly used as a support for Pt-Sn catalysts due to its high surface area and acidity. However, Al2O3-supported catalysts suffer from poor stability and durability during recovery. 

3. SUZ-4 is a novel synthetic zeolite characterized by a unique three-dimensional structure with intersecting ten-membered and eight-membered channels. It is similar to the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite.

4. ZSM-5-based catalysts are prone to carbon deposition, which leads to deactivation under specific reaction conditions.

5. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst developed by the research group showed superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts, offering higher stability and propylene yield without the need for increased Sn loading.

6. The enhanced activity and stability of PtSnNa/SUZ-4 can be attributed to the presence of a larger amount of Pt on its external surfaces, which minimizes deactivation caused by carbon deposition blocking the zeolite pores.

7. In the case of PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the reduced acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite allows for easier reduction of dispersed Sn oxides to metallic state, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the use of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites (like SUZ-4) versus BEA topologic zeolites (like ZSM-5) influences the catalytic activity, stability, and propylene selectivity. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. **High Activity and Stability**: The SUZ-4 zeolite, due to its unique topology and strong acid sites, effectively prevents the impregnation of Pt precursors, leading to a higher quantity of Pt on the external surfaces of the catalyst. This enhances the activity and stability during PDH reactions.

2. **Minimal Deactivation by Carbon Deposition**: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite prevent the deactivation of Pt by carbon deposition, which is a critical factor in maintaining the catalyst's performance over time.

3. **Weaker Acidity for Enhanced Reduction**: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite facilitates the easier reduction of Sn oxides to metallic Sn, which decreases the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

4. **Dispersed Pt Distribution**: In the SUZ-4-supported catalyst, Pt particles are primarily dispersed over the external surface, reducing the likelihood of carbon deposition and enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

5. **Interaction of Components**: The interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support play a crucial role in determining the state of Sn components, the dispersion of Pt, and the overall dehydrogenation performance. In SUZ-4, these interactions are optimized to maintain a high level of Pt dispersion and prevent excessive Sn reduction, thereby preserving catalytic activity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，各种沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能产生显著影响。特别是硅铝磷酸盐沸石（如SUZ-4）与BEA结构沸石（如ZSM-5）之间的差异影响催化活性、稳定性和丙烯选择性。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. **高活性和稳定性**：SUZ-4沸石由于其独特的拓扑结构和强酸性位点，有效阻止铂前体的浸润，导致催化剂外部表面有较高量的铂。这增强了PDH反应过程中的活性和稳定性。

2. **碳沉积最小化**：SUZ-4沸石的强酸位点防止了碳沉积对铂的破坏，这是维持催化剂性能的关键因素。

3. **较弱的酸性促进Sn氧化物还原**：ZSM-5沸石的较弱酸性使得Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属Sn，从而降低了对烃类脱氢的催化活性。

4. **铂分布分散**：在SUZ-4支持的催化剂中，铂颗粒主要分布在外部表面，减少了碳沉积的可能性，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

5. **成分间的相互作用**：铂、锡和支撑材料之间的相互作用决定了锡成分的状态、铂的分散以及整体脱氢性能。在SUZ-4中，这些相互作用优化了铂的高分散度，防止了过量的Sn还原，从而保持了催化活性。

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. **Topology of Zeolites**: The topology of the zeolite framework affects its pore structure and acidity. For instance, SUZ-4 zeolite with its three-dimensional structure and intersecting channels provides a unique environment for PtSnNa catalysts, enhancing their stability and propylene selectivity. The ZSM-5 zeolite, with its well-defined, ten-membered, ring-crossed channel system, prevents the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thereby improving stability.

2. **Acidity of Zeolites**: The acidity of the zeolite supports plays a critical role in the distribution of the Pt and Sn components. In SUZ-4, the strong acid sites prevent the impregnation of the Pt precursor, leading to a higher dispersion of Pt on the external surface. Conversely, the weak acid sites in ZSM-5 allow more precursor entry, forming Pt clusters within the zeolite tunnels, which affects the catalyst's stability and propylene selectivity.

3. **Catalyst Composition**: The addition of sodium ions improves the propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Sodium content of 1.0% is found to be optimal, enhancing the stability and propylene selectivity of the catalysts.

4. **Pt Distribution**: The distribution of Pt across the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition. In contrast, Pt clusters formed within the ZSM-5 zeolite tunnels are more prone to carbon deposition, leading to deactivation.

5. **Interactions between Components**: The interactions between Pt, Sn, and the zeolite support are crucial. Sodium reduces the interactions between Sn oxides and the support, promoting the reduction of Sn to the metallic state, which decreases the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

6. **Stability and Efficiency**: The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability in PDH reactions compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5. This is attributed to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, minimal deactivation by carbon deposition, and the optimized interactions between components.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对催化剂性能有显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. **沸石拓扑结构**：沸石框架的拓扑结构影响其孔隙结构和酸性。例如，SUZ-4沸石独特的三维结构和交叉通道提供了独特的环境，提高了PtSnNa催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。而具有清晰定义的十元环交叉通道的ZSM-5沸石能够防止大分子烃类分子的形成，从而提高稳定性。

2. **沸石的酸性**：沸石支持物的酸性对于铂和锡成分的分布至关重要。在SUZ-4中，强酸位点阻止铂前体的浸渍，导致铂主要分布在外部表面。相比之下，ZSM-5中的弱酸位点允许更多的前体进入沸石隧道，在煅烧过程中转化为高度分散的铂簇，这影响催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。

3. **催化剂组成**：钠离子的添加可以改善丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。1.0%的钠含量被发现是最优的，它可以增强催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。

4. **铂分布**：SUZ-4沸石外部表面的铂分布减少了由碳沉积导致的催化剂失活。相比之下，ZSM-5沸石内部隧道内的铂簇更容易受到碳沉积的影响，导致催化剂失活。

5. **组分之间的相互作用**：铂、锡和沸石支持物之间的相互作用是关键。钠减少了锡氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用，促进了锡向金属状态的还原，这降低了氢化碳脱氢的催化活性。

6. **稳定性和效率**：与ZSM-5相比，PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在PDH反应中的活性和稳定性更高。这归因于外部表面更大的铂量、更少的由碳沉积导致的失活以及组分之间的优化相互作用。
