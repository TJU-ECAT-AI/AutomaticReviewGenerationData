[1] "It has been shown that SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."
[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
[5] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the SUZ-4 zeolite, with its strong acid sites, prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor, leading to a higher surface dispersion of Pt particles and improved stability against carbon deposition. This, in turn, contributed to higher catalytic activity and propylene selectivity compared to ZSM-5-based catalysts. The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 facilitated the dispersion of Sn oxides, which were easily reduced to metallic Sn, thus reducing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation. The key factors contributing to improved performance included the dispersion of Pt on the zeolite surface, the stability of the catalyst against carbon deposition, and the interactions between Sn oxides and the support, which were influenced by the zeolite's acidity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，各种沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能产生显著影响。具体而言，SUZ-4沸石的强酸性位点阻止了铂前体的浸渍，导致铂颗粒在表面的高分散度和增强的稳定性，这进而提高了催化活性和丙烯选择性，与ZSM-5基催化剂相比具有优势。ZSM-5的弱酸性使得Sn氧化物更容易分散，并且容易还原为金属Sn，从而降低了烃类脱氢的催化活性。关键因素包括铂在沸石表面的分散、催化剂对抗碳沉积的稳定性以及Sn氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用，这些都受沸石酸性的影响。
