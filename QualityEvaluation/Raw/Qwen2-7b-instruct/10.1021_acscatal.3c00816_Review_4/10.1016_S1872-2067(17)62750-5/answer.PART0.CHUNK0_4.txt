[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene."
[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics."
[3] "SUZ-4-supported catalysts have been widely used in many processes, such as the conversion of n-hexane, the synthesis of dimethyl ether from methanol, and the elimination of nitrogen oxides."
[4] "In contrast to γ-Al2O3, the three-dimensional microporous ZSM-5 zeolite has a well-defined, ten-membered, ring-crossed channel system that prevents the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus improving the catalyst's stability."
[5] "The evident deactivation and low propylene selectivity were likely due to the excessive concentrations of acid sites on these materials, leading to carbon deposits and undesirable cracking reactions, respectively."
[6] "Moreover, the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 afforded the highest propylene yields of up to 20%."
[7] "Between these two, the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior based on its higher stability and propylene selectivity."
[8] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[9] "In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."
[10] "These conclusions agree with reports in the literature."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. **Topology of Zeolites**: The topology of the zeolite framework affects its pore structure and acidity. For instance, SUZ-4 zeolite with its three-dimensional structure and intersecting channels provides a unique environment for PtSnNa catalysts, enhancing their stability and propylene selectivity. The ZSM-5 zeolite, with its well-defined, ten-membered, ring-crossed channel system, prevents the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thereby improving stability.

2. **Acidity of Zeolites**: The acidity of the zeolite supports plays a critical role in the distribution of the Pt and Sn components. In SUZ-4, the strong acid sites prevent the impregnation of the Pt precursor, leading to a higher dispersion of Pt on the external surface. Conversely, the weak acid sites in ZSM-5 allow more precursor entry, forming Pt clusters within the zeolite tunnels, which affects the catalyst's stability and propylene selectivity.

3. **Catalyst Composition**: The addition of sodium ions improves the propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Sodium content of 1.0% is found to be optimal, enhancing the stability and propylene selectivity of the catalysts.

4. **Pt Distribution**: The distribution of Pt across the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite minimizes deactivation by carbon deposition. In contrast, Pt clusters formed within the ZSM-5 zeolite tunnels are more prone to carbon deposition, leading to deactivation.

5. **Interactions between Components**: The interactions between Pt, Sn, and the zeolite support are crucial. Sodium reduces the interactions between Sn oxides and the support, promoting the reduction of Sn to the metallic state, which decreases the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

6. **Stability and Efficiency**: The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst exhibits higher activity and improved stability in PDH reactions compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5. This is attributed to the greater quantity of Pt on its external surfaces, minimal deactivation by carbon deposition, and the optimized interactions between components.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对催化剂性能有显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. **沸石拓扑结构**：沸石框架的拓扑结构影响其孔隙结构和酸性。例如，SUZ-4沸石独特的三维结构和交叉通道提供了独特的环境，提高了PtSnNa催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。而具有清晰定义的十元环交叉通道的ZSM-5沸石能够防止大分子烃类分子的形成，从而提高稳定性。

2. **沸石的酸性**：沸石支持物的酸性对于铂和锡成分的分布至关重要。在SUZ-4中，强酸位点阻止铂前体的浸渍，导致铂主要分布在外部表面。相比之下，ZSM-5中的弱酸位点允许更多的前体进入沸石隧道，在煅烧过程中转化为高度分散的铂簇，这影响催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。

3. **催化剂组成**：钠离子的添加可以改善丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。1.0%的钠含量被发现是最优的，它可以增强催化剂的稳定性和丙烯选择性。

4. **铂分布**：SUZ-4沸石外部表面的铂分布减少了由碳沉积导致的催化剂失活。相比之下，ZSM-5沸石内部隧道内的铂簇更容易受到碳沉积的影响，导致催化剂失活。

5. **组分之间的相互作用**：铂、锡和沸石支持物之间的相互作用是关键。钠减少了锡氧化物与支持物之间的相互作用，促进了锡向金属状态的还原，这降低了氢化碳脱氢的催化活性。

6. **稳定性和效率**：与ZSM-5相比，PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂在PDH反应中的活性和稳定性更高。这归因于外部表面更大的铂量、更少的由碳沉积导致的失活以及组分之间的优化相互作用。
