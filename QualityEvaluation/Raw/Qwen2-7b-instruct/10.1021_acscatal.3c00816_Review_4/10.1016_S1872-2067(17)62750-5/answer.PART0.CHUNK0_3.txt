[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene."
[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics."
[3] "However, Al2O3-supported Pt-Sn catalysts are deficient in terms of poor stability and lack of durability during recovery."
[4] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."
[5] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite."
[6] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite."
[7] "The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the use of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites (like SUZ-4) versus BEA topologic zeolites (like ZSM-5) influences the catalytic activity, stability, and propylene selectivity. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. **High Activity and Stability**: The SUZ-4 zeolite, due to its unique topology and strong acid sites, effectively prevents the impregnation of Pt precursors, leading to a higher quantity of Pt on the external surfaces of the catalyst. This enhances the activity and stability during PDH reactions.

2. **Minimal Deactivation by Carbon Deposition**: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite prevent the deactivation of Pt by carbon deposition, which is a critical factor in maintaining the catalyst's performance over time.

3. **Weaker Acidity for Enhanced Reduction**: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite facilitates the easier reduction of Sn oxides to metallic Sn, which decreases the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

4. **Dispersed Pt Distribution**: In the SUZ-4-supported catalyst, Pt particles are primarily dispersed over the external surface, reducing the likelihood of carbon deposition and enhancing the stability of the catalyst.

5. **Interaction of Components**: The interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support play a crucial role in determining the state of Sn components, the dispersion of Pt, and the overall dehydrogenation performance. In SUZ-4, these interactions are optimized to maintain a high level of Pt dispersion and prevent excessive Sn reduction, thereby preserving catalytic activity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，各种沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能产生显著影响。特别是硅铝磷酸盐沸石（如SUZ-4）与BEA结构沸石（如ZSM-5）之间的差异影响催化活性、稳定性和丙烯选择性。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. **高活性和稳定性**：SUZ-4沸石由于其独特的拓扑结构和强酸性位点，有效阻止铂前体的浸润，导致催化剂外部表面有较高量的铂。这增强了PDH反应过程中的活性和稳定性。

2. **碳沉积最小化**：SUZ-4沸石的强酸位点防止了碳沉积对铂的破坏，这是维持催化剂性能的关键因素。

3. **较弱的酸性促进Sn氧化物还原**：ZSM-5沸石的较弱酸性使得Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属Sn，从而降低了对烃类脱氢的催化活性。

4. **铂分布分散**：在SUZ-4支持的催化剂中，铂颗粒主要分布在外部表面，减少了碳沉积的可能性，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

5. **成分间的相互作用**：铂、锡和支撑材料之间的相互作用决定了锡成分的状态、铂的分散以及整体脱氢性能。在SUZ-4中，这些相互作用优化了铂的高分散度，防止了过量的Sn还原，从而保持了催化活性。
