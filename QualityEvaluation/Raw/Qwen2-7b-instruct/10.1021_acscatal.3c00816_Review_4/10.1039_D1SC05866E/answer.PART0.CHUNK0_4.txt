[1] "Propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework In(i) in chabazite zeolites Indium on silica, alumina and zeolite chabazite (CHA), with a range of In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios, have been investigated to understand the effect of the support on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[2] "The examination of Si/Al ratios suggests that higher Si/Al ratios are beneficial to propane dehydrogenation."
[3] "Isolated In+ in CHA are stable for ethane dehydrogenation for 90 h time-on-stream (TOS), while the Al2O3 supported indium catalyst deactivated with time on stream."
[4] "Indium on silica, on alumina and exchanged into CHA zeolites with varying In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios have been used to investigate the effect of the support on the indium speciation and the corresponding impact on propane dehydrogenation rates."
[5] "These results all point to the conclusion that the dehydrogenation properties of isolated In+ in CHA are superior to those of In(0) on other supports."
[6] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS."
[7] "Indium on silica, on alumina and exchanged into CHA zeolites with varying In/Al ratios and Si/Al ratios have been used to investigate the effect of the support on the indium speciation and the corresponding impact on propane dehydrogenation rates."
[8] "At comparable conversion, the propane dehydrogenation reaction over In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In/SiO2, In/Al2O3 and bulk In2O3."
[9] "The impact of the In/Al ratio and Si/Al ratio of In-CHA catalysts on the PDH performance has also been examined (Fig. 10)."

1. The study investigates how different zeolite supports, specifically silica, alumina, and chabazite zeolites (CHA), influence indium speciation and its impact on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 
2. Higher Si/Al ratios in chabazite zeolites positively affect propane dehydrogenation performance.
3. Indium supported on chabazite zeolites shows superior stability and selectivity for ethane dehydrogenation compared to alumina.
4. Various indium loading and support materials are compared to assess their effects on PDH rates and selectivities.
5. Isolated indium ions (In+) in chabazite zeolites exhibit superior dehydrogenation properties compared to indium in zero valence (In(0)).
6. Indium 2 oxide (In2O3) on the surface of chabazite zeolites is reduced in hydrogen, displacing protons in Brnsted acid sites (BASs).
7. Different indium loading and support materials are used to examine their influence on PDH rates and selectivities.
8. The chabazite zeolite (In-CHA) catalyst shows better stability and propylene selectivity (85%) than indium supported on silica, alumina, or bulk indium oxide.
9. The inorganic support material (in this case, chabazite zeolite) has a significant impact on the indium speciation and PDH performance, particularly in terms of stability and selectivity.
