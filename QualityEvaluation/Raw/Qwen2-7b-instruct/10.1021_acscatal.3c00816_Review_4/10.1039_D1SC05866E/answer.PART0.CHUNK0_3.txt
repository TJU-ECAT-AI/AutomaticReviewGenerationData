Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, the indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated Al. When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, In(0) was formed upon reduction (Fig. 1).

H2-TPR measurements were conducted to monitor the reduction process of the In-based catalyst (Fig. 2a). For In-CHA(11, 1.0), the resulting profile shows several peaks with increasing temperature from 200 C to 600 C. This complex signal may result from two factors: (1) the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at a high In loading (14%) had a variety of reduction temperatures; (2) an elevated temperature was needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when the sites had been consumed mainly at lower temperatures.

In the samples of 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, the hydroxyl group observed before reduction is largely consumed after reduction at 550 C, a consequence of the replacement of the proton in these sites by In species.

FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides information about the indium speciation of the reduced samples. In these experiments, the catalyst was reduced at 550 C for 30 min in pure H2 and cooled down to 50 C under vacuum, followed by the dosing of CD3CN.

The determination of consumed H2 on In-CHA with varying Si/Al ratios and In/Al ratios demonstrates that In2O3 could be completely reduced to In+ species when the In/Al ratios > 1.0, independent of Si/Al ratios.

1. Upon reduction, indium species enter the zeolite pores and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum. On silica and alumina supports, indium(0) is formed upon reduction.
2. H2-TPR measurements reveal complex signals for In-CHA(11, 1.0), with peaks at various temperatures indicating the reduction of indium oxide particles and interaction with Brönsted acid sites.
3. Upon reduction at 550°C, hydroxyl groups on 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3 are consumed, suggesting proton replacement by indium species.
4. FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile adsorption shows indium speciation changes post-reduction.
5. Complete reduction of indium oxide to indium(+) occurs when the indium/aluminum ratio exceeds 1.0, regardless of the silicon/aluminum ratio.

1. 在还原后，铟物种进入沸石孔并与四面体配位的铝相互作用。在硅氧烷和氧化铝支持下，还原后形成铟(0)。
2. 对于In-CHA(11, 1.0)，H2-TPR测量显示200°C到600°C之间的多个峰，这可能由两个因素引起：（1）高载量时In2O3颗粒尺寸分布导致不同的还原温度；（2）在较低温度下消耗主要位置时，需要提高温度来驱动In2O3与Brönsted酸性位点的反应。
3. 在550°C的还原后，10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3上的羟基组分被大量消耗，表明氢键被铟物种取代。
4. d3-乙腈吸附的FTIR光谱显示了还原后样品的铟物种变化。
5. 当铟/铝比超过1.0时，无论硅/铝比如何，可以完全将铟氧化物还原为铟(+)。
