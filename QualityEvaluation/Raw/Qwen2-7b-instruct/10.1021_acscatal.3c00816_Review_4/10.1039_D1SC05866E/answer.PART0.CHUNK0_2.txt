[1] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;33,34 however, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[2] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."
[4] "For In-CHA, the C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels (Fig. 11a)."

1. The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was supported by ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, but the stability of this species at the reaction temperature (600 C) is uncertain due to the collection of spectra at low temperatures.
2. The impact of the support on indium speciation is crucial for advancing the understanding of In-based catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Upon reduction, In2O3 on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is displaced from the Brnsted acid sites (BASs) and forms isolated In+ cations in extra-framework positions.
4. The reaction orders for propane dehydrogenation and cracking on In-CHA are close to the first order, indicating that these reactions follow first-order kinetics.

1. 对于乙烷脱氢，[InH2]+被确认为活性位点，主要基于离线傅里叶变换红外光谱和密度泛函理论计算的支持，但该物种在反应温度（600°C）下的稳定性存在不确定性，因为其光谱是在773 K时使用氢气处理后在低温（低于153 K）下收集的。
2. 理解支持物对铟物种化的影响对于推进基于铟的催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的理解至关重要。
3. 在还原过程中，位于H-CHA沸石外表面的In2O3从Brnsted酸位点（BASs）中被氢气取代，并形成位于额外框架位置的孤立In+离子。
4. In-CHA上的丙烷脱氢和裂解反应的反应级数接近一级，表明这些反应遵循一级动力学。
