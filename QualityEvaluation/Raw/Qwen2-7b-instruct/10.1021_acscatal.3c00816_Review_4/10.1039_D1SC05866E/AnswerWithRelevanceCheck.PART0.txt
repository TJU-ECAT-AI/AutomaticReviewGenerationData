         "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
         "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
         "The complex signal may result from two factors: (1) the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at a high In loading (14%) had a variety of reduction temperatures; (2) an elevated temperature was needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when the sites had been consumed mainly at lower temperatures."
         "FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides information about the indium speciation of the reduced samples."

         Questions focus on the impact of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition on the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), particularly regarding the role of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The discussion centers on how indium species, especially in the form of [InH2]+, affect the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. The relevance is evident in the exploration of how factors like indium loading, support materials, and the structure of the zeolite influence the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propylene. The mention of specific phenomena, such as the formation of extra-framework indium species (In-CHA), the role of Si/Al ratios, and the stability of catalysts over time, all contribute to the relevance of the answers to the questions.

         这些问题关注了沸石拓扑结构、制备方法和组成对基于沸石的催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中性能的影响，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的作用。讨论集中在如何影响催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的铟物种，特别是在形成[InH2]+形式时。答案的相关性体现在对催化剂效率的研究上，这种效率涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程，同时考虑了铟的负载、支撑材料和沸石结构等因素。提及的具体现象，如额外框架内铟物种（In-CHA）的形成、Si/Al比例的作用以及催化剂随时间的稳定性，都与问题相关联。

         "Propane dehydrogenation over extra-framework In(i) in chabazite zeolites"
         "Isolated In+ in CHA are stable for ethane dehydrogenation for 90 h time-on-stream (TOS)"
         "At comparable conversion, the propane dehydrogenation reaction over In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In/SiO2, In/Al2O3 and bulk In2O3."
         "The impact of the In/Al ratio and Si/Al ratio of In-CHA catalysts on the PDH performance has also been examined (Fig. 10)."

         The second question delves deeper into the specific mechanisms and outcomes of using zeolites with different topologies and compositions for PDH, particularly focusing on the stability and selectivity of the products. The answers highlight the role of indium in influencing the properties of these catalysts, such as its ability to form stable extra-framework species and the effect of different support materials (like silica, alumina, and chabazite) on the catalyst's performance. The discussion on the stability of isolated In+ in CHA for ethane dehydrogenation and the superior performance of In-CHA in propane dehydrogenation compared to other types of catalysts further underscores the relevance of the answers to the question.

         第二个问题更深入地探讨了不同拓扑结构和组成沸石用于PDH的具体机制和结果，特别关注产物的稳定性和选择性。答案强调了铟在影响这些催化剂性质中的作用，比如形成稳定额外框架物种的能力，以及不同支撑材料（如二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石）对催化剂性能的影响。关于在CHA中孤立In+的稳定性以及与乙烷脱氢相比，In-CHA在丙烷脱氢方面的优越性能，与其他类型催化剂相比，进一步突出了答案与问题的相关性。
