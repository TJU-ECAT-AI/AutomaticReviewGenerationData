[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS."
[3] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."
[4] "The examination of Si/Al ratios suggests that higher Si/Al ratios are beneficial to propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "For In-CHA, the C3H8 reaction order was 0.77 for dehydrogenation and 0.93 for cracking, close to the first order for both reaction channels."
[6] "TG analysis of the spent catalyst illustrates the high stability of the In-CHA(11, 1.0) catalyst. After a time-on-stream of 14 hours, the samples show only a small amount of coke formation (2.4%, Fig. S37), a value lower than that on the H-CHA(11) catalyst, confirming that the deactivation of the H-CHA catalyst is mainly due to the formation of coke and that an isolated In+ site is less prone to coke formation reactions."

1. The rising demand for propylene and the affordable price of propane from shale gas have sparked renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH).

2. Indium (In) in the CHA zeolite is reduced from In2O3 to In+ species, replacing Brönsted acid sites (BASs).

3. Compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3, the In-CHA catalyst shows superior stability and higher C3H6 selectivity (85%) at comparable conversion levels. This is attributed to a lower C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and a higher C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst.

4. Higher Si/Al ratios in CHA zeolites seem advantageous for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The reaction order for C3H8 dehydrogenation on In-CHA is 0.77, and for cracking, it is 0.93, close to the first order for both reactions.

6. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the spent catalyst indicates that the In-CHA(11, 1.0) catalyst has high stability. It shows minimal coke formation (2.4%) after 14 hours of operation, compared to the H-CHA(11) catalyst. This suggests that coke formation is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in the H-CHA catalyst, and an isolated In+ site is less susceptible to coke formation reactions.

1. 对丙烯的需求增加以及从页岩气中获得丙烷成本低廉，激发了对丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的兴趣。

2. 在CHA沸石中，In2O3最初位于H-CHA沸石晶体表面，在氢气存在下被还原，取代了Brönsted酸性位点（BAS）。

3. 相比于In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3，In-CHA催化剂在相似转化率下显示出更好的稳定性和更高的C3H6选择性（85%）。这归因于In-CHA催化剂中C3H8脱氢活化能较低（94.3 kJ mol1）和C3H8裂解活化能较高（206 kJ mol1）。

4. CHA沸石中较高的Si/Al比例对丙烷脱氢有益。

5. C3H8脱氢在In-CHA上的反应级数为0.77，而裂解为0.93，接近两个反应通道的第一级。

6. 热重分析（TG）表明，In-CHA(11, 1.0)催化剂具有高稳定性。在14小时操作后，样品仅形成少量焦炭（2.4%），与H-CHA(11)催化剂相比，这证实了H-CHA催化剂失活主要是由于焦炭形成，而孤立的In+位点不太可能形成焦炭。
