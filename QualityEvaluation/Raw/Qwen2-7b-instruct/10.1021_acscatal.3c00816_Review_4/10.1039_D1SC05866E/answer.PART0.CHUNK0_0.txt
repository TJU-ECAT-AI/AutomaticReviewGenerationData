Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA). A stoichiometric ratio of 1.5 of formed H2O to consumed H2 during H2 pulsed reduction experiments confirms the indium oxidation state of +1.

The reduced indium is different from the indium species observed on samples of 10In/SiO2, 10In/Al2O3 (i.e., 10 wt% indium) and bulk In2O3, in which In2O3 was reduced to In(0), as determined from the X-ray diffraction patterns of the product, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles, pulse reactor investigations and in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy.

At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst.

A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.

Other small-pore zeolite-stabilized metal cation sites could form highly stable and selective catalysts for this and facilitate other alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1. Upon reduction at 550°C, indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA) on the zeolite. This indicates that the indium oxidation state is +1. The stability and propylene selectivity of In-CHA are better than those of In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, as confirmed by a lower C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and higher C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol) in the In-CHA catalyst.

2. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolite is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because it decreases the number of cages containing multiple In+ cations. This suggests that the Si/Al ratio influences the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

3. Small-pore zeolite-stabilized metal cation sites, such as those in CHA zeolite, can form highly stable and selective catalysts for PDH and other alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of these sites offers a pathway for identifying new catalysts with improved properties.

1. 在550°C的还原下，铟从酸性位点（BASs）中取代质子，形成额外框架的In+物种（In-CHA）。这表明铟的氧化态为+1。In-CHA催化剂的稳定性与选择性优于In2O3、10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3，这是通过较低的C3H8脱氢化活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol）来确认的。

2. CHA沸石的高Si/Al比对于丙烷脱氢化（PDH）有益，因为它减少了包含多个In+离子笼的数量。这表明Si/Al比影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. 小孔径的沸石稳定金属离子位点，如CHA沸石中的位点，可以形成高度稳定的PDH和其他烷烃脱氢化反应催化剂。利用这些位点提供了一条识别具有改进性能的新催化剂的途径。
