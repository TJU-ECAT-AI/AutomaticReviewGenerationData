Upon reduction in H2 gas (550 C), indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA). A stoichiometric ratio of 1.5 of formed H2O to consumed H2 during H2 pulsed reduction experiments confirms the indium oxidation state of +1.

The reduced indium is different from the indium species observed on samples of 10In/SiO2, 10In/Al2O3 (i.e., 10 wt% indium) and bulk In2O3, in which In2O3 was reduced to In(0), as determined from the X-ray diffraction patterns of the product, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles, pulse reactor investigations and in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy.

At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst.

A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.

Other small-pore zeolite-stabilized metal cation sites could form highly stable and selective catalysts for this and facilitate other alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

1. Upon reduction at 550°C, indium displaces the proton in Brnsted acid sites (BASs), forming extra-framework In+ species (In-CHA) on the zeolite. This indicates that the indium oxidation state is +1. The stability and propylene selectivity of In-CHA are better than those of In2O3, 10In/SiO2, and 10In/Al2O3, as confirmed by a lower C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and higher C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol) in the In-CHA catalyst.

2. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolite is beneficial for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because it decreases the number of cages containing multiple In+ cations. This suggests that the Si/Al ratio influences the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

3. Small-pore zeolite-stabilized metal cation sites, such as those in CHA zeolite, can form highly stable and selective catalysts for PDH and other alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of these sites offers a pathway for identifying new catalysts with improved properties.

1. 在550°C的还原下，铟从酸性位点（BASs）中取代质子，形成额外框架的In+物种（In-CHA）。这表明铟的氧化态为+1。In-CHA催化剂的稳定性与选择性优于In2O3、10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3，这是通过较低的C3H8脱氢化活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol）来确认的。

2. CHA沸石的高Si/Al比对于丙烷脱氢化（PDH）有益，因为它减少了包含多个In+离子笼的数量。这表明Si/Al比影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. 小孔径的沸石稳定金属离子位点，如CHA沸石中的位点，可以形成高度稳定的PDH和其他烷烃脱氢化反应催化剂。利用这些位点提供了一条识别具有改进性能的新催化剂的途径。

[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."
[2] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS."

[6] "TG analysis of the spent catalyst illustrates the high stability of the In-CHA(11, 1.0) catalyst. After a time-on-stream of 14 hours, the samples show only a small amount of coke formation (2.4%, Fig. S37), a value lower than that on the H-CHA(11) catalyst, confirming that the deactivation of the H-CHA catalyst is mainly due to the formation of coke and that an isolated In+ site is less prone to coke formation reactions."

1. The rising demand for propylene and the affordable price of propane from shale gas have sparked renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH).

2. Indium (In) in the CHA zeolite is reduced from In2O3 to In+ species, replacing Brönsted acid sites (BASs).

3. Compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3, the In-CHA catalyst shows superior stability and higher C3H6 selectivity (85%) at comparable conversion levels. This is attributed to a lower C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and a higher C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst.

4. Higher Si/Al ratios in CHA zeolites seem advantageous for propane dehydrogenation.

5. The reaction order for C3H8 dehydrogenation on In-CHA is 0.77, and for cracking, it is 0.93, close to the first order for both reactions.

6. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of the spent catalyst indicates that the In-CHA(11, 1.0) catalyst has high stability. It shows minimal coke formation (2.4%) after 14 hours of operation, compared to the H-CHA(11) catalyst. This suggests that coke formation is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation in the H-CHA catalyst, and an isolated In+ site is less susceptible to coke formation reactions.

1. 对丙烯的需求增加以及从页岩气中获得丙烷成本低廉，激发了对丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的兴趣。

2. 在CHA沸石中，In2O3最初位于H-CHA沸石晶体表面，在氢气存在下被还原，取代了Brönsted酸性位点（BAS）。

3. 相比于In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3，In-CHA催化剂在相似转化率下显示出更好的稳定性和更高的C3H6选择性（85%）。这归因于In-CHA催化剂中C3H8脱氢活化能较低（94.3 kJ mol1）和C3H8裂解活化能较高（206 kJ mol1）。

4. CHA沸石中较高的Si/Al比例对丙烷脱氢有益。

5. C3H8脱氢在In-CHA上的反应级数为0.77，而裂解为0.93，接近两个反应通道的第一级。

6. 热重分析（TG）表明，In-CHA(11, 1.0)催化剂具有高稳定性。在14小时操作后，样品仅形成少量焦炭（2.4%），与H-CHA(11)催化剂相比，这证实了H-CHA催化剂失活主要是由于焦炭形成，而孤立的In+位点不太可能形成焦炭。

[1] "The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;33,34 however, the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K), and therefore whether the indium hydride is stable at the reaction temperature (600 C) remains to be determined."
[2] "Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[3] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."

Upon reduction of In-based catalysts, the indium species enter the pores of the zeolite and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated Al. When indium is impregnated on SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, In(0) was formed upon reduction (Fig. 1).

H2-TPR measurements were conducted to monitor the reduction process of the In-based catalyst (Fig. 2a). For In-CHA(11, 1.0), the resulting profile shows several peaks with increasing temperature from 200 C to 600 C. This complex signal may result from two factors: (1) the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at a high In loading (14%) had a variety of reduction temperatures; (2) an elevated temperature was needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when the sites had been consumed mainly at lower temperatures.

In the samples of 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, the hydroxyl group observed before reduction is largely consumed after reduction at 550 C, a consequence of the replacement of the proton in these sites by In species.

FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides information about the indium speciation of the reduced samples. In these experiments, the catalyst was reduced at 550 C for 30 min in pure H2 and cooled down to 50 C under vacuum, followed by the dosing of CD3CN.

The determination of consumed H2 on In-CHA with varying Si/Al ratios and In/Al ratios demonstrates that In2O3 could be completely reduced to In+ species when the In/Al ratios > 1.0, independent of Si/Al ratios.

1. Upon reduction, indium species enter the zeolite pores and interact with tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum. On silica and alumina supports, indium(0) is formed upon reduction.
2. H2-TPR measurements reveal complex signals for In-CHA(11, 1.0), with peaks at various temperatures indicating the reduction of indium oxide particles and interaction with Brönsted acid sites.
3. Upon reduction at 550°C, hydroxyl groups on 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3 are consumed, suggesting proton replacement by indium species.
4. FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile adsorption shows indium speciation changes post-reduction.
5. Complete reduction of indium oxide to indium(+) occurs when the indium/aluminum ratio exceeds 1.0, regardless of the silicon/aluminum ratio.

1. 在还原后，铟物种进入沸石孔并与四面体配位的铝相互作用。在硅氧烷和氧化铝支持下，还原后形成铟(0)。
2. 对于In-CHA(11, 1.0)，H2-TPR测量显示200°C到600°C之间的多个峰，这可能由两个因素引起：（1）高载量时In2O3颗粒尺寸分布导致不同的还原温度；（2）在较低温度下消耗主要位置时，需要提高温度来驱动In2O3与Brönsted酸性位点的反应。
3. 在550°C的还原后，10In/SiO2和10In/Al2O3上的羟基组分被大量消耗，表明氢键被铟物种取代。
4. d3-乙腈吸附的FTIR光谱显示了还原后样品的铟物种变化。
5. 当铟/铝比超过1.0时，无论硅/铝比如何，可以完全将铟氧化物还原为铟(+)。
