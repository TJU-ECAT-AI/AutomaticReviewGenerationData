[1] "Confining metal clusters in the channels or cages of a zeolite can result in special catalysts with complex structures, in which the metal clusters are surrounded by the zeolite framework and their structures are different from traditional supported catalysts."
[2] "The Pt content determined by ICP test, as shown in Table S1, is 1.21 wt% and 1.19 wt% for Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX, respectively."
[3] "The Pt clusters in Pt@NaX showed very slight growth due to their protection by the surrounding X-zeolite skeleton after the prolonged reaction time of 18 h."
[4] "Nevertheless, the conversion of propane over Pt/NaX increased when the reaction was prolonged to 12 h, which is probably due to the activation of the Pt clusters at high temperature."
[5] "The catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX can be attributed to the different electronic states of their Pt clusters rather than the size effect, considering that smaller Pt clusters should be more active for the dehydrogenation of propane according to the literature."
[6] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Metal clusters confined in zeolite cages exhibit complex structures differing from traditional supported catalysts. The surrounding zeolitic framework affects the electronic state of the Pt clusters, influencing their catalytic activity.

2. The Pt content in Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX is 1.21 wt% and 1.19 wt%, respectively. This variation influences the catalytic performance of the two catalysts.

3. In Pt@NaX, the Pt clusters are protected by the X-zeolite skeleton, leading to slight growth even after prolonged reaction times. In contrast, the Pt clusters in Pt/NaX show significant growth, which may contribute to their activation at high temperatures.

4. The catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX is attributed to the different electronic states of their Pt clusters rather than size effect. Smaller Pt clusters might be more active for PDH, but this is not the case here.

5. The surrounding zeolitic framework negatively impacts the catalytic performance of Pt clusters in certain reactions. This finding enhances our understanding of catalysts with metal clusters enclosed in zeolites.

6. The study reveals that enclosing metal clusters in zeolites may not always lead to improved catalytic performance, particularly for specific reactions. This insight deepens our understanding of this type of catalyst.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同类型的沸石基催化剂的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。被封存在沸石笼中的金属簇表现出与传统支持催化剂不同的复杂结构。周围沸石框架影响铂簇的电子状态，进而影响其催化活性。

2. Pt@NaX和Pt/NaX中的铂含量分别为1.21 wt%和1.19 wt%。这种差异影响两种催化剂的性能。

3. 在Pt@NaX中，铂簇在X-沸石骨架的保护下，即使在长时间反应后也仅表现出轻微生长。相比之下，Pt/NaX中的铂簇显示出显著增长，这可能与它们在高温下的激活有关。

4. Pt@NaX和Pt/NaX的催化活性归因于它们铂簇的不同电子状态，而不是尺寸效应。较小的铂簇可能对PDH更为活跃，但这并不适用于此处的情况。

5. 周围的沸石框架对某些反应中铂簇的催化性能产生负面影响。这一发现加深了我们对封装在沸石中的金属簇催化剂的理解。

6. 研究揭示，将金属簇封装在沸石中并非总是能提高催化剂性能，尤其是对于特定反应而言。这一见解深化了我们对这种类型催化剂的认识。

1. The Pt/NaX catalyst, with Pt clusters on the exterior of the X-zeolite, showed a 1100% increase in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where the Pt clusters were inside the zeolite. 

2. After reacting for 18 hours, the Pt/NaX catalyst exhibited less coke deposition and high stability.

3. The main reason behind the improved performance of the Pt/NaX catalyst is the significant passivation effect of the surrounding zeolitic framework. This effect decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters, weakens propane activation, and prevents propylene desorption, thus reducing propylene selectivity and increasing coke deposition.

1. 对于丙烷脱氢反应，外部位于X沸石中的铂簇的Pt/NaX催化剂与内部粘附在X沸石中的铂簇的Pt@NaX催化剂相比，其周转频率（TOF）提高了1100%，并且丙烯选择性显著提高。

2. 反应18小时后，Pt/NaX催化剂表现出较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。

3. Pt/NaX催化剂性能改善的主要原因是周围沸石骨架的显著钝化效应。这种效应降低了铂簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷激活，并阻止了丙烯脱附，从而减少了丙烯选择性和增加了焦炭沉积。

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the location of Pt clusters within the zeolite framework affects the catalyst's activity, propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and stability. In this study, the Pt/NaX catalyst, where Pt clusters are on the exterior of the X-zeolite, showed a remarkable enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where Pt clusters are inside the zeolite. The catalysts' stability was also superior, with less coke deposition detected in the Pt/NaX after a reaction duration of 18 hours. The enhanced performance is attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework's passivating effect on the Pt clusters. This effect decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters, which weakens the activation of propane. Consequently, it prevents the desorption of propylene, thereby reducing propylene selectivity and increasing coke deposition.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. **Location of Pt Clusters**: Exterior placement enhances the catalyst's ability to activate propane and promote propylene formation efficiently.
2. **Stabilization of Pt Clusters**: The zeolite framework protects the Pt clusters, preventing aggregation and maintaining their integrity throughout the reaction.
3. **Passivation Effect**: The surrounding zeolite framework modulates the Pt clusters' electronic state, leading to a decrease in the d-band center and suppression of propylene desorption.
4. **Reduced Coke Deposition**: Improved stability and selectivity result in lower coke formation, enhancing overall catalyst efficiency.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能产生了显著影响。特别是，铂（Pt）簇的放置位置在沸石骨架中的位置直接影响催化剂的活性、丙烯选择性、转化率和稳定性。在本研究中，Pt/NaX催化剂表现出在外表面的X沸石中的Pt簇相对于嵌入内部的NaX催化剂具有显著的转化频率（TOF）增强和丙烯选择性的提高。该催化剂的稳定性也更好，在18小时的反应后检测到较少的焦炭沉积。这种增强的性能归因于周围沸石框架对Pt簇的钝化作用。这种作用降低了Pt簇的d带中心，减弱了丙烷的激活，从而阻止了丙烯的脱附，导致丙烯选择性的降低和焦炭沉积的增加。

改进性能的关键因素包括：
1. **Pt簇的位置**：外部放置提高了催化剂激活丙烷和促进丙烯形成的效率。
2. **Pt簇的稳定化**：沸石骨架保护了Pt簇，防止它们聚集并维持其在整个反应过程中的完整性。
3. **钝化效应**：周围沸石框架调整了Pt簇的电子状态，导致d带中心的降低和丙烯脱附的抑制。
4. **减少焦炭沉积**：改进的稳定性和选择性导致较少的焦炭形成，从而提高整体催化剂效率。

1. The Pt/NaX catalyst, with Pt clusters located on the exterior of the X-zeolite, exhibited a remarkable enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where the Pt clusters were embedded within the X-zeolite. 

2. After a reaction duration of 18 hours, the Pt/NaX catalyst showed reduced coke deposition and maintained high stability.

3. The substantial passivation effect observed was attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework, which altered the d-band center of the Pt clusters, thereby inhibiting propane activation. This, in turn, hindered propylene desorption, leading to decreased propylene selectivity and increased coke formation.

4. The research underscores that the zeolitic environment surrounding metal clusters in this specific configuration does not necessarily benefit all catalytic reactions, deepening our understanding of these types of catalysts.

2.在反应持续18小时后，Pt/NaX催化剂显示出较低的焦炭沉积和保持高稳定性。

3.观察到的显著钝化效应主要归因于围绕封装铂簇的沸石骨架，这改变了铂簇的d带中心，从而抑制了丙烷激活。这反过来又阻碍了丙烯脱附，导致丙烯选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。

4.研究表明，在这种特定配置中围绕金属簇的沸石环境并不总是有利于所有催化反应，深化了我们对这类催化剂的理解。

1. The preparation methods, specifically the in situ crystallization for Pt@NaX and the traditional incipient impregnation for Pt/NaX, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of the catalysts. The BEA topologic zeolite in Pt@NaX and silicoaluminophosphate zeolite in Pt/NaX influence the electronic state and catalytic performance of the Pt clusters. Improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are achieved by the modulation of the d-band center of the Pt clusters, the suppression of propylene desorption, and the prevention of coke deposition.

2. The catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of the X-zeolite (Pt/NaX) shows a 1100% enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly improved propylene selectivity compared to the catalyst with Pt clusters enclosed within the X-zeolite (Pt@NaX).

3. The Pt clusters in Pt/NaX are more active for CO oxidation, indicating that the Na+ in the zeolite does not poison the Pt clusters, leading to better catalytic performance for CO oxidation.
