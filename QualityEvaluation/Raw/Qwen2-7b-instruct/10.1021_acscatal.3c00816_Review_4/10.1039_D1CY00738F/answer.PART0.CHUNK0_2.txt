[1] "The support and surrounding environment play a key role in the electronic state and catalytic performance of metal clusters and nanoparticles in metal-based catalysts."
[2] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[3] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[4] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the location of Pt clusters within the zeolite framework affects the catalyst's activity, propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and stability. In this study, the Pt/NaX catalyst, where Pt clusters are on the exterior of the X-zeolite, showed a remarkable enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where Pt clusters are inside the zeolite. The catalysts' stability was also superior, with less coke deposition detected in the Pt/NaX after a reaction duration of 18 hours. The enhanced performance is attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework's passivating effect on the Pt clusters. This effect decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters, which weakens the activation of propane. Consequently, it prevents the desorption of propylene, thereby reducing propylene selectivity and increasing coke deposition.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. **Location of Pt Clusters**: Exterior placement enhances the catalyst's ability to activate propane and promote propylene formation efficiently.
2. **Stabilization of Pt Clusters**: The zeolite framework protects the Pt clusters, preventing aggregation and maintaining their integrity throughout the reaction.
3. **Passivation Effect**: The surrounding zeolite framework modulates the Pt clusters' electronic state, leading to a decrease in the d-band center and suppression of propylene desorption.
4. **Reduced Coke Deposition**: Improved stability and selectivity result in lower coke formation, enhancing overall catalyst efficiency.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能产生了显著影响。特别是，铂（Pt）簇的放置位置在沸石骨架中的位置直接影响催化剂的活性、丙烯选择性、转化率和稳定性。在本研究中，Pt/NaX催化剂表现出在外表面的X沸石中的Pt簇相对于嵌入内部的NaX催化剂具有显著的转化频率（TOF）增强和丙烯选择性的提高。该催化剂的稳定性也更好，在18小时的反应后检测到较少的焦炭沉积。这种增强的性能归因于周围沸石框架对Pt簇的钝化作用。这种作用降低了Pt簇的d带中心，减弱了丙烷的激活，从而阻止了丙烯的脱附，导致丙烯选择性的降低和焦炭沉积的增加。

改进性能的关键因素包括：
1. **Pt簇的位置**：外部放置提高了催化剂激活丙烷和促进丙烯形成的效率。
2. **Pt簇的稳定化**：沸石骨架保护了Pt簇，防止它们聚集并维持其在整个反应过程中的完整性。
3. **钝化效应**：周围沸石框架调整了Pt簇的电子状态，导致d带中心的降低和丙烯脱附的抑制。
4. **减少焦炭沉积**：改进的稳定性和选择性导致较少的焦炭形成，从而提高整体催化剂效率。
