[1] "Confining metal clusters in the channels or cages of a zeolite can result in special catalysts with complex structures, in which the metal clusters are surrounded by the zeolite framework and their structures are different from traditional supported catalysts."
[2] "The Pt content determined by ICP test, as shown in Table S1, is 1.21 wt% and 1.19 wt% for Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX, respectively."
[3] "The Pt clusters in Pt@NaX showed very slight growth due to their protection by the surrounding X-zeolite skeleton after the prolonged reaction time of 18 h."
[4] "Nevertheless, the conversion of propane over Pt/NaX increased when the reaction was prolonged to 12 h, which is probably due to the activation of the Pt clusters at high temperature."
[5] "The catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX can be attributed to the different electronic states of their Pt clusters rather than the size effect, considering that smaller Pt clusters should be more active for the dehydrogenation of propane according to the literature."
[6] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Metal clusters confined in zeolite cages exhibit complex structures differing from traditional supported catalysts. The surrounding zeolitic framework affects the electronic state of the Pt clusters, influencing their catalytic activity.

2. The Pt content in Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX is 1.21 wt% and 1.19 wt%, respectively. This variation influences the catalytic performance of the two catalysts.

3. In Pt@NaX, the Pt clusters are protected by the X-zeolite skeleton, leading to slight growth even after prolonged reaction times. In contrast, the Pt clusters in Pt/NaX show significant growth, which may contribute to their activation at high temperatures.

4. The catalytic activity of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX is attributed to the different electronic states of their Pt clusters rather than size effect. Smaller Pt clusters might be more active for PDH, but this is not the case here.

5. The surrounding zeolitic framework negatively impacts the catalytic performance of Pt clusters in certain reactions. This finding enhances our understanding of catalysts with metal clusters enclosed in zeolites.

6. The study reveals that enclosing metal clusters in zeolites may not always lead to improved catalytic performance, particularly for specific reactions. This insight deepens our understanding of this type of catalyst.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同类型的沸石基催化剂的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。被封存在沸石笼中的金属簇表现出与传统支持催化剂不同的复杂结构。周围沸石框架影响铂簇的电子状态，进而影响其催化活性。

2. Pt@NaX和Pt/NaX中的铂含量分别为1.21 wt%和1.19 wt%。这种差异影响两种催化剂的性能。

3. 在Pt@NaX中，铂簇在X-沸石骨架的保护下，即使在长时间反应后也仅表现出轻微生长。相比之下，Pt/NaX中的铂簇显示出显著增长，这可能与它们在高温下的激活有关。

4. Pt@NaX和Pt/NaX的催化活性归因于它们铂簇的不同电子状态，而不是尺寸效应。较小的铂簇可能对PDH更为活跃，但这并不适用于此处的情况。

5. 周围的沸石框架对某些反应中铂簇的催化性能产生负面影响。这一发现加深了我们对封装在沸石中的金属簇催化剂的理解。

6. 研究揭示，将金属簇封装在沸石中并非总是能提高催化剂性能，尤其是对于特定反应而言。这一见解深化了我们对这种类型催化剂的认识。
