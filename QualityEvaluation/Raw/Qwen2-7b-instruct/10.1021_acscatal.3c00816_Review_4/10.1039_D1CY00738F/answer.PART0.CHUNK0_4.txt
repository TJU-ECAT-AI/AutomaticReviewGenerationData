[1] "Confining metal clusters in the channels or cages of a zeolite can result in special catalysts with complex structures, in which the metal clusters are surrounded by the zeolite framework and their structures are different from traditional supported catalysts."
[2] "The Pt content determined by ICP test, as shown in Table S1, is 1.21 wt% and 1.19 wt% for Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX, respectively."
[3] "It can clearly be seen that the synthesized X-zeolites are well crystalline with good thermal stability, and no impurities were detected besides the diffraction peaks attributed to the zeolite crystals."
[4] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[5] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane."
[6] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst."
[7] "The results of the CO oxidation results demonstrated that the CO conversion by Pt@NaX is higher than that by Pt/NaX, which comprehensively indicates the Na+ cannot poison the Pt clusters in Pt@NaX, resulting in the Pt clusters being more active for CO oxidation."

1. The preparation methods, specifically the in situ crystallization for Pt@NaX and the traditional incipient impregnation for Pt/NaX, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of the catalysts. The BEA topologic zeolite in Pt@NaX and silicoaluminophosphate zeolite in Pt/NaX influence the electronic state and catalytic performance of the Pt clusters. Improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are achieved by the modulation of the d-band center of the Pt clusters, the suppression of propylene desorption, and the prevention of coke deposition.

2. The catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of the X-zeolite (Pt/NaX) shows a 1100% enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly improved propylene selectivity compared to the catalyst with Pt clusters enclosed within the X-zeolite (Pt@NaX).

3. The Pt clusters in Pt/NaX are more active for CO oxidation, indicating that the Na+ in the zeolite does not poison the Pt clusters, leading to better catalytic performance for CO oxidation.

1. 准备方法，特别是通过原位结晶制备的Pt@NaX和通过传统浸渍法制备的Pt/NaX，组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响催化剂性能。BEA型沸石在Pt@NaX中的应用和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在Pt/NaX中的应用对铂簇的电子状态和催化性能产生了影响。通过调节铂簇的d带中心、抑制丙烯脱附以及防止焦炭沉积，实现了丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。

2. 外部位于X沸石上的铂簇（Pt/NaX）催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出1100%的转化频率（TOF）提升和显著提高的丙烯选择性，与内部封装在X沸石内的铂簇（Pt@NaX）相比。

3. Pt/NaX中的铂簇对于CO氧化表现出更高的活性，表明其中的Na+不会毒化铂簇，导致CO氧化催化性能更好。
