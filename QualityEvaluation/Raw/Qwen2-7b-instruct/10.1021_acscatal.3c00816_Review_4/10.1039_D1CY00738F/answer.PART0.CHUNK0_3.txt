[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."
[4] "The current work demonstrates that the zeolitic environment surrounding the metal clusters in this type of structure is not beneficial for some specific catalytic reactions and deeps the understanding of this type of catalyst."

1. The Pt/NaX catalyst, with Pt clusters located on the exterior of the X-zeolite, exhibited a remarkable enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where the Pt clusters were embedded within the X-zeolite. 

2. After a reaction duration of 18 hours, the Pt/NaX catalyst showed reduced coke deposition and maintained high stability.

3. The substantial passivation effect observed was attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework, which altered the d-band center of the Pt clusters, thereby inhibiting propane activation. This, in turn, hindered propylene desorption, leading to decreased propylene selectivity and increased coke formation.

4. The research underscores that the zeolitic environment surrounding metal clusters in this specific configuration does not necessarily benefit all catalytic reactions, deepening our understanding of these types of catalysts.

1.Pt/NaX催化剂，其中铂簇位于X沸石的外部，与嵌入X沸石内部的Pt@NaX催化剂相比，其周转频率（TOF）显著增加，丙烯选择性得到明显改善。

2.在反应持续18小时后，Pt/NaX催化剂显示出较低的焦炭沉积和保持高稳定性。

3.观察到的显著钝化效应主要归因于围绕封装铂簇的沸石骨架，这改变了铂簇的d带中心，从而抑制了丙烷激活。这反过来又阻碍了丙烯脱附，导致丙烯选择性降低和焦炭沉积增加。

4.研究表明，在这种特定配置中围绕金属簇的沸石环境并不总是有利于所有催化反应，深化了我们对这类催化剂的理解。
