[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."
[2] "Moreover, less coke deposition and high stability were detected in Pt/NaX after the reaction for 18 h."
[3] "Combining the detailed experiments and DFT calculations, it was revealed that the significant passivation effect is mainly attributed to the surrounding zeolitic framework for the enclosed Pt clusters, which decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters and weakens the activation of propane, preventing the desorption of propylene with a reduction in propylene selectivity and increase in coke deposition."

1. The Pt/NaX catalyst, with Pt clusters on the exterior of the X-zeolite, showed a 1100% increase in turnover frequency (TOF) and significantly improved propylene selectivity compared to the Pt@NaX catalyst, where the Pt clusters were inside the zeolite. 

2. After reacting for 18 hours, the Pt/NaX catalyst exhibited less coke deposition and high stability.

3. The main reason behind the improved performance of the Pt/NaX catalyst is the significant passivation effect of the surrounding zeolitic framework. This effect decreases the d-band center of the Pt clusters, weakens propane activation, and prevents propylene desorption, thus reducing propylene selectivity and increasing coke deposition.

1. 对于丙烷脱氢反应，外部位于X沸石中的铂簇的Pt/NaX催化剂与内部粘附在X沸石中的铂簇的Pt@NaX催化剂相比，其周转频率（TOF）提高了1100%，并且丙烯选择性显著提高。

2. 反应18小时后，Pt/NaX催化剂表现出较少的焦炭沉积和高稳定性。

3. Pt/NaX催化剂性能改善的主要原因是周围沸石骨架的显著钝化效应。这种效应降低了铂簇的d带中心，削弱了丙烷激活，并阻止了丙烯脱附，从而减少了丙烯选择性和增加了焦炭沉积。
