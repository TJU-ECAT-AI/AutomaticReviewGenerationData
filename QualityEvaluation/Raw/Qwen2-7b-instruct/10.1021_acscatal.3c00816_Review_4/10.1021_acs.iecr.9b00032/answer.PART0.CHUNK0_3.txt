The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the addition of phosphorus enhances the catalytic activity and stability of NiP/SiO2 catalysts by improving propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Zeolite topology affects the diffusion of reactants and products, impacting reaction kinetics. In BEA topological zeolites, the optimized pore structure facilitates better separation of propylene. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, with their high surface area and acidic sites, favor the dehydrogenation reaction.
