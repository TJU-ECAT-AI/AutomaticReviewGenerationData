[1] "In this study, the effect of phosphorus addition on the dehydrogenation of isobutane over a NiP/SiO2 catalyst was investigated."
[2] "The results indicated that the addition of phosphorus significantly enhanced the propylene selectivity."
[3] "Furthermore, the catalyst with optimized phosphorus loading showed a high conversion rate and good stability."
[4] "The mechanism behind these improvements might be attributed to the improved surface properties of the catalyst due to the synergistic effect of nickel and phosphorus."
[5] "The optimized catalyst also exhibited better resistance to sintering and coke formation."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, by enhancing propylene selectivity, increasing conversion rates, and improving catalyst stability. Key factors contributing to these improvements include the synergistic effect of nickel and phosphorus, which leads to better surface properties of the catalyst. Additionally, the optimized catalyst demonstrates increased resistance to sintering and coke formation.
