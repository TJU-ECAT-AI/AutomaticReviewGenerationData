The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the addition of phosphorus, as demonstrated in the study. The catalysts' performance was enhanced through the use of phosphorus addition, leading to better propylene selectivity and conversion rate. Higher phosphorus content in the catalysts resulted in better stability during the reaction.
