The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the addition of phosphorus (P) to a nickel-phosphorus (NiP) catalyst improves its performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The BEA topological structure of the zeolite enhances catalytic activity, while silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites exhibit better stability and selectivity towards propylene compared to other types of zeolites. These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

在丙烷裂解反应中，催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂的性能有显著影响。具体来说，向镍磷（NiP）催化剂中添加磷（P）可以提高其异丁烷裂解性能。BEA型沸石的结构增强催化活性，而硅铝磷酸盐（SAPO）沸石在丙烯选择性和稳定性方面比其他类型沸石表现更好。这些因素共同导致了丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的改善。
