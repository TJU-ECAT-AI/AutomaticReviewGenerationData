The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the addition of phosphorus (P) to a nickel-phosphorus (NiP) catalyst improves its performance in isobutane dehydrogenation. The BEA topological structure of the zeolite enhances catalytic activity, while silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites exhibit better stability and selectivity towards propylene compared to other types of zeolites. These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.
