<quotes>
<p>In our experiments, the thermal treatment is carried out after the impregnation of La. In this way, relatively strong interactions between lanthanum species and the support exist.</p>
<p>As has been observed in XRD and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, more amounts of La species can enter into the ZSM-5 channels and the dealumination of the support can be inhibited when the calcination temperature is less or equal to 650 C. Thus, it is proposed that the location and species of lanthanum cations should be responsible for the increase in the thermal stability.</p>
<p>It is well known that the existence of aluminum can stabilize the Sn species. Combined the TPR results with the catalytic performances, it is deduced that more amounts of tin can exist in oxidative states.</p>
<p>These new sites are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, which result in the higher catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation process.</p>

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by affecting the interactions between lanthanum species, aluminum, and tin. This influences the thermal stability of the support, stabilization of tin species, and the interaction between platinum and tin oxides, leading to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

2. The calcination temperature of lanthanum (La) plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. By inhibiting the dealumination of the support and stabilizing tin species, the presence of La promotes stronger interactions between platinum and tin oxides. This results in a catalyst with optimal activity and stability for PDH, especially when calcined at 650°C.

3. The model for the effects of La calcined treatment on the catalytic performance includes three key aspects: improving the thermal stability of the support, stabilizing tin species, and strengthening the interaction between platinum and tin oxides. These factors contribute to the higher catalytic properties in the PDH process.

4. The calcination temperature of lanthanum affects the total acidity and the interaction between lanthanum species and the support. This leads to the inhibition of dealumination of the support, stabilization of tin species, and the promotion of strong interactions between platinum and tin oxides. The Z650 catalyst, calcined at 650°C, exhibits the best reaction activity and stability, achieving a mean yield of propene of about 34.3% during the course of the reaction for 82 hours.

2. 镧化处理的温度在催化性能中起着关键作用，特别是对于PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂的PDH应用。通过抑制支持体的铝化和稳定锡物种，镧的存在促进了铂和锡氧化物之间更强的相互作用。当在650°C下进行镧的煅烧时，这种催化剂表现出最佳的活性和稳定性。

3. 镧煅烧处理效果模型包含三个关键方面：提高支持体的热稳定性、稳定锡物种以及加强铂和锡氧化物之间的相互作用。这些因素共同导致PDH过程中更高的催化性能。

4. 镧的煅烧温度影响总酸度和镧系元素与支持体之间的相互作用。这导致支持体的抑制铝化、稳定锡物种以及促进铂和锡氧化物之间更强的相互作用。650°C煅烧的Z650催化剂显示出最佳的反应活性和稳定性，在82小时的反应过程中，丙烯的平均产率为约34.3%。

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "However, worthy mention is that on this reported PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst [12] , the promoter of lanthanum was added directly by impregnating the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution, not undergoing the succedent process of calcination."
[3] "When the calcination time was relatively low, the active sites being responsible for the formation of oxygenated products had not been formed, which resulted in the variation in the reaction conversion and selectivity."
[4] "Clearly, this behavior caused by the introduction of La is very different with that of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst [10] in the absence of La."
[5] "In comparison with these, as for the Z700 sample, more severe dealumination is found."
[6] "Therefore, the better catalytic performance might be obtained due to the optical matching between the acid function and the metallic function."
[7] "Furthermore, on HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates."
[8] "This stabilization effect likely reflects the influence of a monotonic decrease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of tin species at the catalyst surface."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is crucial due to the rising demand for propene, making it increasingly significant in industrial applications.
2. In the preparation of the catalyst, the promoter lanthanum was directly incorporated into the support without undergoing calcination, differing from the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst preparation without lanthanum.
3. Low calcination times can lead to fluctuating reaction yields and selectivities, as active sites for oxygenated product formation may not yet be established.
4. The introduction of lanthanum in the catalyst preparation exhibits distinct effects compared to catalysts without lanthanum.
5. More severe dealumination is observed in catalysts subjected to higher calcination temperatures.
6. The optimal performance can be achieved when there is a harmonious balance between the acidic function and the metallic function.
7. Propane dehydrogenation and cracking on HMFI zeolite are thought to occur via carbonium-ion intermediates.
8. The stabilization effect of tin species on the catalyst surface could lead to a decrease in the size of Pt ensembles, resulting in electronic effects that enhance catalytic activity.

3. 较低的煅烧时间可能导致反应转化率和选择性波动，因为负责形成氧化物产物的活性位点可能尚未形成。
4. 镧的引入在催化剂制备中的效果与不含镧的催化剂有明显差异。
5. 更严重的铝流失在更高煅烧温度的催化剂中被发现。
6. 当酸功能和金属功能之间达到最佳匹配时，可以获得更好的催化性能。
7. 在HMFI沸石上，丙烷的脱氢和裂解被认为通过碳离子中间体进行。
8. 锡物种在催化剂表面的稳定化效应可能导致Pt簇的尺寸逐渐减少，从而产生电子效应，增强催化活性。

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites are key factors in improving propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

2. The calcination temperature of lanthanum (La) plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance. After the thermal treatment of La, the catalyst's acidity increases, and the interactions between La species and the support are strengthened. This leads to the suppression of dealumination of the support and stabilization of tin species, resulting in stronger interactions between platinum (Pt) and tin oxides.

3. The calcination of La causes gradual increases in the total acidity of the catalyst and the interaction between La species and the support. This is beneficial for the dehydrogenation process as it enhances the performance of the catalyst.

4. The Z650 catalyst, which was calcined at 650°C, demonstrates the best reaction activity and stability among the tested catalysts. It is capable of maintaining high yields of propylene during the course of the reaction.

5. Increasing the reaction temperature to 610°C benefits the catalytic activity of the Z650 catalyst, further improving its performance in propane dehydrogenation.

6. The calcination of La at a high temperature of 700°C results in a sharp decrease in catalyst acidity due to severe dealumination. This leads to the sintering of Pt particles and the formation of tin(0) species, causing irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.

7. The initial matching between the active sites and acid sites on the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is disrupted by the high calcination temperature of La, leading to the catalyst's irreversible deactivation.
