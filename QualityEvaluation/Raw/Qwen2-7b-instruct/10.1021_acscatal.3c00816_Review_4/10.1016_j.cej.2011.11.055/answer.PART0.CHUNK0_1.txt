[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "However, worthy mention is that on this reported PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst [12] , the promoter of lanthanum was added directly by impregnating the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution, not undergoing the succedent process of calcination."
[3] "When the calcination time was relatively low, the active sites being responsible for the formation of oxygenated products had not been formed, which resulted in the variation in the reaction conversion and selectivity."
[4] "Clearly, this behavior caused by the introduction of La is very different with that of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst [10] in the absence of La."
[5] "In comparison with these, as for the Z700 sample, more severe dealumination is found."
[6] "Therefore, the better catalytic performance might be obtained due to the optical matching between the acid function and the metallic function."
[7] "Furthermore, on HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates."
[8] "This stabilization effect likely reflects the influence of a monotonic decrease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of tin species at the catalyst surface."

1. Propane dehydrogenation is crucial due to the rising demand for propene, making it increasingly significant in industrial applications.
2. In the preparation of the catalyst, the promoter lanthanum was directly incorporated into the support without undergoing calcination, differing from the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst preparation without lanthanum.
3. Low calcination times can lead to fluctuating reaction yields and selectivities, as active sites for oxygenated product formation may not yet be established.
4. The introduction of lanthanum in the catalyst preparation exhibits distinct effects compared to catalysts without lanthanum.
5. More severe dealumination is observed in catalysts subjected to higher calcination temperatures.
6. The optimal performance can be achieved when there is a harmonious balance between the acidic function and the metallic function.
7. Propane dehydrogenation and cracking on HMFI zeolite are thought to occur via carbonium-ion intermediates.
8. The stabilization effect of tin species on the catalyst surface could lead to a decrease in the size of Pt ensembles, resulting in electronic effects that enhance catalytic activity.

1. 烯烃脱氢因其对丙烯需求的增长而变得越来越重要，这使其在工业应用中变得越来越关键。
2. 在催化剂的制备过程中，镧的促进剂是直接通过向载体中添加La(NO3)3水溶液而加入的，没有经过后续的煅烧过程，与没有镧的PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂的制备方法不同。
3. 较低的煅烧时间可能导致反应转化率和选择性波动，因为负责形成氧化物产物的活性位点可能尚未形成。
4. 镧的引入在催化剂制备中的效果与不含镧的催化剂有明显差异。
5. 更严重的铝流失在更高煅烧温度的催化剂中被发现。
6. 当酸功能和金属功能之间达到最佳匹配时，可以获得更好的催化性能。
7. 在HMFI沸石上，丙烷的脱氢和裂解被认为通过碳离子中间体进行。
8. 锡物种在催化剂表面的稳定化效应可能导致Pt簇的尺寸逐渐减少，从而产生电子效应，增强催化活性。
