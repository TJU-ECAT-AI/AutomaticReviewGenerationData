[1] "In our experiments, the thermal treatment is carried out after the impregnation of La."
[2] "The presence of La inhibits the dealumination of the support and also stabilizes the tin species, which result in the strong interaction between Pt and Sn oxides."
[3] "In these cases, the acidity of the catalyst increases gradually and the interaction between La species and support becomes strengthened."
[4] "In our experiments, the Z650 catalyst that calcined at 650 C possesses the best reaction activity and stability."
[5] "Moreover, this treatment is also beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic activity even at higher reaction temperature (610 C)."
[6] "However, when the calcination temperature of La is 700 C, the catalyst acidity decreases sharply due to the relatively severe dealumination."
[7] "At the same time, the sintering of Pt particles is evidenced by the results of TEM."
[8] "In this way, the initial matching between the active sites and acid sites on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is destroyed, which leads to the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites are key factors in improving propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

2. The calcination temperature of lanthanum (La) plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance. After the thermal treatment of La, the catalyst's acidity increases, and the interactions between La species and the support are strengthened. This leads to the suppression of dealumination of the support and stabilization of tin species, resulting in stronger interactions between platinum (Pt) and tin oxides.

3. The calcination of La causes gradual increases in the total acidity of the catalyst and the interaction between La species and the support. This is beneficial for the dehydrogenation process as it enhances the performance of the catalyst.

4. The Z650 catalyst, which was calcined at 650°C, demonstrates the best reaction activity and stability among the tested catalysts. It is capable of maintaining high yields of propylene during the course of the reaction.

5. Increasing the reaction temperature to 610°C benefits the catalytic activity of the Z650 catalyst, further improving its performance in propane dehydrogenation.

6. The calcination of La at a high temperature of 700°C results in a sharp decrease in catalyst acidity due to severe dealumination. This leads to the sintering of Pt particles and the formation of tin(0) species, causing irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.

7. The initial matching between the active sites and acid sites on the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is disrupted by the high calcination temperature of La, leading to the catalyst's irreversible deactivation.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在丙烷脱氢反应中对基于沸石的催化剂性能产生显著影响。BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石是提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素。

2. 钕（La）的煅烧温度对催化性能至关重要。在镧的热处理后，催化剂的酸度逐渐增加，镧物种与支持物之间的相互作用加强。这导致支持物的剥铝抑制和锡物种的稳定化，从而增强了铂（Pt）与锡氧化物之间的相互作用。

3. 煅烧镧会导致催化剂总酸度增加和镧物种与支持物之间相互作用增强。这对脱氢过程有利，因为它提高了催化剂的性能。

4. 在650°C煅烧的Z650催化剂显示了最佳的反应活性和稳定性，在测试的催化剂中。它能够在反应过程中维持高丙烯产量。

5. 将反应温度提高到610°C有利于Z650催化剂的催化活性，进一步提高了其丙烷脱氢性能。

6. 在700°C高温下煅烧La导致催化剂酸度急剧下降，原因是严重的剥铝。这导致铂颗粒的聚集和锡(0)物种的形成，导致催化剂不可逆失活。

7. 高温煅烧La破坏了PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂上活性位点与酸位点的初始匹配，导致催化剂不可逆失活。
