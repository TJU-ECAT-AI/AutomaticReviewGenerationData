[1] "In our experiments, the Z650 catalyst that calcined at 650 C possesses the best reaction activity and stability."
[2] "The mean yield of propene is about 34.3% during the course of the reaction for 82 h."
[3] "Moreover, this treatment is also beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic activity even at higher reaction temperature (610 C)."
[4] "However, when the calcination temperature of La is 700 C, the catalyst acidity decreases sharply due to the relatively severe dealumination."
[5] "At the same time, the sintering of Pt particles is evidenced by the results of TEM."
[6] "In this way, the initial matching between the active sites and acid sites on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is destroyed, which leads to the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the calcination temperature of lanthanum affects the catalyst's acidity, the interaction between lanthanum species and the support, and the stabilization of tin species.
2. The Z650 catalyst, calcined at 650°C, exhibits the best reaction activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.
3. The mean yield of propene is approximately 34.3% during the 82-hour course of the reaction.
4. The catalyst's performance is enhanced even at higher reaction temperatures (610°C) due to the calcination treatment.
5. The calcination temperature of lanthanum has a significant impact on the catalyst's acidity. At 700°C, the acidity sharply decreases due to severe dealumination.
6. The sintering of platinum particles and the formation of tin0 species occur at high calcination temperatures, leading to irreversible catalyst deactivation.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构影响各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。具体来说，镧的煅烧温度影响催化剂的酸性、镧物种与支持物之间的相互作用以及锡物种的稳定化。
2. 在650°C下煅烧的Z650催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出最佳的反应活性和稳定性。
3. 反应过程中82小时的平均丙烯产率为约34.3%。
4. 即使在较高反应温度（610°C）下，由于煅烧处理，催化剂性能也得到增强。
5. 镧的煅烧温度对催化剂的酸性有显著影响。在700°C时，由于严重的铝流失，酸性急剧下降。
6. 在高煅烧温度下，铂颗粒的聚集和锡0物种的形成发生，导致催化剂不可逆失活。
