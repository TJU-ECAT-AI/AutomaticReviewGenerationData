[1] "In our experiments, the catalyst calcined at 650 C showed the best reaction activity and stability."
[2] "However, with the continuous increase of calcined temperature, the dehydrogenation activity decreases sharply."
[3] "The mean yield of propene is about 34.3% during the course of the reaction for 82 h."
[4] "The Z650 catalyst that calcined at 650 C possesses the best reaction activity and stability."
[5] "Moreover, this treatment is also beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic activity even at higher reaction temperature (610 C)."
[6] "However, when the calcination temperature of La is 700 C, the catalyst acidity decreases sharply due to the relatively severe dealumination."
[7] "At the same time, the sintering of Pt particles is evidenced by the results of TEM."
