<p>In our experiments, the thermal treatment is carried out after the impregnation of La. In this way, relatively strong interactions between lanthanum species and the support exist.</p>
<p>As has been observed in XRD and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, more amounts of La species can enter into the ZSM-5 channels and the dealumination of the support can be inhibited when the calcination temperature is less or equal to 650 C. Thus, it is proposed that the location and species of lanthanum cations should be responsible for the increase in the thermal stability.</p>
<p>It is well known that the existence of aluminum can stabilize the Sn species. Combined the TPR results with the catalytic performances, it is deduced that more amounts of tin can exist in oxidative states.</p>
<p>These new sites are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, which result in the higher catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation process.</p>

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by affecting the interactions between lanthanum species, aluminum, and tin. This influences the thermal stability of the support, stabilization of tin species, and the interaction between platinum and tin oxides, leading to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

2. The calcination temperature of lanthanum (La) plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. By inhibiting the dealumination of the support and stabilizing tin species, the presence of La promotes stronger interactions between platinum and tin oxides. This results in a catalyst with optimal activity and stability for PDH, especially when calcined at 650°C.

3. The model for the effects of La calcined treatment on the catalytic performance includes three key aspects: improving the thermal stability of the support, stabilizing tin species, and strengthening the interaction between platinum and tin oxides. These factors contribute to the higher catalytic properties in the PDH process.

4. The calcination temperature of lanthanum affects the total acidity and the interaction between lanthanum species and the support. This leads to the inhibition of dealumination of the support, stabilization of tin species, and the promotion of strong interactions between platinum and tin oxides. The Z650 catalyst, calcined at 650°C, exhibits the best reaction activity and stability, achieving a mean yield of propene of about 34.3% during the course of the reaction for 82 hours.
