[1] "High-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments result in the growth of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the approximate size range of 1 to 2nm."
[2] "The stability and catalytic activity of encapsulated Pt species is also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "The unique catalytic properties of metal clusters have attracted great attention because they have a behaviour that is distinct from metal nanoparticles (NPs) and mononuclear metal compounds1,2."
[4] "Loading atomically dispersed metal species on solid supports can be a method to improve their stability3,4."
[5] "By conventional methods (such as wet impregnation and ion exchange), the location of metal species cannot always be controlled, and metal NPs will usually be formed after the post-treatment."
[6] "In the case of the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample prepared by the impregnation method, most of Pt NPs (1  5nm) should be located only at the external surface."
[7] "The results given in Fig. 4a show a higher activity of Pt@MCM-22 than Pt/MCM-22-imp."
[8] "Indeed, due to the molecular sieving effect of 10-MR windows in MCM-22, isobutene is mainly accessible to Pt species located at the external cups on the surface of MCM-22, while it should not be accessible to Pt atoms and clusters encapsulated in the cavities inside MCM-22."
[9] "In the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample, oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C lead to continuous growth of Pt NPs."
[10] "However, it is important to take into account that, due to the lower melting and boiling point of Pt nanoclusters, subnanometric Pt species can be mobile during the high-temperature treatments, especially for those Pt species located on the external surface38,39,40."

[1] "High-temperature stability of Pt@MCM-22 The exceptional stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated by performing oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C. Under such harsh conditions, small Pt NPs with sizes of approximately 1nm can be found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of oxidation-reduction treatment at 650C (see Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 14). Those individual Pt atoms and small Pt clusters with a few atoms located in the internal space of the MCM-22 crystallites have mostly aggregated to larger Pt clusters or small Pt NPs (in the range of 1 to 2nm)."
[2] "Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperature41. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C."

1. The exceptional stability of subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 was demonstrated through high-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C. After one cycle of such treatment, small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm were found in Pt@MCM-22. Individual Pt atoms and small Pt clusters within the MCM-22 crystallites aggregated to larger Pt clusters or small Pt nanoparticles (around 1 to 2nm).

2. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst showed higher activity than the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane at 550°C. This suggests that the Pt@MCM-22 system maintains its catalytic performance even under high-temperature conditions, facilitating the activation of alkanes and requiring less frequent regeneration cycles compared to the conventional impregnation method.

3. The dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is crucial for alkane activation, and catalytic processes often necessitate frequent regeneration cycles at high temperatures. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst demonstrated superior activity compared to the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst at 550°C, indicating its potential for efficient alkane dehydrogenation.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The BEA topology of the MCM-22 zeolite provides a highly ordered pore structure, enabling efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) component in the MCM-22 zeolite contributes to the high stability and resistance to sintering of the catalyst. The encapsulation of Pt species within the zeolite cavities ensures their high dispersion and stability, which enhances propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the precise control of Pt atomicity, the stabilization of Pt clusters within the zeolite framework, and the optimization of the zeolite pore size and shape to match the molecular size of the reactants and products. This allows for effective size-selective catalysis, where propylene is preferentially produced from propane, while maintaining high conversion rates. Additionally, the exceptional thermal stability of the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst enables it to retain its activity and selectivity even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperatures, making it suitable for PDH reactions under industrially relevant conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对基于沸石的催化剂性能产生了重大影响。MCM-22沸石的BEA拓扑结构提供了高度有序的孔结构，能够有效促进反应物和产物的扩散。SAPO组分在MCM-22沸石中的存在增强了催化剂的高稳定性和抗聚集性。将Pt物种封装在沸石空腔内确保了其高分散性和稳定性，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和转化率。改进性能的关键因素包括精确控制Pt原子性、在沸石骨架中稳定Pt簇的能力以及优化沸石孔尺寸和形状以匹配反应物和产物的分子大小。这使得沸石具有有效的尺寸选择性催化作用，能够优先产生丙烯，同时保持高的转化率。此外，Pt@MCM-22催化剂的卓越热稳定性使其即使在高温下多次反应再生循环后仍能保持其活性和选择性，适用于工业相关条件下的PDH反应。

1. The high-temperature process (540°C for 4 hours) used for removal of the organic template in the synthesis of Pt@MCM-22 ensures the subnanometric Pt species exhibit excellent thermal stability in air, enhancing their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

2. The impregnation method, commonly used for Pt/MCM-22-imp, results in most Pt nanoparticles being located only at the external surface, limiting their accessibility and catalytic efficiency in PDH reactions.

3. The molecular sieving effect of MCM-22's 10-MR windows enables efficient diffusion of reactants like propylene and isobutene, allowing for better interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

4. Oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C result in the growth of Pt NPs in Pt@MCM-22, while encapsulated Pt clusters with more than five atoms remain stable, thanks to their confinement within the zeolite's cups and supercages.

5. The encapsulation of Pt species within the MCM-22 zeolite's cavities ensures that some Pt clusters are protected from aggregation, maintaining their catalytic activity even after multiple high-temperature treatments.

6. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst demonstrates superior stability and activity compared to Pt/MCM-22-imp during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, retaining 90% of its initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, whereas the impregnated catalyst loses over 40% of its activity.
