[1] "High-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments result in the growth of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the approximate size range of 1 to 2nm."
[2] "The stability and catalytic activity of encapsulated Pt species is also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[3] "The unique catalytic properties of metal clusters have attracted great attention because they have a behaviour that is distinct from metal nanoparticles (NPs) and mononuclear metal compounds1,2."
[4] "Loading atomically dispersed metal species on solid supports can be a method to improve their stability3,4."
[5] "By conventional methods (such as wet impregnation and ion exchange), the location of metal species cannot always be controlled, and metal NPs will usually be formed after the post-treatment."
[6] "In the case of the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample prepared by the impregnation method, most of Pt NPs (1  5nm) should be located only at the external surface."
[7] "The results given in Fig. 4a show a higher activity of Pt@MCM-22 than Pt/MCM-22-imp."
[8] "Indeed, due to the molecular sieving effect of 10-MR windows in MCM-22, isobutene is mainly accessible to Pt species located at the external cups on the surface of MCM-22, while it should not be accessible to Pt atoms and clusters encapsulated in the cavities inside MCM-22."
[9] "In the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample, oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C lead to continuous growth of Pt NPs."
[10] "However, it is important to take into account that, due to the lower melting and boiling point of Pt nanoclusters, subnanometric Pt species can be mobile during the high-temperature treatments, especially for those Pt species located on the external surface38,39,40."

1. The encapsulated Pt species show high stability during high-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments, growing into nanoparticles around 1 to 2nm in size. This stability is reflected in the efficient dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. Metal clusters demonstrate unique catalytic properties that distinguish them from metal nanoparticles and mononuclear metal compounds, often leading to enhanced activity.
3. Loading metal species on solid supports, particularly through methods like impregnation, can enhance their stability.
4. Conventional methods for loading metal species, such as wet impregnation, typically result in the formation of metal nanoparticles after post-treatment.
5. The Pt/MCM-22-imp sample, prepared via impregnation, has most of the Pt nanoparticles located at the external surface of the MCM-22 material.
6. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst shows significantly higher activity than the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst in hydrogenation reactions, indicating the superior catalytic performance of encapsulated Pt species.
7. The molecular sieving effect of the 10-MR windows in MCM-22 selectively enables the access of isobutene to Pt species located at the external surface, rather than those encapsulated within the material.
8. In the impregnation method-prepared Pt/MCM-22-imp sample, Pt nanoparticles continuously grow during oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C.
9. During high-temperature treatments, subnanometric Pt species within the Pt@MCM-22 sample remain stable, whereas Pt nanoparticles experience continuous growth in the impregnation-prepared Pt/MCM-22-imp sample.
10. The mobility of Pt nanoclusters during high-temperature treatments, particularly those on the external surface, contributes to their continuous growth, contrasting with the stability of encapsulated Pt species within the zeolite material.
