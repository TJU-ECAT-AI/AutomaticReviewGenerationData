[1] "In this work, we present a new strategy for the preparation of zeolite-confined subnanometric Pt species (single Pt atoms and Pt clusters) catalysts with high stability during transformation of a two-dimensional (2D) into three-dimensional (3D) zeolite."
[2] "As the starting material, we choose a pure siliceous layered precursor of MCM-22 (MWW-type zeolite)15 with the idea that, during the condensation of the layered zeolite precursor, the hemi-cages (cups) and cageswith internal dimensions of 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8nm, respectivelywould entrap the subnanometric Pt species."
[3] "These subnanometric Pt species are stabilized by MCM-22, even after treatment in air up to 540C."
[4] "Furthermore, these stable Pt species confined within internal framework cavities show size-selective catalysis for the hydrogenation of alkenes."
[5] "High-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments result in the growth of encapsulated Pt species to small nanoparticles in the approximate size range of 1 to 2nm."
[6] "In the case of the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample prepared by the impregnation method, most of Pt NPs (1  5nm) should be located only at the external surface."
[7] "Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane."
[8] "Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperature41."
[9] "Moreover, after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

1. A new strategy was presented for generating subnanometric platinum species (single atoms and clusters) confined within three-dimensional zeolite structures, particularly in the MCM-22 zeolite. These species showed exceptional stability during the transformation of a two-dimensional zeolite into a three-dimensional structure.

2. The pure siliceous layered precursor of MCM-22 was chosen as the starting material for the generation of subnanometric Pt species. The hemi-cages and cages within MCM-22 have internal dimensions of 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8nm, respectively, which were expected to trap the subnanometric Pt species during the condensation of the layered zeolite precursor.

3. The subnanometric Pt species generated within MCM-22 remained stable even after treatment in air up to 540°C. They exhibited size-selective catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of alkenes.

4. High-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments led to the growth of encapsulated Pt species into small nanoparticles with sizes ranging from approximately 1 to 2nm.

5. In contrast to the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample prepared by the impregnation method, where most Pt nanoparticles (1 to 5nm) were located at the external surface of the zeolite.

6. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst was tested for its activity in the dehydrogenation of propane, showing higher stability and activity compared to the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst after undergoing reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperatures.

7. The Pt@MCM-22 sample retained 90% of its initial activity after five cycles of reaction-regeneration at 550°C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, while the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst lost more than 40% of its initial activity under the same conditions.

1. 我们提出了一种新的策略，用于在三维沸石结构中生成受限于二维到三维转换的亚纳米铂物种（单原子和簇）。这些物种在转化过程中表现出极高的稳定性。

2. 选择纯硅层状前体MCM-22作为生成亚纳米Pt物种的起始材料。MCM-22中的半笼和笼具有0.7nm和0.7×1.8nm的内部尺寸，预期在层状沸石前体的凝结过程中捕获亚纳米Pt物种。

3. 在MCM-22中生成的亚纳米Pt物种即使在空气中处理至540°C也能保持稳定。它们对氢化烯烃显示出大小选择性的催化活性。

4. 高温氧化还原处理导致封装的Pt物种生长成大小约为1到2nm的小纳米颗粒。

5. 相比通过浸渍法制备的Pt/MCM-22-imp样品，其中大多数Pt纳米粒子（1到5nm）仅位于沸石表面。

6. 对于丙烷脱氢反应，测试了Pt@MCM-22催化剂的活性，结果显示与使用相同条件的Pt/MCM-22-imp催化剂相比，其稳定性更高且活性更强。

7. 在550°C下进行五次反应再生循环期间，丙烷脱氢反应后，Pt@MCM-22样本保留了初始活动的90%，而Pt/MCM-22-imp催化剂的初始活动损失超过40%。
