The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The BEA topology of the MCM-22 zeolite provides a highly ordered pore structure, enabling efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) component in the MCM-22 zeolite contributes to the high stability and resistance to sintering of the catalyst. The encapsulation of Pt species within the zeolite cavities ensures their high dispersion and stability, which enhances propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The key factors contributing to improved performance include the precise control of Pt atomicity, the stabilization of Pt clusters within the zeolite framework, and the optimization of the zeolite pore size and shape to match the molecular size of the reactants and products. This allows for effective size-selective catalysis, where propylene is preferentially produced from propane, while maintaining high conversion rates. Additionally, the exceptional thermal stability of the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst enables it to retain its activity and selectivity even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperatures, making it suitable for PDH reactions under industrially relevant conditions.
