[1] "High-temperature stability of Pt@MCM-22 The exceptional stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated by performing oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C. Under such harsh conditions, small Pt NPs with sizes of approximately 1nm can be found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of oxidation-reduction treatment at 650C (see Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 14). Those individual Pt atoms and small Pt clusters with a few atoms located in the internal space of the MCM-22 crystallites have mostly aggregated to larger Pt clusters or small Pt NPs (in the range of 1 to 2nm)."
[2] "Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperature41. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C."

1. The exceptional stability of subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 was demonstrated through high-temperature oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C. After one cycle of such treatment, small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm were found in Pt@MCM-22. Individual Pt atoms and small Pt clusters within the MCM-22 crystallites aggregated to larger Pt clusters or small Pt nanoparticles (around 1 to 2nm).

2. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst showed higher activity than the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane at 550°C. This suggests that the Pt@MCM-22 system maintains its catalytic performance even under high-temperature conditions, facilitating the activation of alkanes and requiring less frequent regeneration cycles compared to the conventional impregnation method.

3. The dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is crucial for alkane activation, and catalytic processes often necessitate frequent regeneration cycles at high temperatures. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst demonstrated superior activity compared to the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst at 550°C, indicating its potential for efficient alkane dehydrogenation.

1. 在650°C的高温氧化还原处理下，Pt@MCM-22中亚纳米级铂物种的非凡稳定性得到了证明。在一次这样的处理后，在Pt@MCM-22中发现了大小约为1nm的小铂纳米颗粒。位于MCM-22结晶体内部空间的单个铂原子和小型铂簇聚集成了较大的铂簇或小铂纳米颗粒（范围在1到2nm之间）。

2. Pt@MCM-22催化剂在550°C时表现出比Pt/MCM-22-imp催化剂更高的丙烷脱氢活性。这表明，与传统的浸渍方法相比，Pt@MCM-22系统在高温条件下保持其催化性能的能力更强，有助于烷烃的激活并需要较少的再生周期。

3. 对短烷烃分子的脱氢是激活烷烃的关键，而催化过程往往需要在高温下进行频繁的再生循环。与Pt/MCM-22-imp催化剂相比，Pt@MCM-22催化剂在550°C时表现出更高的活性，这表明它在有效脱氢烷烃方面具有潜力。
