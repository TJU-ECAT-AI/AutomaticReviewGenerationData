<p>However, the preparation procedure of Pt@MCM-22 includes a high-temperature process (540C for 4h) for removal of the organic template, it appears that subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 show excellent thermal stability in air.</p>
<p>In the case of the Pt/MCM-22-imp sample prepared by the impregnation method, most of Pt NPs (1  5nm) should be located only at the external surface.</p>
<p>Notice that H2 can diffuse through the 10-MR window that communicates between the supercavities in which a portion of the Pt species are encapsulated.</p>
<p>Under such harsh conditions, small Pt NPs with sizes of approximately 1nm can be found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of oxidation-reduction treatment at 650C.</p>
<p>In the case of Pt clusters with more than five atoms, they should be more stable because they are captured by the cups and supercages of MCM-22.</p>
<p>Indeed, due to the molecular sieving effect of 10-MR windows in MCM-22, isobutene is mainly accessible to Pt species located at the external cups on the surface of MCM-22, while it should not be accessible to Pt atoms and clusters encapsulated in the cavities inside MCM-22.</p>
<p>Checking by STEM, we have observed some Pt clusters below 1nm while few Pt individual atoms can be found on in the Pt@MCM-22-1cycle sample.</p>
<p>With further cycles of oxidation-reduction treatments, Pt clusters will continue to grow larger, as presented in Fig. 5bd.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, their size distributions (Fig. 5fh) show that most of the small Pt NPs are still below 2nm, indicating the high stability of encapsulated Pt species in MCM-22 crystallites during the very extreme oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C.</p>
<p>Moreover, after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity.</p>

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. The high-temperature process (540°C for 4 hours) used for removal of the organic template in the synthesis of Pt@MCM-22 ensures the subnanometric Pt species exhibit excellent thermal stability in air, enhancing their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

2. The impregnation method, commonly used for Pt/MCM-22-imp, results in most Pt nanoparticles being located only at the external surface, limiting their accessibility and catalytic efficiency in PDH reactions.

3. The molecular sieving effect of MCM-22's 10-MR windows enables efficient diffusion of reactants like propylene and isobutene, allowing for better interaction with the catalyst's active sites.

4. Oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C result in the growth of Pt NPs in Pt@MCM-22, while encapsulated Pt clusters with more than five atoms remain stable, thanks to their confinement within the zeolite's cups and supercages.

5. The encapsulation of Pt species within the MCM-22 zeolite's cavities ensures that some Pt clusters are protected from aggregation, maintaining their catalytic activity even after multiple high-temperature treatments.

6. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst demonstrates superior stability and activity compared to Pt/MCM-22-imp during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, retaining 90% of its initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, whereas the impregnated catalyst loses over 40% of its activity.

准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能产生了重大影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 在合成Pt@MCM-22时采用的540°C 4小时高温过程，确保了纳米级别的铂物种在空气中具有出色的热稳定性，从而增强了其在PDH反应中的有效性。

2. 常规浸渍法用于制备Pt/MCM-22-imp，导致大部分铂纳米颗粒仅位于表面，限制了它们在PDH反应中的可接近性和催化效率。

3. MCM-22的10-MR窗口的分子筛效应使丙烯和异丁烯等反应物能够高效扩散，从而更好地与催化剂的活性位点相互作用。

4. 在650°C进行的氧化还原处理导致Pt@MCM-22中的Pt纳米颗粒生长，而封装在MCM-22晶胞中的Pt簇（超过五个原子）保持稳定，这归因于它们被包含在沸石的杯子和超笼中。

5. 封装在MCM-22晶胞中的Pt物种确保了一些Pt簇免受聚集的影响，即使在极端高温处理下，其催化活性也能得到保持。

6.Pt@MCM-22催化剂在550°C进行五次反应再生循环期间，丙烷脱氢表现出优越的稳定性和活性，保留了初始活动的90%，而常规浸渍催化剂的活性损失超过了40%。
