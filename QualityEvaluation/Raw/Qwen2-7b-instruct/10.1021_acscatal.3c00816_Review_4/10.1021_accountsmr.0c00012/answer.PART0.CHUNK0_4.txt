1. The challenges in preparing NCs under structure control stem from their thermodynamical metastability. Researchers have shown interest in regulating material structure and reaction performance at the molecular and atomic levels in recent years.

2. The study focuses on providing foundational knowledge for designing NCs specifically for PDH reactions.

3. In the case of propane dehydrogenation, the structure sensitivity of CC cleavage can be mitigated by dispersing Pt atoms geometrically. This prevents further unwanted dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Disordered PtCu alloys demonstrated higher propylene selectivity and lower deactivation rates compared to pure Pt. However, their Pt atom distribution is limited due to disorder.

5. Ordered intermetallic alloys (IMAs) offer an advantage by dispersing active sites into isolated atoms, thus enhancing thermal stability compared to single-atom alloys.

6. Incorporating TiO2 onto Al2O3 supports can increase the electron density of Pt, resulting in improved propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.

7. Reductive treatment of oxides leads to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated M cations in MO sites, which facilitates efficient CH bond activation.

8. The TOF for the a-PtSn/ND@G catalyst is notably higher than that of Pt3Sn/Al2O3 and Pt/ND@G, showcasing the benefits of using nanocarbon supports.

9. By adding small quantities of hydrogenation-active metal promoters, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2-based catalysts can be increased, promoting CH bond dissociation.
