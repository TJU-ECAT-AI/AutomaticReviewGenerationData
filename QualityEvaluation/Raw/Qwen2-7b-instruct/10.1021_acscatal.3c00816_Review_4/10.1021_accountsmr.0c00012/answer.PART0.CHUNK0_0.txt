<p>As an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.</p>
<p>This paper is aimed at delivering general fundamentals for rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. We start with the catalytic kinetics on the active sites regarding the adsorption of key propyl intermediates on the surface. In subsequent sections, we present the effective regulation strategies for metal and oxide NCs by promoter and support effects.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than CrOx-based catalysts. However, Pt suffers from deactivation of sintering and coking. Meanwhile, the high cost of Pt-based catalysts attracts us to rationally design Pt nanostructures and develop alternatives, such as VOx-, GaOx-, ZrO2-based oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>Theoretical analysis has shown that the geometrically dispersed and electron-rich Pt sites exhibited higher propylene selectivity. A bottom-up regulation approach was proposed by alloying/dealloying with promoters and/or anchoring on the specific supports to enhance the dispersion, and at the meantime, tailoring the electronic states by electron redistribution and/or transfer.</p>
<p>For supported VOx-based catalysts, it is proposed that VOS (support) bonds are active sites. Considering the unique properties of VOx/MO systems, consisting of isolated and/or polymeric nanostructures that wet the supporting MO, we constructed the submonolayer and/or monolayer VOx nanoclusters on Al2O3 and ZrO2.</p>

1. PDH is an endothermic process that necessitates high temperatures (typically above 500°C), which can limit the selectivity of propylene and the stability of catalyst structures due to side reactions like coking and particle sintering.

2. The paper aims to provide foundational knowledge for the rational design of nanostructured catalysts in PDH reactions. It begins with the kinetic study of active sites related to the adsorption of key propyl intermediates on the surface.

3. Platinum-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than chromium oxide-based catalysts. However, they suffer from sintering and coking deactivation, leading to the exploration of more cost-effective alternatives like vanadium oxide, gallium oxide, and zirconium oxide catalysts.

4. A bottom-up approach is suggested for the regulation of dispersion and electronic states by alloying or dealloying with promoters and anchoring on specific supports, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

5. VOx-based catalysts propose that VOS bonds act as active sites. The catalysts' unique properties consist of isolated and/or polymeric nanostructures that wet the supporting MO, facilitating the construction of submonolayer and/or monolayer VOx nanoclusters on substrates like Al2O3 and ZrO2.

1.PDH是一个需要高温（通常在500°C以上）的强吸热过程，由于副反应如结焦和颗粒烧结，这会限制丙烯的选择性和催化剂结构稳定性。

2.本文旨在提供PDH反应中纳米结构催化剂设计的基本原理。它从活性位点的相关表面吸附研究活性位点的催化动力学开始。

3.铂基催化剂比铬酸盐基催化剂更环保。然而，它们受到烧结和结焦导致的活性丧失，导致探索成本更低的替代品，如二氧化钒、氧化镓和二氧化锆基氧化物催化剂。

4.通过合金化或去合金化与促进剂和特定支持物的锚定，提出了一个自下而上的方法来调节分散性和电子状态，增强催化剂性能。

5.Vox基催化剂提出VOS键作为活性位点。催化剂的独特性质包括孤立的和/或聚合纳米结构，这些结构浸湿支撑MO，促进了在Al2O3和ZrO2等基质上构建亚单层和/或单层Vox纳米簇。
