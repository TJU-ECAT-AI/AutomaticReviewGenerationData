<p>As an intensively endothermic process, PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth.</p>
<p>This paper is aimed at delivering general fundamentals for rational design of NCs in PDH reactions. We start with the catalytic kinetics on the active sites regarding the adsorption of key propyl intermediates on the surface. In subsequent sections, we present the effective regulation strategies for metal and oxide NCs by promoter and support effects.</p>
<p>Comparatively, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than CrOx-based catalysts. However, Pt suffers from deactivation of sintering and coking. Meanwhile, the high cost of Pt-based catalysts attracts us to rationally design Pt nanostructures and develop alternatives, such as VOx-, GaOx-, ZrO2-based oxide catalysts.</p>
<p>Theoretical analysis has shown that the geometrically dispersed and electron-rich Pt sites exhibited higher propylene selectivity. A bottom-up regulation approach was proposed by alloying/dealloying with promoters and/or anchoring on the specific supports to enhance the dispersion, and at the meantime, tailoring the electronic states by electron redistribution and/or transfer.</p>
<p>For supported VOx-based catalysts, it is proposed that VOS (support) bonds are active sites. Considering the unique properties of VOx/MO systems, consisting of isolated and/or polymeric nanostructures that wet the supporting MO, we constructed the submonolayer and/or monolayer VOx nanoclusters on Al2O3 and ZrO2.</p>

### How do the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, and what are the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability?

1. **Nanostructured Catalysts and Their Regulation**: The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles in enhancing the performance of catalysts in PDH reactions. The key factors include the controllable regulation of metal and oxide nanostructures (NCs), which allows for the optimization of the geometric and electronic properties of the active sites. This optimization leads to higher propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and stability against deactivation.

2. **Promoter Effects**: The use of promoters can enhance dispersion and tailor the electronic states of the catalyst surface, thereby improving propylene selectivity and stability. This is achieved through alloying/dealloying and anchoring the catalysts on specific supports.

3. **Core-shell Nanostructures**: Core-shell nanostructures effectively reduce the usage of noble metals by incorporating transition metals in the core and noble metals in the shell. This design enhances electron properties and promotes propylene selectivity.

4. **Zeolite Topology and Active Sites**: Zeolites, especially those with BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate structures, offer a unique framework for the confinement of metal species. This confinement leads to the formation of submonolayer and monolayer active sites, which significantly improves the dehydrogenation activity. The topology facilitates the wetting of metal species, creating active sites that are isolated or polymeric, enhancing the catalytic performance.

5. **Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC)**: SOMC methods enable the creation of well-defined surface species with isolated OH sites on supports. This approach leads to the development of single-site metal oxides (MOx) that exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. The isolation of active sites through SOMC provides a pathway for improving catalyst performance.
