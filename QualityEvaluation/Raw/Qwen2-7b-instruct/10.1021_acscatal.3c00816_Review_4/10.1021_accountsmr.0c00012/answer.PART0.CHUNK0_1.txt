1. The CH bond cleavage of propane can be categorized into α-type and β-type, generating 1-propyl and 2-propyl species respectively. The initial CH activation plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

2. The catalyst design strategy aims to balance geometric and electronic properties, transitioning from pure phases to disordered, ordered, subsurface, and single-atom alloys, optimizing for maximum atomic utilization. This approach enhances the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and antideactivation capacity.

3. Hydroxyl groups introduced onto the VOx surface significantly boost propylene selectivity and reduce deactivation rates. This modification enhances the catalyst's performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

4. VOS bonds on the support are identified as active sites, contributing to the efficiency of the catalysts in PDH reactions.

5. This account highlights significant advancements in controlling the structure of metal- and oxide-based nanocatalysts for efficient propane dehydrogenation. The focus is on understanding the properties and mechanisms involved in these reactions.
