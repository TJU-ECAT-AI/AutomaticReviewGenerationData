SAPO-34 supported PtSn-based novel catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34.
The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions.
The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34.
In this work, the novel weak acidic support SAPO-34 (almost inert to dehydrogenation), with good shape selective opportunities was experimentally investigated in order to improve propylene selectivity from direct propane dehydrogenation.
A SAPO-34 supported novel PtSn-based catalyst was proposed for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
In contrast, PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst results were compared under identical conditions to provide comprehensive information in understanding roles of the catalyst support.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The use of SAPO-34 as a support for the PtSn-based catalyst enhances propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Key factors contributing to these improvements include the larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity of SAPO-34. Compared to ZSM-5, SAPO-34 is almost inert to dehydrogenation and provides better shape selectivity, allowing for the exclusive formation of propylene. The novel weak acidic support of SAPO-34 enables efficient conversion of reaction intermediates to propylene, leading to superior catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation processes.

在丙烷脱氢反应中，各种沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和拓扑结构对性能有很大影响。使用SAPO-34作为PtSn基催化剂的支持物可以提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。促进这些改进的关键因素包括SAPO-34的大表面积、形状选择性和适宜的酸性。与ZSM-5相比，SAPO-34几乎不参与脱氢反应，并提供了更好的形状选择性，仅允许丙烯形成。SAPO-34的弱酸性支持能够高效地将反应中间体转化为丙烯，从而在丙烷脱氢过程中获得优越的催化性能。
