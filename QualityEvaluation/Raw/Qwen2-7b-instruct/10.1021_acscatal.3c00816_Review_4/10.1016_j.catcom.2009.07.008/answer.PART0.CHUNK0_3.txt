<p>The selection of Sn as a promoter has been explained in terms of geometric and/or electronic effects. In the geometric effect, Sn decreases the size of platinum ensembles, which reduces hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Sn also modifies the electronic density of Pt, either by positive charge transfer from the Snn+ species or the different electronic structures in PtSn alloys.</p>
<p>However, the mechanistic understanding is still controversial and the reaction results were not conclusive, especially on stability and selectivity.</p>
<p>In this work, the novel weak acidic support SAPO-34 (almost inert to dehydrogenation), with good shape selective opportunities was experimentally investigated in order to improve propylene selectivity from direct propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene.</p>
<p>A SAPO-34 supported novel PtSn-based catalyst was proposed for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. However, no study to date has been focused on PtSn-based catalysts intensification using SAPO-34 as support that demonstrates superior propylene yield and selectivity.</p>
<p>The performances of PtSn-based catalysts for selective propane dehydrogenation using both SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 zeolites as the carrier were tested under identical conditions, and results are shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>SAPO-34 was almost inert for dehydrogenation as the conversion was less than 3.5%. The PtSn/ZSM-5 showed a higher dehydrogenation rate but lower propylene selectivity i.e. about 40 wt.%.</p>
<p>SAPO-34 itself is active for dehydrogenation due to higher surface acidity while SAPO-34 shows negligible conversion.</p>
<p>The intensity of the corresponding peaks at angle 2θ = 810 decreased much with Sn loading, indicating that the addition of Sn affected the crystallinity of the SAPO-34 zeolite.</p>
<p>The intensities of the corresponding bands associated with chemisorbed ammonia were decreased, when desorption takes place at 100 C, in contrast to original SAPO-34 zeolite.</p>
<p>The TPR profiles of all samples were shown in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>The H2 reduction results of PtSn/SAPO-34 displayed wide reduction peak between 360 and 540 C that confirmed the joint reduction and valuable interaction between Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34.</p>
<p>The TEM image of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst was shown in Fig. 7.</p>
<p>On a Pt-based SAPO-34 supported catalyst, propane dehydrogenation proceeds by hydrogen abstraction on metallic sites in which a propoxy species (ZOC3H7) was formed.</p>
<p>The intrinsic rates of dehydrogenation and olefin desorption were on the same order of magnitude.</p>
<p>SAPO-34 was better in accommodating coke and stabilize catalyst than ZSM-5.</p>

<p>Only one hydrogen attached to a β-carbon in propane was available for attack by Pt, to form the propoxy species (ZOC3H7).</p>
<p>These propoxy species were selectivity converted to propylene over SAPO-34.</p>

1. The choice of tin (Sn) as a promoter is attributed to its geometric and electronic effects. Geometrically, Sn reduces the size of platinum clusters, decreasing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. Electronically, Sn alters the electron density of platinum, either through positive charge transfer or by creating different electronic structures in PtSn alloys.

2. The mechanistic understanding of the reaction remains uncertain, with inconsistent outcomes, particularly concerning stability and selectivity.

3. The study investigates a novel weak acidic support, SAPO-34, to enhance propylene selectivity in direct propane dehydrogenation. SAPO-34 is a microporous chabasite-like structure (CHA) zeolite with excellent shape selectivity for propylene.
