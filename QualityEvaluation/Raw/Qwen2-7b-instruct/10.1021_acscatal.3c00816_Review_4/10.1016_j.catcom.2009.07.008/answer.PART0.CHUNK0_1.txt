[1] "However, the reaction of direct propane dehydrogenation is highly endothermic ( = 125 kJ/mol of extracted hydrogen) requiring a relatively high temperature and lower pressure."
[2] "On the other hand, propane is a low cost raw material and easily available."
[3] "Therefore we can infer that the dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends on the interactions between the Pt and Sn species as well as the support."
[4] "The Sn as a promoter helps in dispersing Pt metal and largely suppresses coke forming reactions, therefore significantly improves catalytic performance."
[5] "Moreover it was observed that the performance of propane dehydrogenation reaction significantly dependent on support."
[6] "This study has aimed to examine the performances of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst in a microreactor and its detailed characterization in order to justify SAPO-34 superiority as a support."
[7] "In contrast, PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst results were compared under identical conditions to provide comprehensive information in understanding roles of the catalyst support."
[8] "The different effect of SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 as the support of PtSn-based catalysts on the propane dehydrogenation reaction can be shown using the olefins performance envelop (OPE)."
[9] "The higher conversion of ZSM-5 catalyst is due to its contribution towards cracking."
[10] "The amount of coke formed over PtSn-based ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts (of similar contents), under identical operating conditions (8 h operation) were 0.7 and 0.4 wt.% respectively."
[11] "The detailed product distribution over PtSn/SAPO-34 was shown in Table 2."
[12] "Previously, attempts have been given to improve the catalyst performance by varying metallic contents."
[13] "The intensities of the corresponding peaks at angle 2θ = 810 decreased much with Sn loading, indicating that the addition of Sn affected the crystallinity of the SAPO-34 zeolite."
[14] "The decrease in strong acid sites was expected because the Pt consumed some of the Bronsted acid sites on SAPO-34."
[15] "The formation of the PtSn alloy results permanent deactivation."
[16] "The final step is propylene desorption. The intrinsic rates of dehydrogenation and olefin desorption were on the same order of magnitude."
[17] "The intrinsic rates of dehydrogenation and olefin desorption were on the same order of magnitude."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts (particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites) in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. **Metallic Content**: The use of PtSn-based catalysts with Sn as a promoter helps in dispersing Pt metal, suppressing coke forming reactions, and improving catalytic performance.

2. **Zeolite Support Topology**: SAPO-34 zeolite, with its BEA topology, offers a weak acidic environment that selectively converts propyl cation to propylene, provides shape selectivity allowing only propylene to form, and is almost inert to dehydrogenation and cracking.

3. **Metal Loading**: Metal doping during catalyst preparation does not destroy the structural topology of SAPO-34, ensuring the integrity of the support while incorporating Pt and Sn species.

4. **Surface Area and Shape Selectivity**: SAPO-34 has a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5, which contributes to higher propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Additionally, SAPO-34's shape selectivity effect allows for efficient control of reaction intermediates to desired products.

5. **Acidity Profile**: The SAPO-34 supported catalysts exhibit both weak Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, which are stable after metal incorporation. These suitable acid sites selectively convert reaction intermediates to propylene.

6. **Coke Formation**: SAPO-34 shows less coke formation compared to ZSM-5 under identical operating conditions, contributing to better catalyst stability and performance.

7. **Reaction Mechanism**: Over Pt-based SAPO-34 supported catalysts, propane dehydrogenation proceeds by hydrogen abstraction on metallic sites, forming propoxy species that are selectively converted to propylene via a transition state.

These factors collectively contribute to the improved performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, leading to high propylene selectivity and conversion rates, as well as better stability and coke accommodation.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，各种沸石基催化剂（特别是BEA拓扑和硅铝磷酸盐沸石）的制备方法、组成和沸石结构对性能产生影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. **金属含量**：使用PtSn基催化剂时，Sn作为促进剂有助于分散Pt金属，抑制焦炭形成反应，并显著提高催化性能。

2. **沸石支持拓扑结构**：SAPO-34沸石，其具有BEA拓扑结构，提供了一个弱酸环境，可以将丙基离子选择性地转化为丙烯，提供形状选择性仅允许丙烯形成，并且对脱氢和裂解几乎无活性。

3. **金属负载**：在催化剂制备过程中进行的金属掺杂不会破坏SAPO-34的结构拓扑，同时引入Pt和Sn物种。

4. **表面积和形状选择性**：与ZSM-5相比，SAPO-34具有更大的表面积，这有助于更高的丙烯选择性和转化率。此外，SAPO-34的形状选择性效应允许高效控制中间体以形成所需产品。

5. **酸度特性**：SAPO-34支持的催化剂表现出弱酸和路易斯酸位点，这些酸位点在金属掺入后保持稳定。这些适当的酸位点选择性地将反应中间体转化为丙烯。

6. **焦炭形成**：在相同的操作条件下，SAPO-34产生的焦炭量少于ZSM-5，有助于更好的催化剂稳定性和性能。

7. **反应机制**：在基于Pt的SAPO-34支持的催化剂上，丙烷脱氢通过在金属位点上的氢摘取进行，形成丙氧物种，这些丙氧物种通过过渡态被选择性地转化为丙烯。

这些因素共同导致了PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的优异性能，导致高丙烯选择性和转化率，以及更好的稳定性和焦炭容纳能力。
