SAPO-34 supported PtSn-based novel catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis.
NH3-TPD, IR spectra and XRD results suggested that the doping of metals on SAPO-34 did not affect its acidic strength and structural topology of support, respectively.
Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. 
The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34.
In contrast, PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst results were compared under identical conditions to provide comprehensive information in understanding roles of the catalyst support.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The SAPO-34 zeolite, with its BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate structure, offers advantages over traditional zeolites like ZSM-5. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the larger surface area, shape selectivity, and suitable acidity of SAPO-34. The sequential impregnation method ensures the successful loading of metals such as Pt and Sn, maintaining the structural integrity and acidic properties of the SAPO-34 support. The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst achieves a high propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97%, surpassing the performance of PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. This demonstrates that the choice of zeolite topology and the optimization of metal loading contribute significantly to the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts in propane dehydrogenation processes.
