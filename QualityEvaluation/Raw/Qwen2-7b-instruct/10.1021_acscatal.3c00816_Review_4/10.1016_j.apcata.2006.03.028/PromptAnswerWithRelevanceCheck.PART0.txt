<quotes>
[1] "Zeolites are particularly attractive host systems for dehydrogenation catalysts, since they may impose shape-selectivity, thus favoring the formation of dehydrogenation over oligomerization products such as coke."
[2] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."
[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[4] "On the contrary, the introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-Y by ion exchange does not give a more active or stable catalyst than that from sequential impregnation with zinc and platinum."
[5] "For a given zeolite type, the fraction of these different zinc species can be controlled by varying the zinc concentration, the pH of the zinc salt solution or the zinc salt precursor."
[6] "Due to their stability even in the absence of added hydrogen, these catalysts may offer an attractive alternative to the widely studied PtSn-containing L-type zeolites."

1. Zeolite Zn-ZSM-5 (MFI) showed enhanced non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation rates and selectivities for unsaturated products compared to the Zn-free zeolite H-ZSM-5. Zeolites are advantageous in dehydrogenation catalysts due to their shape-selectivity, which favors dehydrogenation over coke formation.

2. Zeolites serve as appealing host systems for dehydrogenation catalysts because they can enforce shape-selectivity, promoting the formation of dehydrogenation products over oligomerization byproducts like coke.

3. Hill et al. observed that a zeolite-based PtSnK-L catalyst, in the presence of hydrogen, had significantly higher isobutene formation rates compared to a PtSnKsilica catalyst.

4. Alexander and Huff found that the PtZn system, supported on zeolite L, is a superior catalyst with high isobutane conversion levels near thermodynamic equilibrium and high olefin selectivities under certain conditions.

5. Page reported on propane conversion over zeolites H-mordenite and 0.5Pt/H-mordenite.
