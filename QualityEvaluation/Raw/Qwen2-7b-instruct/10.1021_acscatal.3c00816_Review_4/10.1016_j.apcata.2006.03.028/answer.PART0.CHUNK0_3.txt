[1] "In particular, increased rates for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation and selectivities to unsaturated products were observed on zeolite Zn-ZSM-5 (MFI) with respect to the Zn-free zeolite H-ZSM-5."
[2] "Over the 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction whereas aromatization occurred over the 12-membered-ring zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y."
[3] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[4] "On the contrary, highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7  nSi/nAl  26)."
[5] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.62.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

1. The presence of zinc in zeolites led to enhanced rates of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation and improved selectivity to unsaturated products compared to zinc-free zeolites.

2. Zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 primarily promoted propane dehydrogenation, while zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L, and Na-Y favored aromatization reactions.

3. Zeolites Beta and mordenite with a specific silicon-to-aluminum ratio and zinc content provided the highest and most stable propane conversion rates under certain conditions.

4. Zeolites with a specific topology and intermediate silicon-to-aluminum ratios, when slightly over-exchanged with zinc, produced highly active and stable catalysts for propane conversion.

5. Zeolite Na-Beta, with specific silicon-to-aluminum, platinum, and zinc contents, showed the best performance for propane dehydrogenation, achieving equilibrium conversion and high propene selectivity for prolonged periods.

1. 添加锌的沸石表现出较高的非氧化性丙烷脱氢速率和更优的不饱和产物选择性，与无锌的沸石相比。

2. Na-ZSM-5和Na-ZSM-11主要促进了丙烷脱氢，而Na-Beta、Na-蒙脱石、K-L和Na-Y则倾向于芳香化反应。

3. 具有特定硅铝比和锌含量的Beta和蒙脱石提供了最高的稳定丙烷转化率，并在特定条件下达到了平衡转化率。

4. 具有特定拓扑结构和中等硅铝比的沸石，在适度过交换锌后，产生了高度活性和稳定的催化剂用于丙烷转换。

5. 具有特定硅铝、铂和锌含量的Beta沸石表现出最佳的丙烷脱氢性能，实现了平衡转化率和高丙烯选择性，并且持续时间较长。
