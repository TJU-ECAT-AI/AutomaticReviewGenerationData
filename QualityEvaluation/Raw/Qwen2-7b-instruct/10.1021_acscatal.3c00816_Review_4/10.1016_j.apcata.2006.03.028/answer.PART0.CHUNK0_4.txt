[1] "Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), PtZn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared."
[2] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."
[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[4] "On the contrary, the introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-Y by ion exchange does not give a more active or stable catalyst than that from sequential impregnation with zinc and platinum."
[5] "These latter species appear to be volatile, because, after 12 h on-stream, condensation of metallic zinc occurred in the colder part of the reactor downstream of the catalyst bed."

1. Various types of zeolites including Na-ZSM-5, Na-ZSM-11, Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L, and Na-Y were utilized to prepare PtZn-containing catalysts with zinc content ranging from 0.6 to 13.4 wt.% and a fixed platinum content of 0.5 wt.%. 

2. The way zinc was incorporated into the zeolites did not significantly impact the catalytic performance of those with a lower Si/Al ratio (less than 3.4).

3. The zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta showed a stable propane conversion equivalent to the thermodynamic equilibrium for propane dehydrogenation to propene (29% conversion, T = 555°C, p = 0.1 MPa) for at least 63 hours.

4. The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-Y through ion exchange did not yield a more active or stable catalyst compared to sequential impregnation with zinc and platinum.

5. The volatile nature of certain zinc species was demonstrated, as condensation of metallic zinc occurred in the colder part of the reactor downstream of the catalyst bed after 12 hours of operation.

1. 包括Na-ZSM-5、Na-ZSM-11、Na-Beta、Na-mordenite、K-L和Na-Y在内的多种类型的沸石被用于制备含锌量在0.6至13.4 wt.%之间，且铂含量固定为0.5 wt.%的PtZn催化剂。

2. 锌的整合方式对具有较低Si/Al比（小于3.4）的沸石的催化性能影响不大。

3. 在0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta沸石上，稳定丙烷转化率接近丙烷脱氢到丙烯的热力学平衡（29%转化率，T = 555°C，p = 0.1 MPa），持续至少63小时。

4. 将锌通过离子交换引入到Na-Y沸石中，并没有产生比连续浸渍锌和铂更活跃或稳定的催化剂。

5. 某些锌物种的挥发性得到证实，在反应器下游的冷部分出现金属锌凝结，这是在运行12小时后催化剂床下的情况。
