1. Zeolite Zn-ZSM-5 (MFI) showed enhanced non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation rates and selectivities for unsaturated products compared to the Zn-free zeolite H-ZSM-5. Zeolites are advantageous in dehydrogenation catalysts due to their shape-selectivity, which favors dehydrogenation over coke formation.

2. Zeolites serve as appealing host systems for dehydrogenation catalysts because they can enforce shape-selectivity, promoting the formation of dehydrogenation products over oligomerization byproducts like coke.

3. Hill et al. observed that a zeolite-based PtSnK-L catalyst, in the presence of hydrogen, had significantly higher isobutene formation rates compared to a PtSnKsilica catalyst.

4. Alexander and Huff found that the PtZn system, supported on zeolite L, is a superior catalyst with high isobutane conversion levels near thermodynamic equilibrium and high olefin selectivities under certain conditions.

5. Page reported on propane conversion over zeolites H-mordenite and 0.5Pt/H-mordenite.

6. Among all catalysts based on zeolite Na-Y, the catalyst 0.5Pt2.7Zn/Na-Y demonstrated the best performance.

1. 含锌的ZSM-5 (MFI) 在无氧化丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更高的速率和更选择性地生成不饱和产物，与不含锌的H-ZSM-5相比。由于其在分子筛孔道中的形状选择性，使脱氢反应优于形成焦炭等副产物。

2. 分子筛作为脱氢催化剂的宿主系统特别有吸引力，因为它们可以施加形状选择性，促进脱氢产物的生成而避免形成如焦炭之类的聚合物副产品。

3. Hill等人发现，在氢气的存在下，基于分子筛的PtSnK-L催化剂的异丁烯形成速率显著高于PtSnK硅酸盐催化剂。

4. Alexander和Huff发现，PtZn体系在分子筛L上的使用是一种优越的催化剂，在特定条件下，异丁烷转化率接近热力学平衡，且具有高烯烃选择性。

5. Page报告了在H-蒙脱石和0.5Pt/H-蒙脱石上进行的丙烷转换研究。

6. 在基于Na-Y的催化剂中，0.5Pt2.7Zn/Na-Y表现出最佳性能。
