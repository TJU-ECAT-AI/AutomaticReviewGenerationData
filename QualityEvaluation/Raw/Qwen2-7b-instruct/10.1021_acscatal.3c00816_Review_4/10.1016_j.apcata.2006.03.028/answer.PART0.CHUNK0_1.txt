[1] "In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts."
[2] "After the aqueous ion exchange of the zeolites with nSi/nAl-ratios  26, the zinc content in the catalysts was higher than that expected from their ion exchange capacity."
[3] "This over-exchange with zinc was explained by the formation of oxidic zinc species."
[4] "Aromatization occurred over the 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, whereas propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction over the 12-membered-ring zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y."
[5] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[6] "The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

1. The systematic investigation involved loading various zeolites with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange using aqueous zinc salt solutions.
2. The zinc content in the catalysts was higher than expected due to an over-exchange with zinc.
3. The over-exchange led to the formation of oxidic zinc species.
4. Propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction over 12-membered-ring zeolites, while aromatization occurred over 10-membered-ring zeolites.
5. Zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta showed a stable conversion to propene close to thermodynamic equilibrium for at least 63 hours.
6. The propene selectivity over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta was greater than 90%.

1. 对各种沸石进行了系统研究，通过浸渍或使用水合锌盐溶液进行离子交换加载锌。
2. 催化剂中的锌含量高于预期，这是由于锌的过量交换。
3. 过量交换导致氧化锌物种的形成。
4. 在12个成员环沸石中，丙烷脱氢是主要反应，而在10个成员环沸石中，则发生异构化。
5. 在0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta沸石上，丙烷转化为丙烯的稳定转化率接近热力学平衡，至少持续了63小时。
6. 在0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta沸石上的丙烯选择性大于90%。
