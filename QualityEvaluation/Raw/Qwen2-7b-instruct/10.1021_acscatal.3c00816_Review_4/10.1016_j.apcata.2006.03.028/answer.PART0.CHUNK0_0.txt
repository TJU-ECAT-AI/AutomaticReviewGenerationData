[1] "Zeolites are particularly attractive host systems for dehydrogenation catalysts, since they may impose shape-selectivity, thus favoring the formation of dehydrogenation over oligomerization products such as coke."
[2] "The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios ( 3.4)."
[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream."
[4] "On the contrary, the introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-Y by ion exchange does not give a more active or stable catalyst than that from sequential impregnation with zinc and platinum."
[5] "For a given zeolite type, the fraction of these different zinc species can be controlled by varying the zinc concentration, the pH of the zinc salt solution or the zinc salt precursor."
[6] "Due to their stability even in the absence of added hydrogen, these catalysts may offer an attractive alternative to the widely studied PtSn-containing L-type zeolites."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Zeolites are effective in dehydrogenation catalysts because they can control the shape of molecules, promoting dehydrogenation over the formation of coke. 
2. The method of zinc incorporation had minimal impact on the catalytic performance of large-pore zeolites with a low nSi/nAl ratio.
3. The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta demonstrated a stable conversion equivalent to the thermodynamic equilibrium for propane dehydrogenation to propene, lasting over 63 hours under certain conditions.
4. The ion-exchange method for adding zinc did not result in a more active or stable catalyst for zeolite Na-Y compared to sequential impregnation.
5. The proportion of various zinc species in the catalyst can be adjusted by modifying the zinc concentration, the pH of the zinc salt solution, or the type of zinc salt used.
6. The stability of these catalysts without hydrogen addition makes them a promising alternative to commonly studied PtSn-containing L-type zeolites.

1. 硅铝比低的大型沸石是有效的脱氢催化剂，因为它们能够控制分子形状，促进脱氢而非形成焦炭。
2. 锌的整合方式对具有较低nSi/nAl比率的大孔沸石的催化性能影响较小。
3. 催化剂0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta在特定条件下表现出稳定且接近于丙烷脱氢到丙烯的热力学平衡转化率，持续时间超过63小时。
4. 对于沸石Na-Y来说，通过离子交换添加锌并未带来比连续浸渍锌和铂更活跃或更稳定的催化剂。
5. 可以通过调整锌浓度、锌盐溶液的pH值或锌盐类型来改变催化剂中不同锌物种的比例。
6. 这些催化剂在无氢添加的情况下保持稳定性，成为广泛研究的PtSn型L型沸石的有吸引力的替代品。
