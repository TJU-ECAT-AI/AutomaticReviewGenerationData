Abstract
The addition of P to a Ni/SiO2 catalyst greatly changes the isobutane dehydrogenation performance. The Ni:P ratio is an important influencing factor for a Ni–P/SiO2 catalyst because of the formation of different Ni–P compounds. When the Ni:P ratio equals 1:1, a Ni–P/SiO2 catalyst with Ni2P formed on the surface exhibits an optimum dehydrogenation performance (an isobutane conversion of 22% and an isobutene selectivity of 81.3%). The in situ Fourier transform infrared characterization was performed to determine the adsorption mode of isobutane. Isobutane is adsorbed onto the Ni–P surface with one H atom in a methyl group, and the intermediate tends to form isobutene rather than C–C bond scission. Moreover, the decreased adsorption energy of isobutene on the Ni2P surface inhibits its further reaction. The deactivation of a Ni–P/SiO2 catalyst is mainly caused by the phase transformation from Ni2P to Ni12P5 and coke deposition. Finally, some general rules are summarized to get a deep understanding of the second component added to a Ni/SiO2 catalyst.

1. Introduction
Supported Pt and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in the dehydrogenation of alkanes for industrial production. (1−7) Because of their high cost and environmental issues, the studies focused on non-noble-metal catalysts, such as supported Ni, Mo, Fe, and Sn catalysts, have received widespread attention in recent years. (8−11)
Single-component Pt catalysts exhibit relatively low selectivity to olefins and deactivate rapidly for alkane dehydrogenation; (12,13) therefore, in order to modify the dehydrogenation performances, the addition of a second component is inevitable, (14) and the most studied is Sn. (15−18) The introduction of Sn can selectively facilitate the formation of olefins by reducing the Pt crystallite size and donating an electron from the Sn to Pt atom; moreover, Sn is conducive to the migration of coke from active Pt to a support to enhance the catalyst stability. (19,20) Regarding supported Ni catalysts, the rupture of C–C bonds can be effectively inhibited after the addition of Sn. (21,22) S plays a similar role. The addition of S to Ni-based catalysts can significantly improve the selectivity to isobutene in our previous works. (8,23)
Besides S and Sn, P addition to Ni-based catalysts also exhibits a positive effect in alkane dehydrogenation. (24) Supported Ni–P catalysts have been widely used in catalytic hydrogenation in the reported literature. (25−29) Because dehydrogenation and hydrogenation are reverse reactions, research on Ni2P for alkane dehydrogenation has been performed in recent years. (30−32) Wang and co-workers proved that the selectivity to isobutene for isobutane dehydrogenation over Ni2P supported on activated carbon (AC) was much higher than that over a Ni/AC catalyst under the same reaction conditions. (31) Moreover, for ethane dehydrogenation to ethene, P addition to Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst also promoted ethene selectivity and decreased the yield to coke. (33)
Although the addition of Sn, P, and S to Ni catalysts effectively facilitates the formation of olefins in alkane dehydrogenation, (8,21−24,30,34) the reaction performance, especially the stability of the modified Ni-based catalyst, is significantly different. For the Ni–Sn/SiO2 catalyst, isobutane conversion along with selectivity to isobutene remains stable for 200 h. (21,22) On the contrary, Ni–S and Ni–P catalysts deactivate much more rapidly. (23,30,32) The different catalyst stabilities mainly result from the different properties of these three elements, such as the atomic radius, electronegativity, and interaction strength with Ni.
In this paper, Ni–P/SiO2 catalysts with different molar ratios of Ni to P were prepared and evaluated for isobutane dehydrogenation. As characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), pyridine infrared (Py-IR), etc., a Ni–P/SiO2 catalyst exhibits different Ni–P compounds and acid properties when the molar ratio of Ni to P is changed, which exerts a great influence on the dehydrogenation performance. To explain the effect of P addition, the adsorption modes of isobutane and isobutene on the catalyst with an optimal Ni:P ratio were determined by in situ FTIR. In addition, the stability of a Ni–P/SiO2 catalyst was investigated, and rapid deactivation is probably caused by transformation of the Ni–P phase and coke deposition. Finally, combined with our previous works, a better understanding of the effect of the secondary component on a Ni/SiO2 catalyst was obtained.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Ni–P/SiO2 catalysts used in this work were prepared by excessive wetness impregnation. A total of 1.95 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and a certain amount of NH4H2PO4 were dissolved in 12.4 g of deionized water. Then the obtained solution was added to 9.5 g of SiO2 particles, purchased from Qingdao Ocean Chemical Co. Ltd. (particle size, 60–80 mesh; purity, ≥99.9%). After standing for 3 h at room temperature, the mixture was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined at 650 °C in air for 2 h. The content of NiO in NiO/SiO2 was 5.0 wt %. The catalyst precursors were reduced under a H2 atmosphere at 650 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature in a N2 flow. These as-prepared catalysts are named as 5Ni–P/SiO2-x, where x represents the molar ratio of Ni to P. The P/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by the same method as that mentioned above, and the amount of P was the same as that in the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst.
2.2. Catalyst Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the catalyst was carried out on a Haoyuan DX-2700BH diffraction system using Cu Kα radiation at 30 mA and 40 kV, running from 35° to 80° with a speed of 0.5° min–1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed using an ESCALab-250Xi apparatus with an Al Kα X-ray excitation source. The data processing involved background subtraction using the Shirley method.
N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out with a Quadrasorb SI instrument at 77 K to determine the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface areas and pore properties of the catalysts. In order to remove the adsorbed moisture, all samples were evacuated at 300 °C for 5 h at a pressure of 0.1 mmHg prior to the measurements. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 120.0 kV.
The acid sites of the catalysts were determined by Py-IR. The IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine on 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalysts were collected using a Bruker Tensor 27 IR spectrometer in the range of 4000–600 cm–1. The background spectrum and that of chemisorbed pyridine were recorded at 25 °C.
Because of the oxidation of Ni–P compounds in air at high temperature, the amount of coke in deactivated catalyst cannot be detected only by thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA; Figure S1). The amount of coke deposited on the deactivated catalyst was determined by a 1HW(T) HF infrared absorption C/S instrument. Fully dried CaCO3 powders (50.0 mg) were loaded in a crucible, and the temperature was rapidly raised to 950 °C in order to ensure complete decomposition of CaCO3. The signal of the formed CO2 was detected by an IR detector at the same time. About 250 mg of catalyst was put in another crucible, and it was heated to 950 °C under an O2 flow. The amount of coke can be calculated based on the IR signals of CO2 formed from CaCO3 and catalyst. A detailed description of this method is presented in the Supporting Information.
The redox performance of 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalysts was determined by temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) on a PCA-1200 chemical adsorption analyzer. During the test, 0.1 g of catalyst precursor particles (20–60 mesh) were pretreated in a flow of Ar at 600 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1, and then the temperature was reduced to 100 °C. A mixture of 10 vol % H2/N2 (30 mL min–1) was brought into contact with the catalyst and subsequently heated to the final temperature at a rate of 10 °C min–1. The thermal conductivity detector signal was recorded in real time.
2.3. Catalytic Activity Test
Dehydrogenation of isobutane was conducted in a fixed-bed microreactor with an inner diameter of 12 mm. A total of 2.0 g of catalyst particles with sizes of 60–80 mesh were located in the reactor. Before the reaction, the catalysts were pretreated under H2 at 650 °C for 30 min; afterward, the temperature was cooled to the required temperature under a N2 flow (30 mL min–1). During the test, isobutane without H2 or inert gas was fed to the reactor. Each gas product was collected for 10 min, which means that the conversion and selectivity at each time were the average data in 10 min. Thus, the initial conversion and selectivity were obtained at the first 10 min. The composition of the gas products was analyzed by a Bruker 450 gas chromatograph. The mass of coke deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was determined by a carbometer. The conversion of isobutane and product selectivity were calculated as follows (eqs 1 and 2):

2.4. In Situ FTIR Measurement
IR spectra of adsorbed isobutane and isobutene on a Ni–P/SiO2 catalyst were collected by a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrophotometer (with an instrumental resolution of 2 cm–1). Before measurement, 20 mg of a catalyst powder was pressed into a thin wafer with a diameter of 13 mm and then located in an in situ transmission cell provided by Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (Dalian, China). The catalyst wafer was pretreated under a H2 flow (30 mL min–1) at 650 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the temperature was cooled to 25 °C in N2 with a flow of 70 mL min–1, and the background signal was collected. Subsequently, N2 was switched to a isobutane (or isobutene) flow (30 mL min–1). After 1 h, gaseous isobutane (isobutene) was gradually removed by vacuum, and IR spectra under different pressures were collected at the same time. The measurement was repeated to exclude the background noise and obtain reproducible IR spectra.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalyst Characterization
XRD patterns of 5Ni/SiO2 catalysts before and after P addition are shown in Figure 1. Obviously, the characteristic diffraction peaks due to metallic Ni disappear after the introduction of P. Instead, different Ni–P compounds, such as Ni3P, Ni12P5, and Ni2P, can be detected in 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalysts. As for the 5Ni–P/SiO2-3.0 catalyst, diffraction peaks attributed to Ni3P can be observed. With a decrease of the molar ratio of Ni to P to 2.0, Ni12P5 can be detected. Further decreasing the ratio leads to the formation of Ni2P. That is, an increased amount of P in the catalyst precursor facilitates formation of the Ni2P phase. Even if an excess amount of the P species is added, no peaks due to P or phosphate are visible, from which we conclude that these crystallites are too small to be detected. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the addition of P to a Ni/SiO2 catalyst changes the existing state of Ni crystallites.
Figure 1
Figure 1. XRD patterns of 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalysts.
To further study the effect of P, XPS measurements of 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalysts were carried out. According to the reported literature, (22,35) the Ni 2p peak of metallic Ni is located at 852.3 eV and that of Niδ+ in the Ni–P compound can be detected in the range of 853.5–852.2 eV. As shown in Figure 2a, the obvious Ni 2p peaks observed at 853.0 and 852.4 eV indicate the formation of Ni3P and Ni2P, (36) which is consistent with the results of the XRD patterns shown in Figure 1. That is, because of the decreased electron density of Ni atoms through the donation of electrons to P atoms, (37) Ni atoms exhibit positive partial charges.

With regard to the P species, the P 2p binding energies of phosphate species and Pδ− in Ni2P are centered at 134.3 and 129.3 eV, respectively. (38) In addition, the H2-TPR profiles of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalyst (Figure S2) prove the presence of phosphate. During the preparation process of the catalyst, nickel phosphate can be formed on the catalyst after calcination. According to the reported literature, (39−41) in the experiment of H2-TPR, Ni2+ can be reduced to metallic Ni, and then H2 molecules dissociatively adsorb on the Ni surface to generate H atoms, which spill over to the adjacent P atoms and reduce them to P or phosphine. At last, these P species react with metallic Ni to form Ni–P compounds. Because the bond energy of P–O in phosphate is stronger than that of the Ni–O bond, a higher reduction temperature is needed. As reported in the literature, (42,43) the peaks in the H2-TPR profiles below 550 °C are attributed to the reduction of NiO, while the reduction temperature of phosphate is generally in the range of 550–800 °C. According to the H2-TPR profiles in Figure S2, phosphate in the precursors of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 and 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalysts cannot be completely reduced under a reduction temperature of 650 °C prior to reaction. As for the 5Ni–P/SiO2-3.0 catalyst, the peaks attributed to the P species are difficult to check. Only one small peak located at 134.3 eV can be detected for the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst. The 5Ni–P/SiO2-0.3 catalyst shows a recognizable peak at 129.3 eV attributed to Pδ− of Ni2P, which is consistent with the XRD patterns.
The introduced P species in the 5Ni/SiO2 catalyst not only change the existing state of Ni but also generate new acid sites. As shown in Figure 3, the adsorption of pyridine on 5Ni–P/SiO2-x catalysts gives rise to three IR bands in the range of 1600–1400 cm–1. Specifically, the bands centered at 1547, 1492, and 1448 cm–1 are attributed to vibrational modes of the pyridine ring adsorbed onto Brønsted acid sites, Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, and Lewis acid sites, respectively. (44) The area of the band at 1547 cm–1 increases significantly with an increase of P, while the band areas peaking at 1448 cm–1 increase slowly. Combined with the variation trend of the peak area for P5+ species at 134.3 eV (Figure 2b), the Brønsted acid sites in 5Ni–P/SiO2-x are likely to be related with the P–OH sites derived from incompletely reduced phosphate (Figure S2). With regard to the NH3-TPD profiles of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-a catalysts (x = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.3) shown in Figure S3, the peak temperatures are 188, 197, and 198 °C, respectively, which belong to NH3 molecules adsorbed on weak acid sites, and the number of acid sites is increased with a decrease of the Ni:P ratio (Table S1).

3.2. Catalytic Performance of a Ni–P/SiO2 Catalyst for Isobutane Dehydrogenation
3.2.1. Isobutane Dehydrogenation over a Ni–P/SiO2 Catalyst with Different Ni:P Ratios
As listed in Table S2, SiO2 exhibits extremely low activity, and thus the reactions of isobutane mainly occur on the Ni and Ni–P surfaces. Methane is the only hydrocarbon product for isobutane reacting over the 5Ni/SiO2 catalyst at 600 °C under a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 150 h–1 (Table 1); even when GHSV is increased to 1200 h–1, only a trace amount of isobutene is detected (Table S3), which is caused by C–C bond scission catalyzed by the aggregated Ni particles on SiO2. In our previous works, S or Sn was introduced to a Ni-based catalyst to modify its dehydrogenation performance, (8,21,22) and here P was added instead. For isobutane dehydrogenation over the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst, the selectivity to isobutene increases sharply to 81.3% (Table 1). In Ni2P, every Ni atom is tetrahedrally surrounded by four P atoms, (45,46) indicating that the aggregated Ni atoms active for C–C bond scission are dispersed on a molecular scale. Therefore, different catalytic performances before and after P addition are probably attributed to the formation of Ni2P.

aReaction conditions: temperature = 600 °C, mass of catalyst = 2.0 g, and GHSV = 150 h–1.
Actually, different Ni–P compounds exhibit different dehydrogenation performances. With regard to isobutane dehydrogenation on the Ni3P surface in the 5Ni–P/SiO2-3.0 catalyst, the selectivity to isobutene is only 4.5% with an isobutane conversion of 84.0%, demonstrating that the scission of C–C bonds is inevitable. Because Ni3P (Figure S4a) surfaces are constituted by Ni4P4 and Ni8-terminated surfaces, (47) the existence of multiple assembled Ni atoms active for C–C bond rupture is quite possible. As for the 5Ni–P/SiO2-2.0 catalyst, isobutane conversion reduces to 10.4%, while isobutene selectivity rises to 76.1% because of the formation of Ni12P5. As listed in Table 1, when the molar ratio of Ni to P is reduced to 1:1, the highest selectivity to isobutene (81.3%) can be obtained, and at the same time, the conversion of isobutane is 21.6%. These facts manifest that the catalytic activity of Ni2P for isobutane dehydrogenation is much higher than that of two other Ni–P compounds. Actually, the distribution of atoms and electronic properties are different among these three Ni–P compounds. Specifically, the number of P atoms surrounding Ni atoms increased in the following order: Ni3P, Ni12P5, and Ni2P (Figure S4). (37,48) That is, the increased amount of P in Ni–P compounds improves the selectivity to isobutene to some extent. Given the low dehydrogenation activity of P/SiO2 under the same reaction conditions (Table S4), the active sites for isobutane dehydrogenation are probably the Ni atoms in Ni2P crystallites.
However, the introduction of excessive P species cannot facilitate the formation of isobutene. The selectivity to isobutene is decreased to 54.6% over the 5Ni–P/SiO2-0.5 catalyst and that to C1–C3 hydrocarbons and linear butenes apparently rises. In addition, C–C bond scission and the formation of n-butenes are further exacerbated over the 5Ni–P/SiO2-0.3 catalyst. n-Butenes can be formed by the isomerization of isobutene or dehydrogenation of n-butane. Because of almost no strong acid sites existing on the 5Ni–P/SiO2 surface (Figure S3) as well as the low amount of n-butane in the products (Table 1), the formation of n-butenes is probably caused by the former route, skeleton isomerization of isobutene. According to the XPS (Figure 2) and IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine (Figure 3), the superficial OH groups connected to phosphate species that are not reduced promote the formation of byproducts.
3.2.2. Isobutane Dehydrogenation over a Ni–P/SiO2 Catalyst under Different Reaction Conditions
Because the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst exhibits a relatively good dehydrogenation performance, the reaction conditions have been optimized. Catalytic dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction, so the increasing temperature facilitates the activation and rupture of the C–H bond. Consequently, the conversion of isobutane increases from 11.6% to 28.4% when the temperature changes in the range of 560–620 °C (Figure 4a). At the same time, it should be noted that higher temperature also promotes C–C bond scission as the secondary reaction of the formed isobutene (Table S5), which causes lower selectivity to isobutene (85.0% → 73.9%). As shown in Figure 4b, the shorter restrained time due to the increased GHSV prevents further reaction of generated isobutene (Table S6). Therefore, the selectivity to isobutene is increased and the formation of coke is inhibited.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Catalytic performance of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation under different reaction conditions: (a) effect of the temperature (mass of catalyst = 2.0 g; GHSV = 150 h–1); (b) effect of the GHSV (mass of catalyst = 2.0 g; temperature = 600 °C).
3.3. Adsorption Modes of Isobutane and Isobutene on a Ni–P/SiO2 Catalyst
Although the addition of moderate amounts of P to the 5Ni/SiO2 catalyst significantly prevents C–C bond scission, the selectivity to isobutene is lower than that over the Ni–Sn/SiO2 catalyst in our previous work. (21) It is speculated that the intermediates formed on the Ni, Ni–P, and Ni–Sn surfaces are probably different, which can be determined by the adsorption mode of isobutane. Generally, H atoms instead of C atoms in alkane molecules tend to interact with the metal surface upon adsorption, (49,50) and the adsorbed C–H bond leads to a significant shift of the corresponding IR bands. Moreover, for double-site adsorption, the shift of ν(C–C) is obviously larger than that for single-site adsorption.
The IR spectra of isobutane adsorbed onto the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst are shown in Figure 5. For comparison, the assignments of the IR bands of gaseous isobutane are listed in Table S7. In the region of 3000–2800 cm–1, the bands at 2978 and 2952 cm–1 belonging to stretching vibrations of the C–H bonds in methyl are shifted to 2980 and 2958 cm–1, respectively. The band at 1380 cm–1, attributed to δs(CH3), is shifted to 1386 cm–1 after adsorption. Shifts of the IR bands due to the C–H bond in methylidyne, 2892 cm–1 → 2890 cm–1 and 1334 cm–1 → 1336 cm–1, are obviously smaller. Moreover, the bands centered at 2966, 2880, 2870, 1490, 1477, 1466, and 1394 cm–1 exhibit no obvious shifts. That is, the electrons of the C–H bonds in methyl undergo the largest change after adsorption. In addition, a ν(C–C) shift of 3 cm–1 is much less than that of the double-site adsorption isobutane. (21) Thus, the adsorption of isobutane on the Ni–P surface may be of the single-site type with one H atom in a methyl group, as shown in Scheme 1a.

Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Adsorption Modes of Isobutane (a) and Isobutene (b) on the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 Catalyst
For isobutane adsorbed on the 5Ni/SiO2 catalyst in our previous work, (21) two H atoms in different methyl groups are interacting with the Ni surface. The formed intermediate tends to rupture the C–C bond, leading to the generation of abundant methane instead of isobutene. (51,52) On the contrary, after the addition of P, only one H atom in a methyl is adsorbed on the active site. In this case, the rupture of two C–H bonds in both a methyl and the methylidyne to generate isobutene is quite possible, which is consistent with the reported literature. (53,54) That is, C–C bond breaking can be effectively inhibited on the Ni2P surface.
The adsorption mode of isobutene reflects its desorption behavior to some extent, which influences the product distribution for isobutane dehydrogenation. As for the IR spectra of isobutene adsorbed onto the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst shown in Figure 6, the C═C stretching band centered at 1660 cm–1 is shifted to 1648 cm–1, which is the largest shift in the IR spectra. With regard to the bands due to the C–H bonds in vinylidene in the regions of 3100–3000 cm–1 [ν(═CH2)] and 1300–1250 cm–1 (═CH2 in-plane bending) (55) listed in Table S8, these shifts are observed as follows: 3097 cm–1 → 3099 cm–1, 3075 cm–1 → 3073 cm–1, 1292 cm–1 → 1290 cm–1, and 1268 cm–1 → 1265 cm–1. The existence of these bands indicates that the C═C bond is not destroyed during adsorption. As for the bands assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of the C–H bonds in methyl, only three shifts can be observed: 2926 cm–1 → 2924 cm–1, 1456 cm–1 → 1458 cm–1, and 1392 cm–1 → 1394 cm–1. In addition, there is a shift of 3 cm–1 contributed to the C–C bond centered at 1052 cm–1. The above-detected small shifts are generally caused by physical adsorption or background noise. Therefore, on the surface of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst, isobutene is probably adsorbed in a single-site mode with the C═C bond.
Figure 6
Figure 6. IR spectra of isobutene adsorbed on the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst.
For the π-bonded olefin adsorption species on the metal surface, the adsorption energy is generally proportional to the shift of the IR band attributed to the C═C bond. (56,57) The shift of ν(C═C) for isobutene adsorbed on the Ni2P surface is 12 cm–1, which is obviously smaller than that on the Ni surface (18 cm–1). (21) The significantly decreased adsorption strength of isobutene can effectively prevent its further reaction.
3.4. Deactivation Origin of the Ni–P/SiO2 Catalyst
The stability of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst was investigated under the optimized reaction conditions. As shown in Figure 7, the conversion of isobutane along with the selectivity to isobutene is decreased with extension of the reaction time. The initial isobutane conversion of 21.6% decreases to 11.0% after 120 min; at the same time, the selectivity to isobutene drops from 81.3% to 76.3%. Compared with the excellent stability of the Ni–Sn/SiO2 catalyst for isobutane dehydrogenation in our previous works, (21,22) deactivation of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst is much more rapid. In order to determine the origin of catalyst deactivation, the phase analyses after different reaction times were carried out. It is obvious from Figure 8 that the characteristic diffraction peaks attributed to Ni12P5 become increasingly intensified with longer time on stream, while the peaks due to Ni2P diminish simultaneously. P atoms located in the Ni lattice weaken the interaction between Ni atoms, resulting in an unstable crystal structure. (45) According to the online mass spectrometry (MS) spectra of isobutane dehydrogenation (Figure S5), the intensity of the isobutane signal gradually increases after 18 min of continuous reaction, indicative of deactivation of the catalyst. Furthermore, the MS signal of PH3 can be detected during the reaction, demonstrating P loss in the form of PH3. That is, during the reaction, the active Ni2P is converted to Ni12P5, with low dehydrogenation activity, which is one reason for catalyst deactivation. Similar to our previous works for isobutane dehydrogenation over Ni–S catalysts, S loss by H2S is also inevitable, leading to a decrease of the dehydrogenation activity. (8,34) In addition, the average diameter of the Ni–P compound is 7.5 nm in the fresh 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst, which increases to 10.9 nm after 120 min of reaction (Figure S6); that is, sintering of the Ni–P compound during reaction is inevitable.

As for coke formation, the amount of coke on the catalyst is 0.58 wt % after 120 min of reaction. In addition, because the pore properties of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst before and after reaction exhibit little variation (Table S9), the generated coke is mainly deposited on the catalyst surface rather than plugging the pores. The amount of coke formed during the first 30 min is 0.35 wt %, which accounts for 60% of the total amount of coke generated during the reaction shown in Figure 7, and thus the reduction of isobutane conversion in the first 30 min is much more rapid. Unlike Sn in Pt–Sn-based catalysts, (19) P species in Ni2P and Ni12P5 cannot transfer coke from the active sites to the support; therefore, the decreased Ni–P surface by the coverage of coke lowers the conversion of isobutane. In short, deactivation of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst is probably caused by the phase change of the Ni–P compounds and coke deposition on the active sites.
3.5. Role of the Second Component Added to Ni/SiO2 for Isobutane Dehydrogenation
For the supported Ni catalyst, the addition of Sn, S, and P changes the reaction of isobutane from cracking to dehydrogenation. (8,22,34,58) According to the reaction and characterization results for isobutane dehydrogenation over the Ni/SiO2 catalyst with different components introduced, some universal rules can be summarized here.
First of all, the amount of A (the added component) atoms embedded in the Ni crystallites should be optimized. Ni crystallites cannot be well dispersed with a low amount of A, leading to a high activity for C–C bond scission. As listed in Table 1, almost no isobutene can be produced on the Ni3P surface if the molar ratio of Ni to P equals 3.0; similar reaction results have been obtained over a Ni3Sn alloy for a Ni–Sn-based catalyst. (22) The excess amount of A atoms may result in coverage of the active surface and a change of the acid properties, which is unfavorable for isobutene formation.
Second, when an olefin molecule is adsorbed onto the Ni surface, there is d−π* back-donation bonding between the 3d orbital of the Ni atom and the antibonding orbital of the C═C bond, and the increased electron density of Ni atom can reduce the strength of this bond. (21,53) Although well-dispersed Ni crystallites can be formed after the addition of Sn, S, and P, the charge properties of the Ni species are different. The sequence of the binding energies of Ni 2p increases in the order Ni–Sn/SiO2 (851.9 eV), Ni–S/SiO2 (852.4 eV), and Ni–P/SiO2 (852.8 eV), (22,23) consistent with the decrease sequence of the isobutene selectivity (Table S10). That is, Niδ− is more beneficial to isobutene generation.
Last but not least, after the introduction of an A atom, the structure stability of the newly formed NixAy compound on the catalyst surface is an extremely important factor regarding the stability of the catalyst. If a stable alloy phase can be formed after the addition of an A atom to the supported Ni catalyst, such as a Ni–Sn alloy, the stability of the catalyst is much higher. (21,22) However, the introduction of large atoms, such as P and S, can significantly weaken metal bonds by occupying the inner space of the metal lattice and forming metal interstitial compounds, which results in an unstable crystal structure and reduces the catalytic performance under high temperature. Especially, the loss of P and S (23) can be detected during isobutane dehydrogenation over Ni–P/SiO2 and Ni–S/SiO2 catalysts. Therefore, the stability of the Ni–A/SiO2 catalyst largely depends on the structure of the NixAy compound produced.
4. Conclusions
The introduction of P to the 5Ni/SiO2 catalyst significantly improves the catalytic performance for isobutane dehydrogenation. 5Ni–P/SiO2 catalysts with different molar ratios of Ni to P were prepared and characterized by XRD, XPS, Py-IR, etc., indicative of the different existing states of Ni and P on the catalyst surface. As for isobutane reacting over the 5Ni–P/SiO2-3.0 catalyst, the selectivity to isobutene is only 4.5% with a high isobutane conversion (84.0%); that is, C–C bond scission is inevitable on the Ni3P surface. With the ratio decreased to 2:1, a Ni12P5 phase is formed, and the conversion reduces to 10.4%, while the isobutene selectivity rises to 76.1%. The highest selectivity to isobutene of 81.3% is obtained on the Ni2P surface for the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst. As the ratio is further decreased, Brønsted acid sites can inevitably be produced, leading to aggravation of the secondary reactions of the generated isobutene and the rupture of C–C bonds. In order to gain a deep understanding of the reaction result, the adsorption modes of isobutane and isobutene on the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst were determined by in situ FTIR. Isobutane is adsorbed on the Ni2P surface with one H atom in a methyl, and the generated intermediate is prone to the formation of isobutene instead of methane. In addition, further reactions of isobutene are effectively inhibited because the adsorption energy of isobutene on the Ni2P surface is much lower than that on the Ni surface. Deactivation of the 5Ni–P/SiO2-1.0 catalyst is mainly caused by the transformation of active Ni2P to low-activity Ni12P5 by P loss and the formation of coke on the active sites. In combination with our previous works on Ni–Sn/SiO2 and Ni–S/SiO2 catalysts, the above results suggest that the second components added to the Ni/SiO2 catalyst obey the following rules: First, the amount of additives should be optimized. Second, Niδ− is more beneficial to isobutene production than Niδ+. Last but not least, the structural stability of the compound formed by Ni and the added component is strongly dependent on the stoichiometric ratio.
