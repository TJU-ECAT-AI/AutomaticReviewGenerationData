[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene."
[2] "Currently, Pt-based catalysts have drawn particular attention due to their excellent catalytic performance and environment-friendly properties in commercial PDH processes."
[3] "However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering."
[4] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[5] "Among these promoters, Sn is known to be one of the most efficient promoters for decreasing the formation of coke."
[6] "However, it failed to provide strong metalsupport interactions, leading to Pt sintering, thereby reducing the activity and regenerability."
[7] "Therefore, the preparation of a stable Pt-based catalyst for the PDH reaction is still a great challenge."
[8] "For comparison, Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta were also prepared, exhibiting much lower catalytic performance and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta for PDH."
[9] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."
[10] "The effects of Sn and Pt loadings on the PDH performance over Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were further studied."
[11] "The Sn and Pt loadings are measured by ICP-OES and the results are shown in Table S1."
[12] "The optimized Sn weight loading is 0.5% when the Pt weight loading is 0.3% (Fig. 5c)."
[13] "Given the assumption that Pt atoms are individually dispersed in the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst, keeping the content of Sn (0.5 wt%) unchanged, the amount of Pt is added from 0.1 to 0.6 wt%, which guarantees the structure unchanged."
[14] "Note that the Pt weight loading of 0.3% could be optimized with the highest propane conversion and propene selectivity."
[15] "Then, at the optimized contents of Sn and Pt, the activity and stability of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta catalysts were investigated."
[16] "As shown in Fig. 6a, the initial propene formation rate for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is 1.9 times of that for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta."
[17] "The specific activity of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta at 550 C is superior, which is comparable to that of other reported PtSn catalysts at 590 C, and the catalyst life is also attractive."
[18] "In addition, the performance of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta for successive oxidation-reduction cycles was examined (Fig. 6d)."
[19] "The formation rate and selectivity of propene over the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst have no change during four cycles at 550 C, confirming its good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Specifically, the use of BEA topologic zeolites like Si-beta, along with the incorporation of Sn species into their framework, enhances the dispersion of Pt clusters and improves catalyst stability. This is due to the strong interactions between Pt and Sn sites, which prevent Pt sintering and coke deposition. The unique structure of Si-beta zeolite provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH, inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The acidic properties of the zeolite framework, adjustable through removing lattice Al atoms, can also tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for PDH.

2. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the incorporation of Sn species into the Si-beta framework, which promotes the dispersion of Pt clusters and strengthens the Pt-Sn interactions. This leads to better resistance against coke deposition and metal sintering. The confined Sn species in the Si-beta framework also facilitate the desorption of propene, preventing its conversion into deep dehydrogenation products and thus reducing coke formation. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts maintain high performance and stability over multiple cycles, showing excellent stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with unchanged catalytic activity.

1. 准晶拓扑结构的沸石催化剂，特别是Si-beta型沸石，在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石骨架的影响。通过将Sn物种引入其骨架中，可以增强铂簇的分散并提高催化剂稳定性。这是由于铂与Sn位点之间的强相互作用，防止了铂团聚和焦炭沉积。Si-beta沸石的独特结构为PDH提供了一个形状选择性的反应空间，抑制了副反应和焦炭形成。沸石框架的酸性特性，可以通过去除骨架中的铝原子进行调整，可以调节和增强PDH过程的催化活性和选择性。

2. 提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括在Si-beta骨架中引入Sn物种，这促进了铂簇的分散并加强了铂-Sn相互作用。这导致了更好的焦炭沉积和金属团聚抵抗。在Si-beta骨架中被限制的Sn物种也有助于丙烯的脱附，防止其转化为深度脱氢产物，从而减少焦炭形成。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在多个周期内保持高性能和稳定性，显示出良好的脱氢和再生稳定性，催化活性未变。
