1. The incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated beta zeolite enhances the dispersion of Pt species into ultra-small nanoclusters. This is due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. This leads to improved catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, with high propene selectivity and conversion rates, especially at temperatures up to 600°C.

2. The confinement of Sn species in the Si-beta framework facilitates the dispersion of Pt species more significantly, leading to enhanced stability against coke formation and metal sintering. This allows the catalyst to maintain high activity even after 24 hours of operation at 550°C.

3. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts outperform Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta catalysts in terms of catalytic performance for PDH reactions and stability, suggesting that the topology of the zeolite plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of Pt-based catalysts in PDH.

4. The study provides guidance for designing and synthesizing stable dehydrogenation catalysts that exhibit high selectivity and stability, highlighting the importance of the interaction between Pt and Sn species, as well as the topology of the zeolite framework in achieving optimal catalytic properties for PDH reactions.

1. 存在于四面体配合状态的Sn物种被纳入去铝化beta沸石的框架中，增强了Pt物种的分散，形成超小型纳米簇。这是由于Pt和Si-beta框架内Sn(IV)位点之间的强烈相互作用导致的。这促进了丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的催化性能，具有高丙烯选择性和转化率，尤其是在600°C温度下。

2. 在Si-beta框架中限制的Sn物种可以更显著地促进Pt物种的分散，从而提高催化剂的稳定性，防止焦炭形成和金属结块。这使得催化剂即使在550°C运行24小时后也能保持高活性。

3. Pt/Si-beta催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能和稳定性明显优于支持在Sn-H-beta催化剂上的Pt物种，表明沸石拓扑结构在确定Pt基催化剂PDH性能方面起着关键作用。

4. 研究为设计和合成具有高选择性和稳定性的脱氢催化剂提供了指导，强调了Pt和Sn物种之间的相互作用以及沸石骨架拓扑结构的重要性，在实现PDH反应最佳催化特性方面至关重要。
