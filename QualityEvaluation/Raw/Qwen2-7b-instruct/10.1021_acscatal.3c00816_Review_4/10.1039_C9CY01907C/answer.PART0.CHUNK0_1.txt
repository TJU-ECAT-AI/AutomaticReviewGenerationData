1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles in enhancing the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the use of beta zeolites with a BEA topology, which features three-dimensional structures with 12-ring channel systems, allows for a shape-selective reaction space that promotes the diffusion of propene molecules. This inhibits side reactions and coke formation. Additionally, the acidity of beta zeolites, which can be tuned through removing lattice Al atoms, creates vacant T-atom sites related to silanol groups. These sites enable the anchoring of metal precursors, leading to the generation of well-defined bimetallic systems through interactions between the introduced metal and supported metal nanoparticles.

2. The introduction of additional promoters, such as tin (Sn), into the catalyst composition helps reduce the formation of coke by increasing the electron density of platinum (Pt) atoms and weakening the adsorption of alkene products. This strategy reduces coke deposition and improves catalyst stability. However, the effectiveness of these promoters in providing strong metal-support interactions can vary. For instance, tin has been found to be particularly efficient in decreasing coke formation but may not always provide robust interactions with the support material, leading to metal sintering and reduced activity and regenerability.

3. Various methods have been explored to strengthen metal-support interactions in Pt-based catalysts. These include the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approaches, and modifications of the support material itself. Modification of the support material, in particular, has proven to be an effective method for improving catalyst stability. For example, Lu et al. reported the use of PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalysts for PDH, which exhibited high activity, selectivity, and stability. This was attributed to the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a substantial amount of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which stabilized PtSn clusters through strong interactions between metals and supports.

4. Zeolites, especially beta zeolites, are valuable in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface areas, well-defined channels, good thermal stability, and tunable acidity. Beta zeolites offer a unique structure that provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH, enhancing the diffusion of propene molecules and inhibiting side reactions and coke formation. The acidity of beta zeolites can be adjusted by removing lattice Al atoms, which generates vacant T-atom sites. These sites are ideal for anchoring metal precursors and forming bimetallic systems through interactions between the introduced metal and supported metal nanoparticles, thus enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity.

5. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts developed in this study demonstrated high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability in PDH reactions. In comparison, Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta exhibited lower catalytic performance and weaker stability. The unique interaction between Pt and Sn confined within the Si-beta framework was found to significantly influence the catalyst's performance. Detailed characterization of spent catalysts confirmed the exceptional stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在促进各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。特别是，使用具有BEA拓扑结构的β沸石，其特征为三维结构和12环通道系统，允许形成形状选择性的反应空间，促进丙烯分子的扩散。这可以抑制副反应和焦碳形成。此外，可以通过移除沸石框架中的Al原子来调整β沸石的酸性，从而产生与引入金属和支持金属纳米粒子之间的相互作用相关的空T-原子位点。这些位点使金属前体能够锚定，进而通过引入的金属和支持金属纳米颗粒之间的相互作用生成定义明确的双金属体系，从而提高催化活性和选择性。

2. 将附加促进剂，如锡（Sn），引入催化剂组成中有助于减少焦碳的形成，通过增加铂（Pt）原子的电子密度并减弱烷二烯产物的吸附。这种策略减少了焦碳沉积并提高了催化剂稳定性。然而，这些促进剂在提供金属支持相互作用的有效性方面可能有所不同。例如，锡已被发现特别有效于减少焦碳形成，但可能不会总是与支持材料提供稳定的相互作用，导致金属结块并降低活性和再生能力。

3. 已经探索了多种方法来增强Pt基催化剂的金属支持相互作用。这些包括纳米孔封装金属策略、湿化学方法以及对支持材料本身的修改。特别是，修改支持材料被证明是提高催化剂稳定性的有效方法。例如，Lu等人报道了用于PDH的PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂，该催化剂表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性。这归因于γ-Al2O3纳米片中含有大量五配位Al3+离子，这些离子通过金属和支持材料之间的强相互作用稳定了PtSn簇。

4. 沸石，尤其是β沸石，由于其高的比表面积、定义明确的通道、良好的热稳定性和可调的酸性，在异相催化中非常有价值。β沸石提供了独特的结构，为PDH提供了形状选择性的反应空间，增强了丙烯分子的扩散，并抑制了副反应和焦碳形成。可以通过移除沸石骨架中的Al原子来调整沸石的酸性，从而产生与引入金属和支持金属纳米颗粒之间的相互作用相关的空T-原子位点。这些位点非常适合锚定金属前体并形成通过引入的金属和支持金属纳米颗粒之间的相互作用定义明确的双金属体系，从而提高催化活性和选择性。

5. 在这项研究中开发的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH反应中显示出高催化活性、良好选择性和出色的稳定性。相比之下，Pt物种支持在Sn-H-beta上表现出较低的催化性能和较弱的稳定性。Pt和Sn在Si-beta框架内形成的独特相互作用显著影响了催化剂的性能。对耗尽催化剂的详细表征证实了Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂的卓越稳定性。
