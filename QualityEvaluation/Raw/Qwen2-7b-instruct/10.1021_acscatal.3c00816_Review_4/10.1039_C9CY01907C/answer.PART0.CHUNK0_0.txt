[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene."
[2] "However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering."
[3] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."
[4] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."
[5] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta)."
[6] "Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."
[7] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."
[8] "For comparison, Pt species supported on the Sn-H-beta catalyst exhibit much lower catalytic performance for PDH and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions by affecting the dispersion of precious metal catalysts and their interaction with zeolite framework. Specifically, the incorporation of promoter elements like tin (Sn) into the zeolite framework enhances the dispersion of precious metal clusters and improves stability through strong interactions, reducing coke deposition and metal sintering.

2. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are the confinement effect of tin species in the zeolite framework, which facilitates the dispersion of precious metal clusters and promotes strong interactions between the metal and the zeolite. This results in enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, as well as resistance to coke formation and metal sintering.
