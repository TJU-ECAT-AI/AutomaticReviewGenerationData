1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the incorporation of tin (Sn) species into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta) zeolite, along with the dispersion of platinum (Pt) species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters, contributes to the enhanced catalytic performance. The strong interactions between Pt and Sn(IV) sites within the Si-beta framework enable high dispersion of Pt clusters and improve catalyst stability. 

2. The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts exhibit an excellent propene formation rate of 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity exceeding 99% at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. This high performance is attributed to the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework, which prevent coke and sintering of Pt clusters. This leads to excellent stability during dehydrogenation and regeneration processes, maintaining almost unchanged catalytic activity over four cycles at 550 C.

1. 制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。具体而言，将锡(Sn)物种引入去铝化贝塔(Si-beta)沸石骨架中，以及铂(Pt)物种以超小纳米团簇的形式分散，有助于增强催化性能。Si-beta框架内Pt和Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用使Pt簇高度分散，并提高了催化剂稳定性。

2. Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在550°C时的丙烯生成速率高达2.3 mol g1Pt h1，丙烯选择性超过99%，并在600°C时的更高丙烯生成速率为3.1 mol g1Pt h1。这种高性能归因于强PtSn相互作用和Si-beta框架中Sn的限制效应，防止了Pt簇的焦炭和烧结。这导致了良好的脱氢和再生过程稳定性，在550°C下连续四次循环时保持几乎不变的催化活性。
