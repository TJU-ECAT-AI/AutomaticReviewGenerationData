The ALD process creates high-density ZnO sites on the support, enhancing catalytic activity but potentially causing coke species formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, which accelerates catalyst deactivation. For ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalysts, coke formation is the main reason for deactivation. The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is attributed to the combined impact of coke formation, catalytic phase sintering or crystallization, and ZnO evaporation.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the addition of phosphorus, as demonstrated in the study. The catalysts' performance was enhanced through the use of phosphorus addition, leading to better propylene selectivity and conversion rate. Higher phosphorus content in the catalysts resulted in better stability during the reaction.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles in determining the performance of zeolite-based catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Among these factors, BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites demonstrate superior propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.
