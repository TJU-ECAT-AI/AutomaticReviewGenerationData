          [5] "Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH."
          [6] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [7] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [8] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [9] "CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods."
          [10] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C."
          [11] "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."
