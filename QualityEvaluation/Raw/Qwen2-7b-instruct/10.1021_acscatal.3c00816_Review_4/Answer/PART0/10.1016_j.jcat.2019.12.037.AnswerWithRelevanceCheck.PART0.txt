          [1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene."
          [2] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."
          [3] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation."
          [4] "Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction."
          [5] "Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH."
          [6] "The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH."
          [7] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
          [8] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."
          [9] "CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods."
          [10] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C."
          [11] "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, particularly when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols. This configuration facilitates high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoOx species, which can easily be reduced to metallic Co particles, are crucial for the catalyst's activity. The presence of CoOx species in the T-sites of the SiBeta support contributes to the catalyst's superior performance. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts. The small confined Co particles serve as the active sites, showing great catalytic activity with high product selectivity and excellent reusability. This research provides a green, cost-effective, and highly active catalyst for PDH reactions, offering new insights into the active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH.

          [1] "Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions."
          [2] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
          [3] "It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment."
          [4] "The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."

          The dealuminated Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. provides a way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, which are advantageous for catalytic reactions due to the creation of T-vacant sites and low acidity. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst, with a cobalt loading of 0.5 wt%, demonstrated remarkable performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity at 600°C. This performance surpasses other reported cobalt catalysts and is equivalent to that of industrial catalysts. It was observed that the CoOx species confined within the catalyst could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, explaining why the CoSiBeta catalysts, regardless of pre-reduction, exhibit similar catalytic performance. Furthermore, the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH was confirmed by the change in turnover frequency (TOF) values at different weight hour space velocities (WHSV) as depicted in Figure S11.

          Dzwigaj等人开发的去铝化贝塔沸石提供了进一步修改其结构和酸性特性的途径，由于产生了T空位和低酸度，这对于催化反应是有利的。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂，钴加载量为0.5 wt%，在600°C时展示了丙烷脱氢的出色性能，实现了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这一性能超越了其他报道的钴催化剂，并与工业催化剂相当。观察到催化剂中封闭的CoOx物种可以在反应中被还原为金属Co颗粒，这解释了为何不论预还原与否，CoSiBeta催化剂都能展现出相似的催化性能。此外，通过图S11中不同质量小时空间速度（WHSV）下的周转频率（TOF）值的变化，证实了0.5CoSiBeta催化剂在PDH过程中的内在活性。
