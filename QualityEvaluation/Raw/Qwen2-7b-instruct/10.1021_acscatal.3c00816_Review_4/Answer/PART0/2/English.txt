For both types of zeolites, catalysts fabricated with just 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD outperform those made with multiple cycles, suggesting that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for converting propane to propylene and aromatics. The deactivation of ALD ZnO modified zeolites, especially those supported on ZSM-5, is primarily caused by coke formation, leading to loss of catalytic activity. The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is a result of the complex interplay between coke formation, catalytic phase sintering or crystallization, and ZnO evaporation, collectively accelerating the catalyst's decline in performance.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, by enhancing propylene selectivity, increasing conversion rates, and improving catalyst stability. Key factors contributing to these improvements include the synergistic effect of nickel and phosphorus, which leads to better surface properties of the catalyst. Additionally, the optimized catalyst demonstrates increased resistance to sintering and coke formation.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Ga+-chabazite zeolite, with its unique topology and acidic properties, demonstrates high activity and selectivity in nonoxidative PDH, offering a higher propylene yield compared to conventional catalysts. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites contribute to improved performance due to their well-defined pore structure and high surface area, which enhance catalytic efficiency. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in particular, exhibit superior stability under harsh reaction conditions. The precise control over the zeolite framework results in high selectivity and conversion rates in PDH reactions.

The second question delves deeper into the specific mechanisms and outcomes of using zeolites with different topologies and compositions for PDH, particularly focusing on the stability and selectivity of the products. The answers highlight the role of indium in influencing the properties of these catalysts, such as its ability to form stable extra-framework species and the effect of different support materials (like silica, alumina, and chabazite) on the catalyst's performance. The discussion on the stability of isolated In+ in CHA for ethane dehydrogenation and the superior performance of In-CHA in propane dehydrogenation compared to other types of catalysts further underscores the relevance of the answers to the question.

The Pt@MCM-22 sample utilized in the experiment contained 1.10g of catalyst. Prior to the reaction, the sample underwent reduction with H2 at a temperature of 550°C. The actual reaction took place at 550°C with a flow rate of 30ml/min of propane and 3ml/min of N2 for a duration of 15 minutes. Following the reaction, a regeneration step was conducted at 550°C with an airflow for 30 minutes. To determine the initial reaction rate, the conversion of C3H8 was maintained below 10%.

The dealuminated Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. provides a way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, which are advantageous for catalytic reactions due to the creation of T-vacant sites and low acidity. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst, with a cobalt loading of 0.5 wt%, demonstrated remarkable performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity at 600°C. This performance surpasses other reported cobalt catalysts and is equivalent to that of industrial catalysts. It was observed that the CoOx species confined within the catalyst could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, explaining why the CoSiBeta catalysts, regardless of pre-reduction, exhibit similar catalytic performance. Furthermore, the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH was confirmed by the change in turnover frequency (TOF) values at different weight hour space velocities (WHSV) as depicted in Figure S11.
