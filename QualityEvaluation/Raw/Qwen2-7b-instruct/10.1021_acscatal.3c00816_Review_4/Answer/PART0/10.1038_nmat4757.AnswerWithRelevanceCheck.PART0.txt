          [1] "High-temperature stability of Pt@MCM-22 The exceptional stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated by performing oxidation-reduction treatments at 650C. Under such harsh conditions, small Pt NPs with sizes of approximately 1nm can be found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of oxidation-reduction treatment at 650C (see Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 14). Those individual Pt atoms and small Pt clusters with a few atoms located in the internal space of the MCM-22 crystallites have mostly aggregated to larger Pt clusters or small Pt NPs (in the range of 1 to 2nm)."
          [2] "Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperature41. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C."

          The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, resulting in the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm. These nanoparticles are found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of treatment at this temperature. Individual Pt atoms and small Pt clusters within the MCM-22 crystallites aggregate to form larger Pt clusters or small Pt nanoparticles in the range of 1 to 2nm. Considering the exceptional stability of Pt@MCM-22, its catalytic activity for dehydrogenating propane has been tested. It is noted that the dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is crucial for alkane activation and requires frequent regeneration cycles at high temperatures. At 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 demonstrates higher activity than the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst.

          通过650°C的氧化还原处理，证明了Pt@MCM-22中亚纳米级铂物种的高温稳定性，形成了大小约为1nm的小铂纳米颗粒。在650°C的处理后一个周期，这些纳米颗粒存在于Pt@MCM-22中。位于MCM-22结晶体内部空间的单个铂原子和小型铂簇聚集形成较大铂簇或小铂纳米颗粒（范围在1到2nm之间）。考虑到Pt@MCM-22的非凡稳定性，对其在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化活性进行了测试。注意到，对于烷烃的激活和在高温下频繁再生循环，短烷烃分子的脱氢至关重要。在550°C下，Pt@MCM-22的活性高于Pt/MCM-22-imp催化剂。

          [1] "In the case of the Pt@MCM-22 sample, the amount of catalyst was 1.10g."
          [2] "Before the reaction, the sample was reduced by H2 at 550C."
          [3] "The reaction was run at 550C with a flow of 30mlmin1 of propane and 3mlmin1 of N2 for 15min, followed by a regeneration step at 550C with a flow of air for 30min."
          [4] "Conversion of C3H8 was kept below 10% to calculate the initial reaction rate."

          The Pt@MCM-22 sample utilized in the experiment contained 1.10g of catalyst. Prior to the reaction, the sample underwent reduction with H2 at a temperature of 550°C. The actual reaction took place at 550°C with a flow rate of 30ml/min of propane and 3ml/min of N2 for a duration of 15 minutes. Following the reaction, a regeneration step was conducted at 550°C with an airflow for 30 minutes. To determine the initial reaction rate, the conversion of C3H8 was maintained below 10%.

          实验中使用的Pt@MCM-22样品含有1.10g的催化剂。在反应之前，样品在550°C下用H2进行了还原。实际反应在550°C下进行，丙烷的流速为每分钟30ml，氮气流速为每分钟3ml，持续时间为15分钟。反应结束后，进行了550°C下的再生步骤，空气流速为30分钟。为了计算初始反应速率，C3H8的转化率保持在10%以下。
