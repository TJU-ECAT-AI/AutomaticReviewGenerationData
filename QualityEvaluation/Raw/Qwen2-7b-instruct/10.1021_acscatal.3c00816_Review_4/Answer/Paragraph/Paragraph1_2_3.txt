        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032], [10.1021/jacs.2c03941], and [10.1038/nmat4757]. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Incorporation of phosphorus (P) to a nickel-phosphorus (NiP) catalyst enhances its performance in isobutane dehydrogenation, while the BEA topological structure of the zeolite enhances catalytic activity. Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites exhibit better stability and selectivity towards propylene compared to other types of zeolites. The ALD process generates high-density ZnO sites on the support, which boosts catalytic activity but also risks coke formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation. The micropore size of Y zeolite allows precursor molecules to easily enter the micropores during the first three ALD cycles, increasing its conversion rate to 1116% at 550°C. After stability tests, the catalyst color transitions from white to black, indicating potential deactivation mechanisms. The addition of phosphorus to NiP catalysts, the BEA topological structure of zeolites, and the use of SAPO zeolites improve propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

        Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and its corresponding influence on catalytic performance is essential for advancing In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The complex signal may result from the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at high In loading having various reduction temperatures and an elevated temperature needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when sites are consumed mainly at lower temperatures. FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides information about the indium speciation of the reduced samples.

        High-temperature stability of Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, resulting in the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm. These nanoparticles demonstrate higher activity than conventional Pt catalysts at 550°C for dehydrogenating propane. The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 leads to the formation of Pt nanoparticles in the range of 1 to 2nm, which exhibit higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C. 

        Continuous global oil depletion has provoked the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene, making direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. Cobalt (Co) shows a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH, and dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, when modified with Co, enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols, facilitating high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts.

        Questions focus on the impact of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition on the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), particularly regarding the role of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The discussion centers on how indium species, especially in the form of [InH2]+, affect the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. The relevance is evident in the exploration of how factors like indium loading, support materials, and the structure of the zeolite influence the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propylene. The mention of specific phenomena, such as the formation of extra-framework indium species (In-CHA), the role of Si/Al ratios, and the stability of catalysts over time, all contribute to the relevance of the answers to the questions.

The presence of CoOx species in the T-sites of the SiBeta support contributes to the catalyst's superior performance. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts. The small confined Co particles serve as the active sites, showing great catalytic activity with high product selectivity and excellent reusability. This research provides a green, cost-effective, and highly active catalyst for PDH reactions, offering new insights into the active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH.

Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction. Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, particularly when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols. This configuration facilitates high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts.

        The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, resulting in the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm. These nanoparticles demonstrate higher activity than conventional Pt catalysts at 550°C for dehydrogenating propane.

These nanoparticles demonstrate higher activity than conventional Pt catalysts at 550°C for dehydrogenating propane. The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 leads to the formation of Pt nanoparticles in the range of 1 to 2nm, which exhibit higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C.

        The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction. Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, particularly when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols. This configuration facilitates high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts.

        The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, resulting in the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm. These nanoparticles demonstrate higher activity than conventional Pt catalysts at 550°C for dehydrogenating propane.
