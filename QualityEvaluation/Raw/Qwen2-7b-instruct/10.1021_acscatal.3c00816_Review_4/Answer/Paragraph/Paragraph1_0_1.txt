        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1039/C5CP05043J\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032\], \[10.1021/jacs.2c03941\], and \[10.1039/D1SC05866E\]. Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The complex signal may result from the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at a high In loading, having a variety of reduction temperatures, and an elevated temperature needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when the sites have been consumed mainly at lower temperatures. FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides information about the indium speciation of the reduced samples.

        High-temperature stability of Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated, with the subnanometric Pt species forming small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm after one cycle of treatment at 650°C. This stability is crucial for dehydrogenating propane, as it requires frequent regeneration cycles at high temperatures. The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support, bringing about excellent catalytic activity but also facilitating the generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, leading to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst.

        Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols, facilitating high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity.

        The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. The BEA topological structure of the zeolite enhances catalytic activity, while silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites exhibit better stability and selectivity towards propylene compared to other types of zeolites. These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

        The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, resulting in the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm. These nanoparticles are found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of treatment at this temperature. Considering the exceptional stability of Pt@MCM-22, its catalytic activity for dehydrogenating propane has been tested. It is noted that the dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is crucial for alkane activation and requires frequent regeneration cycles at high temperatures. At 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 demonstrates higher activity than the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst.

        Questions focus on the impact of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition on the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH, particularly regarding the role of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The discussion centers on how indium species, especially in the form of [InH2]+, affect the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. The relevance is evident in the exploration of how factors like indium loading, support materials, and the structure of the zeolite influence the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propylene. The mention of specific phenomena, such as the formation of extra-framework indium species (In-CHA), the role of Si/Al ratios, and the stability of catalysts over time, all contribute to the relevance of the answers to the questions.

Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The complex signal may result from two factors: the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at a high In loading (14%) having a variety of reduction temperatures, and an elevated temperature being needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when the sites have been consumed mainly at lower temperatures.
