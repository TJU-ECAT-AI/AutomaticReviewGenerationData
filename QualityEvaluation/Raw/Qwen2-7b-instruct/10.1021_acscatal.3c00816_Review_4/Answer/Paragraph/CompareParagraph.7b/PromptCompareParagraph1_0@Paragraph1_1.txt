        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the preparation techniques for catalysts, particularly in utilizing advanced deposition-assembly techniques like atomic layer deposition (ALD) to tailor the surface properties of zeolites. The exploration of new metal-support interactions, especially in the context of transition metals like cobalt and nickel, could lead to the development of more stable and selective catalysts. Additionally, there is a need for systematic studies to understand the precise relationship between the zeolite topology, composition, and catalytic performance, which could guide the design of more efficient zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions. The integration of computational chemistry methods could further enhance our understanding of the reaction mechanisms and provide insights into the active sites on the catalyst surfaces. Future work might also aim to develop catalysts with improved recyclability and longevity, addressing the environmental concerns associated with the disposal of spent catalysts.
