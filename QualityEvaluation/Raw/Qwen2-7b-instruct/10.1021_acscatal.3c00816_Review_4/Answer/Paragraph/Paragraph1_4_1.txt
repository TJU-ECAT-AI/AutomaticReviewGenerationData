        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032], [10.1021/jacs.2c03941], and [10.1038/nmat4757]. The inclusion of [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037] adds depth to our understanding of the role of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition in enhancing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The focus on BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites highlights their contribution to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

        The ALD process, for instance, significantly boosts the activity of Y zeolite, increasing its conversion rate to 1116% at 550°C when subjected to 13 cycles of ZnO ALD. This finding, coupled with the observation that the nanolith catalytic system surpasses conventional powders in oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, underscores the efficiency and reduction in over-oxidation. Moreover, the ALD process generates high-density ZnO sites on the support, which enhances catalytic activity but also introduces risks of coke formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, accelerating catalyst deactivation.

        The micropore size of Y zeolite being notably larger than that of DEZ facilitates the easy entry of precursor molecules into the micropores during the initial ALD cycles, highlighting the importance of pore size in catalytic performance. The color change from white to black after stability tests indicates potential deactivation mechanisms.

        The addition of phosphorus (P) to a nickel-phosphorus (NiP) catalyst significantly improves its performance in isobutane dehydrogenation, showcasing the impact of composition on catalytic activity. The BEA topological structure of the zeolite enhances catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation, while SAPO zeolites demonstrate better stability and selectivity towards propylene, contributing to overall performance enhancements.

        The BEA and SAPO zeolites, with their distinct structural characteristics, play pivotal roles in achieving improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. This is further supported by the finding that the Ga+-chabazite zeolite is highly selective for non-oxidative PDH, and dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles, facilitating high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity.

        Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and its influence on catalytic performance is crucial for advancing In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The complex signal resulting from varying reduction temperatures of In2O3 particles and the need for higher temperatures to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when sites are consumed at lower temperatures underscores the intricacies involved in optimizing catalyst performance.

        FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides valuable insights into the indium speciation of the reduced samples, emphasizing the importance of molecular-level interactions in determining catalytic activity.

        The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22, demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments, highlights the exceptional stability of the catalyst under harsh conditions. This stability leads to higher activity than conventional Pt catalysts, making it suitable for dehydrogenating propane at 550°C.

        The increasing world demand for propylene and the low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in PDH, making it of great significance in the chemical industry for upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. The use of supported CrOx and Pt catalysts in PDH industries exhibits high catalytic activity but faces challenges such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. The exploration of alternative transition metals, like cobalt, offers a promising avenue for developing green, cost-effective, and highly active catalysts for PDH reactions, providing new insights into the active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH.

        The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, with BEA topology and SAPO zeolites playing critical roles in enhancing performance attributes. The insights gained from these studies can guide future research efforts in developing more efficient and sustainable catalysts for PDH processes.

Future research endeavors might focus on refining the ALD process for the synthesis of high-performance zeolite-based catalysts, optimizing the interaction between zeolite topology and composition to achieve unparalleled catalytic activity, and investigating the synergistic effects of multiple metal additives to enhance propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. Additionally, there is potential to delve deeper into the mechanisms governing coke formation and crystallization, aiming to develop strategies for mitigating these issues and extending catalyst lifetime. The integration of advanced computational tools for predicting catalyst performance and screening novel materials could revolutionize the design and development of zeolite-based catalysts for PDH, paving the way for more environmentally friendly and economically viable propylene production processes.
