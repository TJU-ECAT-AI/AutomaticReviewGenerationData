        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032], [10.1021/jacs.2c03941], and [10.1038/nmat4757]. Understanding of the role of phosphorus (P) in enhancing the performance of nickel-phosphorus (NiP) catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation, as highlighted in reference [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032]. The importance of the BEA topological structure in enhancing the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation, as discussed in reference [10.1021/jacs.2c03941]. The superior stability and selectivity of silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites towards propylene compared to other types of zeolites, as noted in reference [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032].

        The ALD process plays a pivotal role in enhancing the activity of Y zeolite, increasing its conversion rate to 1116% at 550°C when prepared through 13 cycles of ZnO ALD, as documented in reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. The nanolith catalytic system outperforms conventional powders in oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, as stated in reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. The ALD process generates high-density ZnO sites on the support, which boosts catalytic activity but also risks coke formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation, as explained in reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. The micropore size of Y zeolite being much larger than that of DEZ allows precursor molecules to easily enter the micropores during the first three ALD cycles, as described in reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. Post-stability testing results indicate a color change from white to black, suggesting potential deactivation mechanisms, as reported in reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J].

        The high-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22, demonstrated by performing oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, has been shown to enhance the catalytic activity, as evidenced in reference [10.1038/nmat4757]. The enhanced stability of Pt@MCM-22 leads to the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm, facilitating high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity, as observed in reference [10.1038/nmat4757].

        Questions focus on the impact of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition on the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), particularly regarding the role of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, as emphasized in reference [10.1039/D1SC05866E]. The relevance of these factors in influencing the efficiency of catalysts in converting propane to propylene is evident in the exploration of how factors like indium loading, support materials, and the structure of the zeolite affect the catalyst's performance, as discussed in reference [10.1039/D1SC05866E].

        The earth abundance of cobalt (Co) offers long-term utility, as indicated in reference [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037]. The dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, when modified with cobalt, enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols, facilitating high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoOx species, which can easily be reduced to metallic Co particles, are crucial for the catalyst's activity. The presence of CoOx species in the T-sites of the SiBeta support contributes to the catalyst's superior performance, as detailed in reference [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037].

        Continuous global oil depletion has sparked the urgent demand for finding an alternative method to produce propylene, as pointed out in reference [10.1039/D1SC05866E]. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is of great significance in the chemical industry, as upgraded low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, as explained in reference [10.1039/D1SC05866E].

        This review section highlights the critical role of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition in the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, with a particular focus on the impact of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. It emphasizes the importance of factors such as phosphorus addition, BEA structure, and cobalt modification in enhancing catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity, contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.
