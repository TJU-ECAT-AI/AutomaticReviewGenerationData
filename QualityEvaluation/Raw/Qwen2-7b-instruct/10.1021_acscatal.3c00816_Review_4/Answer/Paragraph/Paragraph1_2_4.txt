        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1039/C5CP05043J]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acs.iecr.9b00032], [10.1021/jacs.2c03941], and [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037]. 
        The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Incorporation of phosphorus (P) to a nickel-phosphorus (NiP) catalyst improves its performance in isobutane dehydrogenation, while the BEA topological structure of the zeolite enhances catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation. Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites show better stability and selectivity towards propylene compared to other types of zeolites. Improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are attributed to specific features of the BEA and SAPO zeolites.
        
        The ALD process significantly enhances the activity of the Y zeolite, increasing its conversion rate to 1116% at 550°C when prepared through 13 cycles of ZnO ALD. The nanolith catalytic system outperforms conventional powders in oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, demonstrating both efficiency and reduction in over-oxidation. The ALD process generates high-density ZnO sites on the support, which boosts catalytic activity but also risks coke formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation. The micropore size of Y zeolite is notably larger than that of DEZ, allowing precursor molecules to easily enter the micropores during the first three ALD cycles. Post-stability testing, the catalyst color transitions from white to black, indicating potential deactivation mechanisms.
        
        High-temperature stability of the subnanometric Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 has been demonstrated through oxidation-reduction treatments at 650°C, resulting in the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with sizes around 1nm. These nanoparticles are found in Pt@MCM-22 after one cycle of treatment at this temperature. Considering the exceptional stability of Pt@MCM-22, its catalytic activity for dehydrogenating propane has been tested, demonstrating higher activity than the Pt/MCM-22-imp catalyst at 550°C. Dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes often require frequent regeneration cycles at high temperatures.
        
        The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, particularly when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols. This configuration facilitates high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoOx species, which can easily be reduced to metallic Co particles, are crucial for the catalyst's activity. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts.
        
        Questions focus on the impact of zeolite topology, preparation methods, and composition on the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, particularly regarding the role of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. Indium species, especially in the form of [InH2]+, affect the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. The relevance is evident in the exploration of how factors like indium loading, support materials, and the structure of the zeolite influence the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propylene. The mention of specific phenomena, such as the formation of extra-framework indium species (In-CHA), the role of Si/Al ratios, and the stability of catalysts over time, all contribute to the relevance of the answers to the questions.
        
        Understanding the support impact on indium speciation and the corresponding influence on catalytic performance is thus important to advance In-based catalyst understanding for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The complex signal may result from two factors: (1) the distribution of In2O3 particle sizes at a high In loading (14%) had a variety of reduction temperatures; (2) an elevated temperature was needed to drive the reaction of In2O3 with BASs when the sites had been consumed mainly at lower temperatures. FTIR spectroscopy of d3-acetonitrile (CD3CN) adsorption provides information about the indium speciation of the reduced samples.
        
        The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene. Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation. Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction. Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH.

        The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH. CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction. The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support. CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C. This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction.
        
        The micropore size of Y zeolite is much larger than the diameter of DEZ so that the precursor molecules could easily enter the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD.

        Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction-regeneration cycles at high temperature41. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C.

        制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。向镍磷（NiP）催化剂中添加磷（P）可以提高其异丁烷脱氢的性能。BEA拓扑结构的沸石提高了丙烷脱氢的催化活性。硅铝磷酸盐（SAPO）沸石相对于其他类型的沸石显示出更好的稳定性和丙烯选择性。改善的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性归因于BEA和SAPO沸石的特定特性。

        Y沸石的ALD过程显著增强了其活性，通过13个周期的ZnO ALD制备，其在550°C时的转换率达到1116%。纳米石催化系统在氧化脱氢环己烷中优于常规粉末催化剂，在效率和减少过氧化方面表现出优势。ALD过程在支持物上生成高密度的ZnO位点，这提升了催化活性，但也可能促进焦炭物种的生成和催化相的结晶，导致催化剂加速失活。Y沸石的微孔尺寸远大于DEZ的直径，使得前体分子在前三个ALD周期内容易进入微孔。稳定性测试后，催化剂样品的颜色从白色变为黑色，表明潜在的失活机制。

        高温稳定性下，Pt@MCM-22中亚纳米级的Pt物种已被证明通过650°C的氧化还原处理而得到验证，形成了大小约为1nm的小Pt纳米颗粒。这些纳米颗粒在650°C处理一次后存在于Pt@MCM-22中。考虑到Pt@MCM-22的卓越稳定性，对其用于脱氢丙烷的催化活性进行了测试，显示其在550°C时的活性高于Pt/MCM-22-imp催化剂。脱氢短烷烃对于烷烃的激活具有重要意义，并且催化过程往往需要在高温下进行频繁的再生循环。

        了解支持物上铟物种的特征化及其对应对催化性能的影响对于推进基于烷烃脱氢的In基催化剂的理解至关重要。复杂的信号可能源自两个因素：（1）在14%高In负载下In2O3粒子大小的分布具有多种还原温度；（2）需要提高温度来驱动In2O3与BASs的反应，当这些站点主要在较低温度下被消耗时。红外光谱（FTIR）吸附d3-乙腈（CD3CN）提供关于还原样品中铟物种的信息。

        世界对丙烯的持续需求和来自页岩气的低廉丙烷价格激发了对丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）的兴趣。直接将丙烷（PDH）脱氢为丙烯在化学工业中具有重大意义，升级廉价且丰富的丙烷为附加值更高的丙烯。支持CrOx和Pt催化剂在PDH行业中的使用表现出非常高的催化活性，但存在各种问题，如价格高、环境敌对和快速失活。作为替代方案，已经调查了几种没有典型CrOx和Pt催化剂缺点的过渡金属。不幸的是，它们的催化活性或丙烯选择性都大大低于PDH。
