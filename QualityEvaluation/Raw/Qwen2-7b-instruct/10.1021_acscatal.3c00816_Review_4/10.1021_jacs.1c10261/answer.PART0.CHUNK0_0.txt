The preparation methods, specifically the dealumination process and subsequent impregnation of Zn and Si precursors onto the dealuminated zeolite beta, along with the creation of SiOZnOH nests, significantly influenced the performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. This resulted in enhanced propylene selectivity and conversion rates due to the stable support provided by the SiOZnOH nests for isolated Pt atoms. The topology of the zeolite beta played a crucial role in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction without causing sintering of the metal particles, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst.

制备方法，特别是去铝过程和随后在去铝沸石贝塔上浸渍Zn和Si前体，以及SiOZnOH巢穴的形成，对丙烷脱氢催化剂的性能产生了重大影响。这导致了丙烯选择性和转化率的提高，这是由于SiOZnOH巢穴为孤立的Pt原子提供了稳定的支撑。沸石贝塔的拓扑结构在促进脱氢反应的同时，防止了金属颗粒的结块，从而整体提高了催化剂的性能。
