The preparation methods, specifically the dealumination process and subsequent impregnation of Zn and Si precursors onto the dealuminated zeolite beta, along with the creation of SiOZnOH nests, significantly influenced the performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. This resulted in enhanced propylene selectivity and conversion rates due to the stable support provided by the SiOZnOH nests for isolated Pt atoms. The topology of the zeolite beta played a crucial role in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction without causing sintering of the metal particles, thereby improving the overall performance of the catalyst.
