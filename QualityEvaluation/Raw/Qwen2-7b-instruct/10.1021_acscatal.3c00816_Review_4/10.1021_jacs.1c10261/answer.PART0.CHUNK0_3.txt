The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles in enhancing the performance of catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites show superior propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability due to the unique properties of isolated Pt atoms within SiOZnOH nests in the dealuminated Zeolite Beta structure.
