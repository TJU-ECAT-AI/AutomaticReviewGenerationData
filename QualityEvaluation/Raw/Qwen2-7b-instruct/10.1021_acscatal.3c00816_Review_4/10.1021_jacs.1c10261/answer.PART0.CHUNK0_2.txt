The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, when combined with isolated Pt atoms in SiOZnOH nests, offer improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. Key factors contributing to these enhancements include the unique structure of the zeolite, the presence of isolated Pt atoms, and the specific composition of the SiOZnOH nests. The removal of aluminum in dealuminated zeolite beta provides a more active surface for PDH reactions, while the use of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites optimizes the balance between propylene selectivity and conversion efficiency. Isolated Pt atoms within the SiOZnOH nests demonstrate superior activity and stability, leading to enhanced performance in PDH reactions.
