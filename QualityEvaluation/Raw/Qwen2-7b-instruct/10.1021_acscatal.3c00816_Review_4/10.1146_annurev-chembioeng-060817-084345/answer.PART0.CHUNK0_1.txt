在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，各种沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能有着显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括所用沸石的类型、添加剂的存在以及催化剂操作的条件。BEA拓扑结构的沸石，如ZSM-5，通常用于PDH，因为它们具有高丙烯选择性和高效的丙烷转化为丙烯能力。硅铝磷酸盐（SAPO）沸石也已被探索用于PDH，可能提供稳定性与选择性方面的优势。催化剂的组成，包括添加的改性剂的类型和数量，可以影响其PDH反应的性能。沸石拓扑结构决定了孔径大小和形状，从而影响反应物和产物的可接近性，进而影响反应速率和选择性。温度、压力以及氧或氮等共反应物的存在等条件也能影响基于沸石的PDH催化剂的性能。
