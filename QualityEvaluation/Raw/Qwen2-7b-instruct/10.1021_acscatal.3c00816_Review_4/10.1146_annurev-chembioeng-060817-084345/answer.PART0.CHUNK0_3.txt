The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Zeolites such as HZSM-5 and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites exhibit distinct catalytic activities due to their unique structures. The continuous polyolefin cracking on an HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in a conical spouted bed reactor facilitates the production of light olefins from polyethylene through a two-step process involving pyrolysis and downstream high-temperature thermal cracking. The specific topology of these zeolites enhances the selectivity and conversion rates, contributing to improved propylene yield and catalyst stability.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在丙烷脱氢反应中对各种沸石基催化剂的性能产生显著影响。如HZSM-5和硅铝磷酸盐沸石等沸石显示出不同的催化活性，这是由于它们独特的结构。在锥形喷射床反应器中使用HZSM-5沸石催化剂进行连续聚烯烃裂解，通过两步过程（裂解和下游高温热裂解）生产轻质烯烃。这些沸石的独特结构提高了选择性和转化率，从而改善了丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。
