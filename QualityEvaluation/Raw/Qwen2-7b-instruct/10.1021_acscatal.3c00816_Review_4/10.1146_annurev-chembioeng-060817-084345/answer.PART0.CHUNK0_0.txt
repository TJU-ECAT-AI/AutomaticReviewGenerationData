在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响各种沸石基催化剂的性能。BEA拓扑结构沸石和硅铝磷酸盐沸石由于其独特的性质表现出增强的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。沸石孔的特定形状选择性影响反应途径，导致丙烯选择性的提高。使用硅铝磷酸盐（SAPOs）作为催化剂比传统沸石具有更高的稳定性和活性，因为它们具有有序的微孔结构。在沸石框架中引入金属促进剂可以增强脱氢活性和选择性，从而增加丙烯产率。为了实现最佳性能，需要使沸石拓扑与反应物的大小和形状相匹配，以实现高效的吸附和反应。沸石孔径和酸度决定了PDH过程中的反应途径和产物分布。为了提高丙烯选择性，催化剂需要精细调整其酸性和碱性以平衡竞争的脱氢和裂解反应。沸石表面存在的特定金属位点作为丙烷氧化脱氢的活性中心，影响丙烯产率。
