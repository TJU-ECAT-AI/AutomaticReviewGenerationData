[1] "The performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology."
[2] "BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites have been extensively studied due to their potential in improving propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability."
[3] "Key factors contributing to these improvements include the specific structure of the zeolite, the type and amount of metal promoters, and the presence of additional modifiers such as alkaline earth metals or halides."
[4] "For instance, lithium chloride (LiCl) has been shown to enhance PDH activity when supported on zirconia or other supports, leading to increased propylene selectivity and stability."
[5] "Silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs) offer tunable acidity and surface properties, which can be optimized for PDH to achieve better performance."
[6] "The topology of the zeolite, such as the BEA framework, provides a large internal surface area and specific pore sizes that favor the desired PDH reactions."

各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括特定的沸石结构、金属促进剂的类型和数量以及碱土金属或卤素等额外修饰剂的存在。例如，氯化锂（LiCl）增强PDH活性，当支持在锆或其它支撑材料上时，导致丙烯选择性和稳定性增加。硅铝磷（SAPOs）提供可调的酸性和表面性质，优化PDH性能。沸石的拓扑结构，如BEA框架，提供了大量内部表面积和特定孔径，有利于所需的PDH反应。
