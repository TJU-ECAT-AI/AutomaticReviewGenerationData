<p>In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity.</p>
<p>Various metal promoters, such as Sn,37,41 Zn,42,43 Cu,44,45 Fe,46,47 Co,48 Mn,49 In,50,51 Ga,52,53 V,54 and Ti,55 have often been chosen according to their electronegativity, cost, toxicity and so forth (Fig. 6a).</p>

<p>The exact active sites of various Pt-based catalysts and the corresponding reaction mechanisms in the PDH process remain controversial, the difficulties mainly stem from the structural complexity of supported nanoparticles and the uncertainty of relevant preparation processes.</p>
<p>In the Catofin process, owing to their low price and high catalytic Lewis acid activity, CrOx-based catalysts have been utilized. However, in addition to their high toxicity and environmental hostility, the severe side reactions induce their quick deactivation and frequent regeneration.</p>
<p>Developing alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium content is highly desired.</p>
<p>Compared with Pt, chromium oxide is more complex and it is difficult to explain the reaction and deactivation mechanism.</p>
<p>Over the course of a catalytic cycle, due to the coke deposition, frequent regeneration operations are needed.</p>
<p>CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 3), as well as high toxicity.</p>
<p>A supported vanadium oxide catalyst is expected to be used for PDH. There are a large number of studies on vanadium-based catalysts, and most of them concentrate on oxidative dehydrogenation.</p>

<p>In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts, with about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 4).</p>
<p>Both of the bulk and supported GaOx are active and more stable for PDH, with about 0.1 mol gGa1 h1 or 0.1 mol gcat1 h1at the low deactivation rate of 0.03 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 5).</p>
<p>Many efforts have been made to improve the activity of GaOx-based catalysts. Doping can effectively increase the activity by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites.</p>
<p>By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.</p>
<p>Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations.</p>
<p>Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided.</p>

1. The activation of the first CH bond of propane is the rate-determining step in PDH reactions. Various metal promoters like Sn, Zn, Cu, Fe, Co, Mn, In, Ga, V, and Ti are chosen based on their electronegativity, cost, and toxicity. Preparation methods and metal loadings influence the structures of catalysts.

2. VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared to CrOx-based catalysts. They achieve about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1.

3. GaOx-based catalysts, both in bulk and supported forms, show high activity and stability in PDH reactions. They have about 0.1 mol gGa1 h1 or 0.1 mol gcat1 h1 at the low deactivation rate of 0.03 h1.

4. ZrO2-based catalysts have improved activity by tuning the concentration of Zrcus cations through altering particle size, crystalline phase, doping, and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere.

5. The high reactivity and selectivity of GaOx-based catalysts are attributed to the Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. 

6. The activity of GaOx-based catalysts can be enhanced by doping, which increases the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites.

7. The stability of ZrO2-based catalysts is influenced by the concentration of Zrcus cations, which can be tuned by altering the particle size, crystalline phase, doping, and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere.
