[1] "Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species."
[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers."
[3] "In addition, cofeeding H2 can effectively tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups on the supported metal oxides, and thus tune the desorption barrier of propylene."
[4] "However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."
[5] "Additionally, advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species. On the other hand, VOx-based catalysts have different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers due to their various VO bonds. Cofeeding H2 helps tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, adjusting the desorption barrier of propylene. However, further improvements are needed to achieve lower noble metal loadings and reduced deactivation rates. Advanced characterization techniques are also required to deepen our understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms under real reaction conditions.

各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。对于GaOx基催化剂，PDH活性强烈依赖于Ga物种的结构。另一方面，由于各种VO键的存在，VOx基催化剂具有不同的CH活化和丙烯脱附能垒。向系统中提供H2有助于调整表面羟基层的覆盖度，从而调节丙烯的脱附能垒。然而，为了实现更低的贵金属负载量和降低失活率，需要进一步改进。还需要先进的表征技术来深化对真实反应条件下活性位点和反应机制的理解。
