[1] "Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species. For bulk GaOx, some researchers think that Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites."
[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers. Three γ-Al2O3 supported dimer V2OxHy models were constructed to represent the catalysts with different pretreatment methods."
[3] "The dehydrogenation is different and complex over different metal oxides. Additionally, at present, the identification of dehydrogenation pathways can only be achieved with the help of theoretical simulation. Experimental observation to reveal the reaction intermediates and pathways remains a grand challenge."
