The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. BEA topologic zeolites, such as BEA, provide a framework for controlling pore size and surface area, which can enhance the access of propane molecules to the active sites, thereby improving conversion rates and selectivity towards propylene. Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites, on the other hand, offer a balance between acidity and basicity, which can modulate the dehydrogenation reactions and prevent unwanted side reactions. The specific topology of SAPO zeolites allows for precise control over the arrangement of atoms, which can optimize the catalytic properties for PDH reactions.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:
1. The type of zeolite used can affect the distribution of acid and base sites, which are crucial for activating propane molecules and controlling the dehydrogenation pathway.
2. The pore size and pore shape of the zeolite can influence the diffusion of reactants and products, affecting the reaction kinetics and selectivity.
3. The surface chemistry of the zeolite, including the presence of functional groups and the level of surface coverage, can impact the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.
4. The use of modifiers or promoters can alter the electronic properties of the zeolite, enhancing its catalytic activity and selectivity.
5. The synthesis conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and duration, can influence the formation and stability of the zeolite structure, affecting its catalytic performance.
