The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species. On the other hand, VOx-based catalysts have different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers due to their various VO bonds. Cofeeding H2 helps tune the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, adjusting the desorption barrier of propylene. However, further improvements are needed to achieve lower noble metal loadings and reduced deactivation rates. Advanced characterization techniques are also required to deepen our understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms under real reaction conditions.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. BEA topologic zeolites, such as BEA, provide a framework for controlling pore size and surface area, which can enhance the access of propane molecules to the active sites, thereby improving conversion rates and selectivity towards propylene. Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites, on the other hand, offer a balance between acidity and basicity, which can modulate the dehydrogenation reactions and prevent unwanted side reactions. The specific topology of SAPO zeolites allows for precise control over the arrangement of atoms, which can optimize the catalytic properties for PDH reactions.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:
1. The type of zeolite used can affect the distribution of acid and base sites, which are crucial for activating propane molecules and controlling the dehydrogenation pathway.
2. The pore size and pore shape of the zeolite can influence the diffusion of reactants and products, affecting the reaction kinetics and selectivity.
3. The surface chemistry of the zeolite, including the presence of functional groups and the level of surface coverage, can impact the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.
4. The use of modifiers or promoters can alter the electronic properties of the zeolite, enhancing its catalytic activity and selectivity.
5. The synthesis conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and duration, can influence the formation and stability of the zeolite structure, affecting its catalytic performance.

<p>Among the widely developed CrOx-, VOx-, GaOx- and ZrOx-based oxide catalysts, InOx-based (Table 7), ZnO-based (Table 8), MoOx-based (Table 9) Fe-based (Table 10), Co-based (Table 11) catalysts and so forth have been studied. However, the activity and propylene selectivity need to be further improved. Most importantly, the catalyst stability during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes should be extensively promoted.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+.102,103 The high activity of β-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites. The DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of β-H to form another hydroxyl group.104 But it takes much energy to get rid of these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2, and the latter takes a lot more energy. So it is thought that the difficulty of the desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the activity of Ga2O3.</p>
<p>By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111 Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is effective in generating and increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109 Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nanoclusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also, Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113 Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance. Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided. For example, as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site.113 The promoting effect of the metal is therefore hindered.</p>

1. The performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Zeolites with BEA topologies and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites can exhibit improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. For instance, β-Ga2O3, due to its monoclinic structure, provides a large number of weak acid sites that contribute to the high activity in PDH reactions.

2. The stability of catalysts during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes is a crucial factor for PDH reactions. Efforts are being made to enhance stability through various methods, such as altering the particle size and crystalline phase to tune the concentration of Zrcus cations. Doping and pretreatment with a reductive atmosphere can generate and increase the Zrcus sites, leading to higher dehydrogenation activity.

3. Noble metals, like Rh nanoclusters, play a significant role in improving the reducibility of zirconia and promoting hydrogen desorption, thereby decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reactions. H2 pretreatment can also increase the Zrcus sites, enhancing PDH performance. However, over-reduction must be carefully managed to prevent the blockage of hydrogen recombination sites, which could hinder the catalytic effect.

2. 催化剂在脱氢和再生过程中的稳定性是PDH反应的关键因素。正在努力通过改变颗粒大小和晶相来调整Zrcus离子浓度来增强稳定性。掺杂和使用还原气氛进行预处理可以生成并增加Zrcus位点，从而提高脱氢活性。

3. 如Rh纳米簇这样的贵金属，在提高氧化锆的可还原性、促进氢解离、降低PDH反应中裸露氧化锆的能量壁垒方面起着重要作用。氢气预处理也可以增加Zrcus位点，从而提高PDH性能。然而，必须仔细管理过度还原以防止氢重组位点的堵塞，这可能会阻碍催化效果。
