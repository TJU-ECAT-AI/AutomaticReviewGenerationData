[1] "In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity."
[2] "The Lewis acid MO sites in metal oxides can also effectively activate the propane CH bonds."
[3] "Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactivation causes of chromium oxide."
[4] "Similar to CrOx-based catalysts, carbon deposition is the main reason for deactivation of VOx-based catalysts, which is intimately related to the dispersion of VOx species."
[5] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."
[6] "The active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, due to their specific topology and structure, enhance propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. The Lewis acid sites within these zeolites effectively activate propane CH bonds, contributing to the overall activity. Carbon deposition plays a critical role in deactivating chromium oxide and vanadium oxide catalysts, affecting their performance. The active site of Ga2O3 is determined by the coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions, which provide Lewis acid sites essential for PDH reactions. These factors collectively determine the effectiveness of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH processes.
