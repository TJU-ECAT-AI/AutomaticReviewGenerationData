[1] "Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species."
[2] "Over ZrO2-based catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are the active sites exhibiting PDH activity and selectivity."
[3] "The complex structures and pretreatment of metal oxides make it difficult to reveal the nature of the active sites, especially under the reaction conditions."

1. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is highly influenced by the structure of Ga species.
2. On ZrO2-based catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are recognized as the active sites showing PDH activity and selectivity.
3. The intricate structures and treatments of metal oxides pose challenges in uncovering the true nature of the active sites under PDH reaction conditions.
