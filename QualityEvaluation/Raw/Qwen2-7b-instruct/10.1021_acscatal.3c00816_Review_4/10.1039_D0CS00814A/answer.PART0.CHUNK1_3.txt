[1] "Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species."
[2] "Over ZrO2-based catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are the active sites exhibiting PDH activity and selectivity."
[3] "As discussed above, various strategies including oxidation state modulation, increasing dispersion, poisoning acid sites and cofeeding streams have been operated."
[4] "In addition to the conventional Pt and oxide-based catalysts, transition-metal nitrides and carbides may offer promising economic alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts."
[5] "Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
