[1] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support. As a result, the active sites can be stabilized and higher amounts of Sn species exist in oxidative states."
[2] "The presence of cerium in the support promotes the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen on metallic Pt and in the high temperature range. This was verified by the results of H2-TPD (Fig. 8), which reveals that the Pt active sites can be stabilized."
[3] "The decreased diameter of metallic particle and relatively weak acid intensity suppress the amounts of the produced carbon precursors during the reaction, while the oxidative states of tin makes the role of tin to migrate the coke can be developed more effectively."
[4] "Moreover, over the PtSnNa/Ce(0.76%)ZSM-5 sample, the highest selectivity can be found. In this circumstance, the initial and final selectivities of propene are 84.51 and 96.87%, respectively."
[5] "In the current study, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the highest reaction activity and stability."

1. The Ce-modified material enhances the dispersion of metallic particles, boosts the low-temperature hydrogen adsorption capability, and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support. This leads to stabilized active sites and a higher presence of Sn species in oxidized states.

2. Cerium in the support boosts the ability to adsorb hydrogen on metallic Pt and at high temperatures. This was confirmed by H2-TPD results, showing stabilized Pt active sites.

3. Smaller metallic particle size and weaker acid intensity reduce the formation of carbon precursors during the reaction. Oxidative states of tin facilitate its role in migrating coke to the support.

4. The PtSnNa/Ce(0.76%)ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest propene selectivity, with initial and final selectivities of 84.51% and 96.87% respectively.

5. The optimal Ce content in the support is 0.76 wt%, yielding a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the best reaction activity and stability.

1. 改进材料促进了金属颗粒的分散，提高了低温下氢吸附的能力，并增强了锡物种与载体的相互作用。这导致活性位点的稳定化和氧化态锡物种的更高存在。

2. 支持中的铈增强了在金属Pt上的氢吸附能力以及在高温范围内的能力。这一点通过H2-TPD结果得到证实，显示了稳定化的Pt活性位点。

3. 更小的金属粒子尺寸和较弱的酸强度减少了反应期间碳前体的形成。氧化态锡使它能够更有效地将焦炭迁移到支持上。

4. PtSnNa/Ce(0.76%)ZSM-5样品具有最高的丙烯选择性，初始和最终选择性分别为84.51%和96.87%。

5. 支持中铈的最佳含量为0.76%，产生96.87%的高丙烯选择性和最佳的反应活性和稳定性。
