The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles in enhancing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Incorporating cerium into the zeolite framework, particularly at a concentration of 0.76 wt%, has been found to significantly improve catalyst performance. Cerium modifies the zeolite's thermal stability, enhancing its resistance to surface area loss. This, in turn, stabilizes the catalyst against coke formation and promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improving the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures. The interaction between tin species and the support is also enhanced, leading to a reduction in the catalyst's reactivity toward undesirable reactions, thus increasing propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The optimal cerium concentration ensures the highest reaction activity and stability, making it an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在丙烷脱氢反应中对沸石基催化剂的性能发挥着关键作用。将铈融入沸石框架，特别是在0.76 wt%的浓度下，已被发现能显著提高催化剂的性能。铈修改了沸石的热稳定性，增强了其对抗表面面积损失的能力。这反过来又稳定了催化剂，防止了焦炭的形成，并促进了金属粒子的分散，提高了催化剂在低温吸附氢气的能力。锡物种与支撑物之间的相互作用也得到了增强，导致催化剂对不希望发生的反应的反应性降低，从而增加了丙烯选择性和转化率。最佳铈浓度确保了最高的反应活性和稳定性，使其成为提高沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能的有效策略。

[1] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support. As a result, the active sites can be stabilized and higher amounts of Sn species exist in oxidative states."
[2] "The presence of cerium in the support promotes the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen on metallic Pt and in the high temperature range. This was verified by the results of H2-TPD (Fig. 8), which reveals that the Pt active sites can be stabilized."
[3] "The decreased diameter of metallic particle and relatively weak acid intensity suppress the amounts of the produced carbon precursors during the reaction, while the oxidative states of tin makes the role of tin to migrate the coke can be developed more effectively."
[4] "Moreover, over the PtSnNa/Ce(0.76%)ZSM-5 sample, the highest selectivity can be found. In this circumstance, the initial and final selectivities of propene are 84.51 and 96.87%, respectively."
[5] "In the current study, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the highest reaction activity and stability."

1. The Ce-modified material enhances the dispersion of metallic particles, boosts the low-temperature hydrogen adsorption capability, and strengthens the interaction between Sn species and the support. This leads to stabilized active sites and a higher presence of Sn species in oxidized states.

2. Cerium in the support boosts the ability to adsorb hydrogen on metallic Pt and at high temperatures. This was confirmed by H2-TPD results, showing stabilized Pt active sites.

3. Smaller metallic particle size and weaker acid intensity reduce the formation of carbon precursors during the reaction. Oxidative states of tin facilitate its role in migrating coke to the support.

4. The PtSnNa/Ce(0.76%)ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest propene selectivity, with initial and final selectivities of 84.51% and 96.87% respectively.

5. The optimal Ce content in the support is 0.76 wt%, yielding a high propene selectivity of 96.87% and the best reaction activity and stability.
