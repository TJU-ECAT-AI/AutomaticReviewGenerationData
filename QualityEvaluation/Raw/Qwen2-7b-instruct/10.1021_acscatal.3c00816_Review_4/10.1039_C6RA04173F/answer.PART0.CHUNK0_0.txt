[1] "Recently, catalytic propane dehydrogenation has received more and more attention because of the growing demand for propene."
[2] "Meanwhile, it is known that the equilibrium conversion limited by thermodynamics can increase with the temperature."
[3] "However, such severe conditions result in major challenges of hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which decrease the catalyst stability and reaction selectivity."
[4] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."
[6] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."
[7] "During the process of reaction, the variation of Ce content mainly affects the occurrence of hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation side reactions."

1. The demand for propene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation. High temperatures can increase equilibrium conversion but also introduce challenges like hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which can degrade catalyst stability and selectivity.

2. Optimizing cerium content in the catalyst support to 0.76 wt% can achieve the highest reaction activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Incorporating cerium modifies the catalyst structure by enhancing dispersion of metal particles, improving hydrogen adsorption at low temperatures, and strengthening the interaction between tin species and the support. 

4. Cerium substitution weakens the weak acidity of the catalyst, aiding in the migration of coke from active metal sites to the support.

5. The cerium content significantly influences the occurrence of hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation side reactions during the propane dehydrogenation process.
