[1] "The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by several techniques, including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, SEM, TEM, UV-vis, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD, TPR and TPO analyses."
[2] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."
[3] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."
[4] "The optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The incorporation of cerium (Ce) into the zeolite framework enhances dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures, and facilitates the interaction between tin (Sn) species and the support. This leads to a reduction in weak acidity and promotes the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support. Optimizing the Ce content to 0.76 wt% results in the highest propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

在丙烷脱氢反应中，各种沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能有显著影响。将铈（Ce）引入沸石骨架中可以增强金属颗粒的分散性，提高催化剂在低温下吸附氢的能力，并促进锡（Sn）物种与支撑材料之间的相互作用。这导致弱酸性的减弱，并促进了从活性金属位点向支撑材料迁移的焦炭。将铈含量优化至0.76 wt%，可获得最高的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。
