[1] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat−1h−1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[2] "The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced."
[3] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat−1h−1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[4] "It is revealed that the SN ZnO supported on dealuminated β exhibited high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for PDH."
