[1] "Catalysts with Zing: Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite can be obtained via a two-step post-synthesis method, showing much better catalytic performance for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene than that on raw Hβ zeolite."
[2] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat−1h−1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[3] "The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced."
[4] "With massive active SN ZnO and free of strong acid sites, Zn supported on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the propylene production."
[5] "The dealuminated β zeolite, possessing a great deal of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, can be used as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO by the host-guest interaction."

1. The preparation methods, specifically the dealumination process, the use of small ZnO nanoclusters, and the topology of BEA zeolites, significantly influence the performance of catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by enabling the formation of well-dispersed, active small ZnO clusters and minimizing the presence of strong acid sites.

2. The dealuminated β zeolite, with its vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, serves as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO clusters. This interaction facilitates the creation of active sites within the zeolite framework, reducing the likelihood of inactive bulk ZnO formation on the external surface.

3. The presence of massive active small ZnO clusters in the zeolite framework leads to high catalytic performance and excellent propylene selectivity in PDH reactions. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite further enhances propylene selectivity by reducing side reactions.

4. The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite demonstrates high initial propane conversion and superior propylene selectivity, along with stability and reusability. This catalyst outperforms alternatives by efficiently converting propane to propylene while maintaining high selectivity and retaining activity over multiple reaction cycles.

5. The dealuminated β zeolite, with its unique topology and abundant vacant T-atom sites, provides a favorable environment for the formation of small ZnO clusters. This interaction enables the creation of a large number of catalytically active sites that are well-dispersed throughout the zeolite framework, contributing to the overall high catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

1. 准备方法，特别是去铝化过程、使用小锌氧化合物纳米簇和BEA沸石的拓扑结构，对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的催化剂性能产生重大影响。这些因素通过促进小锌氧化合物簇在沸石框架内的均匀分布并减少强酸位的存在，有助于提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。

2. 去铝化β沸石，含有大量与硅醇基团关联的T-原子位点，可以作为获得均匀分散的小锌氧化合物簇的理想支持物。这种相互作用使活性位点能够在沸石框架内形成，降低了外表面形成无活性的大锌氧化合物的可能性。

3. 沸石框架中大量的活性小锌氧化合物的存在以及缺乏强酸位使催化剂在PDH反应中表现出卓越的催化性能和优秀的丙烯选择性。缺乏强酸位进一步提高了丙烯选择性，减少了副反应的发生。

4. 含有10wt%锌负载的去铝化β沸石催化剂，显示出高初始丙烷转化率和高达93%的优秀丙烯选择性，同时具有稳定性和可重复使用性。与替代品相比，该催化剂更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时保持高选择性并在多次反应周期中保留活性。

5. 去铝化β沸石的独特拓扑结构和丰富的T-原子位点提供了形成小锌氧化合物簇的良好环境。这种相互作用使得大量均匀分布的活性位点能够在整个沸石中形成，为PDH反应的整体高催化活性和选择性做出了贡献。
