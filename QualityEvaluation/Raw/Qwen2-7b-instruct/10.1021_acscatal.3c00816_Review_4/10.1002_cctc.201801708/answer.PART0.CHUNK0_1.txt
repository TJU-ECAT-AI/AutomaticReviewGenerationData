[1] "Catalysts with Zing: Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite can be obtained via a two-step post-synthesis method, showing much better catalytic performance for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene than that on raw Hβ zeolite."
[2] "It is found that the Zn species can be accommodated in the vacant T-atom sites of dealuminated β zeolite due to the reaction of aqueous zinc acetate solution with silanol groups, and thus, producing massive small ZnO nanoclusters as active phases in PDH."
[3] "Dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
[4] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[5] "This study may open a new way to design and synthesize highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability."
[6] "The catalytic performance of Zn supported on raw Hβ and DeAlβ supports are evaluated in PDH, and the influence of Zn loading amounts on the catalytic activity is exhibited in Figure8."
[7] "The optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 exhibits high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity compared with the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts."
[8] "Moreover, the optimal Znβ-10 catalyst possesses great reusability (Figure9), indicating its great potential in industrial application."
