1. The performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by their preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. BEA topologic zeolites and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, especially when dealuminated, can offer an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO, which are catalytically active sites for PDH. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the presence of a large number of active SN ZnO, the absence of strong acid sites, and the high dispersion of ZnO particles.

2. The dealuminated β zeolite, with a large number of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, can be used as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO by the host-guest interaction. The created vacant T-atom sites are in favor of constraining SN ZnO in the zeolite framework, reducing the possibility of inactive bulk ZnO formed on the external surface of zeolite.

3. The presence of SN ZnO in or bonded to the zeolite framework as Lewis acid sites are catalytically active sites in PDH. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite after removing Al atoms can reduce side reactions to a great extent. This leads to high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity in PDH.

4. The dealuminated β zeolite provides an attractive method to generate silanol groups which can interact with Zn complexes, resulting in the formation of a large amount of active SN ZnO. This interaction facilitates the dispersion of ZnO particles throughout the zeolite framework, enhancing the catalytic performance of the Zn catalyst.

5. The optimal Znβ-10 catalyst, with a high initial propane conversion rate and superior propylene selectivity, exhibits great reusability, indicating its potential for industrial applications in PDH processes.

2. 去铝化的β沸石，具有大量与硅醇基团相关的T原子位点，可以用作获得高度分散的SN ZnO的理想的支撑物通过宿主-客体相互作用。创建的T原子位点有利于在沸石框架内约束SN ZnO，减少在沸石表面形成无活性的大块ZnO的可能性。

3. 在或结合到沸石框架中的SN ZnO作为Lewis酸位是PDH的活性位点。去铝化后，沸石中Al原子的去除可导致强酸位消失，大幅减少副反应。这导致高催化活性和PDH过程中出色的丙烯选择性。

4. 去铝化的β沸石提供了一种吸引人的方法来生成能够与Zn复合物相互作用的硅醇基团，从而产生大量的活性SN ZnO。这种相互作用有助于将ZnO颗粒均匀分布在沸石框架中，增强Zn催化剂的催化性能。
