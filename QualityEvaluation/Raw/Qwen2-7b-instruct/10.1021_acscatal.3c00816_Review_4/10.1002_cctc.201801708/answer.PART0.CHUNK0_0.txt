[1] "The optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."
[2] "It is found that the Zn species can be accommodated in the vacant T-atom sites of dealuminated β zeolite due to the reaction of aqueous zinc acetate solution with silanol groups, and thus, producing massive small ZnO nanoclusters as active phases in PDH."
[3] "Moreover, dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."
[4] "This study may open a new way to design and synthesize highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability."
[5] "The catalytic performance of Zn supported on raw Hβ and DeAlβ supports are evaluated in PDH (Figure7), and the influence of Zn loading amounts on the catalytic activity is exhibited in Figure8. The optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 exhibits high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity compared with the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts."
[6] "The new emerging NH3 desorption peak in Znβ catalysts (Figure3) confirms that the incorporated SN ZnO possess the character of LAS, which are active for catalyzing PDH."
[7] "Moreover, the dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions to a great extent."
[8] "So, the dealuminated β zeolite is an attractive method to generate silanol groups which can be employed to interact with Zn complex, and thus, a lot of active SN ZnO can be obtained in DeAlβ."

1. The dealuminated β zeolite, loaded with 10wt% zinc, shows an initial propane conversion of approximately 53% and a high propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000 cm³/gcat/h. This catalyst maintains high stability and reusability.
2. Zinc species can be accommodated in the vacant T-atom sites of dealuminated β zeolite due to the reaction of aqueous zinc acetate solution with silanol groups, resulting in the formation of small zinc oxide nanoclusters as active sites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).
3. The dealuminated β zeolite significantly reduces side reactions because it lacks strong acid sites, ensuring high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and stability.
4. This research suggests a new approach for designing and synthesizing highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability.
5. Comparing the catalytic performance of zinc supported on raw Hβ and dealuminated β zeolites, the optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 demonstrates superior propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
6. The newly emerged NH3 desorption peak in Znβ catalysts indicates that the incorporated small zinc oxide nanoclusters have the characteristic of Lewis acid sites, which are active for catalyzing PDH.
7. The dealuminated β zeolite is almost devoid of strong acid sites, effectively minimizing side reactions.
8. Utilizing the dealuminated β zeolite allows for the generation of silanol groups, facilitating the interaction with zinc complexes to create numerous active small zinc oxide nanoclusters.
