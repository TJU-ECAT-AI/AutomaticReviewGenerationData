[1] "The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene."
[2] "The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst."
[3] "The well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway."
[4] "The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites."
[5] "A small amount of Sn doping (Sn/Si = 1/60) enables Beta zeolite to be a good catalyst for propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[8] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."
[9] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
[10] "These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene."

To enhance the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles. Key factors leading to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Incorporating metal species into the zeolite lattice or framework creates single-site catalysts with well-defined structures, facilitating easy elucidation of the reaction pathways.
   
2. Metal doping, particularly with tin (Sn), modifies the acid properties of zeolites, introducing Lewis acid sites that are essential for dehydrogenation reactions.
   
3. Small amounts of Sn doping enable Beta zeolites to function effectively as PDH catalysts, improving their stability and propylene selectivity.
   
4. The topology of zeolites, such as the BEA framework, provides a suitable environment for incorporating metal species and enhancing catalytic activity.
   
5. The L/B (Lewis acid to Bronsted acid) ratio impacts catalytic performance; a higher L/B ratio correlates with better propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.
   
6. Catalysts with the highest Lewis acid content and lowest L/B ratios, like the Na-Sn-Beta-30, demonstrate superior PDH performance, achieving high conversion rates and selectivities.
   
7. Stability under harsh reaction conditions is a critical factor, with Sn-Beta zeolites showing remarkable resistance to deactivation over extended periods, ensuring reliable and efficient PDH processes.
   
8. The ability to fine-tune local structure, such as through hydroxylation, further enhances the catalytic activity of Sn-Beta zeolites, providing a new avenue for developing advanced PDH catalysts.

在丙烯脱氢（PDH）反应中，提升基于沸石催化剂性能的关键因素包括制备方法、组分和沸石拓扑结构。提高丙二醇选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 将金属物种引入到沸石骨架或框架中，构建单原子催化剂，这些催化剂具有明确的结构，便于阐明反应路径。

2. 特别是通过锡（Sn）掺杂修改沸石的酸性质，引入了作为脱氢反应所需Lewis酸位点的酸位。

3. 较小的Sn掺杂量使Beta沸石能够有效地用作PDH催化剂，同时提高了其稳定性与丙二醇选择性。

4. 沸石的拓扑结构，如BEA框架，为引入金属物种并增强催化活性提供了适宜环境。

5. Lewis酸与Bronsted酸的L/B比率影响催化性能；较高的L/B比率与PDH反应中更高的丙二醇选择性相关联。

6. 最高Lewis酸含量和最低L/B比率的催化剂，如Na-Sn-Beta-30，表现出卓越的PDH性能，实现了高转化率和选择性。

7. 在恶劣反应条件下保持稳定的特性是至关重要的，Sn-Beta沸石显示出出色的抗失活能力，在长时间内确保了PDH过程的可靠性和高效性。

8. 调整局部结构，例如通过羟基化，进一步增强了Sn-Beta沸石的催化活性，提供了一种开发先进PDH催化剂的新途径。
