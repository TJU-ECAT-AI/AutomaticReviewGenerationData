<p>The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process, so an attempt was made by the treatment of Al-Beta with different concentrations of HNO3 (2.3 M, 7.0 M, and 13.0 M) to remove Al from its structure.</p>
<p>XRD and N2 adsorption characterizations on the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample indicates that its crystalline structure and pore architecture are well maintained.</p>
<p>All the samples display strong peaks at 820750 cm1 and 10001100 cm1. The adsorption at 820750 cm1 is assigned to the O-T-O (T = Si or Sn) symmetric stretching vibration mode, and characteristic vibration at 10001100 cm1 is ascribed to the five- and six-membered rings of T-O-T in the structure of zeolite Beta.</p>
<p>The Sn-Beta samples possess high microporous volumes (0.16 cm3/g) and large surface area (410490 m2 g−1) as that of parent Beta zeolite, which indicates that the textural properties of Beta zeolite are well preserved in these Sn-Beta samples.</p>
<p>No evident particles or clusters relative SnO2 phase is detectable in TEM of Sn-Beta, which indirectly suggests that the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite framework.</p>
<p>It is well-known that the presence of octahedrally coordinated Sn species at extra-framework position in the zeolites gives two correlated peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV, derived from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedral Sn species. This signal is not observable in these Sn-Beta zeolites, which strongly suggests that there is no extra-framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.</p>
<p>These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active in propane dehydrogenation, and the initial propane conversion is about 50% for SnO2/Al-Beta-30 and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 samples.</p>
<p>There is no strong interaction between SnO2 particles and zeolite framework, because these SnO2 particles are physically dispersed at the surface of Al-Beta zeolite which can not resistant to the thermal treatment at a high temperature of 630 C.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.</p>

<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>

To enhance the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles. Key factors leading to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Incorporating metal species into the zeolite lattice or framework creates single-site catalysts with well-defined structures, facilitating easy elucidation of the reaction pathways.
   
2. Metal doping, particularly with tin (Sn), modifies the acid properties of zeolites, introducing Lewis acid sites that are essential for dehydrogenation reactions.
   
3. Small amounts of Sn doping enable Beta zeolites to function effectively as PDH catalysts, improving their stability and propylene selectivity.
   
4. The topology of zeolites, such as the BEA framework, provides a suitable environment for incorporating metal species and enhancing catalytic activity.
   
5. The L/B (Lewis acid to Bronsted acid) ratio impacts catalytic performance; a higher L/B ratio correlates with better propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.
   
6. Catalysts with the highest Lewis acid content and lowest L/B ratios, like the Na-Sn-Beta-30, demonstrate superior PDH performance, achieving high conversion rates and selectivities.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Metal species loading onto metal oxides, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common approach for fabricating single-site catalysts. Isolated metal oxide species obtained from this method demonstrate high performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a high propylene selectivity of over 95%. Single-site Zn(II) on amorphous silica supports, Co2+ on SiO2, and single-site Ga on alumina show enhanced activity compared to their counterparts. Incorporating metal species into zeolite lattices or frameworks enhances stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. Iron-silicate zeolites, for instance, exhibit high performance in propane dehydrogenation, suggesting a redox catalytic cycle involving the formation of propane radical cations. The Sn-Beta zeolite, with single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework, displays improved stability and high selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations confirm that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。将金属物种加载到金属氧化物，如SiO2和Al2O3上，是制造单个位点催化剂的常见方法。从这种方法获得的孤立金属氧化物种在丙烷脱氢中表现出高性能，实现超过95%的丙烯选择性。单个位点Zn(II)在无定形硅酸盐支持上、Co2+在SiO2上和单个位点Ga在氧化铝上的活性高于其对应物。将金属物种引入到沸石晶格或框架中可以增强稳定性，这是由于框架结构的强烈锚定效应。例如，铁硅酸盐沸石显示出在丙烷脱氢中的高性能，暗示形成丙烷自由基离子的还原催化循环。含有单个位点Sn的Sn-Beta沸石显示了在丙烷脱氢中的改进稳定性和高选择性。理论计算证实，丙烷脱氢发生在来自单个位点Sn的沸石框架中的Lewis酸中心。
