<p>The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the dealumination greatly affects the subsequent Sn atoms incorporation process, so an attempt was made by the treatment of Al-Beta with different concentrations of HNO3 (2.3 M, 7.0 M, and 13.0 M) to remove Al from its structure.</p>
<p>XRD and N2 adsorption characterizations on the Sn-Beta(13.0 M HNO3) sample indicates that its crystalline structure and pore architecture are well maintained.</p>
<p>All the samples display strong peaks at 820750 cm1 and 10001100 cm1. The adsorption at 820750 cm1 is assigned to the O-T-O (T = Si or Sn) symmetric stretching vibration mode, and characteristic vibration at 10001100 cm1 is ascribed to the five- and six-membered rings of T-O-T in the structure of zeolite Beta.</p>
<p>The Sn-Beta samples possess high microporous volumes (0.16 cm3/g) and large surface area (410490 m2 g−1) as that of parent Beta zeolite, which indicates that the textural properties of Beta zeolite are well preserved in these Sn-Beta samples.</p>
<p>No evident particles or clusters relative SnO2 phase is detectable in TEM of Sn-Beta, which indirectly suggests that the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite framework.</p>
<p>It is well-known that the presence of octahedrally coordinated Sn species at extra-framework position in the zeolites gives two correlated peaks at 486.0 and 494.4 eV, derived from the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of octahedral Sn species. This signal is not observable in these Sn-Beta zeolites, which strongly suggests that there is no extra-framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.</p>
<p>These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active in propane dehydrogenation, and the initial propane conversion is about 50% for SnO2/Al-Beta-30 and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 samples.</p>
<p>There is no strong interaction between SnO2 particles and zeolite framework, because these SnO2 particles are physically dispersed at the surface of Al-Beta zeolite which can not resistant to the thermal treatment at a high temperature of 630 C.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.</p>

1. The incorporation of Sn species into the Beta zeolite structure does not affect the structure of the zeolite.
2. The efficiency of removing aluminum from the Beta zeolite structure through dealumination is crucial for the subsequent incorporation of Sn atoms.
3. The crystalline structure and pore architecture of the Sn-Beta zeolite are well preserved after the dealumination process.
4. The O-T-O (T = Si or Sn) symmetric stretching vibration mode and the five- and six-membered rings of T-O-T in the structure of zeolite Beta are observed in the IR spectra.
5. The Sn-Beta zeolites maintain the textural properties of the parent Beta zeolite, with high microporous volumes and large surface areas.
6. No SnO2 phase is detected in the TEM images of the Sn-Beta zeolite, indicating that the Sn species is incorporated into the zeolite framework.
7. The absence of the octahedrally coordinated Sn species peaks in the XPS spectra suggests that there are no extra-framework Sn species in the Sn-Beta zeolites.
8. The Sn-Beta zeolites are resistant to coking, making them suitable for practical applications.
9. The SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with initial conversion rates of about 50%.
10. The physical dispersion of SnO2 particles on the surface of Al-Beta zeolite leads to poor resistance to high-temperature thermal treatment.
11. The direct pathway is more feasible for propane dehydrogenation in closed Sn-Beta sites, and open sites are generally more reactive than closed sites depending on hydroxylation extents.
