<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway [18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[26] ,[27] ,[28] ,[29] . Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction [21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ,[27] . A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and in-situ characterization studies reveal that single-site Zn(II) ions located in the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous silica surface are the active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction [22] ,[25] . The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over 24 h for propane dehydrogenation. Calculations with hybrid density functional theory suggests a non-redox mechanism for activation of C-H and H-H bonds by Co2+ similar to the pathway of single-site Zn2+/SiO2 [27] . The mononuclear alumina-supported single-site Ga sites show much higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than their dinuclear silica-supported counterparts, and the propane dehydrogenation reaction requires the presence of Al-O-Ga bonds to promote heterolytic C-H bond activation [23] ,[24] .

<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. The iron-silicate zeolites show high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction, and a redox catalytic cycle occurring over the isolated or single-site Fe framework sites in Fe-zeolites for the formation of propane radical cations is suggested to the reaction mechanism in propane dehydrogenation [28] . The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion for the C-C bond coupling and C-O bond breakage in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley Reduction (MPV) reduction, Diels-Alder cycloaddition and glucose-fructose isomerization [30] ,[31] . As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] . Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Metal species loading onto metal oxides, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common approach for fabricating single-site catalysts. Isolated metal oxide species obtained from this method demonstrate high performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a high propylene selectivity of over 95%. Single-site Zn(II) on amorphous silica supports, Co2+ on SiO2, and single-site Ga on alumina show enhanced activity compared to their counterparts. Incorporating metal species into zeolite lattices or frameworks enhances stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure. Iron-silicate zeolites, for instance, exhibit high performance in propane dehydrogenation, suggesting a redox catalytic cycle involving the formation of propane radical cations. The Sn-Beta zeolite, with single-site Sn atoms in the BEA framework, displays improved stability and high selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Theoretical calculations confirm that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites derived from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。将金属物种加载到金属氧化物，如SiO2和Al2O3上，是制造单个位点催化剂的常见方法。从这种方法获得的孤立金属氧化物种在丙烷脱氢中表现出高性能，实现超过95%的丙烯选择性。单个位点Zn(II)在无定形硅酸盐支持上、Co2+在SiO2上和单个位点Ga在氧化铝上的活性高于其对应物。将金属物种引入到沸石晶格或框架中可以增强稳定性，这是由于框架结构的强烈锚定效应。例如，铁硅酸盐沸石显示出在丙烷脱氢中的高性能，暗示形成丙烷自由基离子的还原催化循环。含有单个位点Sn的Sn-Beta沸石显示了在丙烷脱氢中的改进稳定性和高选择性。理论计算证实，丙烷脱氢发生在来自单个位点Sn的沸石框架中的Lewis酸中心。
