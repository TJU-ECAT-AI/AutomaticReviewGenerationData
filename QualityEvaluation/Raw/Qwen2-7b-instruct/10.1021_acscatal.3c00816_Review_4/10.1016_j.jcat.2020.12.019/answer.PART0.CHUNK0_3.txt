<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report [32] . Nevertheless, the Sn-Beta shows negligible activity in the reaction and it only acts as support and promotor for the Pt component [32] ,[33] ,[34] .</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites [61] .</p>
<p>A high level of both Brnsted and Lewis acidity is found in the H-Beta sample. However, the Brnsted acid largely decreases (241.4 μmol.g1 in H-Beta, 36.0 μmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) and the Lewis acid (163.8 in H-Beta, 170.9 μmol.g1 in Sn-Beta-30) is well kept, when the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalytic performances of these Sn-Beta catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation become stable after a certain period, and no evident loss of activity is observable in a long time-on-stream reaction for 72 h.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction [65] .</p>
<p>Indeed, the dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate which can be estimated from propylene selectivity (equals to SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)) in these samples can be correlated with L/B ratios measured from IR-Py characterization ( Fig. 10 ). The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is helpful for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>These efficient Na-Sn-Beta zeolites could provide a new possibility for the development of a new generation of propane dehydrogenation catalysts for the production of propylene.</p>

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play a crucial role in improving the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework enhances stability and creates Lewis acid sites, which are the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The structure of single-site catalysts allows for a clear elucidation of the reaction pathway. The strong anchoring effect of the framework structure ensures enhanced stability for the isolated metal species in zeolite.

3. The Sn-Beta zeolite, when properly prepared, shows high selectivity, activity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions, activating the C-H bond of propane and producing propylene efficiently.

4. The theoretical calculations confirm that the propane dehydrogenation occurs on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.

5. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework transforms the acid property of Beta zeolite, creating Lewis acid sites while keeping the Brnsted acid sites at a high level.
