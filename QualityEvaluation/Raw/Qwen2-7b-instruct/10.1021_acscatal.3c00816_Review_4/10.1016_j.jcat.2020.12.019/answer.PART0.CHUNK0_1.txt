<p>The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene.</p>
<p>Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas.</p>
<p>The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles.</p>
<p>In such a case, much effort has been dedicated to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for the production of propylene from propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Sn-Beta zeolite was applied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in our previous report.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations suggest that the propane dehydrogenation takes place on the Lewis acid sites arising from the single-site Sn in the zeolitic framework.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>A high selectivity to propylene above 95% can be achieved in the silica-supported single-site Zn(II) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>The single-site Co2+ on SiO2 with a tetrahedral coordination also exhibits high selectivity > 95% at 550 C with stable activity over 24 h for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The incorporation of Sn species into the BEA framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>A small amount of Sn doping (Sn/Si = 1/60) enables Beta zeolite to be a good catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>However, a significant loss of activity is observed in these catalysts, which results in a low level of conversion after 72 h.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be concluded that Sn-Beta zeolite is a coking resistant catalyst, which allows it to be a promising catalyst for practical applications.</p>
<p>Based on the propane transformation over H-Beta and Sn-Beta zeolites, it is reasonable to propose that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction.</p>
<p>Indeed, the dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate which can be estimated from propylene selectivity in these samples can be correlated with L/B ratios measured from IR-Py characterization.</p>
<p>The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>To verify the crucial role of single-site Sn in propane dehydrogenation, the reference catalysts SnO2/Al-Beta were also studied in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active in propane dehydrogenation, and the initial propane conversion is about 50% for SnO2/Al-Beta-30 and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 samples.</p>
