[1] "Subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species."
[2] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."
[3] "The location of subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) within pores wall of *BEA crystals in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115) were also revealed."
[4] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, trapping subnanometric Pt clusters into Sn-Beta zeolite through a wet impregnation process followed by hydrogen reduction enables the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts. The high framework Sn content in the zeolite provides enough anchors for Pt species, enhancing the stability of the catalyst. The zeolite topology, combined with the framework Sn, creates a joint confinement effect that improves the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. The presence of Pt clusters confined within the pores of *BEA crystals contributes to maintaining high propane conversion and propene selectivity even after extensive use.

2. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability involve the zeolite's pore structure and the electronic effect of the framework Sn atoms. These elements restrict the growth of Pt clusters, prevent coke formation, and inhibit sintering. As a result, the catalyst maintains 90% of its maximum propane conversion capacity over 250 hours, with a high propene selectivity of 99%. The unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology ensures that the Pt clusters are stably anchored within the zeolite structure, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

1. 烯烃加氢反应中，沸石基催化剂的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。通过将铂盐湿浸渍到含有高骨架锡含量的Sn-Beta沸石中，随后进行氢化还原过程，可以捕获单原子和超细铂簇。高骨架锡含量的沸石为铂物种提供了足够的锚点，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。沸石拓扑结构与骨架锡的独特联合限制效应增强了催化剂在烯烃加氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。受限于沸石孔结构内的铂簇存在于*BEA晶体的壁上，形式为（Si-O）2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115)，这有助于维持高达250小时的最高丙烷转化率的90%，同时保持99%的丙烯选择性。独特的联合限制效应确保铂簇稳定地锚定在沸石结构中，从而提高了催化性能。

2. 改善丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括沸石的孔结构和骨架锡原子的电子效应。这些元素限制了铂簇的增长，防止了焦炭形成，并抑制了结块。因此，催化剂在长达250小时的使用过程中仍能保持其最大丙烷转化能力的90%，同时保持99%的高丙烯选择性。沸石拓扑结构与骨架锡的独特联合限制效应确保铂簇稳定地锚定在沸石结构内，从而提高了催化剂的性能。
