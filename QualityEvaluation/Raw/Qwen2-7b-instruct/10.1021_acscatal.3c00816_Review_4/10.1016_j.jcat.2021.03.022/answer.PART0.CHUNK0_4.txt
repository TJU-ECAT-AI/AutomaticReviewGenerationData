<p>Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals.</p>
<p>In the present study, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species.</p>
<p>The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.</p>

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Zeolites with specific topologies, such as Beta and *BEA, provide confinement effects by encapsulating subnanometric metal clusters within their pores. The addition of second metal additives, like tin (Sn), contributes to the stabilization of these clusters by inhibiting growth and promoting uniform dispersion.

2. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability involve the precise trapping of subnanometric Pt clusters within the zeolite framework. The use of Sn-Beta zeolite ensures that Pt clusters are anchored effectively, preventing their agglomeration and ensuring a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which enhances both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The electronic effect of Sn also tunes the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates in the PDH process, further enhancing the catalyst's performance.

1. 合适的载体和添加第二金属添加剂是提供金属生长抑制效果的有效策略，从而在支持材料中限制金属物种。在当前研究中，通过将铂盐湿法浸渍到Sn-Beta沸石上，然后进行直接氢化还原，成功捕获了亚纳米级的Pt簇。沸石骨架中的高Sn含量提供了足够的锚点来固定Pt物种。

2. 提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括精确捕获亚纳米级的Pt簇在沸石笼中。使用Sn-Beta沸石确保Pt簇被有效锚定，防止它们聚集，并保持较高的表面积与体积比，从而增强催化剂的活性和选择性。Sn的电子效应也调节了PDH过程中C3中间体的吸附强度，进一步提高了催化剂的性能。
