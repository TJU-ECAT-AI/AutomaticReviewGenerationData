<p>Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals.</p>
<p>For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact. The electronic effect has been reported to tune the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates in the PDH process.</p>
<p>Very recently, Ryoo et al. reported a high-performance propane dehydrogenation catalyst with rare earth metals as auxiliaries, that is, rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles confined in a mesoporous MFI zeolite.</p>
<p>Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species.</p>
<p>The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction.</p>

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the use of carriers and metal additives to confine and stabilize metal active sites. In particular, tin (Sn) has been found to effectively prevent the collision of Pt active sites and transfer electrons to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms, tuning the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates. Additionally, the joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology provides a strong stabilization mechanism against coke formation and sintering, maintaining high activity and selectivity over long periods.

2. The preparation of subnanometric Pt clusters within Sn-Beta zeolite involves impregnating Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by hydrogen reduction. The high framework Sn content in the zeolite acts as anchors for Pt species, facilitating the formation of confined Pt clusters. The presence of Sn atoms within the zeolite framework inhibits the growth of Pt clusters, leading to enhanced stability in PDH reactions. The Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts exhibit excellent activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH, with the capacity to maintain 90% of maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

1. 不同的沸石基催化剂（特别是BEA拓扑和硅铝磷酸盐沸石）在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括使用载体和金属添加剂来限制和稳定金属活性位点。特别是，锡（Sn）已被发现能有效防止铂活性位点碰撞，并将电子转移到铂原子的5d轨道上，调整C3中间体的吸附强度。此外，锡和沸石拓扑结构的联合限制效应提供了对抗焦炭形成和聚集的强大稳定机制，维持了在长时间内的高活性和选择性。

2. 将亚纳米尺寸的Pt簇困在Sn-Beta沸石中涉及向Sn-Beta中浸渍Pt盐并随后进行氢还原。沸石骨架中高的Sn含量作为Pt物种的锚点，促进受限Pt簇的形成。骨架中的Sn原子抑制了Pt簇的增长，从而提高了PDH反应的稳定性。获得的Pt@Sn-Beta催化剂在PDH反应中表现出极高的活性、选择性和稳定性，在250小时的运行时间内保持90%的最大丙烷转化率，丙烯选择性为99%。
