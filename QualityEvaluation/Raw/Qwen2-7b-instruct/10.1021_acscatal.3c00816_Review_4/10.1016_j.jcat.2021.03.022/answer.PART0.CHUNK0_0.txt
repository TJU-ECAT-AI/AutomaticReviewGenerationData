<p>Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the metal species hardly enter into the zeolite channels of subnano-sized pore windows by impregnation due to the diffusion constrains, but mainly locate on the crystal external surface, showing unsatisfied performance in stabilizing metal species under harsh reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Recently, in-situ encapsulation of metal species in constructing zeolite frameworks has been frequently reported.</p>
<p>Liu et al. incorporated Pt subnanometer clusters into the cups and cages of MWW framework during the structural transformation of the two-dimensional (2D) lamellar MCM-22 precursor into its corresponding three-dimensional (3D) structure.</p>
<p>Xiao group successfully fixed the metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ag) within zeolite crystals via a controllable seed-directed growth method.</p>
<p>Sun et al. synthesized single-atom Rh catalysts embedded in MFI-type zeolites under hydrothermal conditions and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction.</p>
<p>For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact.</p>
<p>To combine the complementary advantages of zeolite structure and additives in one matrix, several studies have tried to incorporate Pt into Sn-Beta zeolite, while only evenly dispersed surface nanoparticles were obtained.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the metal aggregation upon air-calcination has been well suppressed in case of K-PtSn@MFI catalyst by introducing K+ in the synthetic gel, resulting in regioselective location of subnanometric Pt clusters in sinusoidal channels.</p>
<p>Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction.</p>

This literature discusses the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly those with BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. The use of carriers and metal additives provides confinement effects that prevent metal growth and aggregation, improving stability under harsh reaction conditions.
2. Zeolite topology allows for in-situ encapsulation of metal species, enabling the trapping of subnanometric clusters within the zeolite framework.
3. Metal additives, like tin (Sn), can provide both geometric and electronic effects, enhancing the stabilization of metal species and improving catalytic activity.
4. High framework Sn content in zeolites like Sn-Beta offers sufficient anchors for Pt species, leading to the formation of confined subnanometric Pt clusters within the zeolite pores.
5. The joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts for PDH reactions.

本文讨论了在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同沸石基催化剂（尤其是具有BEA拓扑和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的催化剂）的性能受制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 利用载体和金属添加剂提供封装效果，防止金属生长和聚集，从而改善在苛刻反应条件下的稳定性。
2. 沸石拓扑结构允许原位封装金属物种，在沸石骨架内捕获亚纳米簇。
3. 金属添加剂，如锡（Sn），可提供几何和电子效应，增强金属物种的稳定性并提高催化活性。
4. 高框架Sn含量的沸石（如Sn-Beta）为Pt物种提供了足够的锚点，导致亚纳米尺度的Pt簇在沸石孔内被封闭。
5. Sn和沸石拓扑结构的联合封装效果导致了高度活性、选择性和稳定的Pt@Sn-Beta催化剂用于PDH反应。
