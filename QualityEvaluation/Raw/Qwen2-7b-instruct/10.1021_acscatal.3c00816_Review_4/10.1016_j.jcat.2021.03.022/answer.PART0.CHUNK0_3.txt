1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. By trapping subnanometric Pt clusters within the Sn-Beta zeolite, the catalysts demonstrate improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and stability. The key factors contributing to these enhancements include the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, which prevents coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters.

2. The solid proof for the anchoring effect of Pt clusters within the Sn-Beta zeolite is provided through the use of 119Sn NMR, XAFS, and in-situ XPS spectra. This indicates the formation of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species, demonstrating the successful anchoring of Pt clusters by the framework Sn atoms.

1. 准晶型催化剂的各种性能受到制备方法、组成和分子筛拓扑结构的影响。通过将亚纳米Pt簇困在Sn-Beta分子筛中，催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能得到显著改善，丙烯选择性、转化率和稳定性也得到了提高。这些增强的关键因素包括Sn和分子筛拓扑结构的独特联合约束效果，它可以防止超细Pt簇的焦炭形成和聚集，从而实现丙烷脱氢反应中最高转化率的90%，丙烯选择性保持在99%。

2. 提供了Pt簇在Sn-Beta分子筛中锚定的固体证据，使用了119Sn核磁共振、X射线吸收精细结构(XAFS)和原位X射线光电子能谱(XPS)等技术。这表明形成了(Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]物种，证明了框架Sn原子成功锚定了Pt簇。
