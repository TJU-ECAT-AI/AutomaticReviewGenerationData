<p>Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the metal species hardly enter into the zeolite channels of subnano-sized pore windows by impregnation due to the diffusion constrains, but mainly locate on the crystal external surface, showing unsatisfied performance in stabilizing metal species under harsh reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Recently, in-situ encapsulation of metal species in constructing zeolite frameworks has been frequently reported.</p>
<p>Liu et al. incorporated Pt subnanometer clusters into the cups and cages of MWW framework during the structural transformation of the two-dimensional (2D) lamellar MCM-22 precursor into its corresponding three-dimensional (3D) structure.</p>
<p>Xiao group successfully fixed the metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ag) within zeolite crystals via a controllable seed-directed growth method.</p>
<p>Sun et al. synthesized single-atom Rh catalysts embedded in MFI-type zeolites under hydrothermal conditions and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction.</p>
<p>For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact.</p>
<p>To combine the complementary advantages of zeolite structure and additives in one matrix, several studies have tried to incorporate Pt into Sn-Beta zeolite, while only evenly dispersed surface nanoparticles were obtained.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the metal aggregation upon air-calcination has been well suppressed in case of K-PtSn@MFI catalyst by introducing K+ in the synthetic gel, resulting in regioselective location of subnanometric Pt clusters in sinusoidal channels.</p>
<p>Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction.</p>

This literature discusses the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly those with BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. The use of carriers and metal additives provides confinement effects that prevent metal growth and aggregation, improving stability under harsh reaction conditions.
2. Zeolite topology allows for in-situ encapsulation of metal species, enabling the trapping of subnanometric clusters within the zeolite framework.
3. Metal additives, like tin (Sn), can provide both geometric and electronic effects, enhancing the stabilization of metal species and improving catalytic activity.
4. High framework Sn content in zeolites like Sn-Beta offers sufficient anchors for Pt species, leading to the formation of confined subnanometric Pt clusters within the zeolite pores.
5. The joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts for PDH reactions.

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include the use of carriers and metal additives to confine and stabilize metal active sites. In particular, tin (Sn) has been found to effectively prevent the collision of Pt active sites and transfer electrons to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms, tuning the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates. Additionally, the joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology provides a strong stabilization mechanism against coke formation and sintering, maintaining high activity and selectivity over long periods.

2. The preparation of subnanometric Pt clusters within Sn-Beta zeolite involves impregnating Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by hydrogen reduction. The high framework Sn content in the zeolite acts as anchors for Pt species, facilitating the formation of confined Pt clusters. The presence of Sn atoms within the zeolite framework inhibits the growth of Pt clusters, leading to enhanced stability in PDH reactions. The Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts exhibit excellent activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH, with the capacity to maintain 90% of maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity.

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, trapping subnanometric Pt clusters into Sn-Beta zeolite through a wet impregnation process followed by hydrogen reduction enables the formation of Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts. The high framework Sn content in the zeolite provides enough anchors for Pt species, enhancing the stability of the catalyst. The zeolite topology, combined with the framework Sn, creates a joint confinement effect that improves the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions. The presence of Pt clusters confined within the pores of *BEA crystals contributes to maintaining high propane conversion and propene selectivity even after extensive use.

2. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability involve the zeolite's pore structure and the electronic effect of the framework Sn atoms. These elements restrict the growth of Pt clusters, prevent coke formation, and inhibit sintering. As a result, the catalyst maintains 90% of its maximum propane conversion capacity over 250 hours, with a high propene selectivity of 99%. The unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology ensures that the Pt clusters are stably anchored within the zeolite structure, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

1. 烯烃加氢反应中，沸石基催化剂的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。通过将铂盐湿浸渍到含有高骨架锡含量的Sn-Beta沸石中，随后进行氢化还原过程，可以捕获单原子和超细铂簇。高骨架锡含量的沸石为铂物种提供了足够的锚点，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。沸石拓扑结构与骨架锡的独特联合限制效应增强了催化剂在烯烃加氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。受限于沸石孔结构内的铂簇存在于*BEA晶体的壁上，形式为（Si-O）2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115)，这有助于维持高达250小时的最高丙烷转化率的90%，同时保持99%的丙烯选择性。独特的联合限制效应确保铂簇稳定地锚定在沸石结构中，从而提高了催化性能。

2. 改善丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括沸石的孔结构和骨架锡原子的电子效应。这些元素限制了铂簇的增长，防止了焦炭形成，并抑制了结块。因此，催化剂在长达250小时的使用过程中仍能保持其最大丙烷转化能力的90%，同时保持99%的高丙烯选择性。沸石拓扑结构与骨架锡的独特联合限制效应确保铂簇稳定地锚定在沸石结构内，从而提高了催化剂的性能。

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Zeolites with specific topologies, such as Beta and *BEA, provide confinement effects by encapsulating subnanometric metal clusters within their pores. The addition of second metal additives, like tin (Sn), contributes to the stabilization of these clusters by inhibiting growth and promoting uniform dispersion.

2. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability involve the precise trapping of subnanometric Pt clusters within the zeolite framework. The use of Sn-Beta zeolite ensures that Pt clusters are anchored effectively, preventing their agglomeration and ensuring a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which enhances both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The electronic effect of Sn also tunes the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates in the PDH process, further enhancing the catalyst's performance.

2. 提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括精确捕获亚纳米级的Pt簇在沸石笼中。使用Sn-Beta沸石确保Pt簇被有效锚定，防止它们聚集，并保持较高的表面积与体积比，从而增强催化剂的活性和选择性。Sn的电子效应也调节了PDH过程中C3中间体的吸附强度，进一步提高了催化剂的性能。
