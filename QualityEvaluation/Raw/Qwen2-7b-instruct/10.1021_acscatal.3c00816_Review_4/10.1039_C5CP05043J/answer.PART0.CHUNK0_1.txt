[1] "The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support; this brings about excellent catalytic activity but may also facilitate generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, which will lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst."
[2] "These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."
[3] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."
[4] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."
[5] "The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is due to the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO."

1. The ALD process creates high-density ZnO sites on the support, which leads to high catalytic activity but also increases the risk of catalyst deactivation due to the formation of coke species, crystallization of catalytic phases, and evaporation of ZnO.

2. ZnO species enhance the dehydrogenation reaction, but subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites for improved performance.

3. For ZnO-modified zeolites, catalysts fabricated with 1-2 cycles of ALD perform better than those with multiple cycles, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics.

4. The primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5-supported ALD ZnO catalyst is coke formation during the reaction.

5. The deactivation of the Y zeolite-supported ALD ZnO catalyst is caused by the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO.

1. ALD过程在支持物上产生高密度的ZnO位点，这带来了出色的催化活性，但也增加了由于焦炭物种形成、催化相晶化和ZnO蒸发导致催化剂加速失活的风险。

2. ZnO物种仅促进脱氢反应，而后续的缩合和环化反应需要Brnsted酸位点以提高性能。

3. 对于ZnO改性沸石，通过1-2轮ALD制备的催化剂比多轮ALD制备的催化剂表现更好，表明孤立的Zn(OH)+物种对于丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃更有效。

4. ZSM-5支持的ALD ZnO催化剂失活的主要原因是反应过程中焦炭物种的形成。

5. Y沸石支持的ALD ZnO催化剂的失活是由焦炭物种形成、催化相晶化或蒸发以及ZnO蒸发的综合效应造成的。
