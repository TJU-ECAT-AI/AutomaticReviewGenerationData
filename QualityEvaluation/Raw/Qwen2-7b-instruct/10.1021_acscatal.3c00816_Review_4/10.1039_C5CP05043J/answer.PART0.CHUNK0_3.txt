[1] "Substantial amounts of ZnO can be introduced into the zeolites by carrying out ALD under saturated reaction conditions."
[2] "As revealed by multiple characterization techniques such as weight gain analysis, N2 physisorption, XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR, isolated Zn(OH)+ species are predominantly formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD."
[3] "Because the pore size of HZSM-5 is very close to the diameter of DEZ, the precursor molecules could only enter the micropores during the first ALD cycle; during subsequent ALD cycles the isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed in the internal cavities of ZSM-5 almost remain unchanged while bulky ZnmOn clusters are gradually formed on the external surface."
[4] "The micropore size of Y zeolite is much larger than the diameter of DEZ so that the precursor molecules could infiltrate the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD."
[5] "In the propane dehydrogenation/aromatization reaction the ALD ZnO modified zeolites exhibit greatly enhanced catalytic activities. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite and high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."
[6] "For both zeolites the catalyst modified by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those modified by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."
[7] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."
[8] "The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is due to the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process enables the introduction of substantial amounts of zinc oxide (ZnO) into the zeolites under saturated reaction conditions. The ALD process creates highly dispersed ZnO species on the internal and external surfaces of both zeolites, with the predominant formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species after the first ALD cycle. 

The topology of the zeolites plays a crucial role in determining the deposition pattern of ZnO. In HZSM-5, due to its small pore size comparable to the diameter of the ALD precursor, the ZnO species can only enter the micropores during the first ALD cycle, leading to the preservation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species in the internal cavities while larger ZnO clusters are formed on the external surface in subsequent cycles. Conversely, the larger pore size of Y zeolite allows the precursor molecules to infiltrate the micropores during the first three ALD cycles, facilitating the conversion of isolated Zn(OH)+ species to larger ZnO clusters on both internal and external surfaces.

The ALD ZnO modified zeolites exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activities in PDH reactions. Propylene is the major product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite, while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5. This suggests that ZnO species primarily promote the dehydrogenation reaction, whereas the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites.

Interestingly, for both zeolites, catalysts modified by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD perform better than those modified by multiple cycles, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics.

However, despite their promising initial catalytic performances, these ALD ZnO modified zeolites experience rapid deactivation, primarily due to coke formation. In the case of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst, coke formation is the primary reason for deactivation, while for the Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO, the deactivation is attributed to the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同沸石基催化剂的性能受制备方法、组分和沸石拓扑结构的影响显著。特别是，原子层沉积（ALD）过程能够通过饱和反应条件下的ALD过程向沸石引入大量锌氧化物（ZnO）。ALD过程在两种沸石的内部和外部表面创建高度分散的ZnO物种，并且在第一轮ALD周期后主要形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种。

沸石的拓扑结构对ZnO物种的沉积模式起着关键作用。在HZSM-5中，由于其微孔尺寸与ALD前体直径相近，ZnO物种只能在第一个ALD周期内进入微孔，导致内部空腔中保留孤立的Zn(OH)+物种，而在后续周期中在表面形成较大的ZnO簇。相反，Y沸石较大的微孔允许前体分子在前三个ALD周期内渗透到微孔中，促进在内部和表面同时形成较大ZnO簇。

ALD ZnO修饰的沸石在PDH反应中表现出显著增强的催化活性。在ALD ZnO修饰的Y沸石中，丙烯是主要产物，而ALD ZnO修饰的ZSM-5沸石则实现了高芳烃选择性。这表明ZnO物种主要促进脱氢反应，而随后的聚合和环化反应需要布郎斯特酸位点。

值得注意的是，对于两种沸石而言，在仅1或2个ALD周期后修改的催化剂比多个周期后修改的催化剂表现更好，表明孤立的Zn(OH)+物种在丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃方面更为有效。

然而，尽管这些ALD ZnO修饰的沸石表现出有希望的初始催化性能，但它们的失活速度很快，主要是由于焦炭形成。对于ZSM-5支持的ALD ZnO催化剂，焦炭形成是主要的失活原因；而对于Y沸石支持的ALD ZnO，失活归因于焦炭形成、催化相的聚集或结晶以及ZnO的蒸发的复合效应。
