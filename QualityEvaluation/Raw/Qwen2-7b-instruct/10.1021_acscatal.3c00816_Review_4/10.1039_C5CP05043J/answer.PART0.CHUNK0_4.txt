[1] "Substantial amounts of ZnO can be introduced into the zeolites by carrying out ALD under saturated reaction conditions."
[2] "As revealed by multiple characterization techniques such as weight gain analysis, N2 physisorption, XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR, isolated Zn(OH)+ species are predominantly formed on both zeolites after the first cycle of ZnO ALD."
[3] "For both zeolites the catalyst modified by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those modified by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."
[4] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, atomic layer deposition (ALD) enables the introduction of substantial amounts of zinc oxide (ZnO) into zeolites under saturated reaction conditions. The ALD process leads to the formation of isolated Zn(OH)+ species on the zeolite surfaces, which are predominant after the first cycle of ALD. This suggests that these species play a crucial role in the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics.

2. The performance of the catalysts is influenced by the number of ALD cycles. The catalysts modified with only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD exhibit better performance compared to those modified with multiple cycles. This indicates that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics. 

3. The deactivation of ALD ZnO modified zeolites is primarily due to coke formation, which is a common issue in non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The coke species formed during the reaction can cover the active sites and block the micropores, leading to catalyst malfunction.

4. The deactivations of ALD ZnO catalysts are faster compared to other metal oxide catalysts supported on zeolites for propane conversion. This is attributed to the high loading of ZnO, which results in the generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases during the reaction. Evaporation of ZnO species may also contribute to the reduced activity of the catalyst.

1. 不同的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能产生影响。特别是通过原子层沉积（ALD）技术，可以在沸石中引入大量的氧化锌（ZnO），并在饱和反应条件下进行。ALD过程导致在沸石表面上形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种，这些物种在第一轮ALD后占主导地位。这表明这些物种在丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃方面的转化中起着关键作用。

2. 催化剂的性能受ALD循环次数的影响。仅使用1或2轮ZnO ALD的催化剂比使用多轮ALD的催化剂表现出更好的性能。这表明孤立的Zn(OH)+物种对于丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃更有效。

3. ALD ZnO改性沸石催化剂的失效主要归因于焦炭的生成，这是非氧化脱氢反应中常见的问题。反应过程中生成的焦炭物种可以覆盖活性位点并阻塞微孔，导致催化剂失活。

4. ALD ZnO催化剂的失效速度比其他用于丙烷转化的金属氧化物催化剂更快。这归因于ZnO的高负载量，导致反应期间生成焦炭物种和催化相结晶。ZnO物种的蒸发也可能导致催化剂活性降低。
