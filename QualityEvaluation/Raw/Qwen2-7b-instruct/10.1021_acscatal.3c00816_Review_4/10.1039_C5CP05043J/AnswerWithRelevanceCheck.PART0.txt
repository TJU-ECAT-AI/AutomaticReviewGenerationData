          [1] "Incorporation of ZnO considerably promotes the activity of the Y zeolite. The conversion at 550 C rises to 1116% on the zeolite fabricated by 13 cycles of ZnO ALD."
          [2] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cyclohexane, the nanolith catalytic system was superior to a conventional powdered catalyst in terms of both efficiency and in reducing the over oxidation."
          [3] "The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support; this brings about excellent catalytic activity but may also facilitate generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, which will lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst."
          [4] "The micropore size of Y zeolite is much larger than the diameter of DEZ so that the precursor molecules could easily enter the micropores during the first three cycles of ZnO ALD."
          [5] "After the stability tests the color of the catalyst samples changes from white to black."
          [6] "The ALD process produces high-density ZnO sites on the support; this brings about excellent catalytic activity but may also facilitate generation of coke species and crystallization of catalytic phases, which will lead to accelerated deactivation of the catalyst."

          The ALD process significantly enhances the activity of the Y zeolite, increasing its conversion rate to 1116% at 550°C when prepared through 13 cycles of ZnO ALD. The nanolith catalytic system outperforms conventional powders in oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, demonstrating both efficiency and reduction in over-oxidation. The ALD process generates high-density ZnO sites on the support, which boosts catalytic activity but also risks coke formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, leading to accelerated catalyst deactivation. The micropore size of Y zeolite is notably larger than that of DEZ, allowing precursor molecules to easily enter the micropores during the first three ALD cycles. Post-stability testing, the catalyst color transitions from white to black, indicating potential deactivation mechanisms.

          通过13轮ZnO ALD制造的Y沸石，ALD过程显著提升了其活性，在550°C下的转化率达到1116%。纳米石催化系统在环己烷的氧化脱氢中优于传统粉末催化剂，展现出更高的效率和减少过氧化的效果。ALD过程在支持体上产生高密度的ZnO位点，提高了催化活性，但也有利于焦炭物种的生成和催化相的结晶，加速了催化剂的失活。Y沸石的微孔尺寸远大于DEZ，使得前驱体分子在前三轮ALD周期内能够轻易地进入微孔。稳定性测试后，催化剂的颜色从白色变为黑色，暗示了潜在的失活机制。

          [1] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."
          [2] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."
          [3] "The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is due to the combined effects of coke formation, sintering or crystallization of the catalytic phase, and evaporation of ZnO."

      <English>
          For both types of zeolites, catalysts fabricated with just 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD outperform those made with multiple cycles, suggesting that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for converting propane to propylene and aromatics. The deactivation of ALD ZnO modified zeolites, especially those supported on ZSM-5, is primarily caused by coke formation, leading to loss of catalytic activity. The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is a result of the complex interplay between coke formation, catalytic phase sintering or crystallization, and ZnO evaporation, collectively accelerating the catalyst's decline in performance.

          对于两种类型的沸石，仅使用1或2轮ZnO ALD制造的催化剂比多轮ALD制造的催化剂性能更优，表明孤立的Zn(OH)+物种对于将丙烷转化为丙烯和芳烃更为有效。ZSM-5支持的ALD ZnO催化剂的失活主要是由焦炭的形成导致的，这直接导致了催化剂活性的丧失。Y沸石支持的ALD ZnO催化剂的失活是由焦炭的形成、催化相的聚集或结晶以及ZnO蒸发的复杂相互作用共同加速的，这一系列因素导致了催化剂性能的下降。

          The ALD process creates high-density ZnO sites on the support, enhancing catalytic activity but potentially causing coke species formation and crystallization of catalytic phases, which accelerates catalyst deactivation. For ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalysts, coke formation is the main reason for deactivation. The deactivation of Y zeolite supported ALD ZnO is attributed to the combined impact of coke formation, catalytic phase sintering or crystallization, and ZnO evaporation.

          ALD过程在支持体上产生高密度的ZnO位点，提高了催化活性，但也可能引起焦炭物种的生成和催化相的结晶，加速了催化剂的失活。对于ZSM-5支持的ALD ZnO催化剂，焦炭的形成是导致失活的主要原因。Y沸石支持的ALD ZnO催化剂的失活归因于焦炭的形成、催化相的聚集或结晶以及ZnO蒸发的综合作用。
