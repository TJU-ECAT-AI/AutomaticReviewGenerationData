1. Incorporating ZnO significantly boosts the activity of the Y zeolite, with conversion rates reaching up to 1116% at 550°C when fabricated via 13 cycles of ZnO atomic layer deposition (ALD).

2. For cyclohexane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the nanolith catalytic system outperforms conventional powders in both efficiency and reducing over-oxidation.

3. The ALD method yields densely packed ZnO sites on the support, enhancing catalytic activity, yet also promotes coke formation, phase crystallization, and ZnO evaporation, accelerating catalyst deactivation.

4. The Y zeolite's micropore size exceeds the DEZ molecule's diameter, enabling easy entry of precursor molecules into the micropores during the first three ALD cycles.

5. Post-stability tests, catalyst colors transition from white to black.

6. The ALD process generates a high concentration of ZnO sites on the support, boosting catalytic performance but also increasing the risk of coke formation, phase crystallization, and ZnO evaporation, leading to rapid catalyst degradation.

1. 添加ZnO显著提高了Y沸石的活性，通过13轮ZnO原子层沉积（ALD）制造时，在550°C下的转化率可达到1116%。

2. 对于环己烷氧化脱氢（ODH），纳米石催化体系在效率和减少过氧化方面的表现均优于传统粉末催化剂。

3. ALD方法在支持体上产生密集的ZnO位点，带来优异的催化活性，但也促进了焦炭形成、催化相结晶以及ZnO蒸发，加速了催化剂的降解。

4. Y沸石的微孔尺寸远大于DEZ分子直径，使得前驱体分子在前三轮ALD周期内能够轻松进入微孔。

5. 稳定性测试后，催化剂的颜色从白色变为黑色。

6. ALD过程在支持体上产生了高浓度的ZnO位点，增强了催化性能，但同时也增加了焦炭形成、相结晶和ZnO蒸发的风险，导致催化剂快速降解。
