1. Zeolites play a significant role in petroleum refining and petrochemical industries as acid catalysts. Metal cation modification of zeolites can enhance their catalytic performance by adjusting the acid properties and introducing various active species.

2. The ALD process, when utilized for preparing catalysts, demonstrates unique advantages in catalyst preparation and offers insights into alkane conversion processes over Zn-modified zeolites.

3. The study reveals that for both ZSM-5 and Y zeolites, catalysts produced using only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD outperform those made with multiple ALD cycles. This indicates that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more efficient for propane conversion to propylene and aromatics.

4. The research highlights the importance of ALD in catalyst preparation and contributes to a deeper understanding of alkane conversion processes over Zn-modified zeolites.

5. In the initial ALD cycle, isolated Zn(OH)+ species attach to the zeolite surface through interactions with the lattice oxygen.

6. As the number of ALD cycles increases, the fraction of ZnO reduced at higher temperatures rises, suggesting that larger ZnmOn clusters or particles form, which are closer to the structure of bulk ZnO.

1. 硅铝酸盐在石油精炼和石油化工行业中广泛用作酸催化剂。通过向硅铝酸盐中引入金属阳离子，可以调整其酸性性质并引入不同的活性物种，从而提高催化性能。

2. 使用原子层沉积（ALD）技术制备催化剂显示出独特的优势，在硅铝酸盐改性催化剂的制备和对烷烃转化过程的理解方面提供了见解。

3. 研究发现，对于ZSM-5和Y型硅铝酸盐，仅使用1或2次ALD循环制造的催化剂比多次ALD循环制造的催化剂更优。这表明孤立的Zn(OH)+物种对于丙烷转化为丙烯和芳香族化合物更为有效。

4. 该研究强调了ALD在催化剂制备中的重要性和对烷烃转化过程在锌改性硅铝酸盐中的深入理解。

5. 在最初的ALD循环中，孤立的Zn(OH)+物种通过与硅铝酸盐晶格氧的相互作用附着到表面上。

6. 随着ALD循环次数的增加，处于较高温度范围（780-800°C）被还原的ZnO比例逐渐上升，表明形成了接近纯ZnO结构的较大ZnmOn簇或颗粒。
