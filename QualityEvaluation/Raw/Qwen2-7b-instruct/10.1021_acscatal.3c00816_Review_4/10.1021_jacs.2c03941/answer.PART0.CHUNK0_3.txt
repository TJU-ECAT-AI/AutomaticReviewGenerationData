The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Ga+-chabazite zeolite, with its unique topology and acidic properties, demonstrates high activity and selectivity in nonoxidative PDH, offering a higher propylene yield compared to conventional catalysts. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites contribute to improved performance due to their well-defined pore structure and high surface area, which enhance catalytic efficiency. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in particular, exhibit superior stability under harsh reaction conditions. The precise control over the zeolite framework results in high selectivity and conversion rates in PDH reactions.
