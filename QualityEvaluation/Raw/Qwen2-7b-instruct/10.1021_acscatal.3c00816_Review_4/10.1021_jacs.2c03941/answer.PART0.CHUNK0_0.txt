The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology play crucial roles in enhancing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the Ga+-chabazite zeolite was found to be highly selective for non-oxidative PDH, demonstrating improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability compared to other zeolites. BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites also exhibited enhanced performance attributes due to their unique structural characteristics.
