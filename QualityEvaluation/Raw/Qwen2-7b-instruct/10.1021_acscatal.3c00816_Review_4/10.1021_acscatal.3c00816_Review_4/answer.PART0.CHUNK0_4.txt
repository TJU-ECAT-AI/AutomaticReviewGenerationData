1. The preparation methods, specifically Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation, result in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss during PDH reactions compared to stepwise impregnation. The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst demonstrates a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% under specific conditions.

2. Adjusting the acid treatment conditions for Beta zeolites can lead to varying degrees of dealumination, creating deAl-Beta with customizable structure or even pure silica Beta zeolite, which improves dispersion and stability of metal species.

3. The introduction of framework Sn species into Sn-Beta zeolites enables encapsulation of all impregnated Pt species within the Si-Beta channels, enhancing Pt dispersion and stability.

4. Treatment of the catalyst in He at 823 K reduces Pt species to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn maintains an average valence state of +1, contributing to improved PDH performance.

5. The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst contains most of the Pt species as single atoms or 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages, enhancing Pt dispersion.

6. The dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment reveals that Pt species mainly disperse on the external surface of the SUZ-4 support, leading to superior stability compared to ZSM-5 support.

7. The NaX zeolite framework surrounding encapsulated Pt species in the Pt@NaX catalyst suppresses propylene desorption, reducing propylene selectivity and increasing coke deposits.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions.

1. Zn 离子交换后进行Pt浸渍的方法在PDH反应中相比分步浸渍，能产生更高的Pt分散性和较低的Zn损失。优化的0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在特定条件下实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。

2. 调整Beta沸石的酸处理条件可以实现不同程度的铝去除，生成具有任意结构或纯二氧化硅Beta沸石的deAl-Beta，这有助于改善金属物种的分散性和稳定性。

3. Sn-Beta沸石引入框架Sn物种使得所有浸渍的Pt物种能够被封装在Si-Beta通道内，得益于强PtSn相互作用，这增强了Pt的分散性和稳定性。

4. 在He中对催化剂进行823K处理，Pt物种被还原为接近零价状态，而Zn保持平均价态为+1，这有助于提高PDH性能。

5. Pt@MCM-22催化剂中的大部分Pt物种以单原子或0.7nm簇的形式封装在hemicages和supercages内，增强Pt的分散性。

6. dibenzothiophene中毒实验表明，Pt物种主要分布在SUZ-4支持物的外部表面，导致与ZSM-5支持物相比具有更优的稳定性。

7. NaX沸石框架包裹在Pt@NaX催化剂中的封装Pt物种周围，抑制了丙烯脱附，降低了丙烯选择性和增加了焦炭沉积。

这些因素共同促进了PDH反应中丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提升。
