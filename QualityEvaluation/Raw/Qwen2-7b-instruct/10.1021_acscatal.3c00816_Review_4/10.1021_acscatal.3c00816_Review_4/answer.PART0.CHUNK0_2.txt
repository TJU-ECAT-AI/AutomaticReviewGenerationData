[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[2] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[3] "The resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits."
[4] "The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved."
[5] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH test at 500 C."
[6] "The combined DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments demonstrate that the Ga2O3/In2O3 species would displace the protos of Bronsted acid sites to form isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites upon H2 reduction."

1. Preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Specifically, the use of Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation leads to higher Pt dispersion and reduced Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst demonstrates a high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Additionally, the removal of Bronsted acid sites in Si-Beta zeolites enhances selectivity and stability by suppressing side cracking reactions and coke deposits. Sodium doping treatments weaken Bronsted acidity while preserving Lewis acidity, leading to improved propylene selectivity without affecting propane conversion. Furthermore, the Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits exceptional performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, along with excellent stability. Lastly, the displacement of Bronsted acid sites by Ga2O3/In2O3 species upon H2 reduction forms isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites, which act as the active center for PDH reactions, enhancing reaction rates.

2. The role of Sn in PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts involves modifying Pt site electronic density and transferring coke deposits from Pt to support, improving the PDH performance, particularly in propylene selectivity. The unique feature of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, namely stable and abundant framework P atoms, facilitates the construction of highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides, potentially improving PDH performance compared to metal/oxide sites.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在PDH反应中对各种沸石基催化剂的性能产生重大影响。具体来说，使用Zn离子交换后进行铂浸渍的方法比分步浸渍导致更高的铂分散度和较低的Zn损失。优化后的0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在63小时反应中实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。此外，Si-Beta沸石中去除酸位可以抑制副裂解反应和结焦，从而提高选择性和稳定性。钠掺杂处理减弱了酸位，同时保持了Lewis酸性，导致丙烷转化率保持不变，而丙烯选择性显著提高。此外，Pt-Sn-Beta-R催化剂表现出极高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及出色的稳定性。最后，Ga2O3/In2O3物种在H2还原后通过置换酸位形成孤立的额外框架Ga+/In+位点，作为PDH反应的活性中心，提高了反应速率。

2. 在PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂中，Sn的作用包括修改铂位电子密度，并将结焦从Pt转移到支持物上，从而改善PDH性能，特别是丙烯选择性。硅铝磷酸盐沸石的独特特征是稳定的磷原子骨架，这有助于构建高度分散且超稳定的金属磷化物，与金属/氧化物位相比，这可能提高PDH性能。
