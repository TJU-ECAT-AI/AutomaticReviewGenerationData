[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods."
[2] "The catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[3] "In particular, the catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU)."
[4] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[5] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[6] "Chen et al. (103) first reported the use of Si-Beta zeolites supported ZnOx for the PDH reaction."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation demonstrate higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved performance. Zeolites with specific topologies, like Na-Beta, have a reduced amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits undesirable side-reactions and coke deposits. Adjusting the acid treatment conditions allows for varying degrees of dealumination, creating deAl-Beta zeolites with tailored properties. The optimized catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium under specific conditions. Si-Beta zeolites, when used as supports, contribute to high propylene selectivity and stability. The dehydrogenation rate is influenced by Lewis acidity, while the cracking rate depends on Bronsted acidity, which is independent of the dehydrogenation rate. Sodium doping treatments weaken Bronsted acidity without impacting Lewis acidity, enhancing catalyst performance. Optimized Pt-Sn-Beta catalysts exhibit high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with excellent stability over prolonged reaction times. Treatment conditions can affect the valence states of metals, influencing their reactivity and stability in PDH reactions.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响各种沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。通过Zn离子交换后进行Pt浸渍制备的催化剂表现出更高的Pt分散性和更低的Zn损失，从而提高性能。特定拓扑结构的沸石，如Na-Beta，具有较少的孤立Zn2+位点，这抑制了不利的副反应和焦炭沉积。调整酸处理条件允许不同程度的去铝化，创建具有定制特性的deAl-Beta沸石。优化的催化剂在特定条件下实现高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，接近热力学平衡转换。使用Si-Beta沸石作为支持物，有助于高丙烯选择性和稳定性。去氢化速率受Lewis酸度的影响，而裂解速率取决于Bronsted酸度，后者与去氢化速率无关。钠掺杂处理减弱了Bronsted酸度而不影响Lewis酸度，增强了催化剂性能。优化的Pt-Sn-Beta催化剂在长时间反应中表现出高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及出色的稳定性。处理条件可以影响金属的价态，影响PDH反应中的活性和稳定性。

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. **Preparation Methods**: Using Zn ion-exchange before Pt impregnation leads to higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, enhancing catalyst efficiency. For instance, the 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst demonstrates a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

2. **Zeolite Topology and Structure**: Different topologies allow for varying amounts of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibit side-reactions and coke deposits. For example, Na-Beta supports have less isolated Zn2+ sites compared to other topologies.

3. **Dealkylation**: Adjusting acid treatment conditions can alter the degree of dealkylation in Beta zeolites, leading to deAl-Beta with arbitrary surface area ratios or pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta).

4. **Metal Encapsulation**: Encapsulating Pt species within zeolite channels, as seen in the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, improves dispersion and stability. 

5. **Post-Treatment Conditions**: Reducing Pt species to a nearly zerovalent state after treatment in He at 823 K enhances propylene selectivity by improving the stability and reactivity of the Pt catalyst.

6. **Zn-OH Nests**: Incorporating Zn species on Si-Beta results in Zn-OH nests that anchor isolated Pt atoms, increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

7. **Framework Species**: Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, such as SAPO-34, exhibit unique properties like stable and abundant framework P atoms, facilitating the construction of highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides that improve PDH performance, particularly in propylene selectivity.

These factors collectively contribute to the enhanced performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, optimizing propylene yield and reducing coke formation.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同类型的沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和拓扑结构对性能产生显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. **制备方法**：通过离子交换前的Zn浸渍方法可获得更高的Pt分散度和更低的Zn损失。例如，0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率为30%，丙烯选择性为90%。

2. **拓扑结构和结构**：不同的拓扑结构可以提供不同数量的孤立Zn2+位点，从而抑制副反应和焦炭沉积。例如，Na-Beta支持具有较少的孤立Zn2+位点，与其它拓扑结构相比。

3. **脱铝化**：通过调整酸处理条件，可以改变Beta沸石的脱铝程度，生成任意表面面积比的脱铝Beta或纯硅Beta沸石（Si-Beta）。

4. **金属封装**：将Pt物种封装在沸石通道内，如在Pt@MCM-22催化剂中观察到，可以改善分散性和稳定性。

5. **后处理条件**：在He中进行823K的处理后，将Pt物种还原至近零价态，通过增强Pt催化剂的稳定性和活性来提高丙烯选择性。

6. **Zn-OH巢穴**：在Si-Beta上引入Zn物种导致形成Zn-OH巢穴，这些巢穴锚定了孤立的Pt原子，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

7. **框架物种**：像SAPO-34这样的硅铝磷酸盐沸石具有稳定的框架P原子的独特性质，这有助于构建高度分散且超稳定的金属磷化物，从而改善PDH性能，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。

这些因素共同作用，优化了沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中的性能，最大限度地提高了丙烯产量并减少了焦炭形成。

1. Preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Specifically, the use of Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation leads to higher Pt dispersion and reduced Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst demonstrates a high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Additionally, the removal of Bronsted acid sites in Si-Beta zeolites enhances selectivity and stability by suppressing side cracking reactions and coke deposits. Sodium doping treatments weaken Bronsted acidity while preserving Lewis acidity, leading to improved propylene selectivity without affecting propane conversion. Furthermore, the Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits exceptional performance with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, along with excellent stability. Lastly, the displacement of Bronsted acid sites by Ga2O3/In2O3 species upon H2 reduction forms isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites, which act as the active center for PDH reactions, enhancing reaction rates.

2. The role of Sn in PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts involves modifying Pt site electronic density and transferring coke deposits from Pt to support, improving the PDH performance, particularly in propylene selectivity. The unique feature of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, namely stable and abundant framework P atoms, facilitates the construction of highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides, potentially improving PDH performance compared to metal/oxide sites.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在PDH反应中对各种沸石基催化剂的性能产生重大影响。具体来说，使用Zn离子交换后进行铂浸渍的方法比分步浸渍导致更高的铂分散度和较低的Zn损失。优化后的0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂在63小时反应中实现了30%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。此外，Si-Beta沸石中去除酸位可以抑制副裂解反应和结焦，从而提高选择性和稳定性。钠掺杂处理减弱了酸位，同时保持了Lewis酸性，导致丙烷转化率保持不变，而丙烯选择性显著提高。此外，Pt-Sn-Beta-R催化剂表现出极高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及出色的稳定性。最后，Ga2O3/In2O3物种在H2还原后通过置换酸位形成孤立的额外框架Ga+/In+位点，作为PDH反应的活性中心，提高了反应速率。

2. 在PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂中，Sn的作用包括修改铂位电子密度，并将结焦从Pt转移到支持物上，从而改善PDH性能，特别是丙烯选择性。硅铝磷酸盐沸石的独特特征是稳定的磷原子骨架，这有助于构建高度分散且超稳定的金属磷化物，与金属/氧化物位相比，这可能提高PDH性能。
