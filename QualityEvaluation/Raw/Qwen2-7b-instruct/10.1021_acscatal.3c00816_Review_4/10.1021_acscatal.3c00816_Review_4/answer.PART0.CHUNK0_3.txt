[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods."
[2] "The catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[3] "In particular, the catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU)."
[4] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[5] "The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions."
[6] "For the resulting Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species exist as single atoms and 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages."
[7] "Gong et al. (141) employed the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to introduce well-defined Zn species onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites."
[8] "The combined DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments demonstrate that the Ga2O3/In2O3 species would displace the protos of Bronsted acid sites to form isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites upon H2 reduction."
[9] "Zhou et al. (55) reported that the SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits a PDH stability superior to that of the counterpart with ZSM-5 support."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly impact the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Catalysts prepared through Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation show higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, enhancing their PDH activity. 

2. Zeolite topology: Zeolites like Beta and MFI exhibit different performance profiles due to their distinct structures. For instance, Na-Beta supports inhibit aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits, offering better propylene selectivity. 

3. Acid treatment: Adjusting acid treatment conditions allows for varying degrees of dealumination in Beta zeolites, leading to deAl-Beta with arbitrary surface area ratios or even pure silica Beta zeolites. This modification enhances dispersion and stabilization of metal species.

4. Heteroatom incorporation: Incorporating heteroatoms like Sn, Ga, and In into zeolites provides additional reactive sites and anchor points for Pt species, improving dispersion, stabilization, and propylene selectivity.

5. Encapsulation techniques: Methods like secondary hydrothermal processes and atomic layer deposition enable encapsulation of Pt species within zeolite channels, promoting high dispersion and stability.

6. Poisoning experiments: Investigating Pt distribution through poisoning experiments reveals differences in stability, influenced by zeolite topology. For example, Pt predominantly disperses on the external surface of SUZ-4, leading to superior stability compared to ZSM-5.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同类型的沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对性能有着显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：通过锌离子交换后进行铂浸渍的方法制备的催化剂表现出更高的铂分散性和更低的锌损失，从而增强其PDH活性。

2. 沸石拓扑结构：不同结构的沸石如Beta和MFI表现出不同的性能特性。例如，Na-Beta支持能够抑制副反应和焦炭沉积，提供更好的丙烯选择性。

3. 酸处理：调整酸处理条件允许Beta沸石不同程度的去铝化，产生任意表面面积比或甚至纯硅Beta沸石。这种修改可以增强金属物种的分散性和稳定性。

4. 异质原子的引入：将Sn、Ga和In等异质原子引入到沸石中提供了额外的活性位点和Pt物种的锚定点，从而提高了分散性、稳定性并增强了丙烯选择性。

5. 封装技术：通过二次水热过程和原子层沉积等方法可以在沸石通道内封装Pt物种，促进高分散性和稳定性。

6. 毒物实验：通过毒物实验研究Pt分布揭示了不同沸石拓扑结构的影响差异。例如，Pt主要分布在SUZ-4的外部表面，导致与ZSM-5相比具有更优的稳定性。
