The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. **Preparation Methods**: Using Zn ion-exchange before Pt impregnation leads to higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, enhancing catalyst efficiency. For instance, the 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst demonstrates a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90%.

2. **Zeolite Topology and Structure**: Different topologies allow for varying amounts of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibit side-reactions and coke deposits. For example, Na-Beta supports have less isolated Zn2+ sites compared to other topologies.

3. **Dealkylation**: Adjusting acid treatment conditions can alter the degree of dealkylation in Beta zeolites, leading to deAl-Beta with arbitrary surface area ratios or pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta).

4. **Metal Encapsulation**: Encapsulating Pt species within zeolite channels, as seen in the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, improves dispersion and stability. 

5. **Post-Treatment Conditions**: Reducing Pt species to a nearly zerovalent state after treatment in He at 823 K enhances propylene selectivity by improving the stability and reactivity of the Pt catalyst.

6. **Zn-OH Nests**: Incorporating Zn species on Si-Beta results in Zn-OH nests that anchor isolated Pt atoms, increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

7. **Framework Species**: Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, such as SAPO-34, exhibit unique properties like stable and abundant framework P atoms, facilitating the construction of highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides that improve PDH performance, particularly in propylene selectivity.

These factors collectively contribute to the enhanced performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, optimizing propylene yield and reducing coke formation.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同类型的沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和拓扑结构对性能产生显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. **制备方法**：通过离子交换前的Zn浸渍方法可获得更高的Pt分散度和更低的Zn损失。例如，0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率为30%，丙烯选择性为90%。

2. **拓扑结构和结构**：不同的拓扑结构可以提供不同数量的孤立Zn2+位点，从而抑制副反应和焦炭沉积。例如，Na-Beta支持具有较少的孤立Zn2+位点，与其它拓扑结构相比。

3. **脱铝化**：通过调整酸处理条件，可以改变Beta沸石的脱铝程度，生成任意表面面积比的脱铝Beta或纯硅Beta沸石（Si-Beta）。

4. **金属封装**：将Pt物种封装在沸石通道内，如在Pt@MCM-22催化剂中观察到，可以改善分散性和稳定性。

5. **后处理条件**：在He中进行823K的处理后，将Pt物种还原至近零价态，通过增强Pt催化剂的稳定性和活性来提高丙烯选择性。

6. **Zn-OH巢穴**：在Si-Beta上引入Zn物种导致形成Zn-OH巢穴，这些巢穴锚定了孤立的Pt原子，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

7. **框架物种**：像SAPO-34这样的硅铝磷酸盐沸石具有稳定的框架P原子的独特性质，这有助于构建高度分散且超稳定的金属磷化物，从而改善PDH性能，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。

这些因素共同作用，优化了沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中的性能，最大限度地提高了丙烯产量并减少了焦炭形成。
