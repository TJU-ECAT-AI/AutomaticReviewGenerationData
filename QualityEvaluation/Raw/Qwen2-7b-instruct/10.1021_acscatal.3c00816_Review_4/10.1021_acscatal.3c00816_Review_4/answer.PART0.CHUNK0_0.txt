[1] "De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods."
[2] "The catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."
[3] "In particular, the catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU)."
[4] "By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta)."
[5] "The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane)."
[6] "Chen et al. (103) first reported the use of Si-Beta zeolites supported ZnOx for the PDH reaction."
[7] "It was found that the dehydrogenation rate was dependent on the Lewis acidity, while the Bronsted acidity contributes to the cracking rate but is independent of the dehydrogenation rate."

[10] "After treatment in He at 823 K, the Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1."

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation demonstrate higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss, leading to improved performance. Zeolites with specific topologies, like Na-Beta, have a reduced amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits undesirable side-reactions and coke deposits. Adjusting the acid treatment conditions allows for varying degrees of dealumination, creating deAl-Beta zeolites with tailored properties. The optimized catalysts achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, approaching thermodynamic equilibrium under specific conditions. Si-Beta zeolites, when used as supports, contribute to high propylene selectivity and stability. The dehydrogenation rate is influenced by Lewis acidity, while the cracking rate depends on Bronsted acidity, which is independent of the dehydrogenation rate. Sodium doping treatments weaken Bronsted acidity without impacting Lewis acidity, enhancing catalyst performance. Optimized Pt-Sn-Beta catalysts exhibit high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with excellent stability over prolonged reaction times. Treatment conditions can affect the valence states of metals, influencing their reactivity and stability in PDH reactions.

1. 准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响各种沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。通过Zn离子交换后进行Pt浸渍制备的催化剂表现出更高的Pt分散性和更低的Zn损失，从而提高性能。特定拓扑结构的沸石，如Na-Beta，具有较少的孤立Zn2+位点，这抑制了不利的副反应和焦炭沉积。调整酸处理条件允许不同程度的去铝化，创建具有定制特性的deAl-Beta沸石。优化的催化剂在特定条件下实现高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，接近热力学平衡转换。使用Si-Beta沸石作为支持物，有助于高丙烯选择性和稳定性。去氢化速率受Lewis酸度的影响，而裂解速率取决于Bronsted酸度，后者与去氢化速率无关。钠掺杂处理减弱了Bronsted酸度而不影响Lewis酸度，增强了催化剂性能。优化的Pt-Sn-Beta催化剂在长时间反应中表现出高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，以及出色的稳定性。处理条件可以影响金属的价态，影响PDH反应中的活性和稳定性。
