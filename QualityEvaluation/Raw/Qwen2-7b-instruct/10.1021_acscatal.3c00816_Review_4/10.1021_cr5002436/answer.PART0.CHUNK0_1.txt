[1] "In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. (26) This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions."
[2] "As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions."
[3] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts with a strong reduction peak at low temperatures show the highest catalytic activity."
[4] "It is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."
[5] "Indeed, studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane have revealed that catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields follows the order CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2, a reverse order being found for the reduction temperature of the chromium species on the aforementioned catalyst supports."
[6] "Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant. The latter has been explained by assigning the occurrence of cracking and dehydrogenation reactions to strong and medium strength acid sites, respectively."

1. The development of technology for synthesizing long-chain linear olefins used in biodegradable detergents in the 1960s was inspired by bifunctional supported metal catalysts in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and an acidic support provides sites for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking.

2. The structure of platinum particles plays a role in undesired side reactions during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation. Small particles are preferred, but the dispersion of these particles affects the rate of these reactions differently.

3. Catalysts with a strong reduction peak at low temperatures demonstrate the highest catalytic activity in ethane dehydrogenation.

4. It is feasible to achieve high activity and selectivity in chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by modifying the catalyst composition and operating conditions.

5. The order of catalytic activity for dehydrogenating ethane, based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields, is CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2. The reduction temperature of chromium species on these catalyst supports shows the reverse order.

6. The selectivity towards cracking of a particular material decreases with time-on-stream, while its selectivity towards the alkene remains constant. This difference in selectivity is attributed to the assignment of cracking and dehydrogenation reactions to strong and medium strength acid sites, respectively.

1. 1960年代，用于生产可生物降解洗涤剂的长链线性烯烃的合成技术得到了发展，这种新技术灵感来源于催化重整中使用的双功能支持金属催化剂，其中贵重金属催化加氢和脱氢反应，酸性支持提供异构化、环化和氢化裂解所需的活性位点。

2. 钯颗粒的结构对烷烃脱氢过程中发生的副反应，如氢解、异构化和焦炭形成有影响。小颗粒更优，但颗粒的分散程度对这些反应速率的影响存在争议。

3. 在乙烷脱氢中，具有在低温下显示强烈还原峰的催化剂显示出最高的催化活性。

4. 调整催化剂组成和操作条件是实现高活性和选择性铬基脱氢催化剂的关键。基于乙烷转化率和乙烯产率，脱氢活性顺序为CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2。这些催化剂支撑上铬物种的还原温度则呈现相反的顺序。

5. 在特定材料中，随着时间的推移，其裂解选择性逐渐下降，而其烯烃选择性保持不变。这一差异的选择性归因于将裂解和脱氢反应分别归因于强和中等强度酸位。
