[1] "Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH. Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation. On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation. (30, 206)"

[2] "In addition, the use of a support with little to no Brnsted acidity can dramatically reduce coke deposition, thereby improving catalyst performance."

[3] "The addition of promoters such as MgO to vanadium oxide catalysts can improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation."

[4] "The use of mixed metal oxides, such as GaOx, can provide improved dehydrogenation activity due to the synergistic effects between the metals."

[5] "In terms of stability, Pt-based catalysts can afford comparable yields to metal oxide catalysts while operating at higher space velocities, indicating their superior stability."

[6] "Metal oxide-based catalysts, particularly GaOx, can provide yields comparable to Pt-based catalysts, but they deactivate faster, especially when operated at higher space velocities."

1. Two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support are considered the most active for dehydrogenation, and isolated vanadium species are also active but prone to deactivation due to coke formation. Large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation processes.

2. Using a support with minimal Brnsted acidity can significantly reduce coke deposition, enhancing catalyst performance.

3. Promoter elements like MgO can be added to vanadium oxide catalysts to improve dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation.

4. Mixed metal oxides, such as GaOx, can offer improved dehydrogenation activity due to synergistic interactions between the metals.

5. Platinum-based catalysts demonstrate superior stability, providing comparable yields to metal oxide catalysts at higher space velocities.

6. Metal oxide-based catalysts, particularly GaOx, can achieve yields similar to Pt-based catalysts, but they experience faster deactivation, especially when operated at higher space velocities.

1. 对于脱氢反应，二维聚集体V3+或V4+与γ/θ-氧化铝支持直接结合被认为是活性最高的物种。孤立的钒物种也表现出活性，但容易因焦炭形成而失活。较大的V2O5晶粒在脱氢过程中几乎是无效的。

2. 使用具有极少酸性位点的支撑材料可以显著减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂性能。

3. MgO等促进剂可以添加到钒氧化物催化剂中，通过减少焦炭形成来提高脱氢选择性。

4. 如GaOx这样的混合金属氧化物可以通过金属之间的协同作用提供改善的脱氢活性。

5. 基于铂的催化剂显示出更高的稳定性，能够在更高的空速下提供与金属氧化物催化剂相当的产率。

6. 金属氧化物基催化剂，尤其是GaOx，能够达到与基于铂的催化剂相当的产率，但它们在较高的空速下更快地失活。
