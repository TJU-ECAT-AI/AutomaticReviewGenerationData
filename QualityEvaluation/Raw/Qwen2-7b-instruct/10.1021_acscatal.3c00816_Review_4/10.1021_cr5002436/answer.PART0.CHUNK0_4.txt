[1] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[2] "For example, by adding CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[3] "As an additional effect, the loss of alumina surface area reduces the ability of the support to stabilize Cr6+ species formed during the regeneration step."
[4] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."

1. Many new facilities constructing propane dehydrogenation plants will be established in China or the United States, utilizing either the Catofin technology from Lummus or the Oleflex technology from UOP.

2. Adding CO2 as a mild oxidant enhances the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation.

3. The loss of alumina surface area during the regeneration process diminishes the support's capability to stabilize Cr6+ species.

4. The similarity in ionic radii and charge between Al3+ and Cr3+ aids in the diffusion and incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, forming an inactive chromiaalumina spinel.

5. Zirconia has been explored as an alternative support, owing to its low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance imparted by chromia, making it a suitable substitute for alumina.

1. 大多数新建工厂将在中国或美国建立，用于建造丙烷脱氢装置，使用Lummus的Catofin技术或UOP的Oleflex技术。

2. 添加CO2作为温和氧化剂，通过逆向水煤气变换反应去除生成的氢，从而提高铬基脱氢催化剂的活性，使平衡倾向于产物形成。

3. 再生过程中铝氧化物表面面积的损失削弱了支持体稳定Cr6+物种的能力。

4. 铝离子和Cr3+的相似半径和电荷促进了Cr3+在铝氧化物八面体位点的扩散和集成，形成一种不适用于脱氢反应的铬氧铝氧酸盐。

5. 由于其低表面酸性和由铬氧赋予的增强烧结抗性，锆石被探索用作替代支撑体，使其成为铝氧化物的合适替代品。
