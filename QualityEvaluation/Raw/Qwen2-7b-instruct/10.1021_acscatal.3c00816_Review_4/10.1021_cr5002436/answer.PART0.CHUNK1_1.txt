1. The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics on Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has received considerable attention. Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation are considered the active sites, exhibiting a reaction mechanism akin to those observed on GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. These Zn2+ species reside in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, providing a counter-charge for two Al species. Their stability is crucial, as volatile Zn species might be produced under dehydrogenation reaction conditions.

1. 对于轻烷烃转化为芳烃，通过H-ZSM-5沸石上支持的锌催化剂的研究受到了相当大的关注。四面体定向的孤立Zn2+物种被视为活性位点，其反应机制类似于在GaOx基脱氢催化剂上报道的机制。这些Zn2+物种位于沸石的阳离子交换位点中，为两个Al物种提供反电荷。它们的稳定性很重要，因为在脱氢反应条件下可能会产生挥发性Zn物种。

[1] "The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has also been studied, the catalysts being prepared either as hydrogels or as mixed oxides."
[2] "Chen et al. investigated mixed oxides with different zinc to titanium ratios and found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 resulted in the most active catalyst."
[3] "Cubic Zn2TiO3 was deemed to be the active species in dehydrogenation, although the overall activity of these catalysts was found to be limited."
[4] "More recently, isolated Zn2+ species deposited on a silica support were found to be active in propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The active sites were determined to be coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ Lewis acids sites located on a tri-membered siloxane ring on the silica support."

2. The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has been explored, with catalysts synthesized as hydrogels or mixed oxides. Chen et al. examined mixed oxides with varying zinc to titanium ratios, concluding that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 produced the most effective catalyst. While cubic Zn2TiO3 was identified as the active species in dehydrogenation, the overall catalytic performance of these catalysts was found to be constrained. Recently, isolated Zn2+ species deposited on a silica support were discovered to be active in propane dehydrogenation. These active sites were identified as coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ Lewis acid sites situated on a three-membered siloxane ring on the silica surface.

2. 锌钛酸盐在轻烯烃脱氢中的活性也进行了研究，催化剂以水凝胶或混合氧化物的形式制备。陈等人研究了不同锌到钛比的混合氧化物，发现锌与钛的比例为2时，催化效果最佳。虽然立方体Zn2TiO3被认为是脱氢过程中的活性物种，但这些催化剂的整体活性受限。最近，发现在硅胶支持上沉积的孤立Zn2+物种在丙烷脱氢中具有活性。这些活性位点被确定为位于硅胶表面三元环上的可协调未饱和Zn2+路易斯酸位点。

[1] "The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4."
[2] "However, care must be taken when comparing these Ea values, as the methods used for obtaining these are not identical."
[3] "Furthermore, these simulations assume model surfaces that do not resemble real catalyst systems, and therefore the results are not necessarily representative of the experimentally observed reaction rates."
[4] "Nevertheless, these combined theoretical and experimental data are very encouraging and highlight the need for more extensive studies on the reaction rate on Pt- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

3. The discrepancies in specific activity values previously mentioned can be attributed to the comparison of activation energies calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods, as outlined in section 4. However, caution should be exercised when comparing these energy of activation (Ea) values, considering that the methodologies for deriving these values are not uniform. Moreover, these simulations are based on idealized surface models that do not accurately replicate real catalyst systems, rendering the findings potentially non-representative of actual reaction kinetics. Nonetheless, the amalgamation of theoretical and experimental data is quite promising and underscores the necessity for more comprehensive investigations into the reaction dynamics on platinum- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

3. 之前提到的不同特定活动值的差异可以归因于使用第4节中讨论的密度泛函理论(DFT)方法计算得到的活化能的比较。然而，在比较这些活化能(Ea)值时应谨慎行事，因为获取这些值的方法并不相同。此外，这些模拟基于理想化的表面模型，并不准确地复制真实的催化剂系统，因此结果可能不一定代表实际的反应速率。然而，理论和实验数据的结合非常有前景，并强调了对铂基和金属氧化物基脱氢催化剂反应动力学进行更全面研究的必要性。
