[1] "The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has also been studied, the catalysts being prepared either as hydrogels or as mixed oxides. Chen et al. investigated mixed oxides with different zinc to titanium ratios and found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 resulted in the most active catalyst. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was deemed to be the active species in dehydrogenation, although the overall activity of these catalysts was found to be limited."
[2] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[3] "In the case of platinum-based catalysts, any Pt0 atom located at the surface is believed to catalyze the reaction, while in CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts Cr3+ and Ga3+ must be coordinatively unsaturated to display catalytic activity."
[4] "For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the same differences of specific activities between the Pt and metal oxide catalysts are observed."
[5] "Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing."

1. Chen et al. found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 produced the most active catalyst for dehydrogenation. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was identified as the active species, but the overall activity of these catalysts was limited.
2. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the type of species that forms. Below 1.2 V/nm2, monomeric species dominate; between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species are predominant; and at higher loadings, crystalline V2O5 species are the majority.
3. Platinum-based catalysts activate through surface Pt0 atoms, whereas Cr3+ and Ga3+ species in CrOx and GaOx catalysts must be coordinatively unsaturated to exhibit catalytic activity.
4. The specific activities of Pt and metal oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation are similarly distinct.

[1] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly affect the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For BEA topologic zeolites, the high surface area contributes to better stabilization of Cr6+ sites, which in turn enhances propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, with their unique topology, offer improved stability and selectivity due to their tailored acidity and surface characteristics. These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalysts in achieving high propylene yields with reduced coke formation and better stability over time.

2. The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has been explored, with catalysts synthesized as hydrogels or mixed oxides. Chen et al. examined mixed oxides with varying zinc to titanium ratios, concluding that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 produced the most effective catalyst. While cubic Zn2TiO3 was identified as the active species in dehydrogenation, the overall catalytic performance of these catalysts was found to be constrained.

[1] "The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4."
[2] "However, care must be taken when comparing these Ea values, as the methods used for obtaining these are not identical."
[3] "Furthermore, these simulations assume model surfaces that do not resemble real catalyst systems, and therefore the results are not necessarily representative of the experimentally observed reaction rates."
[4] "Nevertheless, these combined theoretical and experimental data are very encouraging and highlight the need for more extensive studies on the reaction rate on Pt- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
3. The discrepancies in specific activity values previously mentioned can be attributed to the comparison of activation energies calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods, as outlined in section 4. However, caution should be exercised when comparing these energy of activation (Ea) values, considering that the methodologies for deriving these values are not uniform. Moreover, these simulations are based on idealized surface models that do not accurately replicate real catalyst systems, rendering the findings potentially non-representative of actual reaction kinetics. Nonetheless, the amalgamation of theoretical and experimental data is quite promising and underscores the necessity for more comprehensive investigations into the reaction dynamics on platinum- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

3. 之前提到的不同特定活动值的差异可以归因于使用第4节中讨论的密度泛函理论(DFT)方法计算得到的活化能的比较。然而，在比较这些活化能(Ea)值时应谨慎行事，因为获取这些值的方法并不相同。此外，这些模拟基于理想化的表面模型，并不准确地复制真实的催化剂系统，因此结果可能不一定代表实际的反应速率。然而，理论和实验数据的结合非常有前景，并强调了对铂基和金属氧化物基脱氢催化剂反应动力学进行更全面研究的必要性。

[1] "In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. (26) This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions."
[2] "As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions."
[3] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts with a strong reduction peak at low temperatures show the highest catalytic activity."
[4] "It is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."
[5] "Indeed, studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane have revealed that catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields follows the order CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2, a reverse order being found for the reduction temperature of the chromium species on the aforementioned catalyst supports."
[6] "Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant. The latter has been explained by assigning the occurrence of cracking and dehydrogenation reactions to strong and medium strength acid sites, respectively."

2. The structure of platinum particles plays a role in undesired side reactions during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation. Small particles are preferred, but the dispersion of these particles affects the rate of these reactions differently.

3. Catalysts with a strong reduction peak at low temperatures demonstrate the highest catalytic activity in ethane dehydrogenation.

4. It is feasible to achieve high activity and selectivity in chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by modifying the catalyst composition and operating conditions.

5. The order of catalytic activity for dehydrogenating ethane, based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields, is CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2. The reduction temperature of chromium species on these catalyst supports shows the reverse order.

6. The selectivity towards cracking of a particular material decreases with time-on-stream, while its selectivity towards the alkene remains constant.

4. 调整催化剂组成和操作条件是实现高活性和选择性铬基脱氢催化剂的关键。基于乙烷转化率和乙烯产率，脱氢活性顺序为CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2。这些催化剂支撑上铬物种的还原温度则呈现相反的顺序。

5. 在特定材料中，随着时间的推移，其裂解选择性逐渐下降，而其烯烃选择性保持不变。这一差异的选择性归因于将裂解和脱氢反应分别归因于强和中等强度酸位。

The active sites in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts are under debate. Some authors argue that β-Ga2O3, a polymorph of gallium oxide, is the most stable and active species in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure characterized by gallium atoms in tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. It possesses a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites, which are thought to be crucial for dehydrogenation activity. A heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism is proposed where hydrogen adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and a propane molecule on a neighboring oxygen site. The active species are substantiated by Lewis acid sites, especially coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations. Acidic groups, promoted by bases like potassium, can also catalyze the PDH reaction.

[5] "Furthermore, these species were found to be highly stable, which is important as volatile Zn species may be formed at dehydrogenation reaction conditions."

Zinc supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has garnered significant attention for converting light alkanes to aromatics. Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were identified as the active sites, with a reaction mechanism akin to that observed in GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. These species reside in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, effectively counter-charging two aluminum species. The proximity of aluminum species was found critical, as calculations indicate basic Al-bound oxygen is necessary for CH cleavage and forming an AlOH group. The stability of these species is crucial, as volatile Zn species might form under dehydrogenation reaction conditions.

轻烷烃在H-ZSM-5沸石上的锌支持下被广泛研究用于转化为芳香族化合物。孤立的Zn2+物种以四面体取向被认为是活性位点，其反应机制类似于GaOx基脱氢催化剂中报道的机制。这些物种驻留在沸石的阳离子交换位点中，有效地为两个铝物种提供相反的电荷。发现铝物种的邻近至关重要，因为计算表明基本的Al结合氧对于CH断裂并形成AlOH基团是必要的。这些物种的稳定性非常重要，因为在脱氢反应条件下可能会形成挥发性的Zn物种。

[1] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[2] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[3] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[4] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[5] "When these polyaromatic species are still relatively small, they can also migrate from the metal to the support (where they can undergo further oligomerization and condensation)."

Coke refers to a broad category of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reactions. The formation process of coke is complex and not well understood. Accumulation of coke obstructs the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking pores and active sites, leading to a decline in catalytic activity. Coke species can grow from aromatic rings through Diels-Alder addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones. When these polyaromatic species are still small, they can migrate from the metal to the support, undergoing further oligomerization and condensation.

焦炭是指在反应过程中倾向于在催化剂表面形成的高度石墨化的烃类分子的广义类别。焦炭的形成过程复杂且了解不足。焦炭积累通过阻塞孔隙和活性位点阻碍反应物向催化剂表面扩散，导致催化活性下降。焦炭物种可以从芳香环通过Diels-Alder添加、丙烯添加到自由基或更小区域融合成更大的区域生长。当这些多芳烃物种仍然较小，它们可以从金属迁移到支持物，在那里它们可以经历进一步的寡聚化和缩合。

[1] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[2] "For example, by adding CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[3] "As an additional effect, the loss of alumina surface area reduces the ability of the support to stabilize Cr6+ species formed during the regeneration step."
[4] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[5] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
