[1] "The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[2] "Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2."
[3] "An artists impression of a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Figure 20, while Table 4 offers an overview of the different CrOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, as discussed in the previous section."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly affect the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For BEA topologic zeolites, the high surface area contributes to better stabilization of Cr6+ sites, which in turn enhances propylene selectivity and conversion rates. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, with their unique topology, offer improved stability and selectivity due to their tailored acidity and surface characteristics. These factors collectively contribute to the overall efficiency of the catalysts in achieving high propylene yields with reduced coke formation and better stability over time.
