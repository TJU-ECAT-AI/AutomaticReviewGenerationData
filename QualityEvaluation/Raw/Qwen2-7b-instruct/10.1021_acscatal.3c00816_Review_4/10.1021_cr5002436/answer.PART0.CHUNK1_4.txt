[1] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[2] "Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."
[3] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations."
[4] "This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."
[5] "Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[6] "The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., (232) who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity."
[7] "In addition, Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."

The active sites in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts are under debate. Some authors argue that β-Ga2O3, a polymorph of gallium oxide, is the most stable and active species in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure characterized by gallium atoms in tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. It possesses a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites, which are thought to be crucial for dehydrogenation activity. A heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism is proposed where hydrogen adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and a propane molecule on a neighboring oxygen site. The active species are substantiated by Lewis acid sites, especially coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations. Acidic groups, promoted by bases like potassium, can also catalyze the PDH reaction.

在镓氧化物基脱氢催化剂中的活性位点存在争议。一些作者认为，β-Ga2O3是PDH中最具稳定性和活性的物种。β-Ga2O3具有单斜晶系结构，其中镓原子位于四面体和八面体配置中。它含有高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点，被认为是脱氢活性的关键。提出了一个异裂解反应机制，其中氢原子吸附到Ga+ Lewis酸位点上，并且一个丙烷分子吸附到相邻氧位点上。活性物种通过Lewis酸位点，特别是四面体Ga3+离子得到证实。酸性组分，通过钾等碱的促进作用，也可以催化PDH反应。

[1] "The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics on Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has received considerable attention."
[2] "Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were deemed to be the active sites, with a reaction mechanism similar to that reported on GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[3] "These species resided in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, effectively providing the counter-charge for two Al species."
[4] "The proximity of Al species was found to be important, as calculations show basic Al-bound oxygen is required to perform the CH cleavage and form an AlOH group."
[5] "Furthermore, these species were found to be highly stable, which is important as volatile Zn species may be formed at dehydrogenation reaction conditions."

Zinc supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has garnered significant attention for converting light alkanes to aromatics. Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were identified as the active sites, with a reaction mechanism akin to that observed in GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. These species reside in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, effectively counter-charging two aluminum species. The proximity of aluminum species was found critical, as calculations indicate basic Al-bound oxygen is necessary for CH cleavage and forming an AlOH group. The stability of these species is crucial, as volatile Zn species might form under dehydrogenation reaction conditions.

轻烷烃在H-ZSM-5沸石上的锌支持下被广泛研究用于转化为芳香族化合物。孤立的Zn2+物种以四面体取向被认为是活性位点，其反应机制类似于GaOx基脱氢催化剂中报道的机制。这些物种驻留在沸石的阳离子交换位点中，有效地为两个铝物种提供相反的电荷。发现铝物种的邻近至关重要，因为计算表明基本的Al结合氧对于CH断裂并形成AlOH基团是必要的。这些物种的稳定性非常重要，因为在脱氢反应条件下可能会形成挥发性的Zn物种。

[1] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[2] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[3] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[4] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[5] "When these polyaromatic species are still relatively small, they can also migrate from the metal to the support (where they can undergo further oligomerization and condensation)."

Coke refers to a broad category of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reactions. The formation process of coke is complex and not well understood. Accumulation of coke obstructs the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking pores and active sites, leading to a decline in catalytic activity. Coke species can grow from aromatic rings through Diels-Alder addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones. When these polyaromatic species are still small, they can migrate from the metal to the support, undergoing further oligomerization and condensation.

焦炭是指在反应过程中倾向于在催化剂表面形成的高度石墨化的烃类分子的广义类别。焦炭的形成过程复杂且了解不足。焦炭积累通过阻塞孔隙和活性位点阻碍反应物向催化剂表面扩散，导致催化活性下降。焦炭物种可以从芳香环通过Diels-Alder添加、丙烯添加到自由基或更小区域融合成更大的区域生长。当这些多芳烃物种仍然较小，它们可以从金属迁移到支持物，在那里它们可以经历进一步的寡聚化和缩合。
