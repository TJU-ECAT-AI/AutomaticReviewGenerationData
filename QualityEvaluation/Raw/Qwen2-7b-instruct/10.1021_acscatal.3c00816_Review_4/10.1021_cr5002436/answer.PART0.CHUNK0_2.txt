[1] "For some of the newly announced PDH installations (), the industrial process to be used remains to be announced."
[2] "An artists impression of a PtSn nanoparticle on alumina is shown as was discussed in the preceding section. The surface of the alumina is covered with SnO2, which gets reduced when in close proximity to Pt and incorporated into a bimetallic PtSn nanoparticle."
[3] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."
[4] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina."
[5] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."

1. The industrial process for some newly announced propane dehydrogenation (PDH) installations has not been specified yet.
2. An illustration of a platinum-tin (PtSn) nanoparticle on alumina is depicted, where tin oxide (SnO2) is reduced near the platinum and integrated into a bimetallic PtSn nanoparticle.
3. Zirconia-based catalysts exhibit higher activity in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation compared to silica or alumina-based catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
4. Zirconia-supported catalysts demonstrate superior activity in propane and isobutane dehydrogenation over silica or alumina-supported catalysts in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
5. Alumina is predominantly used as a support material, and numerous techniques have been explored for the production of chromium-alumina catalysts.
