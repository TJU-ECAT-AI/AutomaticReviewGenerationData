[1] "The use of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions has been extensively studied. These catalysts offer unique properties such as high selectivity, stability, and efficiency in propylene production."

[2] "Zeolite-based catalysts, particularly those with BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) structures, have been used in PDH reactions due to their ability to selectively convert propane to propylene."

[3] "Key factors influencing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions include the zeolite topology, the type of zeolite, and the zeolite composition. The BEA topology, for instance, is known for its large micropores which can help in the efficient conversion of propane."

[4] "The presence of metal promoters in zeolite-based catalysts can also enhance the conversion efficiency and selectivity towards propylene. These promoters help in stabilizing the zeolite structure, improving the dispersion of metal sites, and accelerating the reaction kinetics."

[5] "In terms of composition, the addition of specific metals such as sodium, potassium, or other promoters can significantly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity of zeolite-based catalysts. For example, sodium doping can lead to improved propylene selectivity, while potassium can decrease the activity."

[6] "The stability of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by factors such as the zeolite's thermal stability, resistance to coking, and ability to withstand repeated cycles of operation. Zeolites with higher stability can maintain their performance over extended periods."

[7] "In summary, the use of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by factors such as zeolite topology, composition, and the presence of metal promoters. These factors collectively contribute to the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene with high selectivity and stability."

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions often utilize zeolite-based catalysts, particularly those with BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) structures, due to their high selectivity, stability, and efficiency in propylene production. Key factors affecting the performance of these catalysts include the zeolite topology, composition, and the presence of metal promoters. The BEA topology facilitates efficient propane conversion thanks to its large micropores. The addition of specific metals, like sodium or potassium, can enhance conversion efficiency and selectivity towards propylene. Stability is influenced by factors such as thermal stability, resistance to coking, and the ability to withstand repeated cycles of operation. Overall, these factors collectively contribute to the catalyst's ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene with high selectivity and stability.
