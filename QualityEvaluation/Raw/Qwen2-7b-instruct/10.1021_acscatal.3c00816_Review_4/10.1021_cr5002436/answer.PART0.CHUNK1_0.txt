[1] "The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has also been studied, the catalysts being prepared either as hydrogels or as mixed oxides. Chen et al. investigated mixed oxides with different zinc to titanium ratios and found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 resulted in the most active catalyst. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was deemed to be the active species in dehydrogenation, although the overall activity of these catalysts was found to be limited."
[2] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[3] "In the case of platinum-based catalysts, any Pt0 atom located at the surface is believed to catalyze the reaction, while in CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts Cr3+ and Ga3+ must be coordinatively unsaturated to display catalytic activity."
[4] "For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the same differences of specific activities between the Pt and metal oxide catalysts are observed."
[5] "Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing."

1. Chen et al. found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 produced the most active catalyst for dehydrogenation. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was identified as the active species, but the overall activity of these catalysts was limited.
2. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the type of species that forms. Below 1.2 V/nm2, monomeric species dominate; between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species are predominant; and at higher loadings, crystalline V2O5 species are the majority.
3. Platinum-based catalysts activate through surface Pt0 atoms, whereas Cr3+ and Ga3+ species in CrOx and GaOx catalysts must be coordinatively unsaturated to exhibit catalytic activity.
4. The specific activities of Pt and metal oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation are similarly distinct.
5. UVvis spectroscopy enables the measurement of the relative amounts of active chromia and deactivated chromium in the catalyst, allowing for timely replacement when necessary.

1. Chen等人发现，Zn:Ti比例为2时产生了最活跃的催化剂用于脱氢。立方形Zn2TiO3被认定为活性物种，但这些催化剂的整体活性有限。
2. 表面积与金属负载比决定形成何种物种。在低于1.2 V/nm2时，主要形成单体物种；在1.2到4.4 V/nm2之间，多聚钒物种占主导；在更高负载下，主要形成结晶V2O5物种。
3. 在铂基催化剂中，表面Pt0原子催化反应，而在CrOx和GaOx催化剂中，Cr3+和Ga3+必须处于配位不饱和状态才能表现出催化活性。
4. Pt和金属氧化物催化剂对异丁烷脱氢的特定活性存在明显差异。
5. UVvis光谱技术能够测量催化剂中活性铬酸盐和不可逆失活的铬的比例，从而判断何时需要更换催化剂。
