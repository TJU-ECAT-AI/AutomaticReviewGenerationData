The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, particularly when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols. This configuration facilitates high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoOx species, which can easily be reduced to metallic Co particles, are crucial for the catalyst's activity. The presence of CoOx species in the T-sites of the SiBeta support contributes to the catalyst's superior performance. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts. The small confined Co particles serve as the active sites, showing great catalytic activity with high product selectivity and excellent reusability. This research provides a green, cost-effective, and highly active catalyst for PDH reactions, offering new insights into the active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH.
