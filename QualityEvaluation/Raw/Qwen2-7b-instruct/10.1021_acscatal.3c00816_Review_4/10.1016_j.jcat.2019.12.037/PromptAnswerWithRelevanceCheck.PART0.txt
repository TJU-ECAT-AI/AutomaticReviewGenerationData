The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite, particularly when modified with cobalt (Co), enables the creation of ultrasmall Co particles confined within the zeolite's silanols. This configuration facilitates high propane conversion and exceptional propylene selectivity. The CoOx species, which can easily be reduced to metallic Co particles, are crucial for the catalyst's activity. The presence of CoOx species in the T-sites of the SiBeta support contributes to the catalyst's superior performance. The CoSiBeta catalysts with 0.5 wt% Co exhibit state-of-the-art propylene productivity and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts. The small confined Co particles serve as the active sites, showing great catalytic activity with high product selectivity and excellent reusability. This research provides a green, cost-effective, and highly active catalyst for PDH reactions, offering new insights into the active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH.

<p>Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts.</p>

1. Various zeolite-based catalysts, especially those with BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, converting low-priced propane into valuable propylene. Cobalt (Co) catalysts, known for their abundance and catalytic potential, are highlighted as a promising alternative to conventional catalysts with issues like high cost, environmental impact, and rapid deactivation.

2. The specific active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH reactions remains unclear, despite some reports showing similar reactivity to gallium (Ga)-based catalysts. The structure of Co catalysts and their influence on PDH efficiency require further investigation.

3. The reduction behavior of Co species on SiBeta zeolite involves multiple stages: superficial CoOx reduction at about 280°C, followed by reduction of CoOx clusters in T-sites at 400-600°C, and finally, reduction of framework Co ions at temperatures above 600°C. This highlights the importance of the zeolite's topology in controlling the reduction process.

4. The presence of small metallic Co particles, formed by reducing confined CoOx species, is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The size of metallic Co particles appears to dictate the PDH reaction's target reactivity, with smaller particles enhancing propylene selectivity through mechanisms like boosting propylene desorption.
