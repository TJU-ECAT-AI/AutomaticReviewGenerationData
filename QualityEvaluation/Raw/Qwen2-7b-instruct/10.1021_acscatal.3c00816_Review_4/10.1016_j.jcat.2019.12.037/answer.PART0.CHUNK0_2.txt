<p>Dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts.</p>
<p>It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment.</p>
<p>The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown. The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11 , showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH.</p>

1. Dealuminated Beta zeolite with T-vacant sites and low acidity enhances its catalytic properties for various reactions. 
2. The 0.5 wt% cobalt catalyst on dealuminated Beta zeolite demonstrated outstanding performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving high propylene selectivity and conversion rates.
3. The cobalt species confined in the Beta zeolite can be reduced to metallic cobalt during the reaction, explaining the similar catalytic performance of cobalt catalysts with and without pre-reduction.
4. The intrinsic activity of the cobalt catalyst on dealuminated Beta zeolite for propane dehydrogenation was confirmed through testing at varying weight hour space velocities (WHSV).

1. 处理后的Beta沸石的T空位和低酸性可以提高其催化性能，适用于多种反应。
2. 在0.5wt%的钴负载下，使用处理后的Beta沸石作为载体，催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出优异性能，实现了高丙烯选择性和转化率。
3. 限制在Beta沸石中的钴物种可以在反应中被还原为金属钴，这是解释了未预还原和预还原钴催化剂性能相似的原因。
4. 通过在不同质量小时空间速度（WHSV）下的测试，确认了使用处理后的Beta沸石载体的钴催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的固有活性。
