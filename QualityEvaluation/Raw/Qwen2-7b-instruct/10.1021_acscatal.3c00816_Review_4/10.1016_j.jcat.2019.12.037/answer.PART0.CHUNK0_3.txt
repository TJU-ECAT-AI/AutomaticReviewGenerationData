<p>Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene.</p>
<p>The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] . Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5 [11] . However, the specific active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH is still unresolved.</p>
<p>In the H2 TPR profiles of Fig. 5 a, the catalysts have a weak reduction peak at about 280 C ascribed to the reduction of superficial CoOx on the SiBeta support [30] . The following peaks are ascribed to the reduction of CoO Co. A broad reduction peak in the range of 400600 C is related to the CoOx clusters located in the T-sites of the zeolite [31] ,[32] . The weak reduction peak above 600 C is related to the reduction of framework Co ions [33] .</p>
<p>It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment. Also, the PDH reaction over the metallic Co is likely a structure-sensitive reaction, the target reactivity of which seems to be determined by the metallic Co sizes: small metallic Co leads to high propylene selectivity, possibly by boosting propylene desorption.</p>

1. Various zeolite-based catalysts, especially those with BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, converting low-priced propane into valuable propylene. Cobalt (Co) catalysts, known for their abundance and catalytic potential, are highlighted as a promising alternative to conventional catalysts with issues like high cost, environmental impact, and rapid deactivation.

2. The specific active phase of cobalt catalysts in PDH reactions remains unclear, despite some reports showing similar reactivity to gallium (Ga)-based catalysts. The structure of Co catalysts and their influence on PDH efficiency require further investigation.

3. The reduction behavior of Co species on SiBeta zeolite involves multiple stages: superficial CoOx reduction at about 280°C, followed by reduction of CoOx clusters in T-sites at 400-600°C, and finally, reduction of framework Co ions at temperatures above 600°C. This highlights the importance of the zeolite's topology in controlling the reduction process.

4. The presence of small metallic Co particles, formed by reducing confined CoOx species, is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and conversion rates. The size of metallic Co particles appears to dictate the PDH reaction's target reactivity, with smaller particles enhancing propylene selectivity through mechanisms like boosting propylene desorption.

1. 各种沸石基催化剂，特别是具有BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的催化剂，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中起着关键作用，将价格低廉、丰富的丙烷转化为有价值的丙烯。报道显示，钴（Co）催化剂因其丰富性和催化潜力，作为替代传统催化剂的有前景选择，这些传统催化剂存在成本高、环境影响大和快速失活等问题。

2. 钴催化剂在PDH反应中的具体活性相仍然不清楚，尽管有些报告指出，它们的活性与镓（Ga）基催化剂相似。钴催化剂的结构及其对PDH效率的影响需要进一步研究。

3. SiBeta沸石上Co物种的还原行为涉及多个阶段：约280°C下浅表CoOx的还原，随后是400-600°C时位于T位点的CoOx簇的还原，最后是在600°C以上温度下框架Co离子的还原。这凸显了沸石结构在控制还原过程中的重要性。

4. 通过还原封闭的CoOx物种形成的微小金属Co颗粒对于实现高丙烯选择性和转化率至关重要。金属Co颗粒的大小似乎决定了PDH反应的目标反应性，更小的颗粒通过增强丙烯脱附等机制提高丙烯选择性。
