• "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."
• "CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction show similar catalytic performance."
• "The CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles."
• "The confined small metallic Co particles are catalytically active for PDH."
• "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."
• "This work not only affords a green and very promising nonprecious dehydrogenation catalyst but gives new insight into the active Co phase for the PDH reaction."

1. The preparation methods, including dealumination of AlBeta zeolite, impregnation with cobalt nitrate, and calcination in air, along with the use of the SiBeta zeolite topology, enable the creation of ultrasmall Co particles that are confined within the silanols of the zeolite. These particles are highly effective in catalyzing the PDH reaction to produce propylene efficiently.

2. The performance of CoSiBeta catalysts, whether or not they undergo pre-reduction, demonstrates similar catalytic abilities. This suggests that the presence of CoOx species confined within the silanols of SiBeta plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity.

3. The CoOx species that are confined within the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles. This reduction process leads to the formation of catalytically active Co particles for PDH reactions.

4. The use of Co in SiBeta zeolite at a 0.5 wt% concentration yields exceptional catalytic performance, achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, which surpasses other reported Co catalysts and matches industrial catalysts.

5. This research provides a sustainable and promising nonprecious catalyst for PDH reactions and offers new insights into the active Co phase involved in PDH processes.

1. 准备方法，包括将AlBeta沸石进行去铝化、钴硝酸盐浸渍和在空气中煅烧，以及使用SiBeta沸石拓扑结构，能够生成位于沸石硅烷醇内的超小Co颗粒。这些颗粒在催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯反应中表现出高效性。

2. CoSiBeta催化剂，无论是经过预还原还是未经预还原，其催化性能相似。这表明被封存在SiBeta沸石硅烷醇中的CoOx物种起着关键作用。

3. 被封存在SiBeta沸石硅烷醇中的CoOx物种可以在还原气氛下被还原成小型金属Co颗粒。这一还原过程导致了PDH反应中具有催化活性的Co颗粒的形成。

4. 在SiBeta沸石中以0.5 wt%浓度使用的Co，在600°C时实现了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，超过了其他报道的Co催化剂，并与工业催化剂相媲美。

5. 这项研究提供了一种可持续的、有前景的非贵金属脱氢催化剂，并为PDH过程中活跃的Co相提供了新的见解。
