<p>Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene.</p>
<p>Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] .</p>
<p>Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction [3] . Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH [5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] .</p>
<p>The earth abundance of Co bodes well for long-term utility, and it has been reported to show a certain degree of catalytic activity for PDH [9] ,[10] .</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments at 600 C for 1 h is very similar, in spite of the induction period, implying that confined CoOx can be reduced to metallic Co during the reaction.</p>
<p>To identify the active Co phases, the Reox10CoSiBeta catalyst was also prepared by exposing the Re10CoSiBeta catalyst to air overnight. The initial propane conversions of three catalysts are 22% for Re10CoSiBeta, 60% for Reox10CoSiBeta, and 85% for 10CoSiBeta.</p>
<p>Combined with activity test results, the large Co3O4 particles lead to serious side reactions responsible for the very low initial propylene selectivity of 10CoSiBeta.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment. The cobalt species are mainly present in the form of CoOx located at the T-sites of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst.</p>
<p>Considering that in situ dynamic transformation of cobalt species can occur under reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting materials, which is a probable reason for the similar catalytic performance of the 10CoSiBeta, Re10CoSiBeta, and Reox10CoSiBeta catalysts.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst exhibits superior reuse performance with the removal of coke by facile calcination.</p>
<p>The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment.</p>
<p>It was found that confined CoOx could be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the PDH reaction over the metallic Co is likely a structure-sensitive reaction, the target reactivity of which seems to be determined by the metallic Co sizes: small metallic Co leads to high propylene selectivity, possibly by boosting propylene desorption.</p>

1. Various zeolite-based catalysts, especially those with BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, play crucial roles in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. These catalysts offer high propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and stability, which are essential for industrial applications. They provide a more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternative to traditional CrOx and Pt catalysts.

2. The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions is significantly influenced by their preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. BEA topologic zeolites, in particular, are noted for their ability to improve propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

3. The presence of confined CoOx species in the SiBeta zeolite contributes to improved catalytic performance. These species can be reduced to metallic Co particles during the reaction, which is responsible for the similar catalytic performance of CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatment.

4. The PDH reaction over metallic Co is likely a structure-sensitive reaction. The size of metallic Co particles determines the reactivity and target selectivity, with smaller metallic Co particles leading to higher propylene selectivity.

5. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic activity and product selectivity for PDH reactions. It exhibits high propylene conversion and selectivity, matching that of commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts.

6. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows excellent reusability, as it can be easily regenerated by calcination to remove coke deposits without requiring additional reduction treatments.

7. The confined CoOx species in the SiBeta zeolite are the active sites responsible for the high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst.

8. The use of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst provides a promising, non-precious alternative for PDH reactions, offering a green and economically feasible solution.

9. The catalyst stability of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is demonstrated through repeated use, with minimal loss of activity after calcination for coke removal.

10. The study offers new insights into the active cobalt phase for PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of the CoOx species' confinement in zeolite pores for catalytic activity enhancement.
