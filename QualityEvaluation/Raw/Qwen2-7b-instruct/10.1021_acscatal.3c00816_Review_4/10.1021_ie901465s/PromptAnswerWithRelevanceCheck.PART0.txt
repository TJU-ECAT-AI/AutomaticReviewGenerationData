The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability involve the presence of tin (Sn) as a promoter, which modifies the electronic density of platinum (Pt) and retards coke formation. Physiochemical techniques such as X-ray fluorescence, BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis were employed to characterize the catalysts. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit enhances the catalytic performance, but beyond that point, it negatively impacts the reaction rate. The optimal operating conditions for achieving high propylene selectivity and conversion rates were found to be a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of 5.6 h⁻¹, a total operating time (TOS) of 15 hours, and a hydrogen-to-propane molar ratio (H₂/C₃H₈) of 0.25.

1. The performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation was enhanced through a detailed parametric characterization of the process operating conditions. The aim was to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The optimal conditions identified were a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h\(^{-1}\) or less, an H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%.

2. The addition of tin (Sn) to the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst system significantly influenced its performance. Up to a certain limit, Sn improved the catalytic performance, but beyond this point, it led to a decrease in reaction rate. Sn modified the surface Pt ensembles, aiding in the dispersion of Pt by altering the interfacial character between the metal and support. Additionally, Sn enabled the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support.

3. The inclusion of Sn in the catalyst system adversely affected its performance when the Sn content exceeded 1 wt%. However, using [Pt(0.5 wt %) Sn(1 wt %)]/SAPO-34 resulted in higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefin selectivity (97.2%).

4. The physiochemical techniques employed for the characterization of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts included X-ray fluorescence, BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, temperature-programmed reduction of H2, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis. These methods provided insights into the catalyst's structure, surface area, acidity, reduction properties, and coke formation, contributing to the understanding of the catalyst's behavior during the dehydrogenation process.

1. 为了提高PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能，进行了参数化的表征，以整合工艺操作条件。目标是实现更高的丙烯选择性。确定的最佳条件为585°C的温度、5.6 h\(^{-1}\)或更低的重量小时空速、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25以及14%-25%的转化率范围。

2. 锡（Sn）添加到PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂系统中显著影响其性能。在一定范围内，Sn提高了催化性能，但超过这一点后，导致反应速率下降。Sn修改了表面Pt簇集，通过改变金属和支持之间的界面特性帮助Pt分散。此外，Sn使碳沉积从金属位点转移到支持成为可能。

3. 当Sn含量超过1 wt%时，催化剂的性能会受到负面影响。然而，使用[Pt(0.5 wt %) Sn(1 wt %)]/SAPO-34获得了94%的高丙烯选择性和97.2%的总烯烃选择性。

4. 用于PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂表征的物理化学技术包括X射线荧光、布兰克埃米特塔勒表面积测量、X射线衍射、氨温度程序脱附、氢气温度程序还原、红外光谱、氧化温度程序和氧气脉冲焦炭分析。这些方法提供了有关催化剂结构、表面积、酸性、还原性质和焦炭形成的信息，有助于理解催化剂在脱氢过程中的行为。

1. The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the use of a BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene production. The specific arrangement of atoms within these zeolites provides a unique microenvironment that facilitates the dehydrogenation process efficiently.

2. The presence of tin (Sn) as a promoter in PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts plays a crucial role in improving the catalytic performance. Sn modifies the surface Pt ensembles, leading to better dispersion of Pt across the support. This modification allows for more effective contact between the metal and support, enhancing the catalytic activity.

3. Physiochemical techniques such as X-ray fluorescence, surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, and temperature-programmed analyses are employed to characterize the catalysts. These methods provide insights into the structure, composition, and reactivity of the catalysts, aiding in understanding their behavior in PDH reactions.

4. Tin addition to the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts initially increases propylene selectivity up to a certain limit (1 wt %). Beyond this point, the reaction rate diminishes due to the formation of Sn0 species, which negatively impacts the catalyst's performance.

5. The interfacial character between the metal and support is altered by Sn loading, facilitating the dispersion of Pt and improving its activity in the PDH process. This dispersion ensures that the Pt sites are well exposed, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

6. Sn promotes the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, thereby reducing the formation of coke and improving the catalyst's stability. This transfer mechanism ensures a more efficient use of the active sites and prolongs the catalyst's life.

7. The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts exhibit better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene compared to other catalysts, leading to improved selectivity and conversion rates.

8. The optimal operating parameters for maximizing propylene production are identified as a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of 5.6 h⁻¹, a time on stream (TOS) of 15 hours, and an H₂/C₃H₈ molar ratio of 0.25. These conditions yield the best conversion rate around 23%, with a high propylene selectivity of 94 wt %.

1. 准晶和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛的制备方法、组成和拓扑结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的催化剂性能有显著影响。例如，使用BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛能够提高催化剂的活性和丙烯选择性。这些分子筛的独特微环境能够高效地促进脱氢过程。

2. 铅锡合金/SAPO-34催化剂中锡（Sn）的存在在提高催化性能方面起着关键作用。Sn修改了表面铅集合体，有助于在支持物上更均匀地分散铅。这种修改允许金属和支持物之间形成更好的接触，从而增强催化活性。

3. 物理化学技术，如X射线荧光、表面积测量、X射线衍射和温度程序分析，被用来表征催化剂。这些方法提供了关于催化剂结构、成分和反应性的信息，帮助理解它们在PDH反应中的行为。

4. Sn添加到PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂中，在一定量（1 wt %）内逐渐增加丙烯选择性。超过这个点，反应速率会因形成Sn0物种而下降，这对催化剂性能产生负面影响。

5. Sn加载改变了金属和支撑之间的界面特性，促进了Pt的分散，提高了其在PDH过程中的活性。这种分散确保了Pt位点的充分暴露，从而提高了催化效率。

6. Sn促进了碳沉积从金属位点转移到支撑，从而减少了焦炭的形成并提高了催化剂的稳定性。这种转移机制确保了活性位点的更有效利用，并延长了催化剂的寿命。

7. PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷和丁烷脱氢到丙烯过程中显示出更好的立体化学控制，导致更高的选择性和转化率。

8. 最佳的操作参数以实现丙烯的最大生产是：温度为585°C，重量小时空速（WHSV）为5.6 h⁻¹，运行时间（TOS）为15小时，以及H₂/C₃H₈摩尔比为0.25。这些条件在约23%的转化率下，可获得高丙烯选择性，为94 wt %。
