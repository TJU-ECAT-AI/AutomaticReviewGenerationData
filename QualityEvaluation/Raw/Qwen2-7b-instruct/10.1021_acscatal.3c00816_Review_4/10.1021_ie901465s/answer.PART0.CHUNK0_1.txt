1. The performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation was enhanced through a detailed parametric characterization of the process operating conditions. The aim was to achieve higher propylene selectivity. The optimal conditions identified were a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h\(^{-1}\) or less, an H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%.

2. The addition of tin (Sn) to the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst system significantly influenced its performance. Up to a certain limit, Sn improved the catalytic performance, but beyond this point, it led to a decrease in reaction rate. Sn modified the surface Pt ensembles, aiding in the dispersion of Pt by altering the interfacial character between the metal and support. Additionally, Sn enabled the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support.

3. The inclusion of Sn in the catalyst system adversely affected its performance when the Sn content exceeded 1 wt%. However, using [Pt(0.5 wt %) Sn(1 wt %)]/SAPO-34 resulted in higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefin selectivity (97.2%).

4. The physiochemical techniques employed for the characterization of the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts included X-ray fluorescence, BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, temperature-programmed reduction of H2, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis. These methods provided insights into the catalyst's structure, surface area, acidity, reduction properties, and coke formation, contributing to the understanding of the catalyst's behavior during the dehydrogenation process.

1. 为了提高PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能，进行了参数化的表征，以整合工艺操作条件。目标是实现更高的丙烯选择性。确定的最佳条件为585°C的温度、5.6 h\(^{-1}\)或更低的重量小时空速、H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25以及14%-25%的转化率范围。

2. 锡（Sn）添加到PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂系统中显著影响其性能。在一定范围内，Sn提高了催化性能，但超过这一点后，导致反应速率下降。Sn修改了表面Pt簇集，通过改变金属和支持之间的界面特性帮助Pt分散。此外，Sn使碳沉积从金属位点转移到支持成为可能。

3. 当Sn含量超过1 wt%时，催化剂的性能会受到负面影响。然而，使用[Pt(0.5 wt %) Sn(1 wt %)]/SAPO-34获得了94%的高丙烯选择性和97.2%的总烯烃选择性。

4. 用于PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂表征的物理化学技术包括X射线荧光、布兰克埃米特塔勒表面积测量、X射线衍射、氨温度程序脱附、氢气温度程序还原、红外光谱、氧化温度程序和氧气脉冲焦炭分析。这些方法提供了有关催化剂结构、表面积、酸性、还原性质和焦炭形成的信息，有助于理解催化剂在脱氢过程中的行为。
