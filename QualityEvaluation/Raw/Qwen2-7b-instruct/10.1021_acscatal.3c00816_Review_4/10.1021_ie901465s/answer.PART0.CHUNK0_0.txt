[1] "The objective was to achieve higher propylene selectivity; therefore, the reaction was parametrically characterized to obtain necessary information to integrate the process operating conditions."
[2] "The catalyst was characterized by a number of physiochemical techniques: X-ray fluorescence, BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, temperature-programmed reduction of H2, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis."
[3] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
[4] "In general, it is noted that the increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
[5] "Higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefin selectivity (97.2%) were obtained using [Pt(0.5 wt %) Sn(1 wt %)]/SAPO-34."
[6] "The optimum operating parameters to produce propylene selectively from propane dehydrogenation are as follows: temperature 585 C, WHSV 5.6 h1, TOS 15 h, and H2/C3H8 ratio 0.25."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability involve the presence of tin (Sn) as a promoter, which modifies the electronic density of platinum (Pt) and retards coke formation. Physiochemical techniques such as X-ray fluorescence, BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis were employed to characterize the catalysts. The presence of Sn up to a certain limit enhances the catalytic performance, but beyond that point, it negatively impacts the reaction rate. The optimal operating conditions for achieving high propylene selectivity and conversion rates were found to be a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity (WHSV) of 5.6 h⁻¹, a total operating time (TOS) of 15 hours, and a hydrogen-to-propane molar ratio (H₂/C₃H₈) of 0.25.

在丙烷脱氢反应中，不同沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和拓扑结构对催化剂性能有显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括锡（Sn）作为促进剂的存在，它修改了铂（Pt）的电子密度并抑制了焦炭形成。采用X射线荧光、布郎阿米特泰勒比表面积测量、X射线衍射、氨温度程序脱附、氢气温度程序还原、红外光谱、氧化温度程序、氧气脉冲焦炭分析等物理化学技术来表征催化剂。Sn的存在在一定范围内增强催化性能，但超过这一点会负面影响反应速率。实现高丙烯选择性和转化率的最佳操作条件为：温度585°C、质量小时空间速度（WHSV）5.6 h⁻¹、总运行时间（TOS）15小时、氢气与丙烷摩尔比（H₂/C₃H₈）0.25。
