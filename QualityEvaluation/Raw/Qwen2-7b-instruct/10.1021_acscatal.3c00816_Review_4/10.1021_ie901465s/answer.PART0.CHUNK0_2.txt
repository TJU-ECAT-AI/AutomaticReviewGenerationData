[1] "The objective was to achieve higher propylene selectivity; therefore, the reaction was parametrically characterized to obtain necessary information to integrate the process operating conditions."
[2] "The optimum operating conditions were found to be temperature 585 C, weight hour space velocity 5.6 h1 or lower, H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25, and conversion range 1425%."
[3] "The catalyst was characterized by a number of physiochemical techniques: X-ray fluorescence, BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, temperature-programmed reduction of H2, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis."
[4] "The catalytic performance was largely improved with the presence of Sn up to a certain limit; after that, it caused diminution in the reaction rate."
[5] "The Sn loading modifies surface Pt ensembles; those helped Pt to be well dispersed by changing the interfacial character between the metal and support."
[6] "Moreover, Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposit from the metal sites to the support."
[7] "In general, it is noted that the increase in Sn content from 1 wt % affects catalyst performance adversely."
[8] "Higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefin selectivity (97.2%) were obtained using [Pt(0.5 wt %) Sn(1 wt %)]/SAPO-34."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the presence of tin (Sn) as a promoter modifies the electronic density of platinum (Pt), enhancing dispersion and improving stability. Physiochemical techniques such as X-ray fluorescence, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen, infrared spectra, temperature-programmed oxidation, and O2-pulse coke analysis were used to characterize the catalysts. These methods revealed that the addition of Sn up to a certain limit improves the catalytic performance, especially propylene selectivity. Optimal operating conditions for achieving higher propylene selectivity include a temperature of 585°C, a weight hour space velocity of 5.6 h\(^{-1}\) or less, an H2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.25, and a conversion range of 14-25%. The Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from the metal sites to the support, thereby improving catalyst stability. The best conversion range for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene is approximately 23%, where the propylene selectivity reaches 94%.

准备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构在丙烷脱氢反应中对各种沸石基催化剂的性能有显著影响。特别是，锡（Sn）作为促进剂修改了铂（Pt）的电子密度，提高了分散性和稳定性。使用X射线荧光、布郎阿-埃米特-泰勒表面积测量、X射线衍射、氨温度程序脱附、氢温度程序还原、红外光谱、氧化温度程序、氧气脉冲焦炭分析等物理化学技术来表征催化剂。这些方法表明，在一定的限制下添加Sn可以改善催化性能，尤其是丙烯选择性。实现更高丙烯选择性的最优操作条件包括温度为585°C，重量小时空速为5.6 h\(^{-1}\)或更小，H2/C3H8摩尔比为0.25，以及转化率范围为14-25%。Sn有助于将碳沉积物从金属位点转移到支撑体，从而提高催化剂稳定性。直接丙烷脱氢到丙烯的最佳转化率约为23%，此时丙烯选择性达到94%。
