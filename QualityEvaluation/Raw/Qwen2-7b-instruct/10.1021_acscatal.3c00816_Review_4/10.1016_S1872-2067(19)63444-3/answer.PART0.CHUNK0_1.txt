[1] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [32], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."
[2] "With the V loading less than 7 wt%, the isolated VOx with a monolayer coverage on the support is theoretically possible, due to the theoretical value of 2.5 V nm2 for a monolayer of isolated VOx [35, 36, 37]."
[3] "As for the 0.5VSiBeta and 1VSiBeta catalysts, the high propylene selectivity is due to the very low propane conversion."
[4] "The catalytic performance of the 3VSiBeta catalyst was completely restored after several regeneration cycles, presenting its great reusability."
[5] "The correlation between the catalytic performance and acidic sites amount are depicted in Fig. 9."
[6] "The increase of V content leads to less accessibility of active sites to the reactants, so the activity per V decreases."

1. 装载V的SiBeta系统被提议在PDH反应中具有很大的潜力，考虑到VOx物种在OPDH中的催化活性。
2. 当V负载小于7 wt%时，理论上可能在支撑物上形成一层单分子层的孤立VOx。
3. 0.5VSiBeta和1VSiBeta催化剂的高丙烯选择性是由于丙烷转化率非常低。
4. 3VSiBeta催化剂在多次再生循环后表现出完全恢复的性能，显示出其高度可重复性。
5. 催化性能与酸性位点数量之间的相关性在图9中描绘。
6. V含量的增加导致活性位点对反应物的可接近性降低，从而降低了每V的活性。
