[1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil."
[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning low-value propane into value-added propylene."
[3] "Supported VOx catalysts have been intensively employed in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH)..."
[4] "We first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."
[5] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."
[6] "Meanwhile, the catalytic performance of the 3VSiBeta catalyst was completely restored after several regeneration cycles, presenting its great reusability."
[7] "The polymerization degree of VOx species increases as increasing the V loading amount."
[8] "The catalytic activity of VOx catalyst is determined by the amounts of acidic sites, which are related to the VOSi bridges and very stable, and achieves its maximum value as entirely monomeric VOx are existent on SiBeta support."
[9] "Moreover, the original valance state of V has a negligible impact on the catalytic performance."
[10] "It is also confirmed that both of propylene selectivity and the deactivation rate caused by coke deposition increase with the increasing polymerization degree of VOx species."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions through multiple factors. Specifically, the following points highlight how these elements contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability:

1. **Propane Conversion Rates**: The 3VSiBeta catalyst, containing monomeric VOx species in monolayer, shows high conversion rates, comparable to those of catalysts with higher V loadings. This indicates that the presence of isolated VOx species enhances the conversion of propane.

2. **Propylene Selectivity**: Increasing the V loading amount leads to a rise in propylene selectivity, suggesting that the aggregation degree of VOx species plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity towards propylene.

3. **Catalyst Stability**: The 3VSiBeta catalyst demonstrates excellent reusability after multiple regeneration cycles, showcasing the stability of the catalyst under repeated use.

4. **Dependence on Acidic Sites**: The catalytic activity is significantly influenced by the creation of acidic sites, which are linked to the VOSi bridges. These sites are highly stable and achieve their maximum efficiency when monomeric VOx species are present on the SiBeta support.

5. **Valence State of Vanadium**: The initial valence state of vanadium has a negligible impact on the catalytic performance, highlighting the importance of the interaction sites between the VOx species and the SiBeta support.

6. **Polymerization Degree of VOx Species**: An increase in the polymerization degree of VOx species results in higher deactivation rates due to coke deposition and affects propylene selectivity negatively.

In summary, the preparation methods, including the type of zeolite and vanadium loading, influence the nature of the active phase of VOx catalysts in PDH reactions. Factors such as the presence of monomeric VOx species, the stability of acidic sites, and the interaction between VOx species and the support surface determine the performance parameters, including propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst stability.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构通过多个因素影响其性能。具体而言，以下几点强调了这些元素如何促进丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的改善：

1. **丙烷转化率**：3VSiBeta 催化剂含有单层孤立的VOx物种，显示出与更高V负载催化剂相当的高转化率。这表明孤立的VOx物种的存在可以增强丙烷的转化。

2. **丙烯选择性**：增加V负载量导致丙烯选择性上升，这表明VOx物种的聚合度对丙烯选择性有决定性作用。

3. **催化剂稳定性**：3VSiBeta 催化剂在多次再生周期后仍表现出良好的可重复使用性，展示了催化剂在反复使用过程中的稳定性。

4. **酸性位点依赖性**：催化活性显著受创酸位点的影响，这些位点与VOSi桥接有关。当单个VOx物种存在于SiBeta支持上时，这些位点达到最大效率。

5. **钒的初始价态**：钒的初始价态对催化性能的影响较小，突出了VOx物种与SiBeta支持表面相互作用的重要性。

6. **VOx物种的聚合度**：VOx物种的聚合度的增加导致焦炭沉积导致的失活率升高，并且对丙烯选择性产生负面影响。

总之，包括沸石类型和钒负载在内的制备方法影响VOx催化剂在PDH反应中的活性相。因素如单个VOx物种的存在、酸性位点的稳定性以及VOx物种与支持表面之间的相互作用决定了性能参数，包括丙烷转化、丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。
