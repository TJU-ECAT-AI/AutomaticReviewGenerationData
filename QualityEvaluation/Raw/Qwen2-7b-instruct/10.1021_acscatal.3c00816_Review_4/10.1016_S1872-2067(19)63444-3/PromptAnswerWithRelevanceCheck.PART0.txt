[1] "Supported VOx catalysts have been intensively employed in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH) [12,13,14], while they have received relatively less attention in oxygenfree PDH reaction."
[2] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [32], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."
[3] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."
[4] "With a V loading higher than 3 wt%, the propane conversion almost levels up. Thus, the non-polymerized VOx species contacting to SiBeta are responsible for enhanced reactivity."
[5] "The deactivation rate increases with the increase of V loading amount. The mononuclear VOx prevailing on the surface of 0.5/1VSiBeta catalysts possess strong carbon deposition resistance, and thus, exhibiting little deactivation rate."
[6] "The catalytic activity of VSiBeta catalyst is exclusively influenced by the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, and seems not be associated with the initial valance of V because the V5+ can be reduced by hydrocarbons during reaction [15]."
[7] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species has effects on the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."

1. Supported VOx catalysts are extensively used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH), but receive lesser attention in oxygen-free PDH reactions. However, considering the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH, the V-loaded SiBeta system shows great promise for PDH reactions.

2. Catalysts with vanadium loadings of 3, 7, and 10 wt% on SiBeta support (referred to as 3VSiBeta, 7VSiBeta, and 10VSiBeta) demonstrate ideal catalytic performance, achieving approximately 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. When the vanadium loading surpasses 3 wt%, the propane conversion tends to stabilize, implying that non-polymerized VOx species interacting with SiBeta support contribute to enhanced reactivity.

4. As the vanadium loading increases, the deactivation rate of the catalyst escalates. Catalysts with predominantly mononuclear VOx species on the surface, such as 0.5VSiBeta and 1VSiBeta, exhibit low deactivation rates due to their strong resistance against carbon deposition.

5. The catalytic activity of VSiBeta catalysts solely relies on the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, rather than the initial valence state of vanadium. This is because vanadium pentavalent species can be reduced by hydrocarbons during the reaction.

6. The aggregation level of VOx species impacts both propylene selectivity and deactivation rate. As the vanadium loading increases, these parameters also increase, suggesting a complex interplay between catalyst composition and PDH reaction efficiency.

7. The catalytic performance of VSiBeta catalysts is uniquely determined by the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, and is not influenced by the initial valence state of vanadium, which can be reduced by hydrocarbons during the reaction process.

1.Vox催化剂在氧化脱氢制丙烯（OPDH）中得到了广泛的应用，但在无氧PDH反应中受到较少的关注。然而，考虑到Vox物种在OPDH中的催化活性，V负载的SiBeta系统在PDH反应中表现出巨大的潜力。

2. 在SiBeta支持下具有3、7和10 wt%钒负载（称为3VSiBeta、7VSiBeta和10VSiBeta）的催化剂显示出理想的催化性能，实现了约40%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。

3. 当钒负载超过3 wt%时，丙烷转化率趋于稳定，表明与SiBeta相互作用的非聚合Vox物种有助于提高活性。

4. 随着钒负载的增加，催化剂的失活速率上升。表面主要含有单核Vox物种的催化剂，如0.5VSiBeta和1VSiBeta，由于其对碳沉积的强抵抗力，表现出低失活率。

5. VSiBeta催化剂的催化活性仅依赖于Vox物种与SiBeta支持之间的相互作用位点，而不是钒的初始价态。这是因为五价钒物种可以在反应过程中被烃类还原。

6. Vox物种的聚合水平影响丙烯选择性和失活速率。随着钒负载的增加，这些参数也增加，表明催化剂组成与PDH反应效率之间存在复杂的相互作用。

7. VSiBeta催化剂的催化性能独特地取决于Vox物种与SiBeta支持之间的相互作用位点，并且不受钒的初始价态的影响，后者可以在反应过程中被烃类还原。

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions through multiple factors. Specifically, the following points highlight how these elements contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability:

1. **Propane Conversion Rates**: The 3VSiBeta catalyst, containing monomeric VOx species in monolayer, shows high conversion rates, comparable to those of catalysts with higher V loadings. This indicates that the presence of isolated VOx species enhances the conversion of propane.

2. **Propylene Selectivity**: Increasing the V loading amount leads to a rise in propylene selectivity, suggesting that the aggregation degree of VOx species plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity towards propylene.

3. **Catalyst Stability**: The 3VSiBeta catalyst demonstrates excellent reusability after multiple regeneration cycles, showcasing the stability of the catalyst under repeated use.

4. **Dependence on Acidic Sites**: The catalytic activity is significantly influenced by the creation of acidic sites, which are linked to the VOSi bridges. These sites are highly stable and achieve their maximum efficiency when monomeric VOx species are present on the SiBeta support.

5. **Valence State of Vanadium**: The initial valence state of vanadium has a negligible impact on the catalytic performance, highlighting the importance of the interaction sites between the VOx species and the SiBeta support.

6. **Polymerization Degree of VOx Species**: An increase in the polymerization degree of VOx species results in higher deactivation rates due to coke deposition and affects propylene selectivity negatively.

In summary, the preparation methods, including the type of zeolite and vanadium loading, influence the nature of the active phase of VOx catalysts in PDH reactions. Factors such as the presence of monomeric VOx species, the stability of acidic sites, and the interaction between VOx species and the support surface determine the performance parameters, including propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst stability.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构通过多个因素影响其性能。具体而言，以下几点强调了这些元素如何促进丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的改善：

1. **丙烷转化率**：3VSiBeta 催化剂含有单层孤立的VOx物种，显示出与更高V负载催化剂相当的高转化率。这表明孤立的VOx物种的存在可以增强丙烷的转化。

2. **丙烯选择性**：增加V负载量导致丙烯选择性上升，这表明VOx物种的聚合度对丙烯选择性有决定性作用。

3. **催化剂稳定性**：3VSiBeta 催化剂在多次再生周期后仍表现出良好的可重复使用性，展示了催化剂在反复使用过程中的稳定性。

4. **酸性位点依赖性**：催化活性显著受创酸位点的影响，这些位点与VOSi桥接有关。当单个VOx物种存在于SiBeta支持上时，这些位点达到最大效率。

5. **钒的初始价态**：钒的初始价态对催化性能的影响较小，突出了VOx物种与SiBeta支持表面相互作用的重要性。

6. **VOx物种的聚合度**：VOx物种的聚合度的增加导致焦炭沉积导致的失活率升高，并且对丙烯选择性产生负面影响。

总之，包括沸石类型和钒负载在内的制备方法影响VOx催化剂在PDH反应中的活性相。因素如单个VOx物种的存在、酸性位点的稳定性以及VOx物种与支持表面之间的相互作用决定了性能参数，包括丙烷转化、丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the varying vanadium (V) loadings affect the types of vanadium oxide (VOx) species present on the SiBeta support. At lower V loadings, monomeric or isolated VOx species are predominant, while at higher loadings, polynuclear VOx species with different polymerization degrees emerge. The 3VSiBeta catalyst, featuring isolated VOx species in monolayer, demonstrates comparable performance to catalysts with higher V loadings, achieving 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity under optimized conditions. The catalytic activity correlates positively with the amount of acidic sites generated through interactions between VOx species and the SiBeta support, maintaining stability across multiple regeneration cycles. Importantly, the initial valence state of V does not dictate the catalytic performance. Instead, the aggregation degree of VOx species plays a crucial role in determining propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, which increase with rising V loading amounts. This insight suggests that the V-loaded SiBeta system holds significant promise for PDH reactions.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能产生了显著影响。具体而言，不同的钒（V）负载量影响了SiBeta支持上的VOx物种的类型。在较低的V负载下，主要存在单体或孤立的VOx物种，而在较高负载下，则出现了不同聚合度的聚核VOx物种。具有单层孤立VOx物种的3VSiBeta催化剂，在优化条件下实现了与更高V负载催化剂相当的性能，包括40%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。催化活性与通过VOx物种与SiBeta支持相互作用产生的酸性位点的数量成正比，并且在多次再生循环后保持稳定。重要的是，V的初始价态并不决定催化性能。相反，VOx物种的聚集程度决定了丙烯选择性和失活速率，这两种速率均随着V负载量的增加而增加。这一见解表明，V负载SiBeta系统在PDH反应中具有巨大的潜力。
