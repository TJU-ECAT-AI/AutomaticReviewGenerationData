[1] "Given the above, there is not a definite conclusion about the kind of active vanadium species for PDH, in terms of polymerization degree, acidity and oxidation state, because the surface chemistry of VOx species is deeply affected by support characteristics."
[2] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."
[3] "It is reported that SiBeta support can effectively disperse and stabilize the introduced VOx species due to the existence of vacant T-sites after removing lattice Al atoms."
[4] "With the increase of V surface density, the polymerization degree of VOx increases, and a part of highly-polymerized VOx species and even V2O5 crystallite are existent in the 10VSiBeta catalyst."
[5] "The initial propane conversion of VSiBeta catalyst shows a linear increase with the amount of acidic sites."
[6] "The correlation between the V loading amount and the catalytic activity is plotted in Fig. 10(a)."
[7] "Clearly, the deactivation rate increases with the increase of V loading amount."
[8] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species has effects on the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."

1. The type of active vanadium species in PDH reactions is not definitively known due to the influence of support characteristics on the surface chemistry of VOx species. Factors like polymerization degree, acidity, and oxidation state are interconnected and depend on the specific conditions of the catalyst.
2. The 3VSiBeta catalyst, which contains monomeric VOx species, demonstrated comparable catalytic activity to catalysts with much higher vanadium loadings, achieving 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.
3. The SiBeta zeolite is capable of dispersing and stabilizing vanadium species by providing vacant T-sites after the removal of lattice aluminum atoms.
4. As the surface density of vanadium increases, the polymerization degree of VOx species also increases. In the 10VSiBeta catalyst, both highly-polymerized VOx species and traces of V2O5 crystallites are present.
5. The catalytic performance of VSiBeta catalysts in PDH reactions is closely related to the amount of acidic sites, which are created by the interaction between vanadium species and the support.
6. The relationship between the vanadium loading and catalytic activity is depicted graphically, showing how activity varies with the amount of vanadium loaded.
7. The deactivation rate of VSiBeta catalysts increases with the vanadium loading amount, primarily due to coke deposition.
8. Both propylene selectivity and the deactivation rate caused by coke deposition are influenced by the aggregation degree of VOx species, increasing as the vanadium loading is raised.

1. 对于PDH反应中的活性钒物种类型，由于支持特性对VOx物种表面化学的影响，尚未得出明确结论。聚合度、酸性、氧化状态等因素相互关联且依赖于催化剂的具体条件。
2. 含有孤立VOx物种的3VSiBeta催化剂展示了与负载量更高的钒催化剂相当的催化活性，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。
3. SiBeta沸石能够通过提供去除晶格铝原子后存在的T位点来分散并稳定钒物种。
4. 随着范德华表面密度的增加，VOx物种的聚合度也增加。在10VSiBeta催化剂中，存在高度聚合的VOx物种以及少量的V2O5结晶体。
5. VSiBeta催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能与酸性位点的数量密切相关，这些酸性位点由范德华物种与支撑物之间的相互作用产生。
6. 图表描绘了范德华负载量与催化活性之间的关系，显示了活性随负载量的变化情况。
7. VSiBeta催化剂的失活速率随着范德华负载量的增加而增加，主要由于焦炭沉积。
8. 丙烯选择性和由于焦炭沉积引起的失活速率都受VOx物种聚合度的影响，随着范德华负载量的提高而增加。
