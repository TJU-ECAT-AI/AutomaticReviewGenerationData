[1] "The VOC catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."
[2] "It is characterized that the VSiBeta catalysts possess different kinds of vanadium species on the SiBeta support, including monomeric or isolated VOx species at a low V loading, and polynuclear VOx species in different polymerization degrees at higher V loadings."
[3] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."
[4] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."
[5] "While, the initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance."
[6] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."
[7] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [32], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of various zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the varying vanadium (V) loadings affect the types of vanadium oxide (VOx) species present on the SiBeta support. At lower V loadings, monomeric or isolated VOx species are predominant, while at higher loadings, polynuclear VOx species with different polymerization degrees emerge. The 3VSiBeta catalyst, featuring isolated VOx species in monolayer, demonstrates comparable performance to catalysts with higher V loadings, achieving 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity under optimized conditions. The catalytic activity correlates positively with the amount of acidic sites generated through interactions between VOx species and the SiBeta support, maintaining stability across multiple regeneration cycles. Importantly, the initial valence state of V does not dictate the catalytic performance. Instead, the aggregation degree of VOx species plays a crucial role in determining propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, which increase with rising V loading amounts. This insight suggests that the V-loaded SiBeta system holds significant promise for PDH reactions.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对各种沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能产生了显著影响。具体而言，不同的钒（V）负载量影响了SiBeta支持上的VOx物种的类型。在较低的V负载下，主要存在单体或孤立的VOx物种，而在较高负载下，则出现了不同聚合度的聚核VOx物种。具有单层孤立VOx物种的3VSiBeta催化剂，在优化条件下实现了与更高V负载催化剂相当的性能，包括40%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。催化活性与通过VOx物种与SiBeta支持相互作用产生的酸性位点的数量成正比，并且在多次再生循环后保持稳定。重要的是，V的初始价态并不决定催化性能。相反，VOx物种的聚集程度决定了丙烯选择性和失活速率，这两种速率均随着V负载量的增加而增加。这一见解表明，V负载SiBeta系统在PDH反应中具有巨大的潜力。
