[1] "Supported VOx catalysts have been intensively employed in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH) [12,13,14], while they have received relatively less attention in oxygenfree PDH reaction."
[2] "Considering of the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH [32], we first propose that the V-loaded SiBeta system may be of great promising to be employed in PDH reaction."
[3] "The ideal catalytic performances were simultaneously realized on the 3/7/10VSiBeta catalysts, about 40% of propane conversion and 90% of propylene selectivity."
[4] "With a V loading higher than 3 wt%, the propane conversion almost levels up. Thus, the non-polymerized VOx species contacting to SiBeta are responsible for enhanced reactivity."
[5] "The deactivation rate increases with the increase of V loading amount. The mononuclear VOx prevailing on the surface of 0.5/1VSiBeta catalysts possess strong carbon deposition resistance, and thus, exhibiting little deactivation rate."
[6] "The catalytic activity of VSiBeta catalyst is exclusively influenced by the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, and seems not be associated with the initial valance of V because the V5+ can be reduced by hydrocarbons during reaction [15]."
[7] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species has effects on the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading."

1. Supported VOx catalysts are extensively used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (OPDH), but receive lesser attention in oxygen-free PDH reactions. However, considering the catalytic activity of VOx species in OPDH, the V-loaded SiBeta system shows great promise for PDH reactions.

2. Catalysts with vanadium loadings of 3, 7, and 10 wt% on SiBeta support (referred to as 3VSiBeta, 7VSiBeta, and 10VSiBeta) demonstrate ideal catalytic performance, achieving approximately 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. When the vanadium loading surpasses 3 wt%, the propane conversion tends to stabilize, implying that non-polymerized VOx species interacting with SiBeta support contribute to enhanced reactivity.

4. As the vanadium loading increases, the deactivation rate of the catalyst escalates. Catalysts with predominantly mononuclear VOx species on the surface, such as 0.5VSiBeta and 1VSiBeta, exhibit low deactivation rates due to their strong resistance against carbon deposition.

5. The catalytic activity of VSiBeta catalysts solely relies on the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, rather than the initial valence state of vanadium. This is because vanadium pentavalent species can be reduced by hydrocarbons during the reaction.

6. The aggregation level of VOx species impacts both propylene selectivity and deactivation rate. As the vanadium loading increases, these parameters also increase, suggesting a complex interplay between catalyst composition and PDH reaction efficiency.

7. The catalytic performance of VSiBeta catalysts is uniquely determined by the interaction sites between the VOx species and SiBeta support, and is not influenced by the initial valence state of vanadium, which can be reduced by hydrocarbons during the reaction process.

1.Vox催化剂在氧化脱氢制丙烯（OPDH）中得到了广泛的应用，但在无氧PDH反应中受到较少的关注。然而，考虑到Vox物种在OPDH中的催化活性，V负载的SiBeta系统在PDH反应中表现出巨大的潜力。

2. 在SiBeta支持下具有3、7和10 wt%钒负载（称为3VSiBeta、7VSiBeta和10VSiBeta）的催化剂显示出理想的催化性能，实现了约40%的丙烷转化率和90%的丙烯选择性。

3. 当钒负载超过3 wt%时，丙烷转化率趋于稳定，表明与SiBeta相互作用的非聚合Vox物种有助于提高活性。

4. 随着钒负载的增加，催化剂的失活速率上升。表面主要含有单核Vox物种的催化剂，如0.5VSiBeta和1VSiBeta，由于其对碳沉积的强抵抗力，表现出低失活率。

5. VSiBeta催化剂的催化活性仅依赖于Vox物种与SiBeta支持之间的相互作用位点，而不是钒的初始价态。这是因为五价钒物种可以在反应过程中被烃类还原。

6. Vox物种的聚合水平影响丙烯选择性和失活速率。随着钒负载的增加，这些参数也增加，表明催化剂组成与PDH反应效率之间存在复杂的相互作用。

7. VSiBeta催化剂的催化性能独特地取决于Vox物种与SiBeta支持之间的相互作用位点，并且不受钒的初始价态的影响，后者可以在反应过程中被烃类还原。
