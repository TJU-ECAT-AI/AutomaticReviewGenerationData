[1] "Although more theoretical work is necessary, these theories are in general agreement on the effects of a finite volume fraction of coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems."
[2] "New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime."
[3] "The role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is reviewed, and it is shown that these fields can play a dominant role in determining the coarsening behavior of a solid-solid system."

The theories on Ostwald ripening agree on how a limited amount of larger particles affects the growth of phases in two-phase systems. Transient Ostwald ripening shows the diverse outcomes in this process. Elastic fields in solid-solid mixtures have a significant impact on how these systems evolve over time.
