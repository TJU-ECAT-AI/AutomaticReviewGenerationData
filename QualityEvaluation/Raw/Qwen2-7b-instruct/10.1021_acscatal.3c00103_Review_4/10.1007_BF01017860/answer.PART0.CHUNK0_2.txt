[1] "Although more theoretical work is necessary, these theories are in general agreement on the effects of a finite volume fraction of coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems."
[2] "New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime."
[3] "The conditions responsible for the presence of the asymptotic state first discovered by LS, as well as the manner in which this state is approached, are also discussed."
[4] "The role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is reviewed, and it is shown that these fields can play a dominant role in determining the coarsening behavior of a solid-solid system."

The literature discusses the theoretical developments in the field of Ostwald ripening, particularly focusing on the impact of a finite volume fraction of the coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems. It reviews recent theoretical work on transient Ostwald ripening, highlighting the diverse behaviors possible within this regime. The conditions leading to the initial discovery of the asymptotic state and how it is approached are also explored. Moreover, the role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is examined, revealing their significant influence on the coarsening behavior of such systems.

文献讨论了在两相系统中粗化相体积分数有限时对粗化行为的影响的理论发展。它回顾了最近关于瞬态奥斯特瓦尔德粗化的工作，强调了在这种状态下可能存在的广泛行为。还探讨了导致首次发现的渐近状态的条件以及如何接近这种状态。此外，还研究了在固-固混合物中奥斯特瓦尔德粗化过程中弹性场的作用，揭示了这些场在决定固-固系统的粗化行为方面的重要影响。
