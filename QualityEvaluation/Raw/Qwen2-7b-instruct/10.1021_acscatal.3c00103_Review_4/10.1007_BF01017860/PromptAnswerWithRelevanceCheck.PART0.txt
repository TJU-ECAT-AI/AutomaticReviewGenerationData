The literature discusses the theoretical developments in the field of Ostwald ripening, particularly focusing on the impact of a finite volume fraction of the coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems. It reviews recent theoretical work on transient Ostwald ripening, highlighting the diverse behaviors possible within this regime. The conditions leading to the initial discovery of the asymptotic state and how it is approached are also explored. Moreover, the role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is examined, revealing their significant influence on the coarsening behavior of such systems.

The theories on Ostwald ripening agree on how a limited amount of larger particles affects the growth of phases in two-phase systems. Transient Ostwald ripening shows the diverse outcomes in this process. Elastic fields in solid-solid mixtures have a significant impact on how these systems evolve over time.
