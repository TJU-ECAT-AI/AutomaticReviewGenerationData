[1] "Developments in the theory of Ostwald ripening since the classic work of I. M. Lifshitz and V. V. Slyozov (LS) are reviewed and directions for future work are suggested."
[2] "New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime."
[3] "The role of elastic fields during Ostwald ripening in solid-solid mixtures is reviewed, and it is shown that these fields can play a dominant role in determining the coarsening behavior of a solid-solid system."

The theory of Ostwald ripening has seen significant developments since the foundational work by I. M. Lifshitz and V. V. Slyozov. These advancements include the exploration of transient ripening phenomena, which exhibit a wide variety of behaviors, and the recognition of the critical role that elastic fields play in the coarsening dynamics of solid-solid mixtures.
