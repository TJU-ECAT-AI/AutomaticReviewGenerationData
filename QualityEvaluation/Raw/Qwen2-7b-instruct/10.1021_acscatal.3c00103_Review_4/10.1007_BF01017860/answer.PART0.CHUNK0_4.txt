[1] "Although more theoretical work is necessary, these theories are in general agreement on the effects of a finite volume fraction of coarsening phase on the coarsening behavior of two-phase systems."
[2] "New work on transient Ostwald ripening is presented which illustrates the broad range of behavior which is possible in this regime."
[3] "The conditions responsible for the presence of the asymptotic state first discovered by LS, as well as the manner in which this state is approached, are also discussed."

The theories reviewed in the article generally agree on the impact of a limited volume of the coarsening phase on the dynamics of two-phase systems undergoing Ostwald ripening. They also explore the variability of behavior in transient Ostwald ripening regimes, along with the factors leading to and the progression towards the initial asymptotic state observed by Lifshitz and Slyozov.
