The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as acid strength, stability, surface area, pore size distribution, and composition, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modifying these properties through strategic support adjustments can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. In particular, single co sites within ordered SiO2 channels have been identified as beneficial for boosting non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation.
