The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as particle size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies, including doping, co-precipitation, and impregnation, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, incorporating metal ions into the catalyst matrix can enhance acidity, leading to improved dehydrogenation efficiency, while adjusting particle size can increase surface area, crucial for enhancing reaction kinetics. Surface modifications, such as creating more active sites through etching or grafting, can further boost catalytic performance.
