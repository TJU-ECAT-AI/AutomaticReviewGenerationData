[1] "Nature has extensively exploited the notion of hierarchy to create matter with extraordinary properties from abundant and naturally occurring building blocks."
[2] "By hierarchical organizing, biological organisms are able to compensate for the shortage of chemical elements readily available in their natural environment and are able to create living materials with functionalities that would not be achievable otherwise using the same set of building blocks implemented at only one particular length scale."
[3] "Porous hierarchy: having bimodal or multimodal porous structures with a pore size distribution from micro-, meso- to macropores in a single body enables fast mass-transport and high contact surface area for highly efficient exchange and reactions."
[4] "The micropores allow for size/shape selectivity or confinement, the mesopores for improved accessibility to active sites and mass-transfer, and the macropores for unimpeded diffusion of various molecules."
[5] "Such bio-inspired Murray material has demonstrated highly enhanced mass-transfer and exchange in complex systems including liquid-solid, gas-solid and electrochemical systems."
[6] "This learning from nature strategy has inspired many creative works on hierarchically porous materials, such as Murray-membranes with ultrafast water transport and evaporation for smart moisture-wicking fabrics, Murray-MOF film with greatly enhanced electron and mass transfer efficiency for electrochemical sensing, and Murray-type assembly of Co-N-C nanoparticles with efficient mass-transfer for improved electrocatalytic performance."
[7] "The relationships deduced from the generalized Murray's law gave the precise pore diameter ratios."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with optimized properties exhibit enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Modification strategies can be employed to fine-tune these properties. For instance, the introduction of hierarchical structures allows for the creation of materials that can efficiently transport and exchange substances and energy. This is achieved by designing materials with interconnected micro-meso-macroporosity, as exemplified by the Murray material, which optimizes mass transport properties while minimizing energy consumption. The generalized Murray's law provides a framework for establishing the quantitative relationship between pore diameters of different length scales, guiding the synthesis of bio-inspired hierarchically porous materials with enhanced mass-transfer capabilities. This strategy has been successfully applied in various systems, such as water transport membranes, electrochemical sensors, and electrocatalysts, demonstrating the potential of learning from nature to optimize catalysts for various applications.
