[1] "Nature has extensively exploited the notion of hierarchy to create matter with extraordinary properties from abundant and naturally occurring building blocks."
[2] "Introducing, simultaneously, four types of hierarchies in one material as found in nature systems constitutes a beautiful dream of scientific research."
[3] "The synthesis strategies always follow an empirical trial-testing-modification-retesting procedure."
[4] "Despite these encouraging progresses in the design-synthesis concept and in the establishment of the interplay between the porous hierarchy and the enhanced performance, they still remain qualitative."
[5] "The application demand-theoretical design-oriented synthesis should become a fundamental principle to guide the synthesis of these complex hierarchically porous materials towards their ultimately optimal functionalities."
[6] "Following the generalized Murray's law, it is possible to establish the quantitative relationship between pore diameters of different length levels, and thus to guide the synthesis of bio-inspired hierarchically porous materials which respect the generalized Murray's law with maximized mass transport properties and minimized energy consumption."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a significant role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, a catalyst with strong acidity may facilitate faster dehydrogenation rates, while structural features such as the presence of large cavities or channels can enhance mass transfer and reaction kinetics. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, researchers can employ various modification strategies. These might involve altering the catalyst's surface chemistry, modifying its particle size, or adjusting its porosity to create a more favorable internal architecture for reactant access and product release. The use of theoretical design-oriented synthesis guided by principles like the generalized Murray's law can also help in predicting and optimizing the performance of these materials, ensuring they respect the natural hierarchy and maximize mass transport while minimizing energy consumption.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性等化学属性以及形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能中起着重要作用。例如，具有强酸性的催化剂可能能够促进更快的脱氢速率，而结构特性如大空腔或通道的存在可以增强物质传输和反应动力学。为了优化这些属性以提高催化效率和选择性，研究人员可以通过改变催化剂的表面化学、调整其粒径或调节其孔隙率来采用各种改性策略。使用理论设计导向的合成方法，并遵循如广义默里定律这样的原则，可以帮助预测和优化这些材料的性能，确保它们尊重自然层次结构并最大化物质传输，同时最小化能量消耗。
