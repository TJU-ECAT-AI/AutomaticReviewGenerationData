[1] "The synthesis strategies always follow an empirical trial-testing-modification-retesting procedure. This largely limits the advantages of hierarchically porous materials in practical applications."
[2] "Despite these encouraging progresses in the design-synthesis concept and in the establishment of the interplay between the porous hierarchy and the enhanced performance, they still remain qualitative."
[3] "The application demand-theoretical design-oriented synthesis should become a fundamental principle to guide the synthesis of these complex hierarchically porous materials towards their ultimately optimal functionalities."
[4] "Following the generalized Murray's law, it is possible to establish the quantitative relationship between pore diameters of different length levels, and thus to guide the synthesis of bio-inspired hierarchically porous materials which respect the generalized Murray's law with maximized mass transport properties and minimized energy consumption."
[5] "This learning from nature strategy has inspired many creative works on hierarchically porous materials, such as Murray-membranes with ultrafast water transport and evaporation for smart moisture-wicking fabrics, Murray-MOF film with greatly enhanced electron and mass transfer efficiency for electrochemical sensing, and Murray-type assembly of Co-N-C nanoparticles with efficient mass-transfer for improved electrocatalytic performance."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with optimized properties exhibit enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Modification strategies can be employed to adjust these properties. For instance, the introduction of hierarchical structures, like porous architectures, can improve mass transport and reaction kinetics, leading to more efficient catalytic processes. The generalized Murray's law provides a framework for establishing the quantitative relationship between pore diameters of different length scales, guiding the synthesis of bio-inspired hierarchically porous materials that optimize mass transport and minimize energy consumption. This strategy has inspired the development of materials with enhanced properties, such as ultrafast water transport membranes, highly efficient electrochemical sensors, and electrocatalysts with improved mass transfer capabilities.
