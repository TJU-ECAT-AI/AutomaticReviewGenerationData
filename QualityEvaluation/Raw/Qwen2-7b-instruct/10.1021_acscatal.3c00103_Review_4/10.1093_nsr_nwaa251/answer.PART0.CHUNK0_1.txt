[1] "Nature has extensively exploited the notion of hierarchy to create matter with extraordinary properties from abundant and naturally occurring building blocks."
[2] "By hierarchical organizing, biological organisms are able to compensate for the shortage of chemical elements readily available in their natural environment and are able to create living materials with functionalities that would not be achievable otherwise using the same set of building blocks implemented at only one particular length scale."
[3] "There has been a rapid development of synthesis strategies for tailoring hierarchical porous architecture within materials, such as zeolites, carbons, metal oxides, polymers and MOFs (metal-organic frameworks), endowing them with significantly improved performances in energy storage and conversion, catalysis, photocatalysis, adsorption, separation, gas sensing and biomedicine."
[4] "The synthesis strategies always follow an empirical trial-testing-modification-retesting procedure. This largely limits the advantages of hierarchically porous materials in practical applications."
[5] "Despite these encouraging progresses in the design-synthesis concept and in the establishment of the interplay between the porous hierarchy and the enhanced performance, they still remain qualitative."
[6] "Most recently, we have revealed the underlying physical principles of optimal nature systems by revisiting Murray's law, and have developed a generalized Murray's law (Equation (1)) via taking the mass variation and constant surface substance exchange into account during the mass transportation."
[7] "Following the generalized Murray's law, it is possible to establish the quantitative relationship between pore diameters of different length levels, and thus to guide the synthesis of bio-inspired hierarchically porous materials which respect the generalized Murray's law with maximized mass transport properties and minimized energy consumption."
[8] "The application of the generalized Murray's law for the design of porous hierarchy in any kind of material will be a new important research direction of great potential and scientific value."
[9] "Nevertheless, the generalized Murray's law deals only with the relationship between the pore size and the performance for optimized diffusion efficiency in materials."
[10] "In addition to the effect of porous diameters, many other intrinsic characteristics of materials, such as proportion; structure; shape and surface properties of different level porosity; the number, length and angles of pore branches; the orchestrated effect of different level porosity; and the chemical composition of materials, which are also decisive for the efficiency of mass-transfer and reactions, should be introduced into the generalized Murray's law."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties determine how effectively the catalysts can facilitate the chemical reactions, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. To optimize these properties, modification strategies can focus on adjusting the catalyst's chemical composition, structure, and morphology to better suit the specific requirements of the dehydrogenation process.

2. The ability of hierarchical organizing allows biological organisms to compensate for the scarcity of readily available chemical elements in their natural environment, enabling the creation of living materials with functionalities that would be unachievable with the same set of building blocks used at a single length scale.

3. Advances in synthesis strategies for creating hierarchical porous architectures within materials, such as zeolites, carbons, metal oxides, polymers, and MOFs, have significantly improved their performance in areas like energy storage and conversion, catalysis, photocatalysis, adsorption, separation, gas sensing, and biomedicine.

4. The current synthesis strategies for hierarchical materials often rely on an empirical trial-and-error approach, which limits their practical applications due to the lack of a systematic understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical structure and material performance.

5. The development of a generalized Murray's law provides a framework for quantitatively relating pore diameters across different length scales, guiding the synthesis of bio-inspired hierarchically porous materials with optimized mass transport properties and reduced energy consumption.

6. The application of the generalized Murray's law represents a promising new research direction for designing hierarchical porous materials, with significant potential and scientific value.

7. While the generalized Murray's law primarily focuses on the relationship between pore size and performance for optimized diffusion efficiency, it does not consider other intrinsic material characteristics that influence mass transfer and reactions.

8. To fully optimize the performance of hierarchical materials, the generalized Murray's law should incorporate factors such as material proportions, structure, shape, surface properties, the arrangement of pore branches, the interaction between different levels of porosity, and the chemical composition of the materials.

9. The development of a comprehensive design theory for hierarchical materials, considering all aspects mentioned in point 8, could revolutionize the field by providing a more systematic approach to material synthesis and optimization.

10. Incorporating the effects of multiple intrinsic material characteristics into the generalized Murray's law could enhance its predictive capabilities and lead to the creation of more efficient hierarchical materials for various applications.
