[1] "The syntheses of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts consist of the creation of mesopore in ZSM-5 zeolite and loading Pt-Sn into hierarchical zeolite."
[2] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
[3] "The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5."
[4] "It is found that the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst shows the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, which gives an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570 C."
[5] "The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including the creation of mesopores in ZSM-5 zeolite and the incorporation of Pt-Sn species, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. This includes affecting the acid strength, stability, and morphology of the catalyst, which in turn impacts the catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
2. The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite is synthesized through a mild treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite with alkali solution, creating a structure with both microporosity and mesoporosity.
3. Incorporating Sn and Pt species into the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite structure results in the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts with distinct physicochemical properties.
4. The PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst demonstrates the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570°C.
5. The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is primarily due to the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite structure.
