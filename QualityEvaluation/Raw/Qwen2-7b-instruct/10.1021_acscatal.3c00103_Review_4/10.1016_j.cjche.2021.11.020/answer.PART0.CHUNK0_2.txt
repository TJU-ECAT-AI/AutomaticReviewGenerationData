1. The concentration of alkali solution and the Sn/Pt ratio significantly influence the catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts. The PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst demonstrates the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, achieving an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570°C. The high performance is attributed to the presence of mesopores in the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, which allows the PtSn particles to be confined within the mesopores, maintaining their stability at high temperatures and facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products.

2. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including the acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the presence of mesopores in the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite structure enhances the diffusion of reactants and products, stabilizes the PtSn particles, and prevents cracking and coking reactions, leading to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

3. The desilication process of ZSM-5 zeolite with NaOH solution affects the crystallinity and pore structure of the catalyst. As the alkali concentration increases, the crystallinity decreases, but the topology of the MFI structure remains intact. This modification strategy impacts the surface area and total pore volume of the desilicated ZSM-5 zeolite, influencing its catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

4. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms reveal that ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a significant nitrogen absorption at low pressures, attributed to the filling in the micropores. The surface area and total pore volume of the desilicated ZSM-5 zeolite are positively correlated with the concentration of NaOH solution, suggesting that the alkali treatment modifies the pore structure and textural properties of the catalyst.

5. When ZSM-5 zeolites are subjected to alkali treatments below 1.0 mol/L, their morphologies are preserved. However, increasing the alkali concentration to 1.0 mol/L significantly damages the zeolite crystals, leading to the formation of smaller particles. The optimal desilication condition, with a NaOH concentration of 0.8 mol/L, yields the best catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. The PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit high pore volumes and surface areas, comparable to those of the hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8) zeolite. The introduction of Pt and Sn species into the hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8) zeolite does not alter its textural properties, indicating that these modifications maintain the catalyst's pore structure and enhance its catalytic performance.

7. In the PtSn/zeolite structure, Sn(IV) atoms are likely bonded through Si-O-Sn linkages, integrating into the zeolite framework and contributing to the stability and functionality of the catalyst.

8. The PtSn1.00/hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst maintains a high propane conversion rate of approximately 20% even after a 70-hour reaction period, demonstrating its long-term stability and regenerability. The regeneration of the deactivated catalyst through calcination in an air flow at 500°C restores its performance, showcasing its good regenerability.

9. The high catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is primarily attributed to the presence of mesopores in the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. These mesopores facilitate the confinement of PtSn particles, stabilize them at high temperatures, and accelerate the diffusion of reactants and products, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. 碱溶液浓度和Sn/Pt比对PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂的催化性能有显著影响。PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8)催化剂在570°C下表现出最高效率的丙烷脱氢，初始转化率为46%，选择性为98%。这种高性能归因于层状ZSM-5中微孔的存在，这些微孔允许PtSn颗粒被限制在微孔内，维持其高温稳定性，并促进反应物和产物的扩散。

2. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度、稳定性和形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能起着关键作用。例如，层状ZSM-5中微孔结构的存在增强了反应物和产物的扩散，稳定了PtSn颗粒，防止了裂解和结焦反应，从而提高了催化效率和选择性。

3. ZSM-5沸石通过NaOH溶液的去硅化过程影响催化剂的结晶性和孔结构。随着碱浓度的增加，结晶性下降，但MFI结构的拓扑保持不变。这一修改策略影响了去硅化ZSM-5沸石的表面面积和总孔体积，影响了其在丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。

4. ZSM-5沸石的氮吸附-脱附等温线显示，沸石在低压力下显示出显著的氮吸附，归因于微孔的填充。去硅化ZSM-5沸石的表面面积和总孔体积与NaOH溶液的浓度呈正相关，表明碱处理修改了催化剂的孔结构和文本属性。

5. 当ZSM-5沸石受到低于1.0 mol/L的碱处理时，它们的形态得以保存。然而，将碱浓度提高到1.0 mol/L显著破坏了沸石晶体，导致形成许多小颗粒。用于丙烷脱氢的最佳去硅化条件是0.8 mol/L的NaOH浓度，这产生最佳催化剂。

6. PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂显示出与层级ZSM-5(0.8)沸石相类似的高孔体积和表面积。Pt和Sn元素的引入到层级ZSM-5(0.8)沸石中没有改变其文本属性，表明这些修改保持了催化剂的孔结构并提高了其催化性能。

8. PtSn1.00/hierarchical ZSM-5(0.8)催化剂即使在70小时的反应期内仍保持约20%的丙烷转化率，显示出其长期稳定性和再生能力。通过空气流中的500°C煅烧重新激活失活催化剂恢复了其性能，展示了其良好的再生能力。

9. PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的高催化性能主要归因于层级ZSM-5中微孔的存在。这些微孔有助于限制PtSn颗粒，使其在高温下稳定，并加速反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高催化效率和选择性。
