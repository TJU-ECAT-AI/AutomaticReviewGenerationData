1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties determine how effectively the catalysts can facilitate the chemical transformations required for dehydrogenation, ensuring high conversion rates and selectivity towards desired products.

2. Morphological modifications, specifically the creation of mesopores in the ZSM-5 zeolite structure, enhance the catalytic efficiency by allowing PtSn particles to be confined within these pores. This confinement stabilizes the particles, preventing them from sintering at high temperatures, thus maintaining their active sites and improving the reaction efficiency.

3. The concentration of alkali solution during the desilication process plays a crucial role in the formation of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, affecting the crystallinity and texture properties of the zeolite. An optimized concentration of 0.8 mol·L-1 NaOH leads to the formation of zeolites with the best catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation, suggesting that this condition optimally balances the formation of mesopores and maintains the zeolite's structure integrity.

4. The high performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores of the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite. This confinement not only stabilizes the particles but also accelerates the diffusion of reactants and products, facilitating efficient dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions such as cracking and coking.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括其化学性质如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，影响脱氢反应的性能。这些性质决定了催化剂能否有效地促进所需化学转化，确保高转化率和目标产物的高选择性。

2. 形态修改，特别是通过在ZSM-5沸石结构中创建介孔，提高了催化效率，允许PtSn颗粒被限制在这些孔中。这种限制稳定了颗粒，防止它们在高温下聚集，从而保持其活性位点并提高反应效率。

3. 在脱硅过程中碱溶液的浓度对形成层级ZSM-5沸石起着关键作用，影响沸石的结晶性和纹理属性。优化的0.8 mol·L-1 NaOH浓度导致形成具有最佳脱氢性能的沸石，表明在这种条件下最佳地平衡了形成介孔和维持沸石结构完整性。

4. PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的高性能归因于PtSn颗粒被限制在层级ZSM-5沸石的介孔中。这种限制不仅稳定了颗粒，而且加速了反应物和产物的扩散，促进了高效的脱氢反应，同时最小化了不希望的副反应如裂解和结焦。
