[1] "The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was obtained via a treatment of ZSM-5 zeolites with alkali solution under a mild condition."
[2] "The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5."
[3] "The effects of the concentrations of alkali solution and Sn/Pt ratios on the catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 were systematically studied, and it is found that the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst shows the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, which gives an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570 C."
[4] "The high performance of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 in propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the presence of mesopore in hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, obtained through a mild alkali treatment, serves as a support for the confinement of PtSn particles within its mesopores. This confinement effect stabilizes the PtSn particles, enabling their effective use at high temperatures. The addition of Sn and Pt species into the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite forms the Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalyst. The study of alkali concentration and Sn/Pt ratio impacts on catalytic performance reveals that the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst exhibits the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation. The presence of mesopores in the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite accelerates diffusion rates, allowing easy access of propane to the PtSn particles for dehydrogenation, while promoting the rapid diffusion of propylene out of the zeolite crystal, thus reducing cracking and coking reactions. These strategies enhance the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of the PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性等化学特性，以及形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能具有显著影响。通过温和的碱处理获得的分级ZSM-5沸石，为PtSn粒子在其中的介孔中提供了定位环境。这种定位效应稳定了PtSn粒子，在高温下有效利用。向分级ZSM-5沸石中添加Sn和Pt物种形成了Pt-Sn/分级ZSM-5催化剂。通过研究碱浓度和Sn/Pt比例对催化性能的影响发现，PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8)催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出最高的效率。分级ZSM-5沸石中存在的介孔加速了扩散速率，使得丙烷能够轻松接近PtSn颗粒进行脱氢反应，同时促进丙烯从沸石晶体的快速扩散，从而减少裂解和结焦反应。这些策略提高了PtSn/分级ZSM-5催化剂的催化效率和选择性。
