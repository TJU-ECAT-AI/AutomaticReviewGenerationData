<p>The introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of Pt-Sn/hierarchical ZSM-5.</p>
<p>The effects of the concentrations of alkali solution and Sn/Pt ratios on the catalytic performance of PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 were systematically studied, and it is found that the PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst shows the highest efficiency in propane dehydrogenation, which gives an initial conversion of 46% and selectivity of 98% at 570 C.</p>
<p>The high efficiency of these PtSn/hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is mainly attributed to the confinement of PtSn particles in the mesopores of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite.</p>

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting factors like reactivity, stability, and selectivity. In the context of this literature, modifying the catalyst's structure through the introduction of Sn and Pt species into hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite enhances its performance. The optimal PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8) catalyst demonstrates the highest efficiency, showcasing the importance of these modifications for enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. The modification strategy involves creating mesopores in ZSM-5 zeolite and loading Pt-Sn into hierarchical zeolite. This approach allows for the confinement of PtSn particles within the mesopores, which stabilizes them at high temperatures, contributing to the catalyst's stability and selectivity. Additionally, the presence of mesopores accelerates the diffusion rate of reactants and products, enhancing conversion rates while minimizing cracking and coking reactions.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，如化学特性和形态特征，影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，通过影响反应活性、稳定性和选择性。在本文献中，通过向分级ZSM-5沸石中引入Sn和Pt物种来修改催化剂结构，可以增强其性能。最优的PtSn1.00/ZSM-5(0.8)催化剂显示出最高效率，这强调了这些修改对于提高催化效率和选择性的关键作用。

2. 修改策略包括在ZSM-5沸石中创建微孔，并将Pt-Sn负载到分级沸石中。这种方法允许PtSn颗粒被限制在微孔内，从而在分级沸石结构中稳定它们，在高温下保持稳定性，对催化剂的稳定性和选择性产生积极影响。此外，微孔的存在加速了反应物和产物的扩散速率，提高了转化率，同时减少了裂解和结焦反应。
