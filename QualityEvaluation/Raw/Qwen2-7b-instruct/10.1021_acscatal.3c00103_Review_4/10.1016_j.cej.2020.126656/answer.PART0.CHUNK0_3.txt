1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as the suppression of strong acid sites, which can promote side reactions leading to coke formation, play a crucial role. Morphological characteristics, like the degree of alloy formation, affect the reactivity and activity of the catalyst. Support modification strategies, such as incorporating Ca, can enhance these properties for better catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. The presence of Ca on the catalyst surface leads to the acceleration of the reduction of GeOx species, resulting in a higher extent of both electronic and geometric effects. This causes a decrease in dispersion, potentially improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

3. TGA analysis reveals the nature of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface after dehydrogenation. The disappearance of peaks related to coke formation on the Ca-promoted catalyst indicates a reduction in the density of strong acid sites and a decrease in the ability for cracking and coke formation.

4. The kinetic modeling used in this work provides insights into the deactivation process during dehydrogenation, with the Ca-promoted catalyst showing lower intrinsic deactivation rates and higher residual activity. This indicates that the presence of Ca leads to a lower net deactivation rate, resulting in improved stability and enhanced performance of the catalyst.

5. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst is slightly higher than that of the unmodified one. This can be attributed to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species on the sample, which promotes the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, thus decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, the higher resistance against deactivation by coke is a more significant factor in the better performance of the promoted catalyst.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度、稳定性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。化学特性如抑制强酸位点的作用对于防止副反应和焦炭形成至关重要。形态特征如合金形成程度影响催化剂的活性和选择性。通过引入Ca等策略修改支撑材料可以优化这些性质以实现更高效的催化作用和更高选择性。

2. 在Ca改性的催化剂表面，加速了GeOx物种的还原过程，导致电子和几何效应的增强，从而导致分散度降低，可能提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. TGA分析揭示了催化剂表面沉积碳的性质。在Ca改性催化剂上，消失与焦炭形成相关的峰值表明强酸位点密度降低以及焦炭形成能力的减弱。

4. 动力学模型揭示了脱氢过程中催化剂的失活过程，Ca改性催化剂显示出更低的内在失活速率和更高的残余活性。这表明Ca的存在导致了更低的净失活速率，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性并增强了其性能。

5. Ca改性催化剂的脱氢反应活化能略高于未改性催化剂。这可以归因于样本中GeOx物种的增强还原，促进了Pt-Ge合金的形成，从而降低了催化剂的初始活性。然而，焦炭形成抵抗性的提高是促进催化剂性能改善的主要因素。
