<p>Clearly, the fraction of strong acid sites to weak + medium acid centers decreases with the addition of Ca to the Al2O3 support. The amount of adsorbed ammonia for Pt0.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 497.9 mol/g, 478.0 mol/g, and 189.8 mol/g, respectively.</p>
<p>Adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3.</p>
<p>As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity.</p>
<p>Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species.</p>
<p>There is a downshift of peaks to lower wavenumbers. It was widely reported that a higher electron density increases the back-donation into the Π* orbital of CO, resulting in a lower CO frequency of the C-O bond of adsorbed CO.</p>
<p>The facile desorption of propylene on the bimetallic samples in comparison with the monometallic ones may result in a higher propylene selectivity by decreasing the probability of unwanted side reactions such as cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, coke formation, and deep dehydrogenation of propylene.</p>
<p>The apparent activation energies of all parameters are estimated from the Arrhenius plots depicted in Fig. 9 (b).</p>
<p>The activation energies of deactivation function (ψd) for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 66.7 kJ/mol and 73.7 kJ/mol, respectively.</p>

1. The addition of calcium to the aluminum oxide support decreases the fraction of strong acid sites, which are responsible for harmful side reactions, thus improving the catalyst's performance.
2. The amount of adsorbed ammonia decreases with the addition of calcium, indicating a decrease in acidity.
3. Calcium promotes the reduction of both platinum and germanium species on the catalyst surface.
4. The downshift in CO-DRIFT peaks suggests that calcium introduces a higher electron density, decreasing the CO frequency.
5. The facile desorption of propylene on the bimetallic samples increases propylene selectivity by reducing the likelihood of unwanted reactions.
6. The Arrhenius plots show the apparent activation energies of the kinetic parameters.
7. The activation energy for deactivation (ψd) is higher for the calcium-promoted catalyst, indicating better resistance against deactivation.
