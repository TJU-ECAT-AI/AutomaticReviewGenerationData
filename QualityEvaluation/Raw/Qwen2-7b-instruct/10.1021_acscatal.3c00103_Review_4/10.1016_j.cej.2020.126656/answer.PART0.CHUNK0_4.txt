<p>Clearly, the fraction of strong acid sites to weak + medium acid centers decreases with the addition of Ca to the Al2O3 support. The amount of adsorbed ammonia for Pt0.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 497.9 mol/g, 478.0 mol/g, and 189.8 mol/g, respectively.</p>
<p>Hence, adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3. As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity.</p>
<p>Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species. It is worthwhile mentioning that there is an optimal amount of Ca for the effective modification of the Al2O3 support.</p>
<p>For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h<sup>-1</sup> along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained. Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.63, respectively.</p>
<p>The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol).</p>
<p>Ca-modified catalyst shows, higher selectivity (98.5% vs. 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS), better stability and lower amount of coke formation.</p>

1. The addition of calcium to the aluminum oxide support reduces the fraction of strong acid sites, decreases the total acidity, and decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia.
2. Calcium promotes the reduction of both platinum and germanium species.
3. The residual activity and deactivation rate are lower for the calcium-promoted catalyst.
4. The activation energy of the propane dehydrogenation reaction increases with calcium addition.
5. The calcium-modified catalyst exhibits higher selectivity, better stability, and lower coke formation.
