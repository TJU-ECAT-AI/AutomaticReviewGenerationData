<p>Clearly, the fraction of strong acid sites to weak + medium acid centers decreases with the addition of Ca to the Al2O3 support. The amount of adsorbed ammonia for Pt0.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3, Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 497.9 mol/g, 478.0 mol/g, and 189.8 mol/g, respectively.</p>
<p>Adding Ge to the support does not significantly change the amount of adsorbed NH3.</p>
<p>As expected, the addition small amount of Ca significantly decreases the amount of adsorbed ammonia, showing a sharp decrease of the total acidity.</p>
<p>Ca helps the reduction of both Pt and Ge species.</p>
<p>There is a downshift of peaks to lower wavenumbers. It was widely reported that a higher electron density increases the back-donation into the Π* orbital of CO, resulting in a lower CO frequency of the C-O bond of adsorbed CO.</p>
<p>The facile desorption of propylene on the bimetallic samples in comparison with the monometallic ones may result in a higher propylene selectivity by decreasing the probability of unwanted side reactions such as cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, coke formation, and deep dehydrogenation of propylene.</p>
<p>The apparent activation energies of all parameters are estimated from the Arrhenius plots depicted in Fig. 9 (b).</p>
<p>The activation energies of deactivation function (ψd) for Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 and Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO are 66.7 kJ/mol and 73.7 kJ/mol, respectively.</p>

<p>The promoting effect of Ca on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction was studied using experimental methods and kinetic modeling. Different characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TGA were used to unravel the properties of catalysts.</p>
<p>Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca.</p>
<p>The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts.</p>
<p>For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained. Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h1 and 0.63, respectively.</p>
<p>The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol) due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species on this sample, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst.</p>

Physicochemical properties, including acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By modifying the support with calcium (Ca), the catalytic efficiency and selectivity can be optimized. In the case of the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalyst, adding Ca decreases the acid strength of the Al2O3 support, increases the degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge, and enhances propylene selectivity. This results in better stability and lower coke formation. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) accurately describes the deactivation process, indicating that the Ca-promoted catalyst has lower intrinsic deactivation rates and higher residual activity, thus improving performance and stability.

<p>Propane conversion at different temperatures for the catalysts is depicted in Fig. 7.</p>
<p>The increase in both selectivity and stability can be linked to the decrease of side reactions such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, which can be promoted by the strong acid centers of support as well as by unsaturated metal sites.</p>

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as the suppression of strong acid sites, which can promote side reactions leading to coke formation, play a crucial role. Morphological characteristics, like the degree of alloy formation, affect the reactivity and activity of the catalyst. Support modification strategies, such as incorporating Ca, can enhance these properties for better catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. The presence of Ca on the catalyst surface leads to the acceleration of the reduction of GeOx species, resulting in a higher extent of both electronic and geometric effects. This causes a decrease in dispersion, potentially improving the stability and selectivity of the catalyst.

3. TGA analysis reveals the nature of carbon deposited on the catalyst surface after dehydrogenation. The disappearance of peaks related to coke formation on the Ca-promoted catalyst indicates a reduction in the density of strong acid sites and a decrease in the ability for cracking and coke formation.

4. The kinetic modeling used in this work provides insights into the deactivation process during dehydrogenation, with the Ca-promoted catalyst showing lower intrinsic deactivation rates and higher residual activity. This indicates that the presence of Ca leads to a lower net deactivation rate, resulting in improved stability and enhanced performance of the catalyst.

5. The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Ca-promoted catalyst is slightly higher than that of the unmodified one. This can be attributed to the enhanced reduction of GeOx species on the sample, which promotes the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, thus decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst. However, the higher resistance against deactivation by coke is a more significant factor in the better performance of the promoted catalyst.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度、稳定性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。化学特性如抑制强酸位点的作用对于防止副反应和焦炭形成至关重要。形态特征如合金形成程度影响催化剂的活性和选择性。通过引入Ca等策略修改支撑材料可以优化这些性质以实现更高效的催化作用和更高选择性。

2. 在Ca改性的催化剂表面，加速了GeOx物种的还原过程，导致电子和几何效应的增强，从而导致分散度降低，可能提高了催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. TGA分析揭示了催化剂表面沉积碳的性质。在Ca改性催化剂上，消失与焦炭形成相关的峰值表明强酸位点密度降低以及焦炭形成能力的减弱。

4. 动力学模型揭示了脱氢过程中催化剂的失活过程，Ca改性催化剂显示出更低的内在失活速率和更高的残余活性。这表明Ca的存在导致了更低的净失活速率，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性并增强了其性能。

5. Ca改性催化剂的脱氢反应活化能略高于未改性催化剂。这可以归因于样本中GeOx物种的增强还原，促进了Pt-Ge合金的形成，从而降低了催化剂的初始活性。然而，焦炭形成抵抗性的提高是促进催化剂性能改善的主要因素。
