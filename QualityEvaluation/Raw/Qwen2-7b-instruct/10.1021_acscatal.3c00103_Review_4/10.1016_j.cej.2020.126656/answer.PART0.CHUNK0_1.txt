<p>The promoting effect of Ca on the catalytic performance of Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction was studied using experimental methods and kinetic modeling. Different characterization techniques including H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, C3H6-TPD, XPS, BET, CO-chemisorption, CO-DRIFT, and TGA were used to unravel the properties of catalysts.</p>
<p>Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca.</p>
<p>The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts.</p>
<p>For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained. Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h1 and 0.63, respectively.</p>
<p>The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol) due to the enhanced reduction of the GeOx species on this sample, which enhanced the formation of a Pt-Ge alloy, decreasing the initial activity of the catalyst.</p>

Physicochemical properties, including acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By modifying the support with calcium (Ca), the catalytic efficiency and selectivity can be optimized. In the case of the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3 catalyst, adding Ca decreases the acid strength of the Al2O3 support, increases the degree of alloy formation between Pt and Ge, and enhances propylene selectivity. This results in better stability and lower coke formation. The deactivation model with residual activity (DMRA) accurately describes the deactivation process, indicating that the Ca-promoted catalyst has lower intrinsic deactivation rates and higher residual activity, thus improving performance and stability.

物理化学性质，包括酸性强度、稳定性以及形态，对脱氢反应中的催化剂性能有重大影响。通过将钙（Ca）修饰到支持物上，可以优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。对于Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3催化剂而言，添加Ca降低了Al2O3支持物的酸性强度，增加了铂（Pt）与锗（Ge）之间的合金形成程度，并增强了丙烯的选择性。这导致了更好的稳定性和较低的焦炭生成。脱活模型与残余活性（DMRA）准确描述了脱活过程，表明Ca促进的催化剂具有更低的内在脱活速率和更高的残余活性，从而提高了性能和稳定性。
