<p>Enhanced propylene selectivity (98.5% Vs 96.4% @ 600 C and 24 h TOS) and catalyst stability were achieved due to the decrease of acid centers of Al2O3 along with an increase of the degree of alloy formation upon addition of Ca.</p>
<p>The experimental data of propane conversion vs. time were successfully fitted with the Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA), allowing for the calculation of the intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters for both catalysts.</p>
<p>For the Ca-promoted catalyst, a deactivation function of 0.05 h1 along with a residual activity of 0.82 at 600 C were obtained. Whereas, for the non-promoted sample, these values were 0.22 h1 and 0.63, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of Ca to the support suppresses the strong acidic sites, leading to improved selectivity and stability.</p>
<p>The activation energy of the PDH reaction for the Pt0.5-Ge1.5/Al2O3-CaO catalyst was slightly higher than that of the unmodified one (74.8 kJ/mol vs. 66.4 kJ/mol).</p>

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically the reduction of acid centers and increase in alloy formation, contribute to enhanced propylene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The Deactivation Model with Residual Activity (DMRA) successfully fits the experimental data, providing insights into intrinsic deactivation kinetic parameters.
3. The Ca-promoted catalyst shows a decreased deactivation rate (ψd) and increased residual activity, indicating better stability and performance.
4. The addition of Ca to the support material suppresses strong acidic sites, improving the catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
5. The activation energy for the Ca-promoted catalyst is higher than that of the unmodified catalyst, suggesting a modification in the reactivity of the nanoparticles.
6. The Ca-promoted catalyst demonstrates reduced activity in coke deactivation, contributing to its overall superior performance.
