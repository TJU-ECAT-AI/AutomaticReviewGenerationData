[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency."
[2] "Acidity adjustment: PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
[3] "Morphology and Porosity Regulation: For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

Dehydrogenation reactions' catalytic efficiency and selectivity are influenced by the physicochemical properties of catalysts. Acid strength and hydrothermal/pH stability determine the catalyst's selectivity towards targeted alkenes, while morphology and porosity impact diffusion efficiency. Strategies such as acidity adjustment and morphology and porosity regulation can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic performance.
