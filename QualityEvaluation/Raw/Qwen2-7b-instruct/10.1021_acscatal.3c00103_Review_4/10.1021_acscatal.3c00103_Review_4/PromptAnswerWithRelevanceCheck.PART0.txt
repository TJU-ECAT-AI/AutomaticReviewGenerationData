3.3. Support Modification
The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency. In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3).

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, hydrothermal and pH stability, and morphological and porous characteristics, significantly impact their catalytic behaviors in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for modifying catalyst supports focus on optimizing these properties to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, acidity adjustment involves introducing alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals to balance the acidity of the support, thereby inhibiting catalytic deactivation. Morphology regulation includes developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces, such as needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures. Porosity regulation involves adjusting the support's porosity to improve mass transport, as seen in the use of mesoporous and hierarchical zeolites.

3.3.1. Acidity Adjustment
"PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
"As for zeolites, the Lewis acid sites are preferable for propane dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites are inductive factors in catalyzing cleavage reactions."
"Generally, adjusting the acid property of the catalyst support by reducing the acidity or changing the acid type can significantly improve the catalytic stability and selectivity toward propylene. However, this strategy may also cause a reduction of catalytic activity."
"3.3.2. Morphology and Porosity Regulation
For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically their chemical qualities like acid strength and hydrothermal/pH stability, impact their catalytic behaviors in dehydrogenation reactions. Morphological and porous characteristics influence diffusion efficiency. Strategies to modify the support include adjusting acidity, regulating morphology, and managing porosity to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. Zeolites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation due to their Lewis acid sites, while Brnsted acid sites in zeolite supports promote cleavage reactions. Reducing acidity or changing the acid type can improve catalytic stability and selectivity towards propylene, though it might decrease catalytic activity.

3. Heterogeneous catalysts' performance is influenced by the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products, which depends on the support's morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties. Modifying morphology and porosity can optimize this efficiency.

4. The example of a 5.3 wt % CoOx/Al2O3 sheet catalyst demonstrates how morphology regulation can influence catalytic performance. The use of CoOx/SiO2-NMs showcases how modifying porosity can similarly enhance efficiency.

5. The examples of Pt1 wt % Ga/SBA-15 and 0.4 wt % Pt0.3 wt % Sn/ZSM-5 hierarchical catalysts illustrate how managing porosity can improve catalytic activities.
