3.3. Support Modification
The physicochemical properties of catalysts have a significant impact on their catalytic behaviors. Chemical qualities, including acid strength and hydrothermal and pH stability, affect the selectivity toward the targeted alkene in dehydrogenation reactions, while the morphological and porous qualities can influence the diffusion efficiency. In this section, strategies focused on support modification for dehydrogenation catalysts are summarized (Table 3).

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, hydrothermal and pH stability, and morphological and porous characteristics, significantly impact their catalytic behaviors in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for modifying catalyst supports focus on optimizing these properties to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, acidity adjustment involves introducing alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals to balance the acidity of the support, thereby inhibiting catalytic deactivation. Morphology regulation includes developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces, such as needle-shaped, sheet-shaped, and mesh-shaped structures. Porosity regulation involves adjusting the support's porosity to improve mass transport, as seen in the use of mesoporous and hierarchical zeolites.
