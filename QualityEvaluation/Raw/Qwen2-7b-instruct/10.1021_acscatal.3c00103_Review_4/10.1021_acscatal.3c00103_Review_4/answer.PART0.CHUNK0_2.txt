3.3.1. Acidity Adjustment
"PDH is an acid-sensitive reaction, which signifies that proper acidity of the support is preferable for CH activation and propylene desorption, while unduly strong acidity, on the other hand, can generate a negative impact on the PDH process, possibly leading to CC cracking and deep dehydrogenation."
"As for zeolites, the Lewis acid sites are preferable for propane dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites are inductive factors in catalyzing cleavage reactions."
"Generally, adjusting the acid property of the catalyst support by reducing the acidity or changing the acid type can significantly improve the catalytic stability and selectivity toward propylene. However, this strategy may also cause a reduction of catalytic activity."
"3.3.2. Morphology and Porosity Regulation
For heterogeneous catalysts, one kinetic factor, the diffusion efficiency of the reactants and products, which is determined by the morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties of the supports, should be taken into consideration."
"Morphology regulation 5.3 wt % CoOx/Al2O3 sheet 863 2.9 C3H8/H2/N2 = 1:0.8:3.2 5 25 97 0.0705 (162)"
"Morphology regulation 0.48 wt % CoOx/SiO2-NMs 823 2.9 C3H8/N2 = 2:6.4 24 25 95 0.0094 (163)"

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically their chemical qualities like acid strength and hydrothermal/pH stability, impact their catalytic behaviors in dehydrogenation reactions. Morphological and porous characteristics influence diffusion efficiency. Strategies to modify the support include adjusting acidity, regulating morphology, and managing porosity to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. Zeolites are preferred for propane dehydrogenation due to their Lewis acid sites, while Brnsted acid sites in zeolite supports promote cleavage reactions. Reducing acidity or changing the acid type can improve catalytic stability and selectivity towards propylene, though it might decrease catalytic activity.

3. Heterogeneous catalysts' performance is influenced by the diffusion efficiency of reactants and products, which depends on the support's morphology, structure, size, and chemical properties. Modifying morphology and porosity can optimize this efficiency.

4. The example of a 5.3 wt % CoOx/Al2O3 sheet catalyst demonstrates how morphology regulation can influence catalytic performance. The use of CoOx/SiO2-NMs showcases how modifying porosity can similarly enhance efficiency.

5. The examples of Pt1 wt % Ga/SBA-15 and 0.4 wt % Pt0.3 wt % Sn/ZSM-5 hierarchical catalysts illustrate how managing porosity can improve catalytic activities.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，尤其是它们的化学特性如酸强度和热力学/PH稳定性，影响脱氢反应中的催化行为。形态和孔隙特性影响扩散效率。支持修改策略包括调整酸性、调节形态和管理孔隙度以提高催化效率和选择性。

2. 粘土由于其Lewis酸位点而被首选用于丙烷脱氢，而粘土支持物上的Brnsted酸位点促进了裂解反应。通过降低酸性或改变酸类型可以改善丙烯的选择性和稳定性，尽管这可能会降低催化活性。

3. 对于异质催化剂，反应物和产物的扩散效率由支持物的形态、结构、大小和化学性质决定。通过修改形态和孔隙度可以优化这一效率。

4. 例如，5.3 wt % CoOx/Al2O3薄片催化剂显示了如何通过形态调节影响催化性能。使用CoOx/SiO2-NMs展示了如何通过修改孔隙度同样可以增强效率。

5. Pt1 wt % Ga/SBA-15和0.4 wt % Pt0.3 wt % Sn/ZSM-5多级催化剂的例子说明了如何通过管理孔隙度来提高催化活性。
