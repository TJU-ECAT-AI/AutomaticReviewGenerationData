The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as acid strength, hydrothermal stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the chemical qualities determine the selectivity towards the targeted alkene, while morphological and porous characteristics affect diffusion efficiency. Strategies for support modification aim to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Acid strength adjustments can improve stability and selectivity towards propylene, whereas morphology and porosity regulation facilitate mass transport and reduce diffusion limitations. Mesoporous materials like SiO2 and Al2O3 are commonly used as supports. Sheet-shaped Al2O3 and single-atom Co supported on SiO2 nanomeshes enhance nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. Nanosized zeolites offer high diffusion efficiency due to short internal diffusion lengths. Finned zeolites improve mass transport through epitaxial growth methods. Hierarchical zeolites combine properties of microporous and mesoporous zeolites for fast transport and strong interactions with active catalytic phases.
