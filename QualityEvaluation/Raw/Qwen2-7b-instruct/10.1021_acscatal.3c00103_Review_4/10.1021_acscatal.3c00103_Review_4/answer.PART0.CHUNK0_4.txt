Physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and hydrothermal/pH stability, and morphological characteristics like porosity and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Acid strength affects the selectivity towards targeted alkenes, while morphological and porous qualities impact diffusion efficiency. Support modification strategies are employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Acidity adjustment helps balance Al2O3 acidity and inhibit deactivation. Morphology regulation facilitates mass transport and reduces diffusion limitations. Porosity regulation improves diffusion efficiency and stability. Adjusting the acid property of catalyst supports enhances stability and selectivity towards propylene. Developing nanosized supports and synthesizing supports with specific morphologies and high external surfaces enhances diffusion efficiency. Mesoporous and hierarchical zeolites serve as promising alternatives to traditional microporous zeolites to mitigate diffusion limitations.
