1. ODH, due to its favorable thermodynamics, holds potential for enhancing reaction efficiency. Low-temperature and highly selective catalysts are crucial for their industrial application in ODH reactions. Matching the right reaction temperature and active sites is essential.
2. Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of catalysts under reaction conditions is urgent. Operando/in situ characterization techniques, like XAFS, XRD, XPS, and E-TEM, are important tools. Establishing a universal relationship between catalyst structure and activity is pressing.
3. Developing methods for producing single atom catalysts with well-defined structures is a grand challenge. Techniques such as strong electrostatic adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and incipient wetness coimpregnation offer potential solutions for scale-up production.

1. 由于其有利的热力学性质，ODH具有提高反应效率的潜力。在ODH反应中应用低温和高选择性催化剂是关键方向。合适的反应温度和活性位点匹配至关重要。
2. 揭示催化剂在反应条件下的活性位点和机制非常重要。原位/就地表征技术，如XAFS、XRD、XPS和环境TEM（E-TEM）是重要工具。建立结构与活性之间的通用关系是紧迫任务。
3. 开发生产单原子催化剂的结构明确方法仍然是一个巨大的挑战。强静电吸附、电镀替代、顺序还原和浸渍共浸润等技术为大规模生产单原子催化剂提供了可能性。
