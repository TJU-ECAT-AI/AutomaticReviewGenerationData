[1] "In the direct comparisons in Fig. 9, there are 4 regions (A, B, C and D), and we can find that although CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts, in region B, show higher propylene formation rates, they suffer higher deactivation rates. Comparatively, some metal oxides in regions C and D such as InOx-based catalysts show relatively lower activity. Importantly, GaOx-based catalysts, in region A, show preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, and might be promising alternative PDH catalysts."
[2] "In order to inhibit the coke formation, which is significantly influenced by the valence states and dispersion structures, various strategies including oxidation state modulation, increasing dispersion, poisoning acid sites and cofeeding streams have been operated."
[3] "The roles remarkably depend on the kinds of supports. When the basicity is appropriate, CO2 can promote the occurrence of RWGS. However, when these basic sites in supports are extensively strong, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites. When there are no basic sites on supports, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are very weak."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as their acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Different catalysts exhibit varying deactivation rates and propylene formation rates based on these properties. For instance, CrOx- and VOx-based catalysts show higher propylene formation rates but suffer higher deactivation rates compared to InOx-based catalysts, which display lower activity. GaOx-based catalysts, on the other hand, exhibit preferable formation rates at lower deactivation rates, making them promising alternatives for PDH reactions. 

2. Strategies to optimize catalyst performance and selectivity include modulation of oxidation states, increasing dispersion, poisoning acid sites, and cofeeding streams. These methods can help inhibit coke formation and improve the stability of metal oxide-based catalysts.

3. The effectiveness of CO2 in promoting dehydrogenation depends on the type of support material. When the support material has appropriate basicity, CO2 can enhance the occurrence of RWGS. However, if the basic sites on the support are too strong, CO2 can irreversibly adsorb and poison these sites. When there are no basic sites on the support, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are minimal.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，如酸强度、稳定性以及形态，对脱氢反应性能有显著影响。不同催化剂在脱活速率和丙烯生成速率方面的表现各异。例如，CrOx-和VOx基催化剂显示出更高的丙烯生成速率，但同时脱活速率更高，相比之下，InOx基催化剂的活性较低。而GaOx基催化剂则在较低的脱活率下表现出更优的生成速率，可能成为PDH反应的有前景替代催化剂。

2. 优化催化剂性能和选择性的策略包括氧化状态调制、增加分散度、酸性位点中毒以及共喂流。这些方法可以有助于抑制焦炭形成并提高金属氧化物基催化剂的稳定性。

3. CO2在促进脱氢过程中的效果取决于支持材料的类型。当支持材料具有适当的碱性时，CO2可以增强原位水解反应的发生。然而，如果支持材料上的碱性位点太强，CO2可以不可逆地吸附并毒害这些位点。当支持材料上没有碱性位点时，CO2共喂流的效果很弱。
