The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is recognized as the rate-determining step that dictates catalyst activity. Propylene, being more active, is prone to undergo complex side reactions like further dehydrogenation and cracking. In the context of the literature, a PtSn bimetallic catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability, receiving the most extensive attention. The roles of tin (Sn) as a promoter are proposed through both geometric and electronic effects, impacting the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts. DFT calculations further elucidate the influence of Sn promoters on the dehydrogenation process. The performance of catalysts can be quantified by comparing propylene formation rates against deactivation rates, as shown in region A where higher rates and lower deactivation are observed, contrasting with region D, which indicates lower formation rates and higher deactivation.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括诸如酸强度和稳定性等化学特性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应性能有显著影响。例如，丙烷第一个C-H键的激活被确认为决定催化剂活性的关键步骤。丙烯由于其活性较高，容易经历进一步脱氢和裂解等复杂副反应。文献中提到，PtSn双金属催化剂在选择性和稳定性方面表现出良好的性能，并获得了最广泛的关注。关于锡（Sn）作为促进剂的作用，提出了几何效应和电子效应两种理论，这些效应影响了Pt基催化剂的脱氢活性和选择性。通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，进一步揭示了Sn促进剂对脱氢过程的影响。催化剂性能可以通过比较不同条件下丙烯生成速率与催化剂失活率来量化，如区域A显示较高的生成速率和较低的失活率，而区域D则表明较低的生成速率和更高的失活率。
