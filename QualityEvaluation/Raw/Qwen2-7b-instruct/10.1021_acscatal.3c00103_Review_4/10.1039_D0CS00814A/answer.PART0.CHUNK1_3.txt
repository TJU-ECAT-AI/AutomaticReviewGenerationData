The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, play a critical role in determining their performance during dehydrogenation reactions. To optimize these properties for better catalytic efficiency and selectivity, various support modification strategies are employed. These include increasing the dispersion of the active metal, manipulating the oxidation state of the metal, and introducing defects into the support material.
