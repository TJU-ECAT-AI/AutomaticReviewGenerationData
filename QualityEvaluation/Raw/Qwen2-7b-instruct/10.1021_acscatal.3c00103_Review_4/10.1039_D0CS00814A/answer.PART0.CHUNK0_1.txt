[1] "The active sites, reaction pathways and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable efficient catalyst design for minimizing the reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene."
[2] "The reaction of alkane molecules occurs at the CrO sites. However, compared with Pt, chromium oxide is more complex and it is difficult to explain the reaction and deactivation mechanism."
[3] "In terms of the fresh chrome oxide catalyst, there are a variety of chromium ions with different valence states, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, which play different roles in the PDH process."
[4] "Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactivation causes of chromium oxide. At the beginning of the reaction, the carbon rapidly accumulates on the chromium oxide surface."
[5] "By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned."
[6] "Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere can be the effective methods for generating Zrcus cations."
[7] "Over-reduction should be carefully avoided. For example, as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2 increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the blockage of the hydrogen recombination site."

1. The active sites, reaction pathways, and deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides, along with their dependent factors, are analyzed and discussed. This aids in designing efficient catalysts that minimize reaction barriers and control propylene selectivity.

2. Chromium oxide, while complex, plays a role in alkane dehydrogenation. However, explaining the reaction and deactivation mechanism is challenging due to its complexity compared to noble metals like Pt.

3. Fresh chrome oxide catalysts exhibit a range of chromium ions with varying valence states (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) that each play distinct roles in the PDH process.

4. Carbon deposition and aggregation of Cr3+ ions are key reasons for the deactivation of chromium oxide. Carbon quickly accumulates on the surface at the onset of the reaction, slowing the rate of carbon deposition.

5. Particle size and crystalline phase modifications can significantly adjust the concentration of Zrcus cations in zirconia, influencing its dehydrogenation activity.

6. Introducing dopants and subjecting the catalyst to a reductive atmosphere are effective strategies for generating Zrcus cations, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity.

7. Excessive reduction of zirconia catalysts should be avoided, as it can lead to propylene adsorption onto rhodium, blocking the hydrogen recombination site.

1. 对于金属和金属氧化物的活性位点、反应途径和脱活机制，以及它们依赖的因素进行分析和讨论。这有助于设计出能最小化反应障碍并控制丙烯选择性的高效催化剂。

2. 虽然铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢中发挥作用，但与贵金属如铂相比，其复杂性导致解释反应和脱活机制的难度较大。

3. 新鲜的铬氧化物催化剂包含多种不同电荷状态的铬离子（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+），这些离子在PDH过程中扮演着不同的角色。

4. 碳沉积和Cr3+的聚集是铬氧化物主要的脱活原因。反应开始时，碳迅速积累在铬氧化物表面，减慢了碳沉积速率。

5. 通过改变颗粒大小和晶相，可以显著调整锆酸盐中的Zrcus阳离子浓度，影响其脱氢活性。

6. 引入掺杂剂和使催化剂经历还原气氛是生成Zrcus阳离子的有效方法，从而增强脱氢活性。

7. 应避免过度还原锆酸盐催化剂，因为这可能导致丙烯吸附在铑上，阻塞氢重组位点。
