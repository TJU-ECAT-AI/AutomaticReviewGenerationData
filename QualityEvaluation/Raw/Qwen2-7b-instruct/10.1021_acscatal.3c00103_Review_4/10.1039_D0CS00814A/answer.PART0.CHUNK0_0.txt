2.1.1 Catofin process The Catofin process is C3C5 alkane dehydrogenation technology to produce olefins developed by the ABB Lummus company. The Catofin process is divided into four sections: reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propylene, reactor discharge compression, product recovery and refining units. The chromium/aluminum catalysts, whose components include chromium oxide with mass fractions greater than 18%, exhibit stable dehydrogenation performance, high conversion rates of alkanes and high propylene yields. The fixed bed reactor is operated in the form of hydrocarbon/hot air circulation. Before entering the catalyst bed, the hydrocarbons are preheated with hot air and react at 650 C and 0.5 bar. The selectivity of propylene is over 87%. Catofin has low requirements on raw material indexes, and the load lifting speed of the device is fast after each feeding. However, this technology has low efficiency and large energy consumption. Additionally, the frequent switching under high temperature conditions leads to the failure of the operating valve.

A heat generating material (HGM) is an innovative metal oxide-based material designed to significantly increase the selectivity and yield in the Catofin process. The HGM is loaded into the reactor bed together with the catalyst to undergo oxidation and reduction processes during the cycle operation, generating heat to drive the dehydrogenation reaction. It can not only increase propylene productivity, but also reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In 2012, the Catofin/HGM concept was demonstrated on a commercial scale in industrial Catofin installations.

2.1.2 Oleflex process The Honeywell UOP Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990. Oleflex uses a fully recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst and has low production costs, high returns on investment and low environmental footprints, and can convert propane-rich liquefied petroleum gas (C3 LPG) feedstock into chemical or polymer-grade propylene products. Recently, more efficient catalysts have been developed, such as the series of DeH catalysts, which further decrease the Pt loading and increase the propylene selectivity.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like particle size and shape, play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the Catofin process utilizes chromium/aluminum catalysts with high chromium oxide content for stable dehydrogenation, high alkane conversion, and high propylene yield. The fixed bed reactor's operation in a hydrocarbon/hot air circulation mode ensures efficient heat transfer and reaction conditions. The Oleflex process, on the other hand, employs a platinum-based alumina catalyst that offers low production costs, high returns on investment, and minimal environmental impact. The development of more efficient catalysts, such as the DeH catalyst series, further decreases the platinum loading while increasing propylene selectivity.

Support modification strategies to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity might include:
1. **Promoter Addition**: Incorporating metal promoters like tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), indium (In), gallium (Ga), vanadium (V), and titanium (Ti) can enhance the activity and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by altering the coordination environment and electronic state of the metal particles. Sn, in particular, can help separate Pt clusters, reducing the risk of coke formation and improving stability.
   
2. **Support Modification**: Using modified supports such as those containing alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) can poison strong acid sites on the catalyst, preventing coke deposition on the surface. Doping magnesium (Mg) into aluminum oxide (Al2O3) can form a stable spinel phase, which helps maintain activity by trapping Pt atoms and reducing coke formation. Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al atoms can anchor Pt atoms more effectively, enhancing stability.

3. **Oxide and Non-Oxide Supports**: Oxide supports like silicon dioxide (SiO2), ceria (CeO2), and zeolites can be used to create strong interactions with Pt or other metals, facilitating better dispersion and stability. Non-oxide supports like carbides and carbon materials can offer unique physical properties that hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, preventing coke deposition.

4. **Regeneration Strategies**: Controlled regeneration processes that prevent the sintering of Pt clusters and aggregation of chromium oxide can recover catalyst performance and extend operational life.

These strategies aim to balance activity, selectivity, and stability, while also addressing issues like coke formation and deactivation during the dehydrogenation and regeneration steps.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性等化学特性以及颗粒形状和大小等形态特性，在决定脱氢反应性能方面起着关键作用。例如，Catofin过程使用高氧化铬含量的铬/铝催化剂实现稳定脱氢、高烷烃转化率和高丙烯产率。固定床反应器在含碳氢化合物和热空气循环模式下的操作确保了有效的热传递和反应条件。而Oleflex过程则利用铂基氧化铝催化剂提供低生产成本、高投资回报和低环境影响，并能将富含丙烷的液化石油气（C3 LPG）原料转化为化学级或聚合物级丙烯产品。最近开发出的更高效的催化剂系列，如DeH催化剂，进一步降低了铂的负载量并提高了丙烯选择性。

优化这些属性以提高催化效率和选择性的支持修改策略可能包括：
1. **添加促进剂**：添加金属促进剂，如锡（Sn）、锌（Zn）、铜（Cu）、铁（Fe）、钴（Co）、锰（Mn）、铟（In）、镓（Ga）、钒（V）和钛（Ti），可以改变金属粒子的配位环境和电子状态，增强铂基催化剂的活性和选择性。特别是锡（Sn）可以通过分离铂簇，降低焦炭形成的风险，从而提高稳定性。
   
2. **支持改性**：在含有碱金属（Li、Na、K）的支持材料中使用，可以毒害催化剂上的强酸位点，防止焦炭沉积在表面。向氧化铝（Al2O3）中掺镁（Mg）可以形成稳定的尖晶石相，通过捕获铂原子减少焦炭形成。具有大量五配位Al原子的Al2O3纳米片可以更有效地锚定铂原子，增强稳定性。

3. **氧化物和支持非氧化物**：氧化物支持如二氧化硅（SiO2）、铈（CeO2）和沸石可以与铂或其他金属形成强烈相互作用，促进更好的分散性和稳定性。碳化物和碳材料等非氧化物支持材料提供独特的物理性质，可以阻止大分子烃类物质的形成，防止焦炭沉积。

4. **再生策略**：防止铂簇聚集和铬氧化物的聚集的受控再生过程可以恢复催化剂性能并延长使用寿命。

这些策略旨在平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，同时解决脱氢和再生步骤中的焦炭形成和失活问题。
