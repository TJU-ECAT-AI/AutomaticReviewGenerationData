[1] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."
[2] "The formation of methane, ethane, and ethylene indicates that cracking processes also occur under experimental conditions."
[3] "For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species."
[4] "It has been known that several properties of the support are crucial for charge transfer, such as its reducibility, conductivity, exposed crystal facets, morphology and defects."
[5] "As a design method for developing cost-reduced catalysts, core (nonprecious element)/shell structures where the Pt element is substituted with nonprecious elements have been widely used."

1. In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts decreases catalytic activity through two mechanisms: poisoning active sites or blocking pores, which limits reactant access.
2. Cracking processes occur in addition to dehydrogenation in PDH reactions, producing methane, ethane, and ethylene.
3. The activity of GaOx-based catalysts for PDH depends significantly on the structure of Ga species.
4. The properties of the support, such as reducibility, conductivity, crystal facets, morphology, and defects, play a crucial role in charge transfer.
5. Core-shell structures, substituting the Pt element with nonprecious elements, are widely used as a cost-effective design method for catalysts.

1. 在PDH反应中，Pt基催化剂上的结焦行为通过两种机制降低催化活性：毒化活性位点或由于孔隙被焦炭部分或完全堵塞限制反应物的接近。
2. 在PDH反应中，除脱氢作用外，还会发生裂解过程，产生甲烷、乙烷和乙烯。
3. GaOx基催化剂的PDH活性依赖于Ga物种的结构。
4. 支撑材料的可还原性、导电性、晶面暴露、形态和缺陷等属性对电荷传递至关重要。
5. 作为开发成本较低催化剂的设计方法，核心（非贵金属元素）/壳结构，通过替换Pt元素为非贵金属元素，被广泛使用。
