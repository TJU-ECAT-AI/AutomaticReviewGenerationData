The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as the acid strength and stability of the catalyst support affect its ability to activate the CH bonds of propane efficiently. Morphologically, the size and crystalline phase of the catalyst can impact the concentration of active sites and the stability during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes. Support modification strategies, such as tuning the particle size and crystalline phase, can optimize these properties. For instance, increasing the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites on Ga2O3 enhances its activity. Similarly, adjusting the particle size and crystalline phase of zirconia can tune the concentration of Zrcus cations, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation process. To optimize catalyst performance, it is essential to balance the chemical qualities of the support and the morphological characteristics of the catalyst, focusing on enhancing stability and activity during the dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles.
