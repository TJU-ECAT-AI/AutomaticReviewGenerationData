[1] "Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be different dehydrogenation active sites. For GaOx-based catalysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure of Ga species."
[2] "For VOx-based catalysts, due to their various VO bonds, there are different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers."
[3] "Increasing the Cr6+ concentration from 0.78 to 1.68% caused simultaneous increases of the C1C3 yield from 2.3 to 3.3% and the coke yield from 2.81 to 3.8% (Fig. 16b)."
[4] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the form of the species. Deactivation is low for single VOx sites but increases with increasing degree of aggregation of VOx species with increasing VOV bonds."
[5] "For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, Cr-containing species on the surfaces of the supported catalysts undergo multiple redox cycles."

1. The activity for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on GaOx-based catalysts depends heavily on the structure of Ga species. 
2. VOx-based catalysts exhibit different CH activation and propylene desorption energy barriers due to their various VO bonds.
3. Increasing the Cr6+ concentration in catalysts led to an increase in the yield of C1C3 compounds and coke formation.
4. The form of VOx species changes with the surface area-to-metal loading ratio, affecting deactivation rates.
5. Supported Cr-containing species on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts undergo multiple redox cycles under reaction conditions.

1. GaOx基催化剂的PDH活性很大程度上取决于Ga物种的结构。
2. VOx基催化剂由于其各种VO键，显示出不同的CH活化和丙烯脱氢能垒。
3. 增加Cr6+浓度导致C1C3产物产率从2.3%增加到3.3%，焦炭产率从2.81%增加到3.8%。
4. VOx物种的形式随着表面积与金属负载比的变化而变化，影响着失活率。
5. Cr含物种在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂表面进行多次氧化还原周期。
