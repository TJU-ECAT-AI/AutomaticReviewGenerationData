The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the activation of the first CH bond of propane acts as the rate-determining step for catalyst activity. Propylene, being more active, can undergo complex side reactions like further dehydrogenation and cracking. Transition metals with unsaturated d orbitals and metal oxides with Lewis acid MO sites are known for their PDH reactivity due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and low activity toward CC cleavage. Over the past several decades, various heterogeneous catalysts, including metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts, and non-oxide-based catalysts, have been utilized for direct PDH reactions. Metal oxides, in particular, can effectively activate propane CH bonds through their Lewis acid MO sites.

Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these physicochemical properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These strategies might include doping to increase the number of coordinatively unsaturated sites, altering the particle size and crystalline phase to tune the concentration of specific active sites, and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere to generate desirable active sites. These modifications aim to enhance the activity, stability, and selectivity of the catalysts, ultimately leading to improved performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，显著影响脱氢反应中的性能。具体而言，丙烷第一个C-H键的激活被认为是催化剂活性的决定性步骤。由于丙烯更为活泼，可以更容易地进行复杂的副反应，如进一步脱氢和裂解。过渡金属中未饱和的d轨道和金属氧化物中的Lewis酸MO位点因其对烷基C-H键的亲和力以及对C-C键断裂的低活性而表现出PDH反应性。过去几十年来，各种异质催化剂，包括金属基催化剂、金属氧化物基催化剂和非氧化物基催化剂，被用于直接PDH反应。特别是金属氧化物可以通过其Lewis酸MO位点有效地激活丙烷C-H键。

为了优化这些物理化学性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采取支持修改策略。这些策略可能包括掺杂以增加特定活性位点的数量，改变颗粒尺寸和晶相以调整特定活性位点的浓度，并用还原气氛进行预处理以生成所需的活性位点。这些修改旨在增强催化剂的活性、稳定性和选择性，最终导致脱氢反应性能的改善。
