[1] "The results clearly show that the interactions between the platinum and the support are mutual, i.e., that the support affects the properties of the platinum and that, at the same time, the properties of the support are influenced by the platinum."
[2] "The changes in the electronic properties of the supported platinum crystallites are evidenced by the shifts of the Pt binding energy in XPS and of the stretching frequency of linearly adsorbed CO. The changes depend on the catalyst acidities: the shifts are increased with increasing concentration of the acid sites."
[3] "At the same time, the acidic properties of the supports are affected by platinum, as indicated by the redistribution of the acid site strengths and the changes in the product selectivities in the ring opening of decalin."
[4] "When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts."
[5] "The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties can be optimized through support modification strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including the electronic properties of the metal clusters and the acid strengths of the supports, are mutually influenced. The electronic properties of the supported metal crystallites are altered by the support, leading to changes in the stretching frequency of adsorbed CO and the Pt binding energy in XPS. The concentration of acid sites on the support affects these changes, with higher acid site concentrations leading to greater shifts.

3. The acidic properties of the supports are also influenced by the presence of the supported metal crystallites. The redistribution of the acid site strengths and changes in the product selectivities in the ring opening of decalin reactions indicate that the metal crystallites affect the acid strength of the supports.

4. Impregnating zeolites and HMCM-41 with platinum significantly reduces the strength of their acid sites. Virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts, indicating a mutual modification of the acid sites by the supported metal.

5. The introduction of platinum into the zeolites suppresses the extent of cracking reactions and alters the cracking selectivity. This is explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites, which are crucial for cracking reactions.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，显著影响脱氢反应的性能。这些性质可以通过支持修改策略优化来提高催化效率和选择性。

2. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括支持上金属簇的电子特性和支持的酸强度，是相互影响的。支持上的金属簇的存在改变了金属簇的电子性质，导致吸附CO的伸缩频率变化和XPS中Pt结合能的变化。酸位点的浓度影响这些变化，较高的酸位点浓度导致更大的偏移。

3. 支持的酸性质也受到支持上金属簇的影响。酸位点分布的重新分配和环开裂反应产物选择性的变化表明，金属簇会影响支持的酸强度。

4. 将沸石和HMCM-41浸渍在铂中显著降低了它们的酸强度。几乎没有任何最强的酸位点存在于铂修饰催化剂中，这表明酸位点通过支持金属被修改。

5. 在沸石中引入铂抑制了裂解反应的强度，并改变了裂解选择性。这是由酸位点强度降低引起的，酸位点对于裂解反应至关重要。
