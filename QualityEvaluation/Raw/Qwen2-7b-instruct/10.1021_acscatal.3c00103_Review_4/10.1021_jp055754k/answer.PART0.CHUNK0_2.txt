[1] "Metalsupport interactions have been investigated by means of XPS, CO and pyridine adsorption, H2 and NH3 TPD, and a model reaction (ring opening of decalin) on a series of platinum-modified catalysts of different acidities."
[2] "The results clearly show that the interactions between the platinum and the support are mutual, i.e., that the support affects the properties of the platinum and that, at the same time, the properties of the support are influenced by the platinum."
[3] "When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts."
[4] "The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well."
[5] "The interatomic potential model,20 proposed to describe metalsupport interactions, was examined in this study to determine whether it can be used to account for the changes in the support acidity due to the metal."

1. Physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the reactivity and selectivity towards desired products. Optimizing these properties can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. Strategies for modifying the support include adjusting the acidity of the support, altering the surface area, controlling the pore size, and managing the distribution of acid sites to better match the reaction requirements. These modifications can lead to improved catalyst performance.

3. Impregnation of zeolites and HMCM-41 with platinum leads to a significant reduction in the strength of the acid sites. Virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts.

4. The reduction in acid site strength suppresses the extent of cracking reactions and alters the cracking selectivity in Pt-modified catalysts. This can be explained by the diminished ability of the catalyst to facilitate the required chemical transformations.

5. The interatomic potential model can account for changes in support acidity due to the presence of metal, as alterations in the electron charge of the support oxygen atoms lead to changes in the interatomic potential of the metal valence orbitals, affecting the acidity of the support.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性以及形貌特征，影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，通过影响目标产物的反应性和选择性。优化这些性质可以提高催化效率和选择性。

2. 支持修改策略包括调整支持的酸度、控制表面积、管理孔径大小和酸基团分布，以更好地匹配反应需求。这些修改可以改善催化剂性能。

3. 将铂浸渍到沸石和HMCM-41中导致酸基团强度显著降低。几乎没有任何最强的酸基团存在于铂改性催化剂中。

4. 酸基团强度的减少抑制了裂解反应的量并改变了裂解选择性在铂改性催化剂中。这可以通过减少催化剂促进所需化学转化的能力来解释。

5. 由于金属的存在，支持酸度的变化可以通过改变支持氧原子的电子电荷，进而改变金属价电子轨道的相互作用势能，从而影响支持的酸度，由此可以说明间原子势模型。
