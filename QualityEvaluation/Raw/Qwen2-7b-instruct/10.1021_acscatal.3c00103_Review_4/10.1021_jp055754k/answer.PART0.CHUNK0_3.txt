<p>The changes in the electronic properties of the supported platinum crystallites are evidenced by the shifts of the Pt binding energy in XPS and of the stretching frequency of linearly adsorbed CO. The changes depend on the catalyst acidities: the shifts are increased with increasing concentration of the acid sites.</p>
<p>When the zeolites and HMCM-41 are impregnated with Pt, the strength of their acid sites is significantly reduced: virtually none of the strongest acid sites are present in the Pt-modified catalysts. The extent of the cracking reactions is suppressed, and the cracking selectivity is altered in the Pt-modified catalysts, which can be explained by the reduced strength of the acid sites as well.</p>

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting their reactivity, selectivity, and stability. Morphological characteristics like pore size and shape can dictate how reactants access the active sites. Chemical qualities, particularly acid strength, play a crucial role in facilitating reactions like dehydrogenation by providing sites for proton transfer.

2. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, one strategy involves modifying the support material. This can be done by adjusting the acidity of the support, which influences the reactivity of the catalyst. For instance, the study shows that introducing platinum into zeolites reduces the strength of their acid sites, leading to decreased cracking activity and altered product selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. Thus, support modification strategies aim to fine-tune the support properties to better match the requirements of the catalytic process.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特性，通过影响其反应性、选择性和稳定性来影响脱氢反应的性能。形态特性如孔径和形状决定了反应物如何接近活性位点。化学特性，特别是酸强度，对于促进脱氢反应至关重要，因为它们提供了一种进行质子转移的途径。

2. 为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，一种策略是修改支撑材料。这可以通过调整支持的酸度来完成，这会影响催化剂的活性。例如，研究表明，在沸石中引入铂会显著降低其酸强度，导致裂解活动减少和脱氢反应产物选择性的改变。因此，支持修改策略旨在精确调整支持的性质，以更好地满足催化过程的要求。
