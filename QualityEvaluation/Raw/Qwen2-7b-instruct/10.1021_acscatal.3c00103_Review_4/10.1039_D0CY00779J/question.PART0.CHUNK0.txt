Unmodified bulk alumina as an efficient catalyst for propane dehydrogenation A series of unmodified bulk Al2O3 materials show an intrinsic activity for selectively catalyzing propane dehydrogenation. The Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst shows the highest yield, which delivers an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%.
Propylene production is essential to the modern chemical industry, because it is an important industrial raw material for producing many chemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene. The steam cracking of oil-based naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional ways for the manufacture of propylene. Nevertheless, these two processes suffer from high-energy demand and low selectivity toward propylene, and it is thus highly desirable to develop new technologies for the production of propylene.1 In this regard, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane becomes an alternative route for future propylene production.2 Propane dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique affording high selectivity to propylene. Moreover, the great success achieved in the exploitation of shale gas supplies a large amount of propane at a low price. Therefore, the development of an efficient technology for the propane dehydrogenation process has attracted worldwide interest in both fundamental research and industrial application.
Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been successfully commercialized for propane dehydrogenation, but the high cost of Pt and toxicity of Cr have significantly limited their further applications.3 Therefore, much attention has been paid to the development of economically viable and eco-friendly catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The progress already made in this area confirms that metal oxide materials are able to activate the CH bond in alkanes for the dehydrogenation reaction, due to their inherent Lewis acidity in the metal center and basicity in the oxygen center.48 Over the years, a wide variety of non-noble metal oxide-based catalysts, such as Ga2O3, ZnO, FeOx, VOx, CoOx and SnO2 in the form of supported or bulk structures, have shown excellent catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, which provides a new possibility for updating the current commercialized catalysts.915 Al2O3 is known as one of the most conventional inorganic materials with a wide range of applications in many areas. In this study, bulk Al2O3 materials (γ-Al2O3-100, γ-Al2O3-200 and θ-Al2O3-90) with different crystalline structures (Fig. S1) and textural properties (Fig. S2 and Table S1)16,17 in the absence of any modification or doping are used as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, and the active site responsible for the catalytic cycle is revealed.
It is well-known that Al2O3 is a kind of typical acid catalyst, and thus the NH3-TPD measurement was performed on these samples (Fig. 1). The desorption peaks in the ranges of 50250 C, 250330 C, and 330600 C in the NH3-TPD profiles are usually assigned to NH3 which is chemisorbed on weak, moderate and strong acid sites, respectively.18 According to the NH3 desorption temperature, a majority of weak acid sites exist in γ-Al2O3-100 and θ-Al2O3-90, and a high level of strong acid sites is observable in γ-Al2O3-200.

The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement. The band at around 1450 cm1 is regarded as the pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites, and the band at around 1540 cm1 is considered as the pyridine adsorbed on the Brnsted acid sites.19 As shown in Fig. S3 and S4, only the band ascribed to the pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites is detected in these Al2O3 catalysts. As confirmed in previous studies, the formation of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 is mainly due to the defective AIII site in the structure.4,7,20,21 The calculated acid site distribution in these samples is given in Table 1, and γ-Al2O3 possesses more Lewis acid sites than θ-Al2O3. The evident absorption peaks at 3780 cm1 are observable in the IR spectra of the Al2O3 dehydrated at 700 C (Fig. S5), and these bands are assigned to the defective AIII site which brings about the formation of Lewis acid sites.22 Table 1 Amounts of acid sites in the Al2O3 catalysts estimated from the Py-FTIR measurement Samples Amount of Lewis acid sites (μmol g1)
200 C 300 C
θ-Al2O3-90 33.6 13.4 γ-Al2O3-200 76.8 33.1 γ-Al2O3-100 61.8 20.8 These three Al2O3 samples were studied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 630 C, and the catalytic results are shown in Fig. 2. In fact, these unmodified Al2O3 catalysts are intrinsically active in propane dehydrogenation. Among these three samples, γ-Al2O3 exhibits higher activity than θ-Al2O3. α-Al2O3 was also investigated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (Fig. S6), and it shows low performance in the reaction. The low activity in α-Al2O3 is mainly due to its highly crystalline structure with few defective AIII sites. Evidently, an induction period from 1 to 4 hours is discovered in all the Al2O3 catalysts, during which a slow increase of propane conversion is detectable. The slight increase of propane conversion over these catalysts can be attributed to the reconstruction of the Al2O3 structure at the high reaction temperature. The propane conversions achieved after the induction period over γ-Al2O3-200, γ-Al2O3-100 and θ-Al2O3-90 are 47.5%, 40% and 32%, respectively. The propane conversion decreases gradually after the propane conversion reaches the highest level. The final activity after 24 hours of these three Al2O3 catalysts follows the order γ-Al2O3-200 > γ-Al2O3-100 > θ-Al2O3-90. About 35% propane conversion is maintained over γ-Al2O3-200 after 24 hours, whereas only about 18% propane conversion is maintained over θ-Al2O3-90. The propylene selectivity of these samples increases in the initial stage and then becomes quite stable in the time-on-stream reaction. The by-products formed in the reaction are methane, ethane and ethylene (Fig. S7S9), which come from the cracking of propane. A higher selectivity of 88% is achieved for the γ-Al2O3-100 and θ-Al2O3-90 catalysts, while a lower selectivity of 83% is obtained for the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst.

The results above indicate that the Lewis acid site could be the active site for the propane dehydrogenation. To confirm the important role of Lewis acid sites in the propane dehydrogenation, a typical ZSM-5 sample with a high level of Brnsted acid sites but a low level of Lewis acid sites (325 μmol g1 Brnsted acid sites and 22 μmol g1 Lewis acid sites at 200 C; 241 μmol g1 Brnsted acid sites and 10 μmol g1 Lewis acid sites at 300 C) was studied in propane dehydrogenation. The catalytic results show that the propylene selectivity of the ZSM-5 zeolite is only about 37% (Fig. S10), which is much lower than that achieved over Al2O3. The main products over the ZSM-5 zeolite are methane, ethane and ethylene, which come from the cracking of propane. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Brnsted acid sites mainly lead to the cracking of propane, while the Lewis acid sites mainly result in the dehydrogenation of propane. The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3).

These Al2O3 catalysts undergo a certain level of deactivation, and thus the regenerability is of vital importance for their practical applications. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst which exhibits the highest yield was further studied to determine its regenerability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Indeed, the loss of activity is due to the coke formation at the high reaction temperature, and therefore the deactivated catalyst was recovered by a simple calcination process at 550 C for 6 h in a flow of air. As shown in Fig. 4, the deactivation is reversible in this catalyst. The propane conversion decreases a little bit in the first cycle, in comparison to that in the fresh catalyst. Nevertheless, the propane conversion can be completely restored in the following two cycles. The selectivity in each cycle remains unaltered, and no loss of selectivity is observed (Fig. S11). Therefore, it can be concluded that the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst is regenerable in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, which allows it to be a sustainable catalyst for industrial application.

The in situ IR of propane adsorbed on the Al2O3 samples was carried out in order to elucidate the propane activation and transformation mechanism. The IR spectra of propane adsorbed on each catalyst are shown in Fig. 5, S12 and S13. In Fig. 5, strong absorption bands at 30002800 cm1 are observable in the IR spectra: the bands at 2871 and 2980 cm1 assigned to νas(CH) and νs(CH) of methyl, the absorption band at 2903 cm1 ascribed to 2δs (CH3), and the band at 2874 cm1 corresponding to ν(CH) of the methylene group.23,24 These absorption bands remained almost unchanged when the sample was heated to high temperatures of 100 and 150 C. Therefore, it can be inferred that propane is chemically adsorbed rather than physically adsorbed at the surface of Al2O3. As confirmed in previous reports, alkanes can be activated at the surface defective AlIII sites which results in Lewis acid sites in the Al2O3 structure, and surface AlIV-alkyl species can be formed in the activation step.4,5,7 Our study results suggest that the propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites, so it is believed that the propane dehydrogenation takes place at the surface defective AlIII site. Py-FTIR and AlOH FTIR characterization verified that there is a certain amount of low coordination number AIII in the Al2O3 structure, and these unsaturated AIII sites are able to activate alkanes at low temperature. Based on the results above, it can be reasonably inferred that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, which leads to the formation of the corresponding AlIVC3H7 surface species.

In fact, the fundamental understanding of the alkane dehydrogenation over oxide catalysts from the theoretical calculation consideration has been carried out by several groups, and two typical surface mechanisms (concerted and stepwise pathways) were proposed for this reaction.7 The concerted pathway suggests that the olefin formation is generated in a single step, whereas the stepwise pathway indicates that the olefin formation takes place via sequential abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the alkane reactant. In these two possible reaction mechanisms, the surface alkyl group can be formed only in the stepwise pathway. In our in situ IR experiment, the AlIVC3H7 surface species is observable which is formed through the activation of the CH bond in propane on the Lewis AlIII site. Therefore, a hypothesis is reasonable that the propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 occurs via the stepwise pathway. Scheme 1 shows the proposed reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3. In the initial step, a single CH bond in propane breaks occurring through the abstraction of a proton by a surface oxygen atom, which leads to the propyl group bonding to the surface aluminum to give an AlIVC3H7 surface species. Next, the β-hydrogen elimination from AlIVC3H7 results in the generation of H2 and propylene. As confirmed in our study, the AlIVC3H7 surface species can be formed at a low temperature. Thus, the CH bond activation is a kinetically favorable process, which indicates that the β-hydrogen elimination rather than the CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process.
Scheme 1 Proposed reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over the Al2O3 catalyst.
Al2O3, as one of the most conventional inorganic materials, was studied in the propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. This economically viable and eco-friendly material without any modification exhibits high performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The Lewis acid site arising from the defective AlIII site is the active site responsible for the catalytic cycle. The studied Al2O3 catalysts deliver high propane conversion and propylene selectivity, and their catalytic performances can be fully restored in each catalytic cycle. The high catalytic performance and good regenerability enable the unmodified Al2O3-based material to be a promising catalyst for the practical application in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
