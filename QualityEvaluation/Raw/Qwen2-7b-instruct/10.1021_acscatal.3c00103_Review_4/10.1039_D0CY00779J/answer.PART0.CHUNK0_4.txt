[1] "γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst shows the highest yield, which delivers an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%."
[2] "The nature and amount of acid sites in these Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated by Py-FTIR measurement."
[3] "Only the band ascribed to the pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites is detected in these Al2O3 catalysts."
[4] "The Lewis acid site arising from the defective AIII site in the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle."
[5] "The results above indicate that the Lewis acid site could be the active site for the propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The in situ IR of propane adsorbed on the Al2O3 samples was carried out in order to elucidate the propane activation and transformation mechanism."
[7] "Strong absorption bands at 30002800 cm−1 are observable in the IR spectra: the bands at 2871 and 2980 cm−1 assigned to νas(CH) and νs(CH) of methyl, the absorption band at 2903 cm−1 ascribed to 2δs (CH3), and the band at 2874 cm−1 corresponding to ν(CH) of the methylene group."
[8] "Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, which leads to the formation of the corresponding AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[9] "In the initial step, a single CH bond in propane breaks occurring through the abstraction of a proton by a surface oxygen atom, which leads to the propyl group bonding to the surface aluminum to give an AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[10] "Next, the β-hydrogen elimination from AlIVC3H7 results in the generation of H2 and propylene."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the presence of Lewis acid sites derived from defective AlIII sites in Al2O3 catalysts acts as the active site for the catalytic cycle, contributing to high propane conversion and propylene selectivity. These catalysts demonstrate high performance and regenerability, making them promising for practical application in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The in situ infrared spectroscopy reveals that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, forming AlIVC3H7 surface species, which then undergo β-hydrogen elimination to produce propylene. The optimized physicochemical properties of Al2O3 catalysts, such as the concentration of Lewis acid sites, enable efficient and selective dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。具体来说，Al2O3催化剂中来源于缺陷AlIII位点的路易斯酸中心作为催化循环的活性位点，促进了高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。这些催化剂表现出高效率和可再生性，使其在丙烷脱氢反应中具有潜在的实用价值。原位红外光谱表明，丙烷在缺陷AlIII位点被激活，形成AlIVC3H7表面物种，随后通过β氢消除产生丙烯。优化Al2O3催化剂的物理化学性质，如Lewis酸中心的浓度，能够实现高效的和选择性的脱氢反应。
