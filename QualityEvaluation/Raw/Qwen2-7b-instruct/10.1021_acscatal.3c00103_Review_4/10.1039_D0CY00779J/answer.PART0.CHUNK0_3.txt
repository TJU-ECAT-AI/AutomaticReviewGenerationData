The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The active site identified as the Lewis acid site, derived from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure, plays a crucial role in the catalytic cycle. The γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher activity compared to other Al2O3 samples. The catalytic cycle's efficiency is influenced by the amount of Lewis acid sites present in the catalyst. The Lewis acid sites, not Brnsted acid sites, are primarily responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propylene. The in situ IR spectroscopy of propane adsorbed on Al2O3 samples provided insights into the activation and transformation mechanism, revealing that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, forming AlIVC3H7 surface species through a stepwise pathway. This understanding helps in optimizing catalyst properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是酸强度和稳定性等化学特性以及形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。在氧化铝结构中不饱和的AlIII位点产生的Lewis酸中心是催化循环的关键活性位点。γ-Al2O3催化剂表现出比其他Al2O3样品更高的活性。催化循环的效率受催化剂中Lewis酸位点数量的影响。Lewis酸位点而不是Brnsted酸位点主要负责丙烷的脱氢作用，从而形成丙烯。通过原位红外光谱研究了吸附在氧化铝样品上的丙烷，提供了激活和转化机制的见解，表明丙烷在缺陷的AlIII位点上被激活，形成了AlIVC3H7表面物种，通过步进路径发生。这种理解有助于优化催化剂性质以提高脱氢反应中的催化效率和选择性。
