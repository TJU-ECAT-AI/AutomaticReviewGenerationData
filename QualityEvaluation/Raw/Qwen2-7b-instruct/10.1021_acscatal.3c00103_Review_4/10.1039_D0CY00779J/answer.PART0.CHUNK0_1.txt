1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including the chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by determining the availability and reactivity of active sites. For instance, the Lewis acid site arising from the unsaturated AlIII site in the Al2O3 structure acts as the active site for the catalytic cycle. The γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst demonstrates the highest yield, achieving an initial conversion of 48% and selectivity of 83%. This highlights the significant impact of specific acid site properties on catalytic efficiency.

2. The investigation of the nature and amount of acid sites within Al2O3 catalysts through Py-FTIR measurement aids in understanding the role of these sites in the catalytic process. The findings suggest that the Lewis acid sites play a crucial role in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, contributing to the high performance of these catalysts.

3. By examining the in situ IR spectra of propane adsorbed on Al2O3 samples, researchers can elucidate the propane activation and transformation mechanism. This provides insights into how the catalysts interact with reactants at the molecular level, further supporting the optimization of catalyst properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，影响脱氢反应的性能，这决定了活性位点的可用性和反应性。例如，Al2O3结构中未饱和AlIII位点产生的Lewis酸中心是催化循环的活性位点。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂显示出最高的产率，初始转化率为48%，选择性为83%，这表明特定酸位性质对催化效率有重大影响。

2. 通过Py-FTIR测量研究Al2O3催化剂中的酸位的性质和数量，有助于理解这些位点在催化过程中的作用。研究结果表明，Lewis酸位在丙烷脱氢反应中起关键作用，从而支持这些催化剂的高性能。

3. 通过分析吸附在Al2O3样品上的丙烷的原位红外光谱，研究人员可以阐明丙烷激活和转换机制。这提供了关于催化剂与反应物分子级相互作用的见解，进一步支持优化催化剂性质以提高催化效率和选择性。
