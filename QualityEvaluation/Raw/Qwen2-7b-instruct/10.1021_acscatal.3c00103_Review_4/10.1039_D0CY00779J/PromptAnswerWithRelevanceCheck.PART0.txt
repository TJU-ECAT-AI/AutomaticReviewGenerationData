[1] "Among these three samples, γ-Al2O3 exhibits higher activity than θ-Al2O3."
[2] "The low activity in α-Al2O3 is mainly due to its highly crystalline structure with few defective AIII sites."
[3] "The results above indicate that the Lewis acid site could be the active site for the propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Therefore, it can be concluded that the Brnsted acid sites mainly lead to the cracking of propane, while the Lewis acid sites mainly result in the dehydrogenation of propane."
[5] "The propane conversion rate is positively linked to the amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3, which also indicates that the Lewis acid sites could be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The deactivation is reversible in this catalyst. The propane conversion decreases a little bit in the first cycle, in comparison to that in the fresh catalyst."
[7] "Based on the results above, it can be reasonably inferred that propane is activated at the defective AlIII sites, which leads to the formation of the corresponding AlIVC3H7 surface species."
[8] "Therefore, a hypothesis is reasonable that the propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 occurs via the stepwise pathway."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study demonstrates that the Lewis acid site arising from the defective AlIII site within the Al2O3 structure is the active site for the catalytic cycle. Specifically, γ-Al2O3, with a higher density of Lewis acid sites, exhibits superior activity compared to θ-Al2O3. The presence of fewer defective AIII sites in α-Al2O3 leads to its lower activity. The conversion rate of propane is positively correlated with the amount of Lewis acid sites, indicating that these sites are the key active sites for the dehydrogenation process. The regeneration of the γ-Al2O3-200 catalyst after deactivation confirms its high regenerability, suggesting that it is a promising catalyst for practical applications. The in situ IR experiment supports the hypothesis that propane dehydrogenation over Al2O3 occurs via the stepwise pathway, involving the activation of the CH bond and subsequent β-hydrogen elimination to produce propylene.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性和形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能起着关键作用。研究表明，铝酸盐结构中缺陷的AlIII位点产生的路易斯酸中心是催化循环的活性位点。具体而言，γ-Al2O3由于具有更高密度的路易斯酸中心表现出优于θ-Al2O3的活性。α-Al2O3中较少的缺陷AIII位点导致其活性较低。丙烷转化率与路易斯酸中心的数量正相关，表明这些位点是脱氢过程的关键活性位点。γ-Al2O3-200催化剂在失活后的可再生性证实了其高度可再生性，表明它有可能在实际应用中使用。原位IR实验支持了以下假设：丙烷在铝酸盐上的脱氢通过逐步途径发生，涉及CH键的活化和随后的β氢消除，以产生丙烯。

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the presence of Lewis acid sites and the morphology of the material, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with more Lewis acid sites tend to exhibit higher activity and selectivity. Morphologically, catalysts with fewer crystalline structures and more defective AIII sites show improved catalytic efficiency.

2. Modification strategies can optimize catalyst properties by enhancing the number of Lewis acid sites or altering the morphology of the material. For instance, introducing defects into the crystal structure increases the surface area available for chemical reactions, thereby improving the catalyst's performance.

3. The Lewis acid site is identified as the active site responsible for the catalytic cycle in propane dehydrogenation, indicating its crucial role in the reaction mechanism.

4. In situ infrared spectroscopy is utilized to understand the activation and transformation mechanism of alkanes on oxide catalyst surfaces. This technique helps in elucidating how the catalyst activates alkanes and transforms them into olefins.

5. It is hypothesized that propane dehydrogenation occurs at the defective AlIII sites, where the CH bond activation leads to the formation of AlIVC3H7 surface species. Subsequently, β-hydrogen elimination results in the generation of H2 and propylene.

6. The concerted pathway proposes the formation of olefins in a single step, while the stepwise pathway suggests sequential abstraction of hydrogen atoms. Both pathways involve the formation of surface alkyl groups, which is observed in the in situ IR experiment.

7. Kinetic studies reveal that CH bond activation is a favorable process, suggesting that β-hydrogen elimination is the rate-determining step in the propane transformation process. This insight guides the development of more efficient catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.
