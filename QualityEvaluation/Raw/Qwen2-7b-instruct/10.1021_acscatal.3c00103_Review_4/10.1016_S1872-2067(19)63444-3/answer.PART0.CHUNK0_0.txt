[1] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "Morphological characteristics, like the surface area and pore size distribution, also play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity."
[3] "Modification strategies often involve adjusting the catalyst's composition, modifying its surface through deposition of metal clusters, or changing the support material to enhance its properties."
[4] "For instance, adding promoters can improve acid strength, while altering the support can affect the catalyst's stability and activity."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as surface area and pore size distribution, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies, which may include adjusting the catalyst's composition, depositing metal clusters on the surface, or changing the support material, are employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
