The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as particle size and shape, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties, typically by adjusting the catalyst surface area, modifying the metal composition, or changing the support material. These modifications aim to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.
