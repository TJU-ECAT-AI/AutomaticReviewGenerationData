The physicochemical properties of catalysts, which encompass their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, as well as their morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in determining their performance during dehydrogenation reactions. These properties affect how effectively the catalysts can facilitate the breaking of bonds in molecules, leading to the production of hydrogen. To enhance the efficiency and selectivity of these reactions, modification strategies can be implemented to optimize the aforementioned properties.
