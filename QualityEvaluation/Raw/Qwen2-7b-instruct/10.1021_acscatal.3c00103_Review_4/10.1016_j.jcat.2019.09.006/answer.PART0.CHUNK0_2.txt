<p>The studies of C1C3 alkane activation and conversion on acid-form BEA and ZSM-5 zeolites, loaded with both zinc oxide species and isolated Zn2+ cations, assumed the importance of the former Zn-sites, however, possible influence of latter ones cannot be excluded.</p>

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine how effectively the catalyst activates the reactants and facilitates the desired reaction pathways. Morphological characteristics, such as the size, shape, and distribution of active sites, impact the accessibility and reactivity of the reactants. Modification strategies that optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity often involve adjusting the catalyst's composition, morphology, and operating conditions. For instance, modifying the type of metal species or adjusting the support material can alter the acidity and stability of the catalyst, leading to improved performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Both isolated Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters contribute to the synergistic action with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) for propane CH bond activation. They both accelerate the H/D exchange reaction, leading to a significant increase in the rate constant and a reduction in activation energy compared to pure acid-form zeolites. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher, indicating that both types of Zn species play crucial roles in enhancing the catalytic activity of the zeolite catalysts.

3. The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane is observed for both Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters. This suggests that both species are involved in the activation process that leads to preferential deuteration of the methyl groups. However, the mechanism of this regioselectivity differs between Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites. For Zn2+/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is maintained throughout the entire reaction, while for ZnO/H-BEA, it is only observed during the initial induction period before the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange.

4. The involvement of the methylene group in the H/D exchange process is attributed to several sequential steps. First, propylene accumulates during the induction period. Next, due to the weaker coordination of propylene to ZnO species, it migrates to BAS and forms isopropyl cations as equilibrated isopropoxy species. Subsequently, a fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling occurs in the isopropyl cation through a 1,2-hydride shift reaction. Finally, an intermolecular hydride transfer reaction between the isopropyl cation and deuterated propane facilitates the transfer of protium into the methylene group of the alkane, explaining the involvement of the methylene group in the exchange process.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质决定了催化剂如何有效地激活反应物并促进所需反应途径。形态特征，如活性位点的大小、形状和分布，影响反应物的可达性和反应性。优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性的修改策略通常涉及调整催化剂的组成、形态和操作条件。例如，通过改变金属物种或调整支持材料可以改变催化剂的酸性和稳定性，从而提高脱氢反应的性能。

2. 隔离的Zn2+离子和ZnO簇都为Brnsted酸位点（BAS）提供了与丙烷CH键激活的协同作用。它们都能加速H/D交换反应，导致反应速率常数显著增加，激活能降低，与纯酸型沸石相比。隔离的Zn2+离子的效果更高，表明两种类型的Zn物种在增强沸石催化剂活性方面发挥着关键作用。

3. 无论是隔离的Zn2+离子还是ZnO簇，都观察到丙烷中甲基组的区域选择性。这表明这两种物种都在激活过程中起作用，导致甲基组的优先脱氘化。然而，Zn2+/H-BEA和ZnO/H-BEA沸石催化剂中的选择性机制有所不同。对于Zn2+/H-BEA，选择性在整个反应过程中得到维持，而对于ZnO/H-BEA，在诱导期之后，甲基组的选择性仅被观察到。

4. 甲基组在H/D交换过程中的参与归因于一系列连续步骤。首先，在诱导期积累丙烯。其次，由于ZnO物种较弱的配合，丙烯迁移到BAS并形成作为平衡异丙氧基物种的异丙基离子。随后，异丙基离子通过1,2-氢转移反应经历快速的分子内H/D混洗。最后，异丙基离子和去氘化的丙烷之间的分子间氢转移反应促进了丙烷中甲基组的质子转移，解释了甲基组在交换过程中的参与。
