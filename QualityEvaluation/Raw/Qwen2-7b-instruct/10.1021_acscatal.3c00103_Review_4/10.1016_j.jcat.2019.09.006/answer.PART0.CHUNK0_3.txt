<p>Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied. Zn-species of either type work jointly with BAS and may provide the synergy effect for propane CH bond activation resulting in dramatic acceleration of the H/D exchange between propane and BAS.</p>
<p>The kinetics analysis has revealed a dramatic increase of the rate constant of the reaction by one order of magnitude and the decrease of the activation energy (Ea) for both Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA) as compared to these parameters for parent pure acid-form zeolite. The effect of the H/D exchange acceleration provided by the presence of Zn2+ cations in zeolite is higher than the effect of ZnO clusters. These data support that both isolated Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters are responsible for the synergistic action with BAS for CH bond activation in propane.</p>
<p>For Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, the exchange is regioselective into the methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is observed only for the beginning of the reaction. Further, the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange with the apparent rate constant similar to that for the methyl groups.</p>
<p>The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane.</p>
<p>Propylene is presumably held by Zn2+ cations more strongly than by ZnO species. This does not allow the formation of isopropyl cation in the quantity sufficient to perform the regioselectivity of the exchange by mechanism I (pathway a in Scheme 1 ) on Zn2+/H-BEA. Also, the involvement of isopropyl cation in the exchange on ZnO/H-BEA only at the stage of intramolecular H/D-scrambling supports the conclusion that authentic regioselectivity of the H/D exchange in propane on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites could be realized by mechanisms II or III, but not by mechanism I. Moreover, considering the data on the apparent rate constants of the H/D exchange and ZnCH3 species formation on Zn2+/H-ZSM-5 [44] ,[56] , we conclude that mechanism III is most probable for the regioselective H/D exchange of propane with BAS on Zn-modified zeolites.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and the morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In this study, two types of Zn-modified zeolites were examined. One contained isolated Zn2+ cations, while the other had small ZnO clusters. Both types of Zn species worked synergistically with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to accelerate the hydrogen exchange process between propane and BAS, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The presence of Zn2+ cations in the zeolite provided a greater acceleration effect compared to ZnO clusters. The regioselectivity of the hydrogen exchange was observed in the methyl groups of propane for Zn2+/H-BEA, while for ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity was retained initially before the methylene group became involved in the exchange. This involvement occurred via the accumulation of propylene, migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS, and subsequent intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions. Mechanisms II or III were found to be most probable for achieving regioselectivity in propane hydrogen exchange on Zn-modified zeolites, rather than mechanism I, due to the stronger binding of propylene to Zn2+ cations and the inability to form sufficient quantities of isopropyl cations for regioselectivity.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是化学特性如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。本研究中，两种锌改性沸石被检视。一种含有孤立的锌离子2+，另一种则有小尺寸的锌氧化物簇。这两种锌物种与布伦斯特酸中心（BAS）协同工作，加速了丙烷与BAS之间的氢交换过程，从而提高了催化效率和选择性。锌离子2+在沸石中的存在提供了比锌氧化物簇更大的加速效果。对于Zn2+/H-BEA，氢交换在丙烷的甲基组中显示出选择性；而对于ZnO/H-BEA，初始阶段的选择性保留随后甲基组参与交换。这种参与通过丙烯积累、弱保留丙烯向BAS迁移，并随后发生分子内和分子间氢转移反应而实现。机制II或III被发现是Zn改性沸石中丙烷氢交换实现选择性的最可能机制，而不是机制I，这是由于丙烯与锌离子2+的更强结合以及无法形成足够的异丙基离子以实现选择性。
