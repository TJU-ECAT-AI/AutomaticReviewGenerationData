<p>The analysis of the kinetics allows us to clarify the peculiarities of the H/D exchange and activation of propane on Zn-modified zeolite, which could contain Zn-species of different state and composition. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both Zn2+ cations and ZnO species demonstrate the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane.</p>
<p>The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane.</p>
<p>Propylene is presumably held by Zn2+ cations more strongly than by ZnO species. This does not allow the formation of isopropyl cation in the quantity sufficient to perform the regioselectivity of the exchange by mechanism I (pathway a in Scheme 1) on Zn2+/H-BEA. Also, the involvement of isopropyl cation in the exchange on ZnO/H-BEA only at the stage of intramolecular H/D-scrambling supports the conclusion that authentic regioselectivity of the H/D exchange in propane on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites could be realized by mechanisms II or III, but not by mechanism I.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically the chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the incorporation of Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters into zeolite structures accelerates the H/D exchange reaction of propane with Brnsted acid sites, leading to increased reaction rates and activation energies compared to pure acid-form zeolites. The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange is observed for both types of Zn species, albeit with slight differences. The involvement of the methylene group in the reaction on ZnO/H-BEA is attributed to the accumulation of propylene during an induction period, weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species, migration of propylene to BAS, and subsequent intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions. The stronger coordination of propylene to Zn2+ cations compared to ZnO species explains the maintenance of regioselectivity for Zn2+/H-BEA during the entire reaction course, suggesting that mechanisms II or III, rather than mechanism I, might govern the regioselective H/D exchange on Zn-modified zeolites.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有着显著影响。可以采用修改策略来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，在沸石结构中引入Zn2+离子和ZnO簇可以加速丙烷与Brnsted酸中心的H/D交换反应，导致反应速率和活化能与纯酸型沸石相比有所增加。对于两种类型的Zn物种而言，均观察到了区域选择性的H/D交换特性，尽管存在细微差异。在ZnO/H-BEA上，甲基团的参与归因于诱导期期间丙烯的积累、丙烯与ZnO物种的弱结合、丙烯向酸中心迁移、以及随后的分子内和分子间氢转移反应。Zn2+离子相比ZnO物种更强的丙烯结合解释了Zn2+/H-BEA在整个反应过程中保持区域选择性的原因，这表明在Zn改性沸石上，可能由机制II或III而非机制I指导了丙烷的区域选择性H/D交换。
