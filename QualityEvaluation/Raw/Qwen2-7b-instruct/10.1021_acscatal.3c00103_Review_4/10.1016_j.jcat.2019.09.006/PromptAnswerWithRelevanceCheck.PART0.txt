[1] "The kinetics analysis has revealed a dramatic increase of the rate constant of the reaction by one order of magnitude and the decrease of the activation energy (Ea) for both Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA) as compared to these parameters for parent pure acid-form zeolite."
[2] "The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher. The influence of Zn on the rate of the H/D exchange reaction supports the involvement of the Zn-species in the key step of hydrogen exchange thus making the mechanisms of this reaction to be different for pure acid-form zeolites."
[3] "Both Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters demonstrate the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group."
[4] "The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the rate constant and activation energy of the reaction. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by adjusting the acid strength, stability, and morphology of the catalyst.

2. The presence of Zn species in catalysts, particularly isolated Zn2+ cations, accelerates the H/D exchange reaction, indicating their involvement in the key step of hydrogen exchange. This effect is different from that observed in pure acid-form zeolites, suggesting that the mechanisms of hydrogen exchange reactions are altered due to the presence of Zn species.

3. Both Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters display regioselectivity in the H/D exchange reaction, directing the reaction primarily into the methyl groups of propane. However, ZnO clusters lose this regioselectivity after an induction period, allowing the methylene group to become involved in the exchange.

4. The process of involving the methylene group in the exchange is explained through several steps: accumulation of propylene during the induction period, weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species, migration of propylene to Brnsted acid sites (BAS), formation of isopropyl cations, intramolecular H/D-scrambling, and finally, intermolecular hydride transfer leading to protium transfer into the methylene group.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，通过影响反应的速率常数和活化能。可以通过调整催化剂的酸强度、稳定性以及形态来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。

2. 催化剂中锌物种的存在，特别是孤立的Zn2+离子，加速了H/D交换反应，表明它们参与了氢交换的关键步骤。这与纯酸型沸石催化剂中观察到的效果不同，暗示了由于存在锌物种，氢交换反应机制发生了改变。

3. 锌2+离子和ZnO簇都显示出了对丙烷甲基组的选择性H/D交换，主要导向丙烷的甲基。然而，ZnO簇在诱导期后失去了这种选择性，允许乙烯基组参与交换。

4. 使乙烯基组参与交换的过程通过以下几步解释：积累丙烯期间的诱导期，丙烯与ZnO物种的弱协调，丙烯迁移到Brnsted酸位点（BAS），形成异丙基离子，分子内H/D混杂，最后是分子间氢转移导致甲基组得到质子。

<p>The analysis of the kinetics allows us to clarify the peculiarities of the H/D exchange and activation of propane on Zn-modified zeolite, which could contain Zn-species of different state and composition. Both Zn2+ and ZnO species provide the acceleration of the H/D exchange by the same order of magnitude with respect to that on pure acid-form zeolite.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both Zn2+ cations and ZnO species demonstrate the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group. The disappearance of the regioselectivity and the involvement of CH2 group in the reaction is accounted for by the stage of fast intramolecular H-scrambling in propane.</p>
<p>The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane.</p>
<p>Propylene is presumably held by Zn2+ cations more strongly than by ZnO species. This does not allow the formation of isopropyl cation in the quantity sufficient to perform the regioselectivity of the exchange by mechanism I (pathway a in Scheme 1) on Zn2+/H-BEA. Also, the involvement of isopropyl cation in the exchange on ZnO/H-BEA only at the stage of intramolecular H/D-scrambling supports the conclusion that authentic regioselectivity of the H/D exchange in propane on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites could be realized by mechanisms II or III, but not by mechanism I.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically the chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the incorporation of Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters into zeolite structures accelerates the H/D exchange reaction of propane with Brnsted acid sites, leading to increased reaction rates and activation energies compared to pure acid-form zeolites. The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange is observed for both types of Zn species, albeit with slight differences. The involvement of the methylene group in the reaction on ZnO/H-BEA is attributed to the accumulation of propylene during an induction period, weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species, migration of propylene to BAS, and subsequent intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions. The stronger coordination of propylene to Zn2+ cations compared to ZnO species explains the maintenance of regioselectivity for Zn2+/H-BEA during the entire reaction course, suggesting that mechanisms II or III, rather than mechanism I, might govern the regioselective H/D exchange on Zn-modified zeolites.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是化学性质如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有着显著影响。可以采用修改策略来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，在沸石结构中引入Zn2+离子和ZnO簇可以加速丙烷与Brnsted酸中心的H/D交换反应，导致反应速率和活化能与纯酸型沸石相比有所增加。对于两种类型的Zn物种而言，均观察到了区域选择性的H/D交换特性，尽管存在细微差异。在ZnO/H-BEA上，甲基团的参与归因于诱导期期间丙烯的积累、丙烯与ZnO物种的弱结合、丙烯向酸中心迁移、以及随后的分子内和分子间氢转移反应。Zn2+离子相比ZnO物种更强的丙烯结合解释了Zn2+/H-BEA在整个反应过程中保持区域选择性的原因，这表明在Zn改性沸石上，可能由机制II或III而非机制I指导了丙烷的区域选择性H/D交换。

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine how effectively the catalyst activates the reactants and facilitates the desired reaction pathways. Morphological characteristics, such as the size, shape, and distribution of active sites, impact the accessibility and reactivity of the reactants. Modification strategies that optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity often involve adjusting the catalyst's composition, morphology, and operating conditions. For instance, modifying the type of metal species or adjusting the support material can alter the acidity and stability of the catalyst, leading to improved performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Both isolated Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters contribute to the synergistic action with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) for propane CH bond activation. They both accelerate the H/D exchange reaction, leading to a significant increase in the rate constant and a reduction in activation energy compared to pure acid-form zeolites. The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher, indicating that both types of Zn species play crucial roles in enhancing the catalytic activity of the zeolite catalysts.

3. The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane is observed for both Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters. This suggests that both species are involved in the activation process that leads to preferential deuteration of the methyl groups. However, the mechanism of this regioselectivity differs between Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites. For Zn2+/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is maintained throughout the entire reaction, while for ZnO/H-BEA, it is only observed during the initial induction period before the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange.

4. The involvement of the methylene group in the H/D exchange process is attributed to several sequential steps. First, propylene accumulates during the induction period. Next, due to the weaker coordination of propylene to ZnO species, it migrates to BAS and forms isopropyl cations as equilibrated isopropoxy species. Subsequently, a fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling occurs in the isopropyl cation through a 1,2-hydride shift reaction. Finally, an intermolecular hydride transfer reaction between the isopropyl cation and deuterated propane facilitates the transfer of protium into the methylene group of the alkane, explaining the involvement of the methylene group in the exchange process.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学性质决定了催化剂如何有效地激活反应物并促进所需反应途径。形态特征，如活性位点的大小、形状和分布，影响反应物的可达性和反应性。优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性的修改策略通常涉及调整催化剂的组成、形态和操作条件。例如，通过改变金属物种或调整支持材料可以改变催化剂的酸性和稳定性，从而提高脱氢反应的性能。

2. 隔离的Zn2+离子和ZnO簇都为Brnsted酸位点（BAS）提供了与丙烷CH键激活的协同作用。它们都能加速H/D交换反应，导致反应速率常数显著增加，激活能降低，与纯酸型沸石相比。隔离的Zn2+离子的效果更高，表明两种类型的Zn物种在增强沸石催化剂活性方面发挥着关键作用。

3. 无论是隔离的Zn2+离子还是ZnO簇，都观察到丙烷中甲基组的区域选择性。这表明这两种物种都在激活过程中起作用，导致甲基组的优先脱氘化。然而，Zn2+/H-BEA和ZnO/H-BEA沸石催化剂中的选择性机制有所不同。对于Zn2+/H-BEA，选择性在整个反应过程中得到维持，而对于ZnO/H-BEA，在诱导期之后，甲基组的选择性仅被观察到。

4. 甲基组在H/D交换过程中的参与归因于一系列连续步骤。首先，在诱导期积累丙烯。其次，由于ZnO物种较弱的配合，丙烯迁移到BAS并形成作为平衡异丙氧基物种的异丙基离子。随后，异丙基离子通过1,2-氢转移反应经历快速的分子内H/D混洗。最后，异丙基离子和去氘化的丙烷之间的分子间氢转移反应促进了丙烷中甲基组的质子转移，解释了甲基组在交换过程中的参与。

<p>Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied.

<p>The kinetics analysis has revealed a dramatic increase of the rate constant of the reaction by one order of magnitude and the decrease of the activation energy (Ea) for both Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA) as compared to these parameters for parent pure acid-form zeolite.

Moreover, considering the data on the apparent rate constants of the H/D exchange and ZnCH3 species formation on Zn2+/H-ZSM-5 [44] ,[56] , we conclude that mechanism III is most probable for the regioselective H/D exchange of propane with BAS on Zn-modified zeolites.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and the morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In this study, two types of Zn-modified zeolites were examined. One contained isolated Zn2+ cations, while the other had small ZnO clusters. Both types of Zn species worked synergistically with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) to accelerate the hydrogen exchange process between propane and BAS, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The presence of Zn2+ cations in the zeolite provided a greater acceleration effect compared to ZnO clusters. The regioselectivity of the hydrogen exchange was observed in the methyl groups of propane for Zn2+/H-BEA, while for ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity was retained initially before the methylene group became involved in the exchange. This involvement occurred via the accumulation of propylene, migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS, and subsequent intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen transfer reactions. Mechanisms II or III were found to be most probable for achieving regioselectivity in propane hydrogen exchange on Zn-modified zeolites, rather than mechanism I, due to the stronger binding of propylene to Zn2+ cations and the inability to form sufficient quantities of isopropyl cations for regioselectivity.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically the acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can involve adjusting the acidity, stability, and pore size of the catalyst to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the presence of isolated Zn2+ cations in the catalyst can provide a synergistic effect with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) for propane CH bond activation, leading to a significant acceleration of the H/D exchange reaction compared to pure acid-form zeolites.

2. The analysis of the kinetics reveals that both isolated Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters contribute to the acceleration of the H/D exchange reaction and activation of propane CH bonds. However, the effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced than that of zinc oxide clusters. This suggests that the chemical quality of the catalyst, particularly the presence of Zn2+ cations, is critical for enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange is observed in the presence of Zn2+ cations, specifically in Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, where the exchange occurs predominantly into the methyl groups of propane. In contrast, for ZnO/H-BEA zeolite, the regioselectivity is only observed during the induction period, after which the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange. This indicates that the morphological characteristics, such as the coordination strength of propylene to ZnO species, affect the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange.

4. The mechanism behind the involvement of the methylene group in the H/D exchange on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite involves several steps. First, propylene accumulates during the induction period. Then, due to the weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species, it migrates to BAS and forms isopropyl cations. These cations then undergo fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling by 1,2-hydride shift reaction. Finally, the intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane leads to protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane. This process explains how the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange, even though it was initially not part of the regioselective exchange.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性以及形貌特征，在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。改进策略可以涉及调整催化剂的酸性、稳定性和孔径大小来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，在催化剂中存在孤立的Zn2+离子可以与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）协同作用，促进丙烷CH键的活化，导致H/D交换反应速率显著加快，与纯酸型沸石相比。

2. 动力学分析揭示了无论是孤立的Zn2+离子还是小尺寸的ZnO簇都对加速H/D交换反应和丙烷CH键活化做出了贡献。然而，孤立的Zn2+离子的作用更为明显。这表明催化剂的化学质量，特别是存在的Zn2+离子，对于增强催化性能至关重要。

3. 在Zn2+/H-BEA沸石中观察到了甲基选择性的H/D交换，该交换主要发生在甲基位置上。相比之下，对于ZnO/H-BEA沸石，仅在诱导期观察到甲基选择性，之后甲基变为参与交换。这表明形貌特性，如丙烯与ZnO物种的结合强度，影响H/D交换的选择性。

4. 对于ZnO/H-BEA沸石中甲基参与H/D交换的过程涉及几个步骤。首先，在诱导期内积累丙烯。然后，由于丙烯与ZnO物种的弱结合，它迁移到BAS并形成异丙基离子。这些离子随后通过1,2-氢转移反应进行快速的分子内H/D混合。最后，异丙基离子与去氘化丙烷的分子间氢转移反应导致氢向烷烃的甲基转移。这个过程解释了为什么甲基成为交换的一部分，尽管最初它并未参与选择性交换。
