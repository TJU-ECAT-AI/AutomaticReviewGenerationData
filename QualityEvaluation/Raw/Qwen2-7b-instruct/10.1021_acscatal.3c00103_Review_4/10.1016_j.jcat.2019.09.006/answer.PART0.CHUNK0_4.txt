<p>Two samples of the Zn-modified zeolite containing exclusively either isolated Zn2+ cations (Zn2+/H-BEA) or small (ZnO)n clusters (ZnO/H-BEA) have been studied. Zn-species of either type work jointly with BAS and may provide the synergy effect for propane CH bond activation resulting in dramatic acceleration of the H/D exchange between propane and BAS. The accelerating effect of isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced compared to zinc oxide clusters.</p>
<p>The analysis of the kinetics, monitored with 1H MAS NMR in situ, has allowed us to clarify the role of Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters in propane activation on Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA zeolites.</p>
<p>The kinetics analysis has revealed a dramatic increase of the rate constant of the reaction by one order of magnitude and the decrease of the activation energy (Ea) for both Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA) as compared to these parameters for parent pure acid-form zeolite. The effect of the H/D exchange acceleration provided by the presence of Zn2+ cations in zeolite is higher than the effect of ZnO clusters.</p>
<p>For Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, the exchange is regioselective into the methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is observed only for the beginning of the reaction. Further, the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange with the apparent rate constant similar to that for the methyl groups.</p>
<p>The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane.</p>

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, specifically the acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can involve adjusting the acidity, stability, and pore size of the catalyst to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, the presence of isolated Zn2+ cations in the catalyst can provide a synergistic effect with Brnsted acid sites (BAS) for propane CH bond activation, leading to a significant acceleration of the H/D exchange reaction compared to pure acid-form zeolites.

2. The analysis of the kinetics reveals that both isolated Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters contribute to the acceleration of the H/D exchange reaction and activation of propane CH bonds. However, the effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is more pronounced than that of zinc oxide clusters. This suggests that the chemical quality of the catalyst, particularly the presence of Zn2+ cations, is critical for enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. The regioselectivity of the H/D exchange is observed in the presence of Zn2+ cations, specifically in Zn2+/H-BEA zeolite, where the exchange occurs predominantly into the methyl groups of propane. In contrast, for ZnO/H-BEA zeolite, the regioselectivity is only observed during the induction period, after which the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange. This indicates that the morphological characteristics, such as the coordination strength of propylene to ZnO species, affect the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange.

4. The mechanism behind the involvement of the methylene group in the H/D exchange on ZnO/H-BEA zeolite involves several steps. First, propylene accumulates during the induction period. Then, due to the weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species, it migrates to BAS and forms isopropyl cations. These cations then undergo fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling by 1,2-hydride shift reaction. Finally, the intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane leads to protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane. This process explains how the methylene group becomes involved in the exchange, even though it was initially not part of the regioselective exchange.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性以及形貌特征，在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。改进策略可以涉及调整催化剂的酸性、稳定性和孔径大小来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，在催化剂中存在孤立的Zn2+离子可以与Brnsted酸位点（BAS）协同作用，促进丙烷CH键的活化，导致H/D交换反应速率显著加快，与纯酸型沸石相比。

2. 动力学分析揭示了无论是孤立的Zn2+离子还是小尺寸的ZnO簇都对加速H/D交换反应和丙烷CH键活化做出了贡献。然而，孤立的Zn2+离子的作用更为明显。这表明催化剂的化学质量，特别是存在的Zn2+离子，对于增强催化性能至关重要。

3. 在Zn2+/H-BEA沸石中观察到了甲基选择性的H/D交换，该交换主要发生在甲基位置上。相比之下，对于ZnO/H-BEA沸石，仅在诱导期观察到甲基选择性，之后甲基变为参与交换。这表明形貌特性，如丙烯与ZnO物种的结合强度，影响H/D交换的选择性。

4. 对于ZnO/H-BEA沸石中甲基参与H/D交换的过程涉及几个步骤。首先，在诱导期内积累丙烯。然后，由于丙烯与ZnO物种的弱结合，它迁移到BAS并形成异丙基离子。这些离子随后通过1,2-氢转移反应进行快速的分子内H/D混合。最后，异丙基离子与去氘化丙烷的分子间氢转移反应导致氢向烷烃的甲基转移。这个过程解释了为什么甲基成为交换的一部分，尽管最初它并未参与选择性交换。
