[1] "The kinetics analysis has revealed a dramatic increase of the rate constant of the reaction by one order of magnitude and the decrease of the activation energy (Ea) for both Zn-modified zeolites (Zn2+/H-BEA and ZnO/H-BEA) as compared to these parameters for parent pure acid-form zeolite."
[2] "The effect provided by isolated Zn2+ cations is higher. The influence of Zn on the rate of the H/D exchange reaction supports the involvement of the Zn-species in the key step of hydrogen exchange thus making the mechanisms of this reaction to be different for pure acid-form zeolites."
[3] "Both Zn2+ cations and small ZnO clusters demonstrate the regioselectivity of the H/D exchange into methyl groups of propane. For ZnO/H-BEA, the regioselectivity is retained only for the induction period followed by the H/D exchange into the methylene group."
[4] "The involvement of the methylene group in the exchange is accounted for by the following steps: (1) the accumulation of propylene during the induction period; (2) weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species; (3) the migration of weakly retained propylene to BAS and the formation of isopropyl cations detected as equilibrated isopropoxy species; (4) fast intramolecular H/D-scrambling in isopropyl cation by 1,2-hydride shift reaction; (5) fast intermolecular hydride transfer reaction of isopropyl cation and deuterated propane resulting in protium transfer into the methylene group of the alkane."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the rate constant and activation energy of the reaction. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by adjusting the acid strength, stability, and morphology of the catalyst.

2. The presence of Zn species in catalysts, particularly isolated Zn2+ cations, accelerates the H/D exchange reaction, indicating their involvement in the key step of hydrogen exchange. This effect is different from that observed in pure acid-form zeolites, suggesting that the mechanisms of hydrogen exchange reactions are altered due to the presence of Zn species.

3. Both Zn2+ cations and ZnO clusters display regioselectivity in the H/D exchange reaction, directing the reaction primarily into the methyl groups of propane. However, ZnO clusters lose this regioselectivity after an induction period, allowing the methylene group to become involved in the exchange.

4. The process of involving the methylene group in the exchange is explained through several steps: accumulation of propylene during the induction period, weak coordination of propylene to ZnO species, migration of propylene to Brnsted acid sites (BAS), formation of isopropyl cations, intramolecular H/D-scrambling, and finally, intermolecular hydride transfer leading to protium transfer into the methylene group.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，通过影响反应的速率常数和活化能。可以通过调整催化剂的酸强度、稳定性以及形态来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。

2. 催化剂中锌物种的存在，特别是孤立的Zn2+离子，加速了H/D交换反应，表明它们参与了氢交换的关键步骤。这与纯酸型沸石催化剂中观察到的效果不同，暗示了由于存在锌物种，氢交换反应机制发生了改变。

3. 锌2+离子和ZnO簇都显示出了对丙烷甲基组的选择性H/D交换，主要导向丙烷的甲基。然而，ZnO簇在诱导期后失去了这种选择性，允许乙烯基组参与交换。

4. 使乙烯基组参与交换的过程通过以下几步解释：积累丙烯期间的诱导期，丙烯与ZnO物种的弱协调，丙烯迁移到Brnsted酸位点（BAS），形成异丙基离子，分子内H/D混杂，最后是分子间氢转移导致甲基组得到质子。
