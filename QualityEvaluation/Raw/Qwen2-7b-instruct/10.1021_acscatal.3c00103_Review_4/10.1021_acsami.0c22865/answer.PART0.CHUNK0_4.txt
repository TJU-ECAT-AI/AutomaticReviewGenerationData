The physicochemical properties of catalysts, which encompass their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, along with their morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in determining their effectiveness during dehydrogenation reactions. Researchers have created subsurface-regulated PtGa nanoparticles encapsulated within Silicalite-1 for use in propane dehydrogenation processes. These catalysts' performance can be optimized through strategic modifications, with the goal of improving both their catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
