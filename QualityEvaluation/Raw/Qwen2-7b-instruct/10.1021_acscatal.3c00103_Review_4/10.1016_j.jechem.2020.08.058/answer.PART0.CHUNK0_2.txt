[1] "In order to evaluate the chemical environment of Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite, UVvis analysis was performed with selected samples and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (c)."
[2] "In contrast, a series of IR bands are observed on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta and two stable bands at 2120 cm1 and 2075 cm1 are preserved after He purging."
[3] "Parent H-Beta demonstrates two NH3 desorption peaks, revealing the presence of both weak and strong acid sites, respectively."
[4] "Interestingly, upon the addition of trace Pt into 2Zn/Si-Beta zeolite, significant improvement in propane conversion and propylene selectivity can be simultaneously obtained."
[5] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof."
[6] "In the presence of H2, a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h1 with high propylene selectivity of 98 % and propylene production rate of 2.54 can be achieved."
[7] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."
[8] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical modifications, like incorporating Zn species onto Si-Beta zeolite, can enhance the dispersion of metals and the interaction between them, leading to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Morphological changes, such as the dealumination process, can alter the surface area and pore size, affecting the accessibility of reactants and products. These properties are optimized through careful control during synthesis and can lead to catalysts with high propylene production rates and stable performance.

2. Modification strategies for optimizing catalyst properties involve the selection of suitable support materials, the precise loading of metals, and the adjustment of synthesis conditions to promote the dispersion of metal species. In this case, Zn stabilization by silanols from Si-Beta zeolite dealumination ensures the dispersion of Pt-Zn species, contributing to the catalyst's robust performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The deactivation of catalysts is often associated with the loss of active sites, aggregation of metal species, or the formation of coke deposits. In the context of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts, coke deposition is not the primary cause of deactivation. Instead, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species are identified as the main factors leading to irreversible deactivation. This highlights the importance of maintaining the stability and dispersion of metal species during high-temperature reactions.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。通过化学改性，例如在Si-Beta沸石上引入Zn物种，可以增强金属的分散性和它们之间的相互作用，从而提高催化效率和选择性。形态变化，如去铝化过程，可以改变表面积和孔隙大小，影响反应物和产物的可接近性。通过精确控制合成条件来优化这些属性，可以导致具有高丙烯产率和稳定性能的催化剂。

2. 优化催化剂属性的修改策略涉及选择合适的支撑材料、精确负载金属以及调整合成条件以促进金属物种的分散。在这种情况下，通过Si-Beta沸石去铝化过程稳定Zn物种确保了Pt-Zn物种的分散，对催化剂在脱氢反应中的稳健性能做出了贡献。

3. 催化剂的失活通常与活性位点的丢失、金属物种的聚集或焦炭沉积有关。对于Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂而言，焦炭沉积不是主要的失活原因。相反，Zn物种的丢失和随后Pt物种的聚集被确定为导致不可逆失活的主要因素。这强调了在高温反应过程中保持金属物种的稳定性和分散的重要性。
