[1] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been fully optimized. Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[2] "In the presence of H2, a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h1 with high propylene selectivity of 98 % and propylene production rate of 2.54 can be achieved."
[3] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."
[4] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the optimization of these properties can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the stabilization of Pt-Zn catalysts on zeolite support ensures high dispersion and close contact between Pt and Zn species, contributing to improved activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

2. Modification strategies aimed at optimizing catalyst properties can involve adjusting the loading of metals, selecting appropriate support materials, and controlling the reaction conditions. In the case of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst, the dealumination of zeolite to introduce silanols stabilizes Zn species, acting as anchoring sites for Pt, thereby promoting high dispersion and interaction between Pt and Zn, which are crucial for efficient dehydrogenation.

3. Low coke deposition is not the primary cause of catalytic deactivation in the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst. Instead, the catalyst deactivates irreversibly due to the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species at high temperatures during the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. The loss of Zn species and the aggregation of Pt species are identified as the main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst. This suggests that maintaining a stable distribution of Pt and Zn species is essential for sustaining catalytic activity over time.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。优化这些性质可以带来更高的催化效率和选择性。例如，通过在沸石载体上稳定Pt-Zn催化剂，确保Pt和Zn物种的高度分散和相互作用，有助于提高丙烷脱氢的活性和选择性。

2. 优化催化剂性质的策略可能包括调整金属负载、选择合适的支撑材料以及控制反应条件。对于Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂而言，沸石的去铝化引入硅醇基团稳定Zn物种，作为锚定Pt物种的位点，从而促进高度分散和Pt与Zn之间的相互作用，这对于有效的脱氢至关重要。

3. 在Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂中，低焦炭沉积并不是催化失活的主要原因。相反，催化剂在高温下脱氢反应期间由于Zn物种的丢失和Pt物种的聚集而不可逆地失活。

4. Zn物种的丢失和Pt物种的聚集被确定为Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂不可逆失活的主要原因。这表明保持Pt和Zn物种稳定的分布对于维持催化剂活性是至关重要的。
