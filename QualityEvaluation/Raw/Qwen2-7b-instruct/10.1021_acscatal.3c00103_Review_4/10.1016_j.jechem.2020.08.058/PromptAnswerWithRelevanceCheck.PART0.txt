1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities like the strength of acid sites and stability under reaction conditions determine the ability of the catalyst to activate reactants effectively and resist deactivation. Morphological characteristics, such as the dispersion and size of metal particles, affect the accessibility of reactants and products, as well as the diffusion pathways within the catalyst.

2. Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from the zeolite framework dealumination, serving as anchoring sites for Pt species. This stabilization ensures the high dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the zeolite support.

3. The close proximity and electronic interaction between Pt-Zn species on the zeolite support contribute to the robust performance of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.

4. Optimized conditions allow achieving a high propylene production rate of 4.11, high propylene selectivity of 98%, and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h−1 at 823 K, demonstrating the catalyst's efficiency and longevity.

5. While coke deposition does not significantly contribute to the deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species under high-temperature conditions lead to irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.

[1] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been fully optimized. Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[2] "In the presence of H2, a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h1 with high propylene selectivity of 98 % and propylene production rate of 2.54 can be achieved."
[3] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the optimization of these properties can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the stabilization of Pt-Zn catalysts on zeolite support ensures high dispersion and close contact between Pt and Zn species, contributing to improved activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

2. Modification strategies aimed at optimizing catalyst properties can involve adjusting the loading of metals, selecting appropriate support materials, and controlling the reaction conditions. In the case of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst, the dealumination of zeolite to introduce silanols stabilizes Zn species, acting as anchoring sites for Pt, thereby promoting high dispersion and interaction between Pt and Zn, which are crucial for efficient dehydrogenation.

3. Low coke deposition is not the primary cause of catalytic deactivation in the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst. Instead, the catalyst deactivates irreversibly due to the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species at high temperatures during the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. The loss of Zn species and the aggregation of Pt species are identified as the main reasons for the irreversible deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst. This suggests that maintaining a stable distribution of Pt and Zn species is essential for sustaining catalytic activity over time.

2. 优化催化剂性质的策略可能包括调整金属负载、选择合适的支撑材料以及控制反应条件。对于Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂而言，沸石的去铝化引入硅醇基团稳定Zn物种，作为锚定Pt物种的位点，从而促进高度分散和Pt与Zn之间的相互作用，这对于有效的脱氢至关重要。

3. 在Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂中，低焦炭沉积并不是催化失活的主要原因。相反，催化剂在高温下脱氢反应期间由于Zn物种的丢失和Pt物种的聚集而不可逆地失活。

4. Zn物种的丢失和Pt物种的聚集被确定为Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂不可逆失活的主要原因。这表明保持Pt和Zn物种稳定的分布对于维持催化剂活性是至关重要的。

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical modifications, like incorporating Zn species onto Si-Beta zeolite, can enhance the dispersion of metals and the interaction between them, leading to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Morphological changes, such as the dealumination process, can alter the surface area and pore size, affecting the accessibility of reactants and products. These properties are optimized through careful control during synthesis and can lead to catalysts with high propylene production rates and stable performance.

2. Modification strategies for optimizing catalyst properties involve the selection of suitable support materials, the precise loading of metals, and the adjustment of synthesis conditions to promote the dispersion of metal species. In this case, Zn stabilization by silanols from Si-Beta zeolite dealumination ensures the dispersion of Pt-Zn species, contributing to the catalyst's robust performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The deactivation of catalysts is often associated with the loss of active sites, aggregation of metal species, or the formation of coke deposits. In the context of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts, coke deposition is not the primary cause of deactivation. Instead, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species are identified as the main factors leading to irreversible deactivation. This highlights the importance of maintaining the stability and dispersion of metal species during high-temperature reactions.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。通过化学改性，例如在Si-Beta沸石上引入Zn物种，可以增强金属的分散性和它们之间的相互作用，从而提高催化效率和选择性。形态变化，如去铝化过程，可以改变表面积和孔隙大小，影响反应物和产物的可接近性。通过精确控制合成条件来优化这些属性，可以导致具有高丙烯产率和稳定性能的催化剂。

2. 优化催化剂属性的修改策略涉及选择合适的支撑材料、精确负载金属以及调整合成条件以促进金属物种的分散。在这种情况下，通过Si-Beta沸石去铝化过程稳定Zn物种确保了Pt-Zn物种的分散，对催化剂在脱氢反应中的稳健性能做出了贡献。

3. 催化剂的失活通常与活性位点的丢失、金属物种的聚集或焦炭沉积有关。对于Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂而言，焦炭沉积不是主要的失活原因。相反，Zn物种的丢失和随后Pt物种的聚集被确定为导致不可逆失活的主要因素。这强调了在高温反应过程中保持金属物种的稳定性和分散的重要性。

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine the catalytic activity and selectivity, while morphological characteristics affect the dispersion and stability of the catalyst. For instance, the introduction of a second metal species with strong interaction can significantly enhance the activity and stability of the Pt species in PDH reaction. Acid strength and stability of the catalysts, such as the presence of Lewis acid sites, also contribute to the catalytic performance. The BEA topology of the catalyst is well preserved after PDH reaction, which rules out the catalytic deactivation due to zeolite structure destruction.

2. Morphological characteristics of catalysts, particularly the dispersion and stability of the active species, are critical factors affecting their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of a second metal species can improve the dispersion of the active Pt species and stabilize them against aggregation, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学品质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在影响脱氢反应性能方面起着关键作用。化学品质决定了催化剂的活性和选择性，而形态特征则影响催化剂的分散性和稳定性。例如，引入具有强烈相互作用的第二种金属物种可以显著提高PDH反应中Pt物种的活性和稳定性。酸强度和催化剂的稳定性，如存在的Lewis酸位点，也对催化性能有贡献。在PDH反应后，催化剂的BEA拓扑结构得到很好的保持，这排除了由于骨架结构破坏导致的催化失活。

2. 催化剂的形态特性，特别是活性物种的分散性和稳定性，是影响脱氢反应性能的关键因素。引入第二种金属物种可以改善活性Pt物种的分散性并防止它们聚集，从而增强催化活性和选择性。Pt-Zn之间的强相互作用对于Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂的成功至关重要。在Si-Beta沸石支持中，硅醇基团的作用是锚定Pt-Zn物种的稳定锚定点，维持这两种金属的稳定相互作用。

3. 通过优化催化剂组成和反应参数，可以显着提高脱氢反应催化剂的性能。例如，向Pt催化剂中添加Zn可以抑制Pt物种的聚集，保持活性Pt-Zn物种的分散性，并减少焦炭沉积物的形成，从而增强催化效率和选择性。Zn的引入还可以增加Pt的电子密度，减弱富电子丙烯吸附，减少焦炭沉积物的形成。
