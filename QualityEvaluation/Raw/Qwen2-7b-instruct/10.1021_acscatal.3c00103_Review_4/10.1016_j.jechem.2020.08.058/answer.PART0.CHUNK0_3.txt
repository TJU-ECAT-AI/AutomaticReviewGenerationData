[1] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been fully optimized. Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[2] "In order to evaluate the chemical environment of Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite, UVvis analysis was performed with selected samples and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (c)."
[3] "In the case of ZnO, a very broad band centered at  370 nm due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer from O2 to Zn2+ in macrocrystalline ZnO is observed [14] ,[28] ,[29] . For 1Zn/Si-Beta and 2Zn/Si-Beta, only the ligand-to-metal charge transfer from O2 to Zn2+ in Si-O-Zn structure (sharp band at  205 nm) could be observed, and the broad band at  370 nm appears with Zn loading increase to 3%, i.e. 3Zn/Si-Beta."
[4] "That is, the Zn species are stabilized by interaction with silanols with the formation of Si-O-Zn linkages, as revealed by UVvis spectra."
[5] "The local electronic environment of Pt is of great significance for PDH process. In this study, the local electronic environment of Pt was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption, which is reliable for the discrimination of highly dispersed Pt centers and large metal bulks even at very low Pt loading."
[6] "According to these observations, it is rational to propose Pt species in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta as the dominant active sites for PDH reaction although Zn species are indeed active for the reaction."
[7] "The good catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in the reaction is well explained [26] , and the deactivation mechanism is finally discussed."
[8] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been fully optimized. Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[9] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."
[10] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like dispersion and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Optimizing these properties through strategies such as stabilizing metals on the support, enhancing dispersion, and creating active sites ensures high efficiency and selectivity. In this case, the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination stabilize Zn species, which act as anchoring sites for Pt species, leading to a highly dispersed Pt-Zn catalyst.

2. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the chemical environment of Zn species, are evaluated using techniques like UVvis analysis. The analysis reveals that Zn species disperse well on the Si-Beta zeolite support, preventing aggregation and forming Si-O-Zn linkages.

3. The local electronic environment of Pt, crucial for PDH process, is studied using FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. This technique allows for the discrimination of highly dispersed Pt centers and large metal bulks, supporting the identification of Pt species as the dominant active sites in the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.

4. The deactivation mechanism of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst involves the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species during high-temperature PDH reactions, which is proposed to be the cause of irreversible deactivation.

5. The catalytic performance of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta in PDH is optimized through careful selection of catalyst composition and reaction parameters, achieving high propylene production rates, selectivity, and sustainable deactivation rates.

6. The low coke deposition during PDH reaction indicates that it is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst. Instead, the loss of Zn species and the aggregation of Pt species are identified as the main causes of deactivation.
