1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities like the strength of acid sites and stability under reaction conditions determine the ability of the catalyst to activate reactants effectively and resist deactivation. Morphological characteristics, such as the dispersion and size of metal particles, affect the accessibility of reactants and products, as well as the diffusion pathways within the catalyst.

2. Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from the zeolite framework dealumination, serving as anchoring sites for Pt species. This stabilization ensures the high dispersion of Pt-Zn species on the zeolite support.

3. The close proximity and electronic interaction between Pt-Zn species on the zeolite support contribute to the robust performance of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.

4. Optimized conditions allow achieving a high propylene production rate of 4.11, high propylene selectivity of 98%, and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h−1 at 823 K, demonstrating the catalyst's efficiency and longevity.

5. While coke deposition does not significantly contribute to the deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species under high-temperature conditions lead to irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在决定脱氢反应性能方面起着关键作用。化学特性的强弱决定了催化剂激活反应物的能力以及其在反应条件下的稳定性。形态特性，如金属颗粒的分散度和大小，影响反应物和产物的可接近性，以及催化剂内部的扩散路径。

2. Zn物种通过与沸石框架去铝化产生的硅醇基团稳定，作为Pt物种的锚定点。这种稳定确保了Pt-Zn物种在沸石支撑上的高分散度。

3. Pt-Zn物种在沸石支持上的紧密接触和电子相互作用共同构成了Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的稳健性能。

4. 在优化条件下，可以实现高达4.11的高丙烯产率，98%的高丙烯选择性和可持续的失活速率0.02 h−1在823 K，表明催化剂的效率和长寿命。

5. 虽然焦炭沉积不是催化剂失效的主要原因，但在高温条件下，Zn物种的丢失和随后的Pt物种聚集导致Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂不可逆失效。
