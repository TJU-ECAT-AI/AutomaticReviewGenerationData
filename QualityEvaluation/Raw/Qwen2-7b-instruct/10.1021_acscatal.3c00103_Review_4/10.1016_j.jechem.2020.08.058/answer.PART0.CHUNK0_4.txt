[1] "In this context, Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9], Pt-Ga [6],[10], Pt-Cu [1], Pt-Sn [11],[12],[13], and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6]."
[2] "For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9]."
[3] "Notably, Weckhuysen and coworkers reported that the migration of subnanometric Pt species during PDH reaction was relevant to the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst than the formation of coke deposits [17]."
[4] "We then investigate the deactivation behavior of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta in PDH reaction."
[5] "Typically, the propylene production rate drops to 1.53 (by  20 %) in the first 10 h of operation and it further drops to 1.10 in the next 140 h (by  22 %)."
[6] "The introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH [15],[16]."
[7] "In view of the known activity of Pt and Pt-Zn in PDH and the contribution of Si-Beta support from the so-called confinement effect, we herein report the design and construction of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts for PDH."
[8] "The well-preserved microporous BEA topology structure of Beta are confirmed by the argon adsorption-desorption measurement."
[9] "In order to investigate the role of Zn on Pt in the bicomponent catalyst, the effects of Pt-Zn loading order on the PDH performance were further investigated."
[10] "Typically, a specific activity value, i.e. propylene production rate, of 4.11 with an acceptable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1 is achieved with our 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, while a specific activity value of 2.54 with a very low deactivation rate of < 0.002 h1 is achieved in the presence of H2."
[11] "That is, the gas-phase propane directly participates in PDH reaction."
[12] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49],[50],[51], which is not good for PDH reaction."
[13] "Meanwhile, the BEA topology of catalyst is well preserved after PDH reaction (Fig. 1 b), ruling out the catalytic deactivation due to zeolite structure destruction."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine the catalytic activity and selectivity, while morphological characteristics affect the dispersion and stability of the catalyst. For instance, the introduction of a second metal species with strong interaction can significantly enhance the activity and stability of the Pt species in PDH reaction. Acid strength and stability of the catalysts, such as the presence of Lewis acid sites, also contribute to the catalytic performance. The BEA topology of the catalyst is well preserved after PDH reaction, which rules out the catalytic deactivation due to zeolite structure destruction.

2. Morphological characteristics of catalysts, particularly the dispersion and stability of the active species, are critical factors affecting their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of a second metal species can improve the dispersion of the active Pt species and stabilize them against aggregation, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity. The close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species are essential for the success of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts. The stability of the Pt-Zn interaction is maintained by the silanol groups in the Si-Beta zeolite support, which act as anchoring sites for both metals.

3. Optimization of catalyst composition and reaction parameters can significantly improve the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts. For example, the addition of Zn to the Pt catalyst can suppress the aggregation of Pt species, maintain the dispersion of active Pt-Zn species, and reduce the formation of coke deposits, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The introduction of Zn can also enrich the electron density of Pt, which weakens the electron-rich propylene adsorption and reduces the formation of coke deposits.

4. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including the dispersion of active species, the stability of the catalyst, and the electronic interaction between different metals, can be modified through various strategies to optimize their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the introduction of a second metal species with strong interaction can improve the dispersion of the active Pt species and stabilize them against aggregation. The stability of the Pt-Zn interaction is maintained by the silanol groups in the Si-Beta zeolite support, which act as anchoring sites for both metals. The optimization of catalyst composition and reaction parameters, such as the loading of Zn and Pt, can also enhance the catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
