          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, encompassing chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as particle size and shape, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be implemented to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, encapsulating PtZn within an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier can lead to improved catalytic activity, as the presence of the high-crystallized zeolite provides a stable support for the metal particles, facilitating easier access of reactants to the active sites and improving dehydrogenation reaction rates.
