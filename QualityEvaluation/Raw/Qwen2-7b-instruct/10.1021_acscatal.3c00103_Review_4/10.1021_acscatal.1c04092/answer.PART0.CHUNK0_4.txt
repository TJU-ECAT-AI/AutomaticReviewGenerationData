The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to modify these properties, such as encapsulating the catalyst within zeolites, enhancing crystallinity, and lowering surface barriers, can improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
