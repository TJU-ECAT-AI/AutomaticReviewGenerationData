[5] "This phenomenon has been measured by UVvis spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 18. In the figure, a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is treated at 1100 C for 12 h, which results in the bands corresponding to Cr3+ species to shift, signaling the incorporation of Cr3+ species into the alumina support."

1. The majority of new facilities for propane dehydrogenation will be constructed in China or the United States, utilizing either the Catofin or Oleflex technologies.

2. The dehydrogenation step's duration relies on the catalyst bed's heat content, which decreases rapidly due to the reaction's endothermic nature.

3. Temperatures typically reaching 550 to 750°C are needed for the dehydrogenation of C2-C4 paraffins to achieve alkane conversions of 50% at 1 bar.

4. Catalysts must favor the cleavage of CH bonds over CC bonds to avoid side reactions, as CH bonds are more reactive than CC bonds in paraffins and olefins.

5. Treating a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst at 1100°C for 12 hours results in a shift in the UVvis spectroscopy bands corresponding to Cr3+ species, indicating the incorporation of these species into the alumina support.

6. Alumina is the most common support used, and various methods for producing chromiaalumina catalysts have been explored.

7. In the presence of γ-alumina, entrapment is considered the primary process, while in its absence, migration is favored.

8. The high affordability of ethane from natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has led to a shift from using naphtha in steam cracking installations in the US.

9. Zirconia is seen as a viable substitute for alumina due to its low surface acidity and the enhanced sintering resistance imparted by chromia to zirconia.

10. Titania is not a suitable support for CrOx catalysts because CrOx tends to sinter due to its weak interaction with titania.

1. 大多数新建的丙烷脱氢装置将在中国或美国建设，使用卡托芬（Lummus）或奥普（UOP）技术。

2. 脱氢步骤的持续时间取决于催化剂床的热容量，由于反应的吸热性质，该值迅速降低。

3. 在1巴的压力下，为了获得50%的烷烃转化率，通常需要达到550至750摄氏度的温度来脱氢C2-C4烷烃。

4. 催化剂必须促进CH键而非CC键的断裂，以避免副反应，因为CH键在烷烃和烯烃中的反应性高于CC键。

5. 将CrOx/Al2O3催化剂在1100°C处理12小时后，相应的Cr3+物种的UVvis光谱图会发生偏移，这表明这些物种被整合到氧化铝支撑体中。

6. 硅酸盐是常用的载体，已经探索了生产铬氧化铝催化剂的各种方法。

7. 在γ-氧化铝的存在下，被认为是最主要的过程是捕获，而在其不存在的情况下，迁移更占优势。

8. 由于天然气液体中乙烷的高可用性和成本效益，导致美国的蒸汽裂解安装从基于石蜡的乙烷转向基于页岩的乙烷。

9. 由于氧化锆的低表面酸性和铬氧化物对锆氧固态的增强烧结性能，锆氧被认为是替代氧化铝的可行选择。

10. 由于氧化钛与氧化钛的弱相互作用，导致氧化钛容易烧结，因此氧化钛不是CrOx催化剂的合适支持。
