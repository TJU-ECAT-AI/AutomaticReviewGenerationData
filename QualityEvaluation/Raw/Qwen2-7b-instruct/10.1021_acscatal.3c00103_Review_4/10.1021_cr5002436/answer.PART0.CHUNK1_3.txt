[1] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[2] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[4] "Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation."
[5] "High partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."
[6] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1. Coke refers to a large group of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that form on the catalyst surface during reactions, hindering reactant diffusion and reducing catalytic activity.

2. Coke deposition blocks pores and active sites, obstructing reactant access to the catalyst surface, causing a decline in catalytic performance.

3. Using a support with minimal Brnsted acidity or poisoning acid sites can significantly reduce coke formation.

4. Adjusting reaction conditions, like adding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can decrease coke buildup.

5. Increased partial pressures of olefins and paraffins promote coke deposition.

6. Adding promoter elements, especially tin to platinum-based catalysts, can minimize coke formation.

1. 焦炭是反应过程中在催化剂表面形成的一大类高度石墨化的烃分子的总称，它们阻碍反应物向催化剂表面扩散，导致催化活性下降。

2. 焦炭沉积会堵塞孔隙和活性位点，阻止反应物接近催化剂表面，造成催化性能下降。

3. 使用酸性较小或通过毒化酸性位点的支持材料可以显著减少焦炭生成。

4. 调整反应条件，如添加蒸汽、氢气或二氧化碳，可以降低焦炭积累。

5. 增加烯烃和烷烃的分压会促进焦炭沉积。

6. 添加促进剂元素，尤其是向铂基脱氢催化剂中添加锡，可以减少焦炭沉积。
