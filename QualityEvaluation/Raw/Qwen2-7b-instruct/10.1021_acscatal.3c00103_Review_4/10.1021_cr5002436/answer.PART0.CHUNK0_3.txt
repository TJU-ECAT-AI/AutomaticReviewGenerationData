[1] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[2] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[3] "Indeed, both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum."
[4] "Indeed, the advantages offered by the combustion of coke during the regeneration step far outweigh these unwanted side effects."
[5] "This has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[6] "The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene."

1. The majority of the new propane dehydrogenation facilities will be established in China or the United States and will utilize either the Catofin technology from Lummus or the Oleflex technology from UOP.

2. Coke deposition cannot be entirely avoided, so the catalysts need to be frequently regenerated by burning off the coke deposits.

3. Geometric and electronic effects have been proposed to explain how tin affects the catalytic properties of platinum.

4. The benefits of the coke combustion during the regeneration process significantly surpass the negative impacts.

5. The presence of alkali metals promotes both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites.

6. The authors suggest that strong acid sites are quickly deactivated, preventing cracking reactions and promoting the formation of alkenes.
