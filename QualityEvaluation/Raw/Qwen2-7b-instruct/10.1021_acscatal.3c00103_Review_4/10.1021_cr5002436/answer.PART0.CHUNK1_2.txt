[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Brnsted acid and others active sites of the catalysts serve as seeding points to which olefins and paraffins are added until large graphitic structures are formed."
[2] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[3] "Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."
[4] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

1. The formation of coke is a complex process that is not well understood. It starts when Brnsted acid and other active sites on the catalyst act as starting points for the attachment of olefins and paraffins, leading to the formation of large graphitic structures.

2. Reducing coke formation can be achieved by selecting a support with low Brnsted acidity or by poisoning the acid sites on the catalyst.

3. Adjusting reaction conditions, such as adding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can help reduce coke formation. Conversely, increasing the partial pressures of olefins and paraffins can lead to more coke deposition.

4. Adding a promoter element, such as tin (Sn), to platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts is an effective strategy to reduce coke deposition.

1. 焦炭形成是一个复杂的过程，目前理解不充分。它始于催化剂上的Brnsted酸和其他活性位点作为烯烃和烷烃的起始点，这些起始点逐渐形成大型石墨结构。

2. 可以通过选择低Brnsted酸性的支撑材料或毒化催化剂上的酸性位点来显著减少焦炭的形成。

3. 调整反应条件，例如添加蒸汽、氢气或二氧化碳，可以有助于减少焦炭的形成。相反，增加烯烃和烷烃的分压会加剧焦炭沉积。

4. 在铂基脱氢催化剂中添加促进剂元素，如锡（Sn），是有效减少焦炭沉积的一种策略。
