[1] "Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[2] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[3] "These side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[4] "For example, by increasing the temperature, the rates of both CH and CC cleavage reactions are increased, and therefore temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield."
[5] "This has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[6] "The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene."

1. Two primary categories of catalyst formulations are employed for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metals and metal oxides. 

2. To counteract coke buildup, catalysts require frequent regeneration by burning off the coke deposits.

3. Side reactions, like cracking and hydrogenolysis, are catalyzed by specialized sites not essential for dehydrogenation, allowing for optimized olefin yields through strategic catalyst design.

4. Temperature and pressure adjustments are critical in controlling reaction rates, with higher temperatures accelerating both CH and CC bond cleavages, necessitating careful management to achieve optimal olefin yields.

5. Large alkali ions stabilize the catalyst structure, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active chromium sites, enhancing catalytic performance.

6. The rapid inactivation of strong acid sites prevents cracking reactions, promoting the production of alkenes.

1. 非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃时，通常采用两种主要类型的催化剂配方：贵金属基和金属氧化物基。

2. 为了应对焦炭沉积，催化剂需要通过燃烧焦炭沉积物进行频繁再生。

3. 破裂和氢解等副反应由不用于脱氢的特定位点催化，通过精细的催化剂设计可以实现高烯烃产率。

4. 温度和压力的调整对于控制反应速率至关重要，更高的温度会加速CH和CC键的断裂，需要仔细管理以达到最佳烯烃产率。

5. 大的碱离子稳定催化剂结构，降低表面酸性，并增加活性铬离子的数量，提高催化性能。

6. 强酸位点的快速失效阻止了裂解反应，促进了烯烃的生产。
