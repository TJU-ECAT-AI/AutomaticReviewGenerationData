1. Two primary types of catalyst formulations are employed for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based.

2. Among the group VIIIB elements, platinum (Pt) is the sole noble metal used commercially due to its superior activation of paraffin carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds and minimal cleavage of carbon-carbon (CC) bonds.

3. Chromium oxide (CrOx) has been a focus of investigation since 1933, following the initial report of dehydrogenation activity by Cr2O3.

4. Alkali metals, including potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs), enhance both the activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. The properties of the support material are critical, influencing both the mechanical integrity of the catalyst and the interaction with the active phase, thereby affecting catalytic activity and selectivity.

6. Certain catalysts enabled ethane conversions of 27-30% and ethylene selectivity of 71-75%.

7. The technique for introducing chromium (Cr) into layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors affects the surface area, catalytic efficiency, coking resistance, and thermal stability of the resulting mixed oxides.

1. 用于非氧化性脱氢化轻烯烃的两种主要催化剂类型是：贵金属基和金属氧化物基。

2. 在第VIIIB族元素中，仅铂（Pt）在商业上得到应用，因为它对烷烃中的碳-氢（CH）键具有优越的激活作用，并且对碳-碳（CC）键的裂解活性较低。

3. 自1933年以来，由于首次报道了Cr2O3的脱氢活性，铬氧化物（CrOx）一直是研究的重点。

4. 钾（K）、铷（Rb）和铯（Cs）等碱金属能促进铬基脱氢催化剂的活性和选择性。

5. 支持材料的性质至关重要，不仅影响催化剂的机械性能，还影响活性组分与之的相互作用，从而影响催化活性和选择性。

6. 某些催化剂实现了乙烷转化率27-30%和乙烷选择性71-75%。

7. 将铬（Cr）引入层状双羟基（LDH）前体的方法影响了最终混合氧化物的表面积、催化效率、结焦抵抗性和热稳定性。
