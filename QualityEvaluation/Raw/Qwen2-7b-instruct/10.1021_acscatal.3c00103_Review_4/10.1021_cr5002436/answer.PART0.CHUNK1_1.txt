[1] "Catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."
[2] "The presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance. Indeed, a low amount of coke deposition has been observed to increase the catalytic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site."
[3] "High yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates, which is counterintuitive."
[4] "For the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt-based catalysts, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively."

1. The criteria for catalyst selection include space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield, which must be determined from the original sources. A low amount of coke deposition can enhance catalytic activity by aiding alkane adsorption near the active dehydrogenation site. High yields and low deactivation rates often occur together, which is unexpected. The specific activity of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is significantly higher than those of CrOx and GaOx catalysts.

1. 选择催化剂的标准包括空速、失活率和初始产率，这些必须从原始来源确定。表面沉积少量焦炭可以增强催化活性，通过促进烷烃在活性脱氢位点附近的吸附。高产率和低失活率往往同时出现，这令人意外。铂基催化剂用于丙烷脱氢的特定活性显著高于铬氧化物和镓氧化物催化剂。

[1] "The authors conclude that the differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods."
[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[3] "Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[4] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."

2. The discrepancies in specific activity values can be attributed to the comparison of calculated activation energies using DFT techniques. Despite considerable interest in alternatives like metal oxides in recent decades, a practical substitute for PtSn and CrOx systems hasn't emerged. Oxidative dehydrogenation avoids the thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Many new PDH initiatives have been disclosed over the past years, employing CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.

2. 前面提到的特定活性值差异可以通过比较使用DFT方法计算的激活能来解释。尽管在过去几十年里对替代品，尤其是如镓氧化物、钼氧化物和钒氧化物这样的金属氧化物，引起了大量关注，但尚未开发出实用的PtSn和CrOx系统替代品。氧化性脱氢化避免了非氧化性脱氢化的热力学限制。近年来，许多新的PDH项目被公布，采用CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin）或PtSn/Al2O3（Oleflex）催化剂。

3. Alternative catalysts, particularly metal oxides like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have gained substantial interest over the past decades, but a feasible alternative to PtSn and CrOx systems remains elusive. Expectations for progress in other areas include the benefits of oxidative dehydrogenation, which lacks the thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Over the past few years, numerous new PDH projects have been unveiled, with planned or constructed facilities utilizing either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.
