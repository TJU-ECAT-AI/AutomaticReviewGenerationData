[1] "The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide. These materials are also active in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and a high activity close to the thermodynamic equilibrium is initially obtained, although over a period of a few hours the selectivity drops to zero and the reaction yields only methane, as shown in Figure 23."
[2] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors. (229)"
[3] "Catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used. Notably, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations, despite the fact that the latter are commonly used at higher space velocities, which highlights the remarkable stability of Pt catalysts."
[4] "The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4. In these calculations, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step on PtSn system is lower (109 kJ mol1) than in the CrOx and GaOx catalysts (161 and 163 kJ mol1, respectively)."
[5] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation (vide supra)."

1. The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides during butane dehydrogenation leads to a high initial activity but results in a drop to zero selectivity and methane production over time.
2. β-Ga2O3 is considered the most active Ga species for PDH due to its monoclinic structure and high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites.

[1] "Catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."
[2] "The presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance. Indeed, a low amount of coke deposition has been observed to increase the catalytic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site."
[3] "High yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates, which is counterintuitive."
[4] "For the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt-based catalysts, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively."

1. The criteria for catalyst selection include space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield, which must be determined from the original sources. A low amount of coke deposition can enhance catalytic activity by aiding alkane adsorption near the active dehydrogenation site. High yields and low deactivation rates often occur together, which is unexpected. The specific activity of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is significantly higher than those of CrOx and GaOx catalysts.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower Brnsted acidity or those modified with substances that poison acid sites can reduce coke formation, thereby improving catalyst activity and selectivity. Modifying the support of the catalyst can also enhance its performance. For instance, using supports with minimal Brnsted acidity can drastically reduce coke deposition. Additionally, adjusting reaction conditions by cofeeding gases like steam, hydrogen, or CO2 can minimize coke formation. Adding promoter elements, such as tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, is another strategy to reduce coke deposition. The location of coke deposits on the catalyst surface is also crucial; coke on the support has a less severe impact on catalyst activity compared to coke covering active sites. These modifications and adjustments aim to optimize the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

[1] "Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[2] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[3] "These side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[4] "For example, by increasing the temperature, the rates of both CH and CC cleavage reactions are increased, and therefore temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield."
[5] "This has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[6] "The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene."

1. Two primary categories of catalyst formulations are employed for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metals and metal oxides. 

2. To counteract coke buildup, catalysts require frequent regeneration by burning off the coke deposits.

3. Side reactions, like cracking and hydrogenolysis, are catalyzed by specialized sites not essential for dehydrogenation, allowing for optimized olefin yields through strategic catalyst design.

4. Temperature and pressure adjustments are critical in controlling reaction rates, with higher temperatures accelerating both CH and CC bond cleavages, necessitating careful management to achieve optimal olefin yields.

5. Large alkali ions stabilize the catalyst structure, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active chromium sites, enhancing catalytic performance.

6. The rapid inactivation of strong acid sites prevents cracking reactions, promoting the production of alkenes.

1. 非氧化脱氢化轻烯烃时，通常采用两种主要类型的催化剂配方：贵金属基和金属氧化物基。

2. 为了应对焦炭沉积，催化剂需要通过燃烧焦炭沉积物进行频繁再生。

3. 破裂和氢解等副反应由不用于脱氢的特定位点催化，通过精细的催化剂设计可以实现高烯烃产率。

4. 温度和压力的调整对于控制反应速率至关重要，更高的温度会加速CH和CC键的断裂，需要仔细管理以达到最佳烯烃产率。

5. 大的碱离子稳定催化剂结构，降低表面酸性，并增加活性铬离子的数量，提高催化性能。

6. 强酸位点的快速失效阻止了裂解反应，促进了烯烃的生产。
