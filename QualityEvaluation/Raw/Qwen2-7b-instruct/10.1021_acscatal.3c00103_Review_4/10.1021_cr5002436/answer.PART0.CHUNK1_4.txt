[1] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction."
[2] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[3] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood."
[4] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[5] "The location of coke is very important, as coke on the support has a milder negative effect on catalyst activity."
[6] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[7] "Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation."
[8] "Coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower Brnsted acidity or those modified with substances that poison acid sites can reduce coke formation, thereby improving catalyst activity and selectivity. Modifying the support of the catalyst can also enhance its performance. For instance, using supports with minimal Brnsted acidity can drastically reduce coke deposition. Additionally, adjusting reaction conditions by cofeeding gases like steam, hydrogen, or CO2 can minimize coke formation. Adding promoter elements, such as tin (Sn) to platinum (Pt)-based catalysts, is another strategy to reduce coke deposition. The location of coke deposits on the catalyst surface is also crucial; coke on the support has a less severe impact on catalyst activity compared to coke covering active sites. These modifications and adjustments aim to optimize the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度、稳定性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有着显著影响。具有较低Brnsted酸性或通过使酸性位点中毒的改性支持物可以减少焦炭沉积，从而提高催化剂活性和选择性。修改催化剂的支持物也可以提升其性能。例如，使用具有极低Brnsted酸性的支持物可以大幅度减少焦炭沉积。此外，通过调节反应条件，如共注入蒸汽、氢气或二氧化碳气体，可以减少焦炭形成。添加促进剂元素，如向铂（Pt）基脱氢催化剂中添加锡（Sn），是另一种减少焦炭沉积的方法。焦炭沉积的位置也至关重要；支持物上的焦炭对催化剂活性的影响较小，与覆盖活性位点的焦炭相比。这些修改和调整旨在优化催化剂在脱氢反应中的效率和选择性。
