[1] "The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity."
[2] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
[3] "Increasing the calcination temperature above 600 C causes a loss of dehydrogenation activity, probably due to the incorporation of Cr into the Al2O3 framework."
[4] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[5] "Silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites."
[6] "Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results suggest that there is a direct relationship between catalytic activity and the reducibility of the catalysts."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The interaction between the carrier and the active phase profoundly affects catalyst activity and selectivity. 
2. Alumina is the most common support used in producing chromiaalumina catalysts. Various methods have been explored for this purpose.
3. Increasing the calcination temperature above 600°C may lead to a loss of dehydrogenation activity due to the incorporation of Cr into the Al2O3 framework.
4. Zirconia has been studied as an alternative support for chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts. It offers advantages over alumina, such as enhanced sintering resistance.
5. Silica requires a high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites when used as a support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts.
6. TPR results indicate a direct relationship between catalytic activity and the reducibility of catalysts, with more reducible catalysts generally showing higher activity.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特性，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。载体与活性相之间的相互作用对催化剂活性和选择性产生深远影响。
2. 铝氧化物是制备氧化铝基催化剂的最常用载体，多种方法已被探索用于这一目的。
3. 将煅烧温度提高至600°C以上可能导致脱氢活性的损失，这可能是由于铬被整合到氧化铝框架中。
4. 氧化锆已被研究用作氧化铝基脱氢催化剂的替代载体。它在增强烧结抗性方面优于氧化铝。
5. 当使用硅酸盐作为氧化铝基脱氢催化剂的载体时，需要较高的表面积来稳定Cr6+离子。
6. 温度程序还原（TPR）结果表明，催化活性与催化剂的可还原性之间存在直接关系，更可还原的催化剂通常具有更高的活性。
