[1] "The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide. These materials are also active in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and a high activity close to the thermodynamic equilibrium is initially obtained, although over a period of a few hours the selectivity drops to zero and the reaction yields only methane, as shown in Figure 23."
[2] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors. (229)"
[3] "Catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used. Notably, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations, despite the fact that the latter are commonly used at higher space velocities, which highlights the remarkable stability of Pt catalysts."
[4] "The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4. In these calculations, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step on PtSn system is lower (109 kJ mol1) than in the CrOx and GaOx catalysts (161 and 163 kJ mol1, respectively)."
[5] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation (vide supra)."

1. The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides during butane dehydrogenation leads to a high initial activity but results in a drop to zero selectivity and methane production over time.
2. β-Ga2O3 is considered the most active Ga species for PDH due to its monoclinic structure and high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites.
3. Metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than platinum catalysts at similar yields, highlighting the exceptional stability of platinum catalysts.
4. The lower activation energy barrier for the rate-limiting step on platinum-based catalysts compared to metal oxides explains the higher specific activity of platinum catalysts.
5. Operando spectroscopy enables dynamic adjustment of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases to maintain the catalyst in its most active state, balancing coke formation and deactivation.

1. 无定形钼氧化物在丁烷脱氢过程中形成的，初始表现出高活性，但在几个小时内选择性降至零并仅产生甲烷。
2. β-Ga2O3被认为是在PDH中最为活跃的镓物种，因其具有单斜结构和高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。
3. 金属氧化物催化剂的失活速度比铂基催化剂快，尽管后者通常在更高的空间速度下运行，这突显了铂催化剂的卓越稳定性。
4. 铂基催化剂中率限步的能量壁垒比金属氧化物低得多，解释了铂催化剂的更高特定活性。
5. 在线光谱学允许动态调整脱氢和再生阶段，以保持催化剂在其最活跃的状态，平衡焦炭形成和失活，实现催化剂的最佳性能。
