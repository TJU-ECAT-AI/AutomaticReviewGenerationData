[1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."
[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."
[3] "The latter allows molecules of substrates to access the active sites that are located within micropores and reduce the catalysts, leading to increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time (slower deactivation removal time of product molecules)."
[4] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of secondary porosity in hierarchical zeolites enhances the access and transport of reagents, allowing for faster mass transport. This facilitates the access of substrate molecules to the active sites within the micropores, increasing reaction rates and extending the lifetime of the catalyst by slowing down the deactivation process caused by product molecule removal.

2. The morphological characteristics of hierarchical zeolites, such as their secondary porosity, create an ideal environment for the deposition of active catalytic phases. This leads to high dispersion and a strong interaction between the zeolite and the reaction medium, which can further optimize the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性等化学特性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。层次型沸石材料中所具有的次级介孔和宏观孔结构增强了试剂的访问和传输，有效解决了传统沸石在催化反应中出现的传质问题。这使得反应物分子能够更容易地到达微孔内的活性位点，从而提高反应速率并延长催化剂寿命，降低产物分子去除导致的催化剂失活时间。

2. 层次型沸石的形态特征，尤其是其次级孔结构，为活性催化相的沉积提供了理想的环境，实现了高分散性和强烈的介质与沸石之间的相互作用，进一步优化了催化剂的催化效率和选择性。
