[1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."
[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."
[3] "The latter allows molecules of substrates to access the active sites that are located within micropores and reduce the catalysts, leading to increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time (slower deactivation removal time of product molecules)."
[4] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like the presence of secondary porosity, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Enhanced access and transport of reagents through additional meso- or microporosity provided by hierarchical zeolites improve mass transport, allowing substrate molecules to efficiently reach active sites within micropores. This leads to increased reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetime, as the removal time of product molecules is slowed down.

2. The morphology of hierarchical zeolites, featuring secondary porosity at meso- and macroscales, enables the creation of an ideal space for the deposition of active catalytic phases. Controlling the size of these phases and achieving high dispersion within the zeolite matrix enhances the interaction between the catalyst and the reaction medium, further optimizing catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性等化学特性，以及形态特征如次级孔隙的存在，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。通过传统沸石中额外的介孔或微孔提供的增强反应物访问和运输能力，可以有效解决在催化反应中发生的传质问题。这使得基质分子能够有效地到达位于微孔内的活性位点，从而提高反应速率并延长催化剂寿命，产品分子的去除时间变慢。

2. 高级沸石的形态特征，包括介观和宏观尺度上的次级孔隙，允许为活性催化相的沉积创造一个理想的环境。通过控制这些相的尺寸并在沸石矩阵中实现高分散性，可以增强催化剂与反应介质之间的相互作用，进一步优化催化效率和选择性。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Enhanced access and transport of reagents facilitated by the additional meso- or microporosity in hierarchical zeolites improve mass transport. This leads to faster reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetimes, as substrates can efficiently reach the active sites within the micropores. The secondary porosity also enables better control over the size and dispersion of active catalytic phases, enhancing the interaction between the zeolite and the reaction medium.
