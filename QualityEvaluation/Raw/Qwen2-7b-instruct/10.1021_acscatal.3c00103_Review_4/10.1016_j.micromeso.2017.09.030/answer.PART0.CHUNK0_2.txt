[1] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."
[2] "The latter allows molecules of substrates to access the active sites that are located within micropores and reduce the catalysts, leading to increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time (slower deactivation removal time of product molecules)."
[3] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hierarchical zeolites improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions by enhancing mass transport and substrate access to active sites within the zeolite's micropores. This leads to faster reaction rates and prolonged catalyst life, as well as better dispersion and interaction between the zeolite and the reaction medium.
