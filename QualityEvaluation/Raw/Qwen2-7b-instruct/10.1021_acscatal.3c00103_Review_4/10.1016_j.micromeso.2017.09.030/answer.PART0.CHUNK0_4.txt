[1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."
[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."
[3] "The latter allows molecules of substrates to access the active sites that are located within micropores and reduce the catalysts, leading to increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time (slower deactivation removal time of product molecules)."
[4] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The enhanced access and transport of reagents facilitated by the secondary porosity in hierarchical zeolites improves mass transport, allowing substrate molecules to efficiently reach active sites within the micropores. This leads to increased reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetime. The controlled deposition of active catalytic phases within the hierarchical zeolites ensures high dispersion and strong interaction with the medium, further optimizing catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
