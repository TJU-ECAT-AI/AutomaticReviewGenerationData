[1] "Hierarchical zeolites possessing secondary porosity at meso- and macroscale, imposed on primary microporous structures are an original class of porous materials exhibiting both molecular sieving ability and fast mass transport."
[2] "These materials, due to the combination of catalytic properties of conventional zeolites with enhanced access and transport of reagents in additional meso- or microporosity, constitute an effective solution to the problem of mass transport, which occurs while using conventional zeolites in catalytic reactions."
[3] "The latter allows molecules of substrates to access the active sites that are located within micropores and reduce the catalysts, leading to increase reaction rates and catalyst life-time (slower deactivation removal time of product molecules)."
[4] "Besides, secondary porosity of hierarchical zeolites creates an ideal space for deposition of active catalytic phases controlling their size and allows attaining high dispersion and strong interaction between zeolite and the medium."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Enhanced access and transport of reagents facilitated by the additional meso- or microporosity in hierarchical zeolites improve mass transport. This leads to faster reaction rates and longer catalyst lifetimes, as substrates can efficiently reach the active sites within the micropores. The secondary porosity also enables better control over the size and dispersion of active catalytic phases, enhancing the interaction between the zeolite and the reaction medium.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如酸强度、稳定性以及形态，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。层次结构沸石中额外的介孔或微孔促进了物质的有效传输，从而改善了质量传递。这导致了更快的反应速率和更长的催化剂寿命，因为反应物能够有效地到达微孔内的活性位点。二级孔隙还允许更好地控制活性催化相的尺寸和分散性，增强沸石与反应介质之间的相互作用。
