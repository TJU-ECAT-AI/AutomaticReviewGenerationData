[1] "The MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites synthesized under sodium-free conditions were assessed as catalyst supports for PtY alloy nanoparticles."
[2] "The formation of tiny metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in MZ."
[3] "Moreover, the average atomic ratio of Pt to Y was determined to be approximately 3 for both PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples, which agrees well with the Pt/Y ratio of Pt3Y intermetallic alloys supported on MZ-dg in a previous study."
[4] "These results suggest that the silanol nests generated by the direct synthesis in MZ-sf-OH and MZ-sf-Br have a critical role in the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles that exhibit reversible chemisorption behavior upon changes in the electronic state of Pt."
[5] "The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH catalysts were even superior to PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg in terms of catalytic durability."
[6] "For a fair comparison, the propane flow was increased accordingly with the increase in metal loading to maintain the same WHSV values based on the weight of Pt."
