[1] "The MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites synthesized under sodium-free conditions were assessed as catalyst supports for PtY alloy nanoparticles."
[2] "The formation of tiny metal nanoparticles can be attributed to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in MZ."
[3] "Moreover, the average atomic ratio of Pt to Y was determined to be approximately 3 for both PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples, which agrees well with the Pt/Y ratio of Pt3Y intermetallic alloys supported on MZ-dg in a previous study."
[4] "The hydrogen chemisorption provides the total number of chemisorbed H atoms per total number of Pt atoms (H/Pt)."
[5] "These two samples exhibited highly reversible chemisorption behavior (94% for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and 96% for PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br), similar to the case of PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg."
[6] "The three PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites have an activation period (12 h) to reach the full conversion."
[7] "Furthermore, we performed coke analysis with the PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst sample recovered after measurement for 21 d."
[8] "The results show that there is an inverse relationship between the propane conversion and the metal loading amount when the catalysts were fully activated."
[9] "This effect with high loading may be explained by the increase in metal facet areas, which favor coke generation."
[10] "However, the opposite effect with low loading is difficult to explain with the change in the metal surface alone, since the metal particle sizes do not decrease as conspicuously as the metal loading decreased from 1.0 to 0.50 and 0.25 wt%."

1. The MZ-sf-Br and MZ-sf-OH zeolites were assessed as catalyst supports for PtY alloy nanoparticles.
2. Tiny metal nanoparticles were formed due to the confinement effect provided by the mesopores in the MZ zeolite.
3. The average atomic ratio of Pt to Y was approximately 3 for the PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples, consistent with previous studies on Pt3Y intermetallic alloys.
4. Hydrogen chemisorption provides the total number of chemisorbed H atoms per total number of Pt atoms.
5. The PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH and PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br samples exhibited highly reversible chemisorption behavior, similar to the PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg catalyst.
6. The PtY(0.5) catalysts supported on silanol nest-containing zeolites had an activation period to reach full conversion.
7. Coke analysis was performed on the PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br catalyst after 21 days of reaction.
8. There was an inverse relationship between propane conversion and metal loading amount when the catalysts were fully activated.
9. The increase in metal facet areas explains the decreased catalyst durability with high loading.
10. The opposite effect with low loading is likely due to the increased fraction of the zeolite support, causing side reactions that lead to coke deposits on the supported metal surfaces.

1. 合成在无钠条件下的MZ-sf-Br和MZ-sf-OH沸石被评估为PtY合金纳米粒子的催化剂载体。
2. 由于MZ沸石的微孔提供了限制效应，形成了细小的金属纳米颗粒。
3. PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH和PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br样品中的Pt与Y的平均原子比约为3，与先前关于MZ-dg上支持的Pt3Y互金属合金的研究结果一致。
4. 氢化吸附提供了每个总Pt原子的总吸附H原子数。
5. PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-OH和PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br样品表现出高度可逆的吸附行为，类似于PtY(0.5)/MZ-dg催化剂。
6. 支持在具有硅醇巢缺陷的沸石上的PtY(0.5)催化剂有激活期以达到全转化。
7. 对于反应21天后的PtY(0.5)/MZ-sf-Br催化剂进行了焦炭分析。
8. 当催化剂完全激活时，丙烷转化率与金属负载量之间存在反比关系。
9. 高负载下催化剂耐久性的降低可能由金属表面的增加的晶面区域所解释，这有利于焦炭生成。
10. 低负载下相反的影响可能是由于支持的沸石部分比例增加，导致副反应产生高分子量烃物种，从而在支持的金属表面上形成焦炭沉积物。
