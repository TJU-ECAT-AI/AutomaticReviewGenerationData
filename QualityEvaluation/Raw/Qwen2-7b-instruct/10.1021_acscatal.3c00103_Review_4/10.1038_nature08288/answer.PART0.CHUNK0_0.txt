[1] "Zeolitesmicroporous crystalline aluminosilicatesare widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis1,2,3 because strong acid sites within their uniform micropores enable size- and shape-selective catalysis."
[2] "But the very presence of the micropores, with aperture diameters below 1nm, often goes hand-in-hand with diffusion limitations3,4,5 that adversely affect catalytic activity."
[3] "This has been realized by synthesizing zeolite nanocrystals6, by exfoliating layered zeolites7,8,9, and by introducing mesopores in the microporous material through templating strategies10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 or demetallation processes18,19,20,21,22."
[4] "Of these three types of ultrathin zeolites, nanowires and nanosheets would be preferred in heterogeneous catalysis because of their ease of handling (they are collectable by filtration)."
[5] "MFI zeolites with Si/Al ratio of 30 to  were crystallized by using the diammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent."
[6] "The catalytic performance of the MFI nanosheets was investigated using large organic molecules so that diffusion of the reactant molecules constrains the reaction (Methods)26."
[7] "As expected, the catalytic activities (per weight of catalyst) of the MFI nanosheets were much higher than those of conventional MFI zeolite (see Table 1)."
[8] "Coke deposition within micropores causes more effective catalyst deactivation than external coke formation27,28 because internally deposited coke can cover the catalytically active acid sites and also block micropores already at low coking levels; in contrast, external coke causes relatively little hindrance to diffusion unless it covers the entire external catalyst surface."
[9] "The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 2), hydrothermal stability (Supplementary Fig. 3) and strong acidity (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), which are important for many catalytic applications."

1. Zeolites, with their uniform micropores and strong acid sites, are widely utilized in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis due to their size- and shape-selective catalytic capabilities. However, their micropore architecture introduces diffusion limitations that can hinder catalytic activity.

2. Various strategies have been developed to overcome these limitations, including synthesizing zeolite nanocrystals, exfoliating layered zeolites, and introducing mesopores through templating techniques. Nanowires and nanosheets are particularly advantageous in heterogeneous catalysis due to their ease of handling.

3. The researchers synthesized MFI zeolites with a reduced framework thickness by utilizing a di-quaternary ammonium-type surfactant as a structure-directing agent. These ultrathin zeolites are composed of alternating layers of MFI zeolite framework and surfactant micelles.

4. The catalytic performance of MFI nanosheets was evaluated using large organic molecules that require diffusion-controlled reactions. The results showed that the MFI nanosheets had significantly higher catalytic activities compared to conventional MFI zeolite.

5. The MFI nanosheets demonstrated enhanced catalyst lifetime, with coke deposition primarily occurring at the external surface. This slow deposition of coke exclusively at external zeolite surfaces contributed to the long catalytic lifetime of the MFI nanosheets.

6. The MFI nanosheets exhibited excellent thermal stability, hydrothermal stability, and strong acidity, making them suitable for various catalytic applications.
