1. Zeolites, particularly zeolite MFI nanosheets, are widely used in petrochemistry and fine-chemical synthesis due to their strong acid sites within uniform micropores enabling size- and shape-selective catalysis. These materials are preferred in heterogeneous catalysis due to their ease of handling, as they can be collected by filtration.

2. Ultrathin zeolites, especially nanosheets, are advantageous in catalysis because they have a thickness corresponding to a single unit cell, which maximizes molecular diffusion. Nanosheets are preferred over nanowires due to their ease of handling in heterogeneous catalysis.

3. MFI zeolite nanosheets can be synthesized in both multilamellar and unilamellar forms. The unilamellar form is synthesized by reducing the concentration of Na+ in the synthesis mixture.

4. The unilamellar MFI zeolite has a significantly increased surface area (710m²/g) compared to its multilamellar counterpart (520m²/g).

5. The catalytic performance of MFI nanosheets is superior when tested with large organic molecules, where diffusion constraints the reaction.

6. Enhanced catalytic activities of MFI nanosheets can be attributed to a large number of acid sites located at the mesopore surface, with unilamellar MFI generally exhibiting higher activities due to its larger external surface area after calcination.

7. Internal coke deposition causes more effective catalyst deactivation than external coke formation because it covers catalytically active acid sites and blocks micropores. External coke, in contrast, has less hindrance to diffusion unless it covers the entire external catalyst surface.

8. MFI nanosheets demonstrate excellent thermal stability, hydrothermal stability, and strong acidity, which are essential for various catalytic applications.

1. 由于其均匀微孔中的强酸位点能够实现尺寸和形状选择性催化作用，沸石，特别是沸石MFI纳米片，在石油化学和精细化学品合成中被广泛使用。这些材料在异质催化中的处理方便，易于过滤收集。

2. 超薄沸石，尤其是纳米片，因其单个单元细胞对应的厚度而最大化分子扩散，在催化反应中具有优势。在异质催化中，纳米片优于纳米线，因为它们易于处理。

3. 沸石MFI纳米片可以通过降低合成混合物中Na+的浓度来合成成多层和单层两种形式。单层形式通过减少Na+的浓度来合成。

4. 单层MFI沸石的表面面积显著增加（710m²/g），与它的多层对应者相比（520m²/g）。

5. 在测试大型有机分子时，MFI纳米片的催化性能优越，因为扩散限制了反应。

6. MFI纳米片增强的催化活性可以归因于大量位于微孔表面的酸位点，单层MFI通常由于其经过煅烧后的更大外部表面积而表现出更高的活性。

7. 内部焦炭沉积比外部焦炭沉积导致更有效的催化剂失活，因为它覆盖了催化活性酸位点并阻止微孔。相比之下，外部焦炭对扩散的阻碍较小，除非它完全覆盖整个外部催化剂表面。

8. MFI纳米片显示出出色的热稳定性、水热稳定性和强酸性，这些都是各种催化应用的重要特征。
