The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies, like steaming, can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, steaming a catalyst can increase the number of active Fe2+ sites, leading to higher selectivity towards propene. Steam treatment can also increase stability towards coking in the zeolites. In the class of catalysts, minimizing competing reactions such as reforming is essential. Future catalyst design should aim to move away from Cr- and Ga-based catalysts to focus on low-temperature CO2 activation and have controlled redox and acid-base properties.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。可以通过改变支持材料来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，通过蒸处理可以增加活性Fe2+位点的数量，从而提高丙烯的选择性。蒸汽处理还可以提高沸石的稳定性。在催化剂类别中，减少竞争反应如重整至关重要。未来催化剂设计应侧重于低温二氧化碳激活，并具有控制的氧化还原性和酸碱性。
