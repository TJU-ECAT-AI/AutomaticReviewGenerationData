[1] "A study of the effects of catalyst physicochemical properties on dehydrogenation reactions was conducted. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "It was found that acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity."
[3] "More frequently, there are reports of dispersion being influenced by the preparation technique, with grafting vanadia onto the support surface showing promise."
[4] "In contrast, incipient-wetness techniques can still be improved, with hydration of the surface or doping being effective strategies."
[5] "The choice of support material composition and chemical properties is more influential than morphology on overall catalytic performance; many studies comparing mesoporous catalysts with bulk-like morphologies found mesoporosity to have either a detrimental or negligible effect on productivity."
[6] "Porosity can, however, increase specific surface area and therefore support a higher loading of isolated vanadia sites."
[7] "In conclusion, vanadia catalysts have been extensively investigated for ODH-O2, with the main focus being on maximising the number of isolated vanadia species, which is fundamental to increasing propene selectivity."
[8] "A one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, in contrast to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."
[9] "The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, in contrast to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."

[1] "The majority of studies focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2."
[3] "While it seems as though the addition of CO2 would be detrimental on this basis, the removal of hydrogen via the RWGS reaction favourably shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to enable higher propene yields."
[4] "The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions."
[5] "The superiority of Pt as a DDH catalyst over other transition metals was recently illustrated by Araujo-Lopez et al. who used DFT calculations to measure the transition state energy for non-oxidative (and oxidative) CH bond activation."
[6] "The dissociative adsorption of propane and the CH cleavage steps have been suggested as being rate-limiting, although this depends on the catalyst."
[7] "Over the course of five dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the CrAl-800 catalyst demonstrated superior regenerative ability, and the initial STY was 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1."
[8] "The authors postulated the main active site for CH activation was Ga3+ embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework."
[9] "It was found that low Cr loadings contribute to the dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, with some Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also being observed."

1. Physicochemical properties such as acid strength, stability, and morphology of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting reaction rates, selectivity, and the propensity for side-reactions. Morphological modifications can enhance dispersion, control surface area, and optimize the interaction between the active species and reactants. Supporting materials with appropriate acidity can suppress unwanted side-reactions, while promoting active sites.

2. Catalysts with a low Cr loading tend to disperse monomeric Cr6+ species, which enhances catalytic activity. The presence of Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also contributes to the dispersion and stability of the catalyst.

3. The addition of O2 to oxidative dehydrogenation enables lower reaction temperatures and reduces energy costs compared to direct dehydrogenation. The thermodynamic equilibrium shifts favorably for propene production.

4. Catalysts must be designed with careful consideration to inhibit and control side-reactions, such as coke formation and cracking, which can negatively impact performance.

5. Platinum (Pt) has been found to be highly effective in dehydrogenation reactions due to its ability to activate CH bonds. Pt-based catalysts can be enhanced with promoters like Sn and Ga, which improve dispersion, selectivity, and stability.

6. The dissociative adsorption of propane and the CH cleavage steps are rate-limiting processes in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalyst particle size affects the reactivity of propane, with smaller particles promoting higher selectivity and stability.

7. A catalyst with a high initial STY of 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was observed after five dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, indicating robust regenerative ability.

8. Gallium (Ga) embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework acts as an active site for CH activation in dehydrogenation reactions, contributing to high activity and selectivity.

9. Low Cr loadings promote the dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, which enhances catalytic activity. Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also play a role in dispersion and stability.

10. Despite quick deactivation due to carbon deposition, catalysts can maintain initial activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in prolonging life.

[1] "Many studies have investigated VOx-based catalysts, which in some cases have been said to exhibit a catalyst performance similar to that of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. However, comparing the typical STY values for VOx with those of CrOx or Pt, it is clear that the VOx catalysts reported in the literature are not as active as supported CrOx or Pt catalysts."
[2] "In the case of boron-based catalysts, elemental boron showed a remarkably high STY of 280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, which represented an improved productivity over BN-OH catalysts that had been previously described in the literature."
[3] "The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. Supporting VOx supported on H-ZSM-5 was shown not to enhance performance since, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low V loadings. The support influence was detrimental to selectivity and overall lowered the propene yield."
[4] "It was found that increasing the Mg content led to a decrease in strong acid sites, decreasing activity, consistent with the fact that strong acid sites can activate propene."
[5] "The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, morphologies and loadings when compared to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."

1. VOx-based catalysts have been reported to perform similarly to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in some cases, but typically, the STY values for VOx catalysts are significantly lower compared to CrOx or Pt catalysts. 

2. Elemental boron has been found to exhibit the highest productivity among boron-based catalysts, achieving a STY of 280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, surpassing the performance of previously reported BN-OH catalysts.

3. Supporting vanadia on H-ZSM-5 did not enhance performance, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low vanadium loadings. The acidic support negatively impacted selectivity and overall propene yield.

4. Incorporating magnesium into the catalyst structure reduced the number of strong acid sites, which led to a decrease in activity. This is because strong acid sites are capable of activating propene.

[3] "It was shown that VOx/MCM-41 exhibited superior propene selectivity (above 90%) and stability during several successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[4] "The authors observed a positive correlation between the rate of coke formation and the acidity of the support, as well as reporting that coke can actually catalyse the DDH reaction."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability determine the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Morphological characteristics, such as particle size and shape, affect the surface area and the ease of reactant access, which in turn impacts the catalytic efficiency. 

2. Metal-support interactions are crucial in determining the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts. The type of metal and the support material can influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction can stabilize the metal species, enhance dispersion, and modulate the acidity of the support, affecting the reaction pathways and the stability of the catalyst.

3. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate superior performance in dehydrogenation reactions, with high propene selectivity and remarkable stability during repeated dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. This indicates that the structure of the MCM-41 support plays a critical role in maintaining the catalytic activity of VOx species.

4. The rate of coke formation in dehydrogenation reactions correlates positively with the acidity of the support material. Moreover, coke can catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, which might explain the observed deactivation of catalysts. This suggests that controlling the acidity of the support could mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst stability.

5. The degree of polymerization of VOx species affects the susceptibility of catalysts to coke formation. Catalysts supported on aluminosilicates with varying SiO2 contents exhibit different coke formation tendencies depending on the size and structure of the V2O5 crystallites. Smaller, more dispersed VOx species are less prone to coke formation.

[1] "It was shown that NiMoO4 had enhanced ODH-O2 performance when comparing mesoporous to bulk catalysts, but only due to the enhanced number of active sites related to the increased surface area, and not the improved mass transfer properties that usually accompany mesoporosity."
[2] "This confirmed that MoO3 exhibits favourable activity to NiMoO4 for the ODH-O2 reaction (Table 10, entry 7)."
[3] "However, propene was still not the major product over NiO at around 10% conversion, suggesting that NiO-based catalysts are limited in their application for ODH-O2."
[4] "The NiO-polyoxometalates have been shown to stabilise the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, which would limit overoxidation,227 leading to the conclusion that NiO oxygen is too labile to achieve a high selectivity."
[5] "This is due to the polymeric phosphates weaker interaction with propene when compared to NiO nanoparticles, leading to a higher desorption rate and therefore higher selectivity."
[6] "While oxygen vacancies are necessary to activate oxygen, they decreased selectivity in the absence of HCl,231 which is why CeO2 was shown to have a much lower selectivity without the presence of HCl; a change of active species from oxygen vacancies to Cl radical like species, has been shown to increase selectivity without a large detrimental effect on conversion."
[7] "There was no correlation between reducibility and catalyst performance, suggesting that redox properties are not rate-determining in these ODH-O2 catalysts."
[8] "This new route to propene shows promise and enhances our understanding of selectivity patterns."
[9] "The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions."
[10] "The activity of the catalyst in this study was shown to be much larger than the more commonly used vanadia-based catalysts, whilst showing a higher selectivity."
[11] "The key to an increased activity was due to the under-coordinated Pt cluster strongly adsorbing the propane when compared to an extended Pt surface, confirmed by catalytic data which was in agreement with DFT."
[12] "Conversion largely depended on the C3H8:O2 ratio: an increase in propane conversion was found with an increase in O2 concentration relative to propane concentration, but too high an oxygen concentration caused overoxidation to COx."

[1] "The majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "Over the course of ten successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[3] "The specific requirements of catalyst design for each sub-reaction are discussed and we identify that, regardless of the method of dehydrogenation, the balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions in several ways. Acid strength and stability determine the likelihood of unwanted side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization, which can reduce catalyst activity and selectivity. Morphological characteristics, such as particle size, shape, and surface area, can affect the dispersion of active sites and the ease of reactant and product diffusion, impacting the catalytic efficiency. Strategies to optimize these properties include modifying the support to enhance metal-support interactions, adjust the surface acidity, and prevent sintering. For instance, adding metals like Sn or Ga to Pt-based catalysts can improve dispersion, reduce acidity, and inhibit coke formation. In Cr-based catalysts, controlling the Cr loading and the presence of promoting elements can alter the distribution of active Cr species. For Ga-based catalysts, the support type and Ga loading can influence the dispersion and stability of Ga species. The support material, such as mesoporous alumina or zeolites, can also affect the pore structure, which is crucial for mass transfer and preventing coke formation.

In oxidative dehydrogenation, the addition of oxygen allows for lower operating temperatures, which reduces energy consumption. However, the atom economy is lower than in direct dehydrogenation, as water is produced as a by-product. The choice of oxidant, whether O2, CO2, or N2O, can also influence the environmental impact and energy requirements of the process.

In the case of ODH-CO2, the high endothermicity of the reaction necessitates the inclusion of the mild endothermic reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium in favor of propene formation. This can allow for the use of lower reaction temperatures, but it also introduces the challenge of balancing the competing pathways of dry reforming of propane and coke formation.

The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for controlling the selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions. Too much acidity can promote unwanted reactions, while too little can limit the reaction rates. Optimizing this balance ensures that the catalyst can efficiently convert propane to propene without significant side reactions.

CO2 utilization in ODH-CO2 processes offers environmental benefits, but the carbon captured as CO2 can be repurposed in various syn-gas processes or converted back to CO2. The environmental impact depends on how the CO is subsequently used. For instance, if CO is used in a WGS reaction to produce hydrogen, the process becomes carbon-neutral. The source of CO2 is also important; capturing CO2 from the environment or recovering it from other CO2-producing processes can influence the overall carbon footprint.

The most active catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions often achieve high space-time yields (STY), but they may suffer from deactivation due to coke formation, especially in processes like direct dehydrogenation. Strategies to mitigate this issue include using supports with ordered mesoporosity, moderate surface acidity, and strong metalsupport interactions. Incorporating promoting elements can also enhance dispersion, stability, and selectivity.

In summary, the design and optimization of catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions involve balancing multiple factors, including the choice of metal, support, and promoter, as well as the surface chemistry of the catalyst. The goal is to maximize activity, selectivity, and stability while minimizing the formation of undesirable by-products.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特性，对脱氢反应的性能有多种影响。如酸强度和稳定性决定了不利副反应（如裂解、氢化裂解和异构化）的可能性，这些副反应会降低催化剂的活性和选择性。形态特性，如颗粒大小、形状和表面积，会影响活性位点的分散以及反应物和产物的扩散效率，从而影响催化效率。优化这些性质的策略包括通过修改支持来增强金属-支持相互作用、调整表面酸度，并防止结焦。例如，向铂基催化剂中添加Sn或Ga金属可以改善分散、减少酸度并抑制结焦。在Cr基催化剂中，控制Cr负载和促进元素的存在可以改变活性Cr物种的分布。对于Ga基催化剂，支持类型和Ga负载可以影响Ga物种的分散和稳定性。支持材料，如介孔氧化铝或沸石，也会影响孔结构，这对物质传输和防止结焦至关重要。

在氧化性脱氢中，氧气的加入允许使用较低的操作温度，这降低了能耗。然而，与直接脱氢相比，原子经济性较低，因为水作为副产品产生。选择氧化剂，无论是O2、CO2还是N2O，也可以影响过程的能量需求和环境影响。

对于ODH-CO2，由于反应的高吸热性，需要包含温和的吸热逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应以将热力学平衡倾向有利于丙烯形成。这可能允许使用较低的反应温度，但这也引入了平衡干丙烷重整和结焦路径的挑战。

催化剂表面的酸性和碱性平衡对于控制脱氢反应的选择性至关重要。过多的酸性可能导致不利反应，而过少的酸性可能限制反应速率。优化这种平衡确保催化剂能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时避免显著的副反应。

CO2在ODH-CO2过程中利用提供了环境效益，但捕获的碳作为CO2可以被各种合成气过程或转换回CO2重新利用。环境影响取决于CO的后续使用方式。例如，如果将CO用于WGS反应以生产氢气，则该过程成为碳中和。CO2的来源也很重要；从环境中捕获CO2或从其他CO2产生过程回收可以影响总体碳足迹。

最活跃的催化剂往往能够实现高的空间时间产率（STY），但它们可能会因结焦而失效，尤其是在直接脱氢过程中。为了缓解这一问题，可以使用具有有序介孔结构、适度表面酸度和强金属-支持相互作用的支持。引入促进元素也可以增强分散、稳定性和选择性。

总之，脱氢反应中催化剂的设计和优化涉及平衡多种因素，包括金属、支持和促进剂的选择，以及催化剂的表面化学。目标是最大化活性、选择性和稳定性，同时最小化不良副产品的生成。
