[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C."
[2] "It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C."
[3] "In situ DRIFTS analysis elucidated the mechanistic pathway, whereby a vanadium propyl intermediate is formed after propane activation and rapidly transforms to propenyl-vanadium."
[4] "The authors concluded that the relative proportions of V3+, V4+ and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface were affected by V loading and at the optimal loading of 12 wt%, a high concentration of isolated V3+ species was detected."
[5] "This is among the most active B catalysts reported to date."
[6] "The presence of boroxol ring and non-ring sites was proposed as the reason for activity at lower temperature, but the data presented does not differentiate between the two."

1. The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) was used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with a high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase. The crystallization temperature was varied between 25120 degrees Celsius.

2. The crystallization temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. This was due to the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 degrees Celsius.

3. In situ DRIFTS analysis revealed the mechanistic pathway involves the formation of a vanadium propyl intermediate after propane activation, which quickly transforms to propenyl-vanadium.

4. At the optimal loading of 12 wt%, the catalyst had a high concentration of isolated V3+ species, which affected the relative proportions of V3+, V4+, and V5+ species present on the catalyst surface.

5. The boron-based catalyst described is among the most active catalysts reported to date for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

6. The presence of boroxol ring and non-ring sites was suggested as the reason for activity at lower temperatures, but the data did not distinguish between the two types of sites.

1. 使用阳离子阴离子双水解方法（CADH）合成具有高比表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔Al2O3。结晶温度在25120摄氏度之间变化。

2. 支撑材料的结晶化温度直接影响了VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能。这是由于结晶化温度增加到100摄氏度时，Lewis酸位点数量增加的结果。

3. 原位DRIFTS分析揭示了反应机制：丙烷激活后形成钒丙基中间体，快速转化为丙烯基-钒。

4. 在12wt%的最佳负载下，催化剂中存在大量的孤立V3+物种，影响了催化剂表面V3+、V4+和V5+物种的比例。

5. 描述的硼基催化剂是迄今为止报告的用于丙烷氧化脱氢最活跃的催化剂之一。

6. 建议硼氧醇环和非环状结构的存在是低温活性的原因，但数据没有区分两种类型的结构。
