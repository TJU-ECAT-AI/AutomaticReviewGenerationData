[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C."
[2] "It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C."
[3] "Results from successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles."
[4] "The most active catalyst, V/Si-beta (having 3 wt% V loading) displayed an initial propene yield of 33.4% and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."
[5] "This was attributed to the low GHSV so while the catalyst achieved high selectivity at reasonable propane conversion, it was not as intrinsically active as other supported VOx catalysts."
[6] "The highest STY achieved was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 7)."
[7] "It was found that the dispersing action of Mg modification to V2O5 crystallites and an increase in active V3+ species reduced the amount and polymerization of coke deposits."
[8] "The combined and synergistic effect of the surface acidity modifications, their influence on the active V3+ species, and weakened metalsupport interactions facilitated desorption of propene and inhibited the deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke precursors."
[9] "This was almost twice the conversion reached with the unmodified catalyst."
[10] "It was hypothesised that the high WHSV did not allow for deep oxidation and therefore limited the formation of COx products."
[11] "The macroporous structure increased the performance significantly. The STY of macroporous BPO4 was 320 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 9, entry 6)."

1. The crystallization temperature affects the catalytic performance of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts by altering the number of Lewis acid sites on the support.

2. The V/Si-beta catalyst with 3 wt% V loading showed high initial propene yield and retained activity over multiple dehydrogenation cycles.

3. Low gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) allows for high selectivity but not as high intrinsic activity compared to other VOx catalysts.

4. The highest STY achieved for a catalyst was 7.8 molC3H6 kg1cat h1.

5. Mg modification improves catalytic performance by dispersing V2O5 crystallites and increasing the concentration of active V3+ species.

6. Surface acidity modifications, the influence on active V3+ species, and weakened metal-support interactions facilitate propene desorption and inhibit deep dehydrogenation.

7. The modified catalyst achieved nearly twice the conversion of the unmodified catalyst.

8. The macroporous structure of BPO4 catalyst significantly increased its performance.
