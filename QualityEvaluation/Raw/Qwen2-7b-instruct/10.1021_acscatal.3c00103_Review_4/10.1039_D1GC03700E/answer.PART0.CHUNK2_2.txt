[1] "The performance of catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions is influenced by their physicochemical properties, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics. 
[2] "Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity."
[3] "Physicochemical properties such as the number and type of acid sites, the dispersion of the active phase, and the presence of redox sites play critical roles in determining the catalytic activity of a catalyst."
[4] "Supports with weak and moderate surface acidity, along with promoting elements, can result in lower metal utilization, which is desirable for potentially industrially applicable catalysts."
[5] "Various strategies for support modification include the use of mixed metal oxides, intermetallic alloys, and the incorporation of non-noble metals or non-metallic elements like boron, gallium, copper, and nickel."
