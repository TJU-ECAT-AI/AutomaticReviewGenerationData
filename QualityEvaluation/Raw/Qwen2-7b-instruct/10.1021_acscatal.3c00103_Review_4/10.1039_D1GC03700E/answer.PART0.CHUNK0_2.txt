[1] "The nature of the support is an essential parameter to consider as several possible VOx can species exist."
[2] "It is generally accepted that the metalsupport (VOsupport) interactions affect the resultant catalyst performance."
[3] "It was shown that VOx/MCM-41 exhibited superior propene selectivity (above 90%) and stability during several successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles."
[4] "The authors observed a positive correlation between the rate of coke formation and the acidity of the support, as well as reporting that coke can actually catalyse the DDH reaction."
[5] "Additional studies attributed the dependence of coke formation on the degree of polymerization of VOx species over catalysts supported on a range of aluminosilicates, with differing SiO2 contents varying from 1 to 100 wt%."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability determine the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Morphological characteristics, such as particle size and shape, affect the surface area and the ease of reactant access, which in turn impacts the catalytic efficiency. 

2. Metal-support interactions are crucial in determining the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts. The type of metal and the support material can influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. The interaction can stabilize the metal species, enhance dispersion, and modulate the acidity of the support, affecting the reaction pathways and the stability of the catalyst.

3. VOx/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrate superior performance in dehydrogenation reactions, with high propene selectivity and remarkable stability during repeated dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. This indicates that the structure of the MCM-41 support plays a critical role in maintaining the catalytic activity of VOx species.

4. The rate of coke formation in dehydrogenation reactions correlates positively with the acidity of the support material. Moreover, coke can catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, which might explain the observed deactivation of catalysts. This suggests that controlling the acidity of the support could mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst stability.

5. The degree of polymerization of VOx species affects the susceptibility of catalysts to coke formation. Catalysts supported on aluminosilicates with varying SiO2 contents exhibit different coke formation tendencies depending on the size and structure of the V2O5 crystallites. Smaller, more dispersed VOx species are less prone to coke formation.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特性，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。化学特性如酸强度和稳定性决定了催化剂的反应性和选择性。形态特性，如颗粒大小和形状，影响表面积和反应物的接近程度，从而影响催化效率。

2. 金属-支撑（VO支持）相互作用是决定脱氢催化剂性能的关键因素。金属类型和支持材料可以影响催化活性和选择性。这种相互作用可以稳定金属物种、增强分散度并调节支撑的酸性，从而影响反应途径和催化剂的稳定性。

3. VOx/MCM-41催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出优越的性能，具有高丙烯选择性和在连续脱氢再生周期中的显著稳定性。这表明MCM-41支撑结构对于保持VOx物种的催化活性至关重要。

4. 脱氢反应中焦炭形成的速率与支撑材料的酸性成正比。此外，焦炭实际上可以催化脱氢反应，这可能解释了催化剂的观察到的失活现象。这表明控制支撑材料的酸性可以减少焦炭形成并增强催化剂稳定性。

5. VOx物种的聚合度影响催化剂焦炭形成的倾向。具有不同SiO2含量的铝硅酸盐支持催化剂显示出不同的焦炭形成趋势，这取决于V2O5晶粒的大小和结构。更小、更分散的VOx物种较不易形成焦炭。
