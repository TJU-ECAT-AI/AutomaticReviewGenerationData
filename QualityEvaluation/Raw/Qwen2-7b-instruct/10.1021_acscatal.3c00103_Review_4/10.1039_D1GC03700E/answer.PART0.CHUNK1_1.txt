[1] "Many studies have investigated VOx-based catalysts, which in some cases have been said to exhibit a catalyst performance similar to that of Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. However, comparing the typical STY values for VOx with those of CrOx or Pt, it is clear that the VOx catalysts reported in the literature are not as active as supported CrOx or Pt catalysts."
[2] "In the case of boron-based catalysts, elemental boron showed a remarkably high STY of 280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, which represented an improved productivity over BN-OH catalysts that had been previously described in the literature."
[3] "The use of acidic supports has been probed, as acidity has been shown to increase the activity of ODH-O2 catalysts. Supporting VOx supported on H-ZSM-5 was shown not to enhance performance since, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low V loadings. The support influence was detrimental to selectivity and overall lowered the propene yield."
[4] "It was found that increasing the Mg content led to a decrease in strong acid sites, decreasing activity, consistent with the fact that strong acid sites can activate propene."
[5] "The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, morphologies and loadings when compared to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."

1. VOx-based catalysts have been reported to perform similarly to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in some cases, but typically, the STY values for VOx catalysts are significantly lower compared to CrOx or Pt catalysts. 

2. Elemental boron has been found to exhibit the highest productivity among boron-based catalysts, achieving a STY of 280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1, surpassing the performance of previously reported BN-OH catalysts.

3. Supporting vanadia on H-ZSM-5 did not enhance performance, despite the acidity of the support increasing propane conversion for low vanadium loadings. The acidic support negatively impacted selectivity and overall propene yield.

4. Incorporating magnesium into the catalyst structure reduced the number of strong acid sites, which led to a decrease in activity. This is because strong acid sites are capable of activating propene.

5. The one-step synthesis method was demonstrated to increase productivity across various support materials, morphologies, and loadings, outperforming traditional surface loading techniques in catalyst preparation.

1.Vox基催化剂在某些情况下被报道与Pt-和CrOx基催化剂的性能相似，但通常Vox催化剂的STY值远低于CrOx或Pt催化剂。

2.纯硼表现出最高的生产力，实现了280 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1的STY，超过了之前文献中描述的BN-OH催化剂的性能。

3.将Vox支持在H-ZSM-5上并未增强性能，尽管酸性支持提高了低V负载量的丙烷转化率。酸性支持对选择性和总体丙烯产率产生了负面影响。

4.将镁引入催化剂结构减少了强酸中心的数量，导致活性下降。这是因为强酸中心能够激活丙烯。

5.一步合成方法被证明可以提高不同支持材料、形态和负载量的生产力，优于传统的表面加载技术。
