[5] "The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilized (typically 450-550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions in several ways. Acid strength and stability determine the likelihood of unwanted side reactions, such as cracking, hydrogenolysis, and isomerization, which can reduce catalyst activity and selectivity. Morphological characteristics, such as particle size, shape, and surface area, can affect the dispersion of active sites and the ease of reactant and product diffusion, impacting the catalytic efficiency. Strategies to optimize these properties include modifying the support to enhance metal-support interactions, adjust the surface acidity, and prevent sintering. For instance, adding metals like Sn or Ga to Pt-based catalysts can improve dispersion, reduce acidity, and inhibit coke formation. In Cr-based catalysts, controlling the Cr loading and the presence of promoting elements can alter the distribution of active Cr species. For Ga-based catalysts, the support type and Ga loading can influence the dispersion and stability of Ga species. The support material, such as mesoporous alumina or zeolites, can also affect the pore structure, which is crucial for mass transfer and preventing coke formation.

In oxidative dehydrogenation, the addition of oxygen allows for lower operating temperatures, which reduces energy consumption. However, the atom economy is lower than in direct dehydrogenation, as water is produced as a by-product. The choice of oxidant, whether O2, CO2, or N2O, can also influence the environmental impact and energy requirements of the process.

In the case of ODH-CO2, the high endothermicity of the reaction necessitates the inclusion of the mild endothermic reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium in favor of propene formation. This can allow for the use of lower reaction temperatures, but it also introduces the challenge of balancing the competing pathways of dry reforming of propane and coke formation.

The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for controlling the selectivity of dehydrogenation reactions. Too much acidity can promote unwanted reactions, while too little can limit the reaction rates. Optimizing this balance ensures that the catalyst can efficiently convert propane to propene without significant side reactions.

CO2 utilization in ODH-CO2 processes offers environmental benefits, but the carbon captured as CO2 can be repurposed in various syn-gas processes or converted back to CO2. The environmental impact depends on how the CO is subsequently used. For instance, if CO is used in a WGS reaction to produce hydrogen, the process becomes carbon-neutral. The source of CO2 is also important; capturing CO2 from the environment or recovering it from other CO2-producing processes can influence the overall carbon footprint.

The most active catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions often achieve high space-time yields (STY), but they may suffer from deactivation due to coke formation, especially in processes like direct dehydrogenation. Strategies to mitigate this issue include using supports with ordered mesoporosity, moderate surface acidity, and strong metalsupport interactions. Incorporating promoting elements can also enhance dispersion, stability, and selectivity.

In summary, the design and optimization of catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions involve balancing multiple factors, including the choice of metal, support, and promoter, as well as the surface chemistry of the catalyst. The goal is to maximize activity, selectivity, and stability while minimizing the formation of undesirable by-products.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特性，对脱氢反应的性能有多种影响。如酸强度和稳定性决定了不利副反应（如裂解、氢化裂解和异构化）的可能性，这些副反应会降低催化剂的活性和选择性。形态特性，如颗粒大小、形状和表面积，会影响活性位点的分散以及反应物和产物的扩散效率，从而影响催化效率。优化这些性质的策略包括通过修改支持来增强金属-支持相互作用、调整表面酸度，并防止结焦。例如，向铂基催化剂中添加Sn或Ga金属可以改善分散、减少酸度并抑制结焦。在Cr基催化剂中，控制Cr负载和促进元素的存在可以改变活性Cr物种的分布。对于Ga基催化剂，支持类型和Ga负载可以影响Ga物种的分散和稳定性。支持材料，如介孔氧化铝或沸石，也会影响孔结构，这对物质传输和防止结焦至关重要。

在氧化性脱氢中，氧气的加入允许使用较低的操作温度，这降低了能耗。然而，与直接脱氢相比，原子经济性较低，因为水作为副产品产生。选择氧化剂，无论是O2、CO2还是N2O，也可以影响过程的能量需求和环境影响。

对于ODH-CO2，由于反应的高吸热性，需要包含温和的吸热逆向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应以将热力学平衡倾向有利于丙烯形成。这可能允许使用较低的反应温度，但这也引入了平衡干丙烷重整和结焦路径的挑战。

催化剂表面的酸性和碱性平衡对于控制脱氢反应的选择性至关重要。过多的酸性可能导致不利反应，而过少的酸性可能限制反应速率。优化这种平衡确保催化剂能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时避免显著的副反应。

CO2在ODH-CO2过程中利用提供了环境效益，但捕获的碳作为CO2可以被各种合成气过程或转换回CO2重新利用。环境影响取决于CO的后续使用方式。例如，如果将CO用于WGS反应以生产氢气，则该过程成为碳中和。CO2的来源也很重要；从环境中捕获CO2或从其他CO2产生过程回收可以影响总体碳足迹。

最活跃的催化剂往往能够实现高的空间时间产率（STY），但它们可能会因结焦而失效，尤其是在直接脱氢过程中。为了缓解这一问题，可以使用具有有序介孔结构、适度表面酸度和强金属-支持相互作用的支持。引入促进元素也可以增强分散、稳定性和选择性。

总之，脱氢反应中催化剂的设计和优化涉及平衡多种因素，包括金属、支持和促进剂的选择，以及催化剂的表面化学。目标是最大化活性、选择性和稳定性，同时最小化不良副产品的生成。
