[1] "The majority of studies focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2."
[3] "While it seems as though the addition of CO2 would be detrimental on this basis, the removal of hydrogen via the RWGS reaction favourably shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to enable higher propene yields."
[4] "The thermodynamic tendency to form undesirable by-products means that such reactions must be carefully kinetically controlled. Careful catalyst design can inhibit and even switch-off some of these side-reactions."
[5] "The superiority of Pt as a DDH catalyst over other transition metals was recently illustrated by Araujo-Lopez et al. who used DFT calculations to measure the transition state energy for non-oxidative (and oxidative) CH bond activation."
[6] "The dissociative adsorption of propane and the CH cleavage steps have been suggested as being rate-limiting, although this depends on the catalyst."
[7] "Over the course of five dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the CrAl-800 catalyst demonstrated superior regenerative ability, and the initial STY was 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1."
[8] "The authors postulated the main active site for CH activation was Ga3+ embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework."
[9] "It was found that low Cr loadings contribute to the dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, with some Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also being observed."
[10] "However, the catalyst deactivated quickly due to carbon deposition, but retained its initial activity over the course of ten successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

1. Physicochemical properties such as acid strength, stability, and morphology of catalysts influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting reaction rates, selectivity, and the propensity for side-reactions. Morphological modifications can enhance dispersion, control surface area, and optimize the interaction between the active species and reactants. Supporting materials with appropriate acidity can suppress unwanted side-reactions, while promoting active sites.

2. Catalysts with a low Cr loading tend to disperse monomeric Cr6+ species, which enhances catalytic activity. The presence of Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also contributes to the dispersion and stability of the catalyst.

3. The addition of O2 to oxidative dehydrogenation enables lower reaction temperatures and reduces energy costs compared to direct dehydrogenation. The thermodynamic equilibrium shifts favorably for propene production.

4. Catalysts must be designed with careful consideration to inhibit and control side-reactions, such as coke formation and cracking, which can negatively impact performance.

5. Platinum (Pt) has been found to be highly effective in dehydrogenation reactions due to its ability to activate CH bonds. Pt-based catalysts can be enhanced with promoters like Sn and Ga, which improve dispersion, selectivity, and stability.

6. The dissociative adsorption of propane and the CH cleavage steps are rate-limiting processes in dehydrogenation reactions. Catalyst particle size affects the reactivity of propane, with smaller particles promoting higher selectivity and stability.

7. A catalyst with a high initial STY of 60 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 was observed after five dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, indicating robust regenerative ability.

8. Gallium (Ga) embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework acts as an active site for CH activation in dehydrogenation reactions, contributing to high activity and selectivity.

9. Low Cr loadings promote the dispersion of monomeric Cr6+ species, which enhances catalytic activity. Cr3+ species and coordinative vacancies also play a role in dispersion and stability.

10. Despite quick deactivation due to carbon deposition, catalysts can maintain initial activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in prolonging life.
