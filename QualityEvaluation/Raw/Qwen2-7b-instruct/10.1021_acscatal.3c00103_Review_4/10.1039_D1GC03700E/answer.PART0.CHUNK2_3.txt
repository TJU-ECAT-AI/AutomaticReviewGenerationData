[1] "It was shown that NiMoO4 had enhanced ODH-O2 performance when comparing mesoporous to bulk catalysts, but only due to the enhanced number of active sites related to the increased surface area, and not the improved mass transfer properties that usually accompany mesoporosity."
[2] "This confirmed that MoO3 exhibits favourable activity to NiMoO4 for the ODH-O2 reaction (Table 10, entry 7)."
[3] "However, propene was still not the major product over NiO at around 10% conversion, suggesting that NiO-based catalysts are limited in their application for ODH-O2."
[4] "The NiO-polyoxometalates have been shown to stabilise the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, which would limit overoxidation,227 leading to the conclusion that NiO oxygen is too labile to achieve a high selectivity."
[5] "This is due to the polymeric phosphates weaker interaction with propene when compared to NiO nanoparticles, leading to a higher desorption rate and therefore higher selectivity."
[6] "While oxygen vacancies are necessary to activate oxygen, they decreased selectivity in the absence of HCl,231 which is why CeO2 was shown to have a much lower selectivity without the presence of HCl; a change of active species from oxygen vacancies to Cl radical like species, has been shown to increase selectivity without a large detrimental effect on conversion."
[7] "There was no correlation between reducibility and catalyst performance, suggesting that redox properties are not rate-determining in these ODH-O2 catalysts."
[8] "This new route to propene shows promise and enhances our understanding of selectivity patterns."
[9] "The materials were shown to be activated in a similar way to h-BN, forming the proposed active site, i.e., carbonyl bonds, on the surface under oxidative conditions."
[10] "The activity of the catalyst in this study was shown to be much larger than the more commonly used vanadia-based catalysts, whilst showing a higher selectivity."
[11] "The key to an increased activity was due to the under-coordinated Pt cluster strongly adsorbing the propane when compared to an extended Pt surface, confirmed by catalytic data which was in agreement with DFT."
[12] "Conversion largely depended on the C3H8:O2 ratio: an increase in propane conversion was found with an increase in O2 concentration relative to propane concentration, but too high an oxygen concentration caused overoxidation to COx."

1. The mesoporous NiMoO4 catalyst exhibited enhanced performance in ODH-O2 compared to bulk catalysts, mainly due to the increased number of active sites from the larger surface area, not improved mass transfer.

2. MoO3 showed favorable activity for the ODH-O2 reaction compared to NiMoO4.

3. NiO-based catalysts were found to be limited in their application for ODH-O2 due to propene not being the major product at around 10% conversion.

4. The NiO-polyoxometalates helped stabilize the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, preventing overoxidation and indicating NiO's labile oxygen.

5. Polymeric phosphates interacted weaker with propene than NiO nanoparticles, leading to faster desorption and higher selectivity.

6. Oxygen vacancies decreased selectivity in the absence of HCl, but switching to Cl radical-like species increased selectivity without significant conversion loss.

7. Redox properties were not the rate-determining factor in these ODH-O2 catalysts.

8. The new route to propene improved selectivity patterns.

9. The materials were activated similarly to h-BN, forming carbonyl bonds on the surface under oxidative conditions.

10. The under-coordinated Pt cluster catalyst showed higher activity and selectivity compared to vanadia-based catalysts.

11. The under-coordinated Pt cluster strongly adsorbed propane, enhancing activity, as confirmed by both catalytic data and DFT simulations.

12. The catalyst's performance was highly dependent on the C3H8:O2 ratio; increasing the oxygen concentration relative to propane concentration improved propane conversion, but too much oxygen led to overoxidation to COx products.

1. 纳米孔型NiMoO4催化剂在ODH-O2反应中的性能优于块状催化剂，主要是由于纳米孔带来的更大表面积导致的活性位点增加，而不是质量传递性能的改善。

2. MoO3对于ODH-O2反应显示出比NiMoO4更优的活性。

3. NiO基催化剂在ODH-O2反应中应用受限，因为丙烯并不是主要产物，转化率约为10%。

4. NiO-polyoxometalates通过稳定表面吸附的氧原子，防止过氧化，表明NiO的氧原子不稳定。

5. 聚合磷酸盐与丙烯的相互作用弱于NiO纳米颗粒，导致更快的脱附和更高的选择性。

6. 氧空位在没有HCl的情况下降低了选择性，但切换到Cl类似物的活性物种在不显著影响转化率的情况下提高了选择性。

7. 还原性性质不是这些ODH-O2催化剂的速率决定因素。

8. 新的丙烯生成途径改进了选择性模式。

9. 材料在氧化条件下以类似于h-BN的方式激活，形成表面的羰基键。

10. 未协调的Pt簇催化剂与扩展的Pt表面相比，强烈吸附丙烷，增强活性，这一发现得到了催化数据和DFT模拟的支持。

11. 高活性和选择性的Pt簇催化剂的性能明显优于vanadia基催化剂。

12. 催化剂的性能高度依赖于C3H8:O2的比例；增加氧气相对于丙烷的浓度提高了丙烷转化率，但过多的氧气导致COx产品的过氧化。
