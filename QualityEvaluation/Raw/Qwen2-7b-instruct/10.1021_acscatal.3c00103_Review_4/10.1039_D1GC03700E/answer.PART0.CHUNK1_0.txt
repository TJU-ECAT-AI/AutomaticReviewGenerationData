[1] "A study of the effects of catalyst physicochemical properties on dehydrogenation reactions was conducted. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions."
[2] "It was found that acidic supports inherently decrease V dispersion, thus decreasing selectivity and overall productivity despite increasing activity."
[3] "More frequently, there are reports of dispersion being influenced by the preparation technique, with grafting vanadia onto the support surface showing promise."
[4] "In contrast, incipient-wetness techniques can still be improved, with hydration of the surface or doping being effective strategies."
[5] "The choice of support material composition and chemical properties is more influential than morphology on overall catalytic performance; many studies comparing mesoporous catalysts with bulk-like morphologies found mesoporosity to have either a detrimental or negligible effect on productivity."
[6] "Porosity can, however, increase specific surface area and therefore support a higher loading of isolated vanadia sites."
[7] "In conclusion, vanadia catalysts have been extensively investigated for ODH-O2, with the main focus being on maximising the number of isolated vanadia species, which is fundamental to increasing propene selectivity."
[8] "A one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, in contrast to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."
[9] "The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, in contrast to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."
[10] "Increasing selectivity via dispersion techniques may be deemed a more promising route to improving catalytic performance."

Physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity include modifying the support. Techniques such as grafting vanadia onto the support surface, hydration of the surface, doping, and one-step synthesis methods can improve dispersion, thereby increasing selectivity. The choice of support material composition and chemical properties plays a crucial role in overall catalytic performance, and the morphology of the catalyst can have a detrimental or negligible effect on productivity. Porosity can increase specific surface area and support a higher loading of isolated vanadia sites, which is fundamental to increasing propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度、稳定性等化学特性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。为了提高催化效率和选择性，优化这些性质的策略包括改变支持物的方法。例如，将钒化物附着在支撑表面上、表面水分化、掺杂以及一步合成方法可以改善分散性，从而提高选择性。支撑材料的选择及其化学性质在整体催化性能中起着关键作用，而催化剂的形态可能对生产力产生负面或微不足道的影响。孔隙度可以增加特定表面积并支持更高负载的孤立钒化物位点，这是提高氧化脱氢反应丙烯选择性的基础。
