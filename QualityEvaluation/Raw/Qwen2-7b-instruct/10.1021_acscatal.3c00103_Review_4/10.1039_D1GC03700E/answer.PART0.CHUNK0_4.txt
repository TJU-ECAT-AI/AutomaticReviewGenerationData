[1] "The majority of analyses focus on well-established processes, where more information and data are available, but no such analyses were found for oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "The addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures to be utilised (typically 450550 C) and is exothermic, meaning the energy costs of sustaining the reaction temperature are less than those in DDH and ODH-CO2."
[3] "While it seems as though the addition of CO2 would be detrimental on this basis, the removal of hydrogen via the RWGS reaction favourably shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to enable higher propene yields."
[4] "The enhanced performance was ascribed to the moderate surface acidity of B-ZrO2 (Table 3, entry 2)."
[5] "However, the most common deactivation pathway is coking, which can cause sintering in both the support and Cr."
[6] "This was attributed to differences in surface acidity between supports, with strong acid sites largely determining the dispersion of Ga species, as well as inducing adverse side reactions."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the addition of O2 enables lower operating temperatures, reducing energy costs. The balance of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface is of paramount importance, as seen in the influence of surface acidity on the dispersion of Ga species and the induction of adverse side reactions.

2. Morphological characteristics of catalysts, such as particle size and support structure, play a significant role in determining their performance. The particle size affects the reactivity of propane, with smaller particles generally showing higher activity and selectivity. The support structure, like the presence of mesopores, can enhance mass transfer and stability.

3. To optimize catalyst properties, support modification strategies can be employed. These might include the introduction of specific functionalities to the support, such as the addition of promoters or the use of supports with ordered mesoporosity. These modifications can influence the dispersion of active species, the interaction between the metal and support, and the surface acidity, all of which are critical for catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能产生影响。例如，氧气的加入可以降低操作温度，从而减少维持反应温度所需的能量成本。催化剂表面的酸碱平衡对于活性物种的分散至关重要，这在Ga物种的分散性和诱导不利副反应中得到了体现。

2. 催化剂的形态特性，如颗粒大小和支持结构，对性能有显著影响。颗粒大小影响丙烷的反应性，较小的颗粒通常显示出更高的活性和选择性。支持结构，如微孔的存在，可以增强质量传输并提高稳定性。

3. 可以采用支持改性策略来优化催化剂性能。这些策略可能包括向支持引入特定功能，如添加促进剂或使用具有有序介孔的支持。这些修改可以影响活性物种的分散、金属与支持之间的相互作用以及表面酸度，这些都是催化效率和选择性的关键因素。
