[1] "The most common deactivation pathway is coking, which can cause sintering in both the support and Cr."
[2] "It was shown that AlV sites facilitate high dispersion of the active Pt and Ga ions, and result in strong metalsupport interactions."
[3] "The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) reduces Brnsted and increases Lewis acid sites in the preparation Ga/MFI catalysts, which resulted in improved performance."

1. The most common deactivation pathway in dehydrogenation reactions is coking, which affects both the support and chromium components of the catalyst. This process leads to sintering of the catalyst materials.

2. AlV sites play a crucial role in enhancing the dispersion of active Pt and Ga ions and strengthening the interaction between the metal and the support, thereby contributing to the catalyst's performance.

3. Incorporating 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) into the preparation of Ga/MFI catalysts can reduce Brnsted acid sites and increase Lewis acid sites, leading to improved catalytic performance.

1. 在脱氢反应中，催化剂最常见的失活途径是结焦，这会导致支持材料和铬成分的结块。这一过程导致催化剂材料的结块。

2. AlV位点在促进活性Pt和Ga离子的分散以及加强金属与支撑材料之间的相互作用方面发挥着关键作用，从而有助于催化剂性能的提升。

3. 将3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷（MPS）引入Ga/MFI催化剂的制备过程中可以减少Brnsted酸位点并增加Lewis酸位点，从而带来更好的催化性能。
