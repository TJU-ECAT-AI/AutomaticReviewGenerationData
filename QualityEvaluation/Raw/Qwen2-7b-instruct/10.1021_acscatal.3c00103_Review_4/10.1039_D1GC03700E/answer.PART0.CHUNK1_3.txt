[1] "The choice of support material composition and chemical properties is more influential than morphology on overall catalytic performance; many studies comparing mesoporous catalysts with bulk-like morphologies found mesoporosity to have either a detrimental or negligible effect on productivity."
[2] "A more precise view of vanadia species in recent studies has shown isolated vanadia sites to be more selective than polymeric species which contain VOV bridging bonds."
[3] "Increasing selectivity via dispersion techniques may be deemed a more promising route to improving catalytic performance."
[4] "Porosity can, however, increase specific surface area and therefore support a higher loading of isolated vanadia sites."
[5] "The one-step synthesis method was shown to improve productivity for different support materials, in contrast to analogous catalysts formed with more traditional surface loading techniques."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly the chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and the morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The composition and chemical properties of the support material have a greater impact on overall catalytic performance than its morphology. Many studies indicate that mesoporosity can either negatively impact or have little effect on productivity. Recent research has revealed that isolated vanadia sites are more selective than polymeric vanadia species, which contain VOV bridging bonds. Increasing selectivity through dispersion techniques is considered a promising approach to improving catalytic performance. Porosity can increase the specific surface area, thereby supporting a higher loading of isolated vanadia sites. One-step synthesis methods have been shown to improve productivity across various support materials, contrasting with traditional surface loading techniques.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是诸如酸强度和稳定性等化学特性，以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能产生重大影响。可以采用支持修改策略来优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性。支持材料的组成和化学性质对整体催化性能的影响大于其形态。许多研究指出，介孔结构可能对生产力产生不利影响或几乎没有影响。最近的研究发现，孤立的钒化物位点比包含VOV桥接键的聚集体更具有选择性。通过分散技术增加选择性被认为是提高催化性能的一种有前景的方法。孔隙度可以通过增加特定表面积来支持更高负载的孤立钒化物位点。一步合成方法已被证明可以改善各种支持材料的生产力，与传统的表面加载技术形成对比。
