[1] "Although low dehydrogenation barrier indicates high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst, too high dehydrogenation activity might result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which in the worst case results in undesired coke formation."
[2] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes. Recently developed BEP or other linear scaling relationships connect transition states, which are computationally expensive to be located, with simply calculated parameters or so called descriptors, such as reaction energies or binding energies."
[3] "The complexity of the systems mentioned above seems to beyond the ability to completely scan the potential energy surfaces to a large extent with DFT calculations, which limits most of the current studies which focus to understand one aspect of the catalyst instead of the complete picture of dehydrogenation."

1. Catalysts with low dehydrogenation barriers show high activity in dehydrogenation reactions. However, excessively high dehydrogenation activity can lead to uncontrollable deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, potentially causing coke formation.
2. The aim of theoretical studies is to pinpoint the most effective catalysts for specific chemical processes. Linear scaling relationships, like the BEP, simplify the process by linking transition states to easily calculated parameters, such as reaction energies or binding energies.
3. Current computational methods struggle to comprehensively analyze the potential energy surfaces of complex catalytic systems, limiting the ability to fully understand the catalyst's performance across all aspects of dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 催化剂的低脱氢化壁垒表明其在脱氢反应中的高活性。然而，过高的脱氢化活性可能导致烃类深度脱氢，最坏的情况下会形成焦炭。
2. 理论研究的目标是确定特定化学过程的最佳催化剂。最近开发的BEP或其他线性尺度关系简化了过渡态的计算，将其与易于计算的参数（如反应能或结合能）关联起来。
3. 当前的计算方法难以全面分析复杂催化系统的潜在能量表面，限制了对催化剂性能进行全面理解的能力，尤其是在脱氢化反应的各个方面。
