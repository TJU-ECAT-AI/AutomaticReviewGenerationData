1. The ultimate aim of theoretical studies is to pinpoint the most efficient catalysts for specific chemical processes.
2. The strength of binding is also linked to the size of the cluster, apart from variations in coordination number.
3. Vang et al. used a straightforward reaction pathway to evaluate the selectivity of ethylene dehydrogenation and cracking on Ni surfaces.
4. The initial dehydrogenation activity on PtIr(111) is elevated, featuring a lower D1 barrier of 53 kJ mol1 compared to 82 kJ mol1 on Pt(111) and 90 kJ mol1 on Ir(111).
5. The adsorption of carbon atoms onto the surface of a NiAu alloy is thermodynamically less favorable, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than on a pure Ni(111) surface.
6. The predominant commercial PDH catalysts consist of supported platinum or chromium oxide.

1. 理论研究的最终目标是确定特定化学过程的最佳催化剂。
2. 结合簇的大小以及不同配位数的影响，吸附力也与之相关联。
3. Vang等人通过使用简单的反应途径来评估镍表面的乙烯脱氢和裂解选择性。
4. 在PtIr(111)上的初始脱氢活性更高，D1步的能垒为53 kJ/mol，低于Pt(111)的82 kJ/mol和Ir(111)的90 kJ/mol。
5. 将碳原子吸附到NiAu合金表面比纯Ni(111)表面更不有利，能垒至少降低了23 kJ/mol。
6. 主要的商业PDH催化剂包括负载型铂或铬酸盐。
