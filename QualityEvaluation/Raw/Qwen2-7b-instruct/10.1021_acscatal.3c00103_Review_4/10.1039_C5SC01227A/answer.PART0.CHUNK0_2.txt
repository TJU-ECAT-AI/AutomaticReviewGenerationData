[1] "Understanding the mechanism for the activation of CH bonds in hydrocarbons provides fundamental insights into this process and a guideline for the optimization of catalysts used for the processing of light alkanes."
[2] "The origins of coking formation are also discussed followed by a perspective on directions of future research."
[3] "Although low dehydrogenation barrier indicates high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst, too high dehydrogenation activity might result in uncontrolled deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, which in the worst case results in undesired coke formation."
[4] "The ultimate goal for theoretical studies is to identify optimal catalysts for particular chemical processes."
[5] "Although there are other metallic reforming catalysts such as Ru and Rh, which are less strongly prone to coking than Ni,129 Ni is one of the most common reforming catalysts, which is partly due to its significantly cheaper price."
