The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the case of the PtGa nanoalloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15, their high activity and stability are attributed to these properties. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 facilitates efficient diffusion pathways for reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance.
