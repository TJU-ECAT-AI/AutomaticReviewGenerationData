Alkali-metal-ions promoted Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with high selectivity and resistance to coking in the conversion of furfural toward furfural alcohol. Detailed characterizations demonstrated modification of alkali-metal ions on acid sites. Alkaline ion modified Zr-Al-Beta high-selectively convert furfural under high concentration. Alkaline treatment to zeolites was proved possibility of potential application.

FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on them at low temperature was investigated. With the increasing CO pressure, Zr-Al-Beta sample exhibits two major bands at 2190 cm1 and 2174 cm1 successively, which are attributed to CO adsorbed over the open Zr Lewis sites and Brnsted acid sites Si-O(H)-Al respectively. After alkaline treatment, the disappearance of adsorption band at 2174 cm-1 on M+-Zr-Al-Beta (M = Li, Na, K) zeolites indicates the elimination or transformation of Brnsted acid sites by the ion exchange.

Different heterogeneous catalysts were applied to the MPV reduction of furfural (FUR) with isopropanol, in which furfuryl alcohol (FAL) could be obtained as main product. As shown in Table 2, when using Al-Beta as catalyst, FUR conversion reaches only 18.8% after reaction at 120 C for 3 h and no FAL can be acquired. After the incorporation of Zr atom in Al-Beta, FUR conversion on it improves greatly at the same reaction time, but the FPE still is the main product. This demonstrates that the Zr Lewis sites possess high activity and can catalyze both the MPV reduction of FUR and subsequent etherification of FAL.

Typically, the FUR conversion for Na+-Al-Beta increases to 46.0% from 18.8% of Al-Beta within reaction time of 3 h. Moreover, FAL rather than FPE becomes the primary product; this implies that the Brnsted acid sites in Al-Beta are successfully transformed into weak Lewis acid sites, which can perform the MPV reduction of FUR toward FAL but not further etherification of FAL.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by adjusting the acid sites on the catalyst surfaces.

2. The alkali metal ions promoted the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, enhancing its selectivity and resistance to coking in the conversion of furfural to furfural alcohol. This was demonstrated through detailed characterization methods, showing the modification of alkali metal ions on the acid sites of the zeolite.

3. The MPV reduction of furfural with isopropanol was performed using various catalysts, where furfuryl alcohol was the main product. The Zr Lewis sites were found to have high activity, catalyzing both the reduction and subsequent etherification of furfural.

4. The introduction of alkali metal ions to the Al-Beta catalyst led to a significant improvement in furfural conversion. The Brnsted acid sites were successfully transformed into weak Lewis acid sites, enabling the MPV reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol while inhibiting further etherification.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。可以通过调整催化剂表面的酸位来优化这些性质，以提高催化效率和选择性。

2. 通过简单的碱处理过程，可以调节Zr-Al-Beta沸石的活性位点，显著增强其在将糠醛转化为糠醇的反应中的选择性和抗结焦能力。这通过详细的表征方法得到了证明，显示了碱金属离子对沸石酸位的修饰作用。

3. 使用各种催化剂进行糠醛与异丙醇的MPV还原反应，糠醇成为主要产物。Zr Lewis位点被发现具有高活性，既能催化糠醛的还原反应，又能促进后续的糠醇醚化反应。

4. 将碱金属离子引入Al-Beta催化剂中导致糠醛转化率显著提高。Brnsted酸位成功转变为弱Lewis酸位，使得糠醛能够进行MPV还原反应生成糠醇，同时抑制进一步的糠醇醚化反应。
