[1] "In the present study, a simple alkaline treatment to the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite in alcoholic solution of alkali metal hydroxide was conducted."
[2] "The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly."
[3] "The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration."
[4] "Furthermore, among three alkaline ions, the Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites decreased with their alkalinity orders of LiOH < NaOH < KOH, and so led to their different catalytic activities and product selectivity in FUR conversion."
[5] "An appropriate treatment concentration of alkaline ions was required, and the optimum reaction result was obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the strength and stability of acid sites, and the morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the untreated Zr-Al-Beta zeolite showed poor product selectivity and high coke formation during the reduction of furfural and isopropanol. However, after undergoing an alkaline treatment, the catalyst's performance notably improved, demonstrating enhanced resistance to deactivation and coke formation. The optimal reaction outcome, achieving a 97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at a 99.6% conversion of furfural, was achieved using 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta. The Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites decreased with the order of alkalinity: LiOH < NaOH < KOH, leading to variations in catalytic activities and product selectivities. An appropriate concentration of alkaline ions is crucial, with the best results observed at 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如酸位强度和稳定性以及形貌特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。例如，在未处理的Zr-Al-Beta沸石中，产物选择性差且产生大量焦炭。然而，经过碱处理后，催化剂性能明显提高，显示出增强的失活和焦炭形成抵抗能力。在固定点条件下，获得最优反应结果，即97.3%的糠醇产率和99.6%的糠醛转化率，使用的是0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta。M+-Zr-Al-Beta沸石的Lewis酸性随碱性顺序降低：LiOH < NaOH < KOH，导致催化活性和产物选择性的变化。合适的碱离子浓度至关重要，最佳结果出现在0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta。
