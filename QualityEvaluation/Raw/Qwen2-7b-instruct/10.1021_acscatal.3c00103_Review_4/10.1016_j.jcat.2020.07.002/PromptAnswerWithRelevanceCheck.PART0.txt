Alkali-metal-ions promoted Zr-Al-Beta zeolite with high selectivity and resistance to coking in the conversion of furfural toward furfural alcohol. Detailed characterizations demonstrated modification of alkali-metal ions on acid sites. Alkaline ion modified Zr-Al-Beta high-selectively convert furfural under high concentration. Alkaline treatment to zeolites was proved possibility of potential application.

FTIR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on them at low temperature was investigated. With the increasing CO pressure, Zr-Al-Beta sample exhibits two major bands at 2190 cm1 and 2174 cm1 successively, which are attributed to CO adsorbed over the open Zr Lewis sites and Brnsted acid sites Si-O(H)-Al respectively. After alkaline treatment, the disappearance of adsorption band at 2174 cm-1 on M+-Zr-Al-Beta (M = Li, Na, K) zeolites indicates the elimination or transformation of Brnsted acid sites by the ion exchange.

Different heterogeneous catalysts were applied to the MPV reduction of furfural (FUR) with isopropanol, in which furfuryl alcohol (FAL) could be obtained as main product. As shown in Table 2, when using Al-Beta as catalyst, FUR conversion reaches only 18.8% after reaction at 120 C for 3 h and no FAL can be acquired. After the incorporation of Zr atom in Al-Beta, FUR conversion on it improves greatly at the same reaction time, but the FPE still is the main product. This demonstrates that the Zr Lewis sites possess high activity and can catalyze both the MPV reduction of FUR and subsequent etherification of FAL.

Typically, the FUR conversion for Na+-Al-Beta increases to 46.0% from 18.8% of Al-Beta within reaction time of 3 h. Moreover, FAL rather than FPE becomes the primary product; this implies that the Brnsted acid sites in Al-Beta are successfully transformed into weak Lewis acid sites, which can perform the MPV reduction of FUR toward FAL but not further etherification of FAL.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by adjusting the acid sites on the catalyst surfaces.

2. The alkali metal ions promoted the Zr-Al-Beta zeolite, enhancing its selectivity and resistance to coking in the conversion of furfural to furfural alcohol. This was demonstrated through detailed characterization methods, showing the modification of alkali metal ions on the acid sites of the zeolite.

3. The MPV reduction of furfural with isopropanol was performed using various catalysts, where furfuryl alcohol was the main product. The Zr Lewis sites were found to have high activity, catalyzing both the reduction and subsequent etherification of furfural.

4. The introduction of alkali metal ions to the Al-Beta catalyst led to a significant improvement in furfural conversion. The Brnsted acid sites were successfully transformed into weak Lewis acid sites, enabling the MPV reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol while inhibiting further etherification.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine the reaction rates and selectivities, while morphological characteristics affect the accessibility of reactants to active sites and the diffusion of products. Modification strategies such as adjusting the concentration of alkali metal ions, dealinguminating the catalyst, or using an alcoholic solution can alter these properties, thus optimizing catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the stability of catalysts against deactivation and coking, as well as their selectivity towards desired products, are crucial factors.

2. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. This includes the introduction of alkali-metal ions, which can transform and weaken the acidic sites of the catalyst, thereby promoting its catalytic performance and reducing coking. The concentration of the alkaline solution used for modification also plays a role in determining the catalytic performance, as it correlates with the acidity and textual properties of the catalyst.

3. The optimal performance is achieved when the catalyst contains the right type of alkali-metal ions and is treated with a suitable concentration of alkaline solution. In this case, 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta is found to provide the best results, achieving a 97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at a 99.6% conversion of furfural, with high tolerance to the furfural concentration.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the strength and stability of acid sites, and the morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the untreated Zr-Al-Beta zeolite showed poor product selectivity and high coke formation during the reduction of furfural and isopropanol. However, after undergoing an alkaline treatment, the catalyst's performance notably improved, demonstrating enhanced resistance to deactivation and coke formation. The optimal reaction outcome, achieving a 97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at a 99.6% conversion of furfural, was achieved using 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta. The Lewis acidities of M+-Zr-Al-Beta zeolites decreased with the order of alkalinity: LiOH < NaOH < KOH, leading to variations in catalytic activities and product selectivities. An appropriate concentration of alkaline ions is crucial, with the best results observed at 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如酸位强度和稳定性以及形貌特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。例如，在未处理的Zr-Al-Beta沸石中，产物选择性差且产生大量焦炭。然而，经过碱处理后，催化剂性能明显提高，显示出增强的失活和焦炭形成抵抗能力。在固定点条件下，获得最优反应结果，即97.3%的糠醇产率和99.6%的糠醛转化率，使用的是0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta。M+-Zr-Al-Beta沸石的Lewis酸性随碱性顺序降低：LiOH < NaOH < KOH，导致催化活性和产物选择性的变化。合适的碱离子浓度至关重要，最佳结果出现在0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta。
