<p>The modification of alkali-metal ions on both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites in Zr-Al-Beta was evidenced by XPS and FT-IR spectroscopy (CO and pyridine).</p>
<p>The untreated materials displayed poor product selectivity and high coke deposit in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction of furfural and isopropanol; however, the treatment of alkali-metal ions promoted their catalytic performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation and coking significantly.</p>
<p>The optimum reaction result (97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at 99.6% conversion of furfural) can be obtained on 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta with high tolerance to the furfural concentration.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of alkali-metal ions into Zr-Al-Beta zeolites modifies both Lewis acid sites and Brnsted acid sites, enhancing catalytic performance and reducing deactivation and coking. Optimal results are achieved at an appropriate concentration of alkali ions, improving selectivity and tolerance to high substrate concentration.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。向Zr-Al-Beta沸石中引入碱金属离子可以修改Lewis酸中心和Brnsted酸中心，显著提升催化性能并减少失活和结焦。在适当的碱离子浓度下可以获得最佳结果，提高选择性和对高底物浓度的容忍度。
