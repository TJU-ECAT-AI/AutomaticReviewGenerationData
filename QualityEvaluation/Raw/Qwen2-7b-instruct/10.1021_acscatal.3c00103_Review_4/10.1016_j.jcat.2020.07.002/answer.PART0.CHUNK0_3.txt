1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the stability of catalysts against deactivation and coking, as well as their selectivity towards desired products, are crucial factors.

2. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. This includes the introduction of alkali-metal ions, which can transform and weaken the acidic sites of the catalyst, thereby promoting its catalytic performance and reducing coking. The concentration of the alkaline solution used for modification also plays a role in determining the catalytic performance, as it correlates with the acidity and textual properties of the catalyst.

3. The optimal performance is achieved when the catalyst contains the right type of alkali-metal ions and is treated with a suitable concentration of alkaline solution. In this case, 0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta is found to provide the best results, achieving a 97.3% yield of furfuryl alcohol at a 99.6% conversion of furfural, with high tolerance to the furfural concentration.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征，显著影响脱氢反应中的性能。特别是催化剂的抗失活和结焦能力，以及其对目标产物的选择性，是关键因素。

2. 可以采用修改策略来优化这些属性，以提高催化效率和选择性。这包括引入碱金属离子，可以将催化剂的酸性位点转化为较弱的酸性位点，从而促进催化性能并减少结焦。用于修改的碱溶液的浓度也会影响催化性能，因为它与催化剂的酸性和文本性质相关。

3. 最优性能是在催化剂中含有正确的碱金属离子类型，并用适当的碱溶液浓度进行处理时实现的。在这种情况下，0.025 M-Na+-Zr-Al-Beta被发现提供了最佳结果，实现了97.3%的糠醇产率和99.6%的糠醛转化率，在高糠醛浓度下具有很高的耐受性。
