Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites combine the intrinsic catalytic properties of microporous zeolites and the enhanced access and transport of the additional meso- and/or macroporous system. These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests. In addition to the enhanced mass transfer leading to high activity, selectivity, and cycle time, another essential merit of the hierarchical structure in zeolite materials is that it can significantly improve the utilization effectiveness of zeolite materials resulting in the minimum energy, time, and raw materials consumption. Substantial progress has been made in the synthesis, characterization, and application of hierarchical zeolites. Herein, we provide an overview of recent achievements in the field, highlighting the significant progress in the past decade on the development of novel and remarkable strategies to create an additional pore system in zeolites. The most innovative synthesis approaches are reviewed according to the principle, versatility, effectiveness, and degree of reality while establishing a firm link between the preparation route and the resultant hierarchical pore quality in zeolites. Zeolites with different hierarchically porous structures, i.e., micro-mesoporous structure, micro-macroporous structure, and micro-meso-macroporous structure, are then analyzed in detail with concrete examples to illustrate their benefits and their fabrications. The significantly improved performances in catalytic, environmental, and biological applications resulting from enhanced mass transport properties are discussed through a series of representative cases. In the concluding part, we envision the emergence of “material-properties-by-quantitative and real rational design” based on the “generalized Murray’s Law” that enables the predictable and controlled productions of bioinspired hierarchically structured zeolites. This Review is expected to attract important interests from catalysis, separation, environment, advanced materials, and chemical engineering fields as well as biomedicine for artificial organ and drug delivery systems.

1. Introduction
Zeolites are an important family of crystalline microporous materials with three-dimensional framework constructed by corner-sharing TO4 tetrahedrons (T refers to tetrahedrally coordinated framework atoms Si, Al, or other heteroatoms). The different ways of TO4 tetrahedra connections result in a rich variety of zeolite microporous structures. These microporous materials are either formed naturally by volcanic activity or synthesized artificially in the laboratory. Currently, 245 distinct zeolite framework structures are recognized by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (IZA-SC). (1) Since the first synthetic preparation of zeolites by Barrer in the 1940s, zeolites have been widely used as catalysts and catalyst supports in petroleum and chemical industries, (2−4) as ion exchangers in detergents, and as sorbents in separation processes. Today, they constitute more than 40% of all solid catalysts used for oil refining, petrochemical processing, and fine chemicals. (5)
The remarkable properties of zeolites in these catalytic and separation processes are closely related to their well-defined microporous structure. (6,7) Notably, the intracrystalline molecular mobility in the zeolites is the determining factor of the overall reaction rate and separation efficiency. However, the intrinsic micropores (typically <2 nm) usually impose severe constraints for mass transfer of reactants/products to and away from the active center, especially when bulky molecules are involved. Diffusion, as the main mechanism of mass transfer, is a crucial factor in deciding the catalytic properties (activity, selectivity, and lifetime) and the utilization efficiency of the zeolites in many reactions and separation processes. (8) Moreover, the slow transport in zeolite microporous channels could lead to side reactions, significant coking, rapid deactivation of catalysts, and most importantly the waste of zeolite materials and energy. One fundamental approach to minimize the diffusion limitation is to shorten the diffusion path length, which can be realized by developing hierarchically porous materials that integrate porosities of multiple levels in a single solid body. Therefore, hierarchically porous zeolites are regarded as the most promising catalytic materials for industrial applications. (9)
Many classes of organisms among both plants and animals contain hierarchical networks of interconnected pores to maximize the mass transport and increase the rates of reactions for optimal efficiency and least energy consumption (Figure 1). (10,11) Water transport in leaf vein systems is an essential part of plant growth and development. The efficient water transport via the leaves is mainly achieved by a two-level hierarchy consisting of the main veins and smaller capillaries. Our respiratory system is a highly efficient natural construction enabling both fast mass transport with minimum resistance and effective O2–CO2 exchange between air and blood. The lung also contains a hierarchically porous system with the primary broad single channel trachea and the secondary large number of pulmonary alveoli with huge surface area. The blood circuit is a closed hierarchically organized vascular system wherein the pathway of blood starts from a certain point and eventually returns back to the same point. It is a highly efficient physiological process promoted by hierarchical distribution and hierarchical recollection. Theoretical calculations also confirmed that different hierarchical features of the flow distribution directly influence the average reaction rates in a structured catalytic microfluidic reactor. (12) Recently, a pioneering series of bioinspired materials emulating the natural vascular structure, in which pore sizes decrease along different scales and end in units of constant size, as in plant stems, leaf veins, vascular, and respiratory systems, have been fabricated. (10) Such biomimics provide hierarchical branching and facilitate mass transport in both liquid (or gas)–solid and electrochemical processes. This is the first macro-meso-microporous material quantitatively designed and synthesized with optimum diameter ratios among multiscale pores. It is thus highly desirable to construct such hierarchical networks of interconnected pores within zeolite crystals. (10) Importantly, the synthesized hierarchically porous zeolites should retain a high zeolitic character; i.e., the additional porosities are introduced without impairing the intrinsic zeolite micropores. For the construction of hierarchically porous zeolite structures, Perez-Ramirez et al. (13) proposed increasing the mesopore surface area without severely sacrificing the intrinsic micropore volume of zeolite to maximize the hierarchy factor. (14)

During the past decade, many different strategies to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites with both an abundant secondary porosity and full interconnected mesopores or macropores have been developed. The preparation methods can be divided principally into the post-treatment synthetic routes and the in situ synthetic routes. (15,16) The post-treatment, including the selective desilication/dealumination processes, is mainly a destructive procedure by sacrificing part of the zeolite crystals to create larger meso- or macropores. (17,18) It usually results in a loss of crystallinity, and the secondary porosity generated is often uncontrollable. To solve this problem, different synthetic approaches, including reaction conditions and reactants, are adopted. The in situ synthesis approach usually uses the organic or inorganic templates in the zeolite crystallization process. It produces hierarchically porous zeolites with identical or similar components as conventional microporous zeolites. The key point is to maximize the interactions between the templates and the zeolite precursors and thus minimize their phase segregation during the zeolite crystallization process. It is the determining factor that influences not only the purity and the morphology of the zeolites but also the location and the interconnectivity between the intrinsic micropores and the introduced meso- or macropores.
Hierarchically porous zeolites combining the intrinsic micropores with an auxiliary meso- and/or macropore network of inter- or intracrystalline structure, exhibiting an unimpeded transport path (macropores) and enhanced micropore accessibility (mesopores) without sacrificing their intrinsic catalytic activity (micropores), show great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion. (19,20) In addition to the above-mentioned excellent catalytic properties, hierarchically porous zeolites also show exceptional sorption characteristics useful for the environmental benefits (wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds) together with carrier qualities that enable them to be desirable hosts in biological applications.
In this Review, we will focus on the synthesis and evaluation of the hierarchically porous zeolites. After this brief introduction (section 1), in section 2, the recent progress in the preparation methods of hierarchically porous zeolites is described. Section 3 outlines the concrete preparations of different defined types of hierarchically porous zeolites with an ordered or disordered structure, including micropores and mesopores (micro-mesoporous zeolites); micropores and macropores (micro-macroporous zeolites); or micropores, mesopores, and macropores (micro-meso-macroporous zeolites). The catalytic, environmental, and biological applications of hierarchically porous zeolites are reviewed in section 4. The last section (section 5) includes concluding remarks and future trends. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of synthesis methods, structural features, and applications of hierarchically porous zeolites. The detailed summary, analysis, and discussion in this Review will enable new researchers in this field to be more fully familiar with the subject and orient them to choose the research subdomain they are interested in. In addition, this Review will help researchers in this field to understand the latest research progress on the hierarchically porous zeolites from synthesis to applications.
2. Synthesis
Hierarchically porous zeolites are characterized by the intrinsic microporosity from the zeolitic framework and the introduced inter- or intracrystalline meso- or macropore system. Depending on the introduced pores, the resulting hierarchically porous zeolites can be further distinguished into (i) hierarchically micro-mesoporous structured zeolites, (ii) hierarchically micro-macroporous structured zeolites, and (iii) hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Numerous studies are carried out to synthesize hierarchical zeolites with the advanced pore structure of multiple levels to overcome the diffusion restrictions derived from sole micropores. The large variety of synthetic strategies for the construction of pore hierarchy can be divided into “in situ” and “postsynthetic” approaches. The in situ approach creates hierarchical zeolites by fabricating microporous and mesoporous products with or without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates during zeolite synthesis. On the other hand, the postsynthetic approach concerns the post-treatment of the as-synthesized zeolites to introduce a hierarchical structure into zeolites. In the following section, these two preparation approaches will be discussed in detail. Figure 2 gives a general overview of different strategies for the introduction of additional porosity. Besides, the hierarchically porous zeolite materials with different hierarchical structures obtained by various methods with concrete examples are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1. Different Methods Used to Prepare Hierarchical Zeolites
2.1. In Situ Approach
2.1.1. Templating Route
2.1.1.1. Direct Templating Route
The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites generally requires mesopore and/or macropore templates (also called porogens) for the generation of additional porosity and a structure-directing agent (SDA) for the formation of the microporous zeolite structure. The mesopore and/or macropore templates are firstly imbedded within the zeolite precursor slurry and then removed after the zeolite formation to free additional porosity. Depending on the rigidity (solid or liquid) of mesopore and/or macropore templates, these synthesis strategies can be classified into the hard templating route (16,21−147) and the soft templating route. (75,148−197)
2.1.1.1.1. Hard Templating Route
The hard templating route involves the use of either nonporous or porous solid materials with a relatively rigid structure usually used as sacrificial templates to create the additional porosity during zeolite crystallization. It can be applied for the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites of a wide range of zeolite structures since the solid template is chemically inert without an impact on the zeolite intrinsic structure formation. Generally, the synthesis procedure consists of the addition of solid templates into the zeolite synthetic mixture, the in situ crystallization of zeolites with the solid templates, and the subsequent template removal by either calcination or leaching. The solid templates can be incorporated into the zeolite crystals during dry-gel conversions (198) or zeolite crystallization. (21) The hard templating route produces zeolites with high crystallinity, uniform additional porosity, and a tailorable porous structure. The hard templating route is very suitable to fabricate hierarchical titanosilicate zeolites due to the special nature of the titanium species under either acid or alkali leaching treatments. (199,200) Carbonaceous materials, (16,21−83) polymers/aerogel/resin, (84−109) inorganic solid materials, (110−130) and biological material (131−147) have been applied as hard templates to fabricate hierarchically porous zeolites.
2.1.1.1.1.1. Carbonaceous Materials
Due to their excellent characteristics, such as chemical inertness, structural diversity, tunable surface functionality, morphology variety, cost effectiveness, and easy removal, carbon materials, such as carbon nanoparticles, (21−31) nanotubes, (32−36,382) nanofibers, (37) ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-1 and CMK-3, (38−44) ordered porous carbons, (16,45−51) and polymers, (84−109) are widely used as hard templates. Whether the obtained porous structures are ordered and interconnected or not depends on how the templates are structured and how they interact with the zeolite synthesis gel during the crystallization process. The hydrophobic nature of the carbon templates usually makes them hard to be uniformly dispersed in the hydrophilic zeolite synthesis gel. (52) To avoid the phase separation between zeolite crystals and carbon materials during zeolite crystallization, the carbons are usually pretreated with mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acids to form surface oxygen species with hydrophilic features. (53,54)
Carbon Nanoparticles, Nanotubes, and Nanofibers
Jacobsen et al. applied carbon nanoparticles for the confined space synthesis of zeolite ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (21) To realize the confined space crystallization, zeolite precursor gels with an amount equal to or even lower than the total pore volume of the carbon matrix were introduced into the carbon materials by the incipient wetness impregnation method. It is difficult to strictly constrain the zeolite crystallization within the templates due to the incompatible nature between the hydrophobic carbon template and the aqueous zeolitic precursor solution. Some precursor gel would migrate and crystallize out of the templates. Thus, dry-gel conversion was applied for this kind of synthesis, in which the zeolite precursors were reduced to a dry powder before they were converted in a water-vapor-rich atmosphere. The mobility in the reaction mixture was greatly reduced. The composites of dry gels were then crystallized. They found that, by using an excessive amount of mesoporous carbon nanoparticles, zeolite crystals nucleated strictly in the mesopores of carbon nanoparticles. (22) The final crystalline size of the zeolites is decided by the inert mesopore system rather than the gel composition. When excess synthesis gel was used, the carbon nanoparticles were dispersed into the zeolite precursor solution and then encapsulated by the growing zeolite crystals during the crystalline process (Figure 3A,B). (23) Contrary to the zeolite nanocrystals prepared in the confined space of porous carbons, removal of the embedded carbon matrix led to zeolite single crystals with intracrystalline mesopores, which are directly related to the size, shape, and connectivity of the carbon nanoparticles. Thus, it can be concluded that, in the carbon-templating synthesis, the generation of either nanocrystals or mesoporous single crystals largely depends on the synthetic condition that influences the nucleation rates relative to growth rates. (25) The high nucleation rates favored the formation of nanosized zeolites while the high growth rates favored the formation of mesoporous zeolite single crystals. (25) The wide availability of this approach was further demonstrated by the following successful synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with different frameworks and compositions and zeotypes, such as mesoporous zeolite single crystals of BEA (Beta), (21) MFI (TS-1, (26) ZSM-5 (27)), MEL (ZSM-11, TS-2, and Silicalite-2), (28) and MTW (ZSM-12) (29) framework structures, and hierarchical aluminum phosphates AFI (AlPO-5) (31) and CHA (AlPO-34) (31) framework structures. The obtained mesoporous zeolites showed highly improved diffusion performances and catalytic properties when compared with the conventional microporous materials. However, the cavity-like mesopores templated by the spherical carbon nanoparticles are not open to the external surface of the zeolite and are only accessible to the micropores, providing very little contribution to improve the mass transfer.

The use of carbon nanotubes (32−36) and carbon nanofibers (37) offers an enhanced control over the size and shape of the introduced mesopores and leads to the generation of accessible and utilizable mesopores for improved mass transport. Schmidt et al. was the first to use multiwall carbon nanotubes (12 nm diameter and several micrometers in length) to produce zeolite Silicalite-1 with straight and uniform mesoporous channels (12–30 nm in width, in accordance with the diameters of the carbon nanotubes) penetrating the whole zeolite single crystals (Figure 3C,D). (32) Mesoporous zeolite Y and ZSM-5 nanocrystals can also be synthesized in the confined internal mesoporous space of the carbon nanotubes with an internal diameter of 20–30 nm. (36) The maximum crystal size is limited by the internal diameter of the carbon nanotubes, thus realizing the preparation of hierarchical zeolite nanocrystals with a desirable and controllable size distribution. Similar mesoporous zeolites were also obtained by using cost-effective carbon nanofibers as templates. (37) The produced mesopores in zeolite crystals are cylindrical and exhibit low tortuosity.
Chou et al. used carbon nanoparticles in both the hydrothermal synthesis process and the dry-gel conversion process for introducing mesoporosity into zeolite crystals. (55,56) During the hydrothermal synthesis, the carbon nanoparticles are excluded from the zeolite crystals, resulting in microporous zeolites similar to the one synthesized without templates. In the dry-gel conversion process, the zeolite growth rate is much slower due to the extremely slow transfer in the synthesis dry gel caused by the water limitation, thus resulting in a tight connection between the synthesis gel and the carbon template and producing hierarchically porous zeolite ZSM-5 with abundant mesopores. In certain zeolite synthesis systems, the carbon templates are more effective in dry-gel conversion than in hydrothermal synthesis. (57)
Recent developments in the synthesis of carbon-templated hierarchical zeolites involve the application of microwave heating methods and the assistance of the fluoride route. Carbon-templated mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were directly synthesized from the conventional synthesis gel containing carbon nanoparticles as the mesopore template under controlled microwave heating. (30) Egeblad et al. synthesized a number of mesoporous zeolites by combining the carbon-templating strategy with the fluoride route. (31) In the fluoride media, the synthesis of mesoporous aluminum phosphate materials, including AlPO-5 and AlPO-34, was also proven possible. (31)
The effects of carbon templates on the construction of hierarchical structures in zeolites have also been investigated with graphene oxide (GO) and graphene nanosheets, which exhibit unique structural, mechanical, and electronic properties due to the one-atom-thick carbon sheets. Hydrophilic GO sheets facilitated zeolite crystallization leading to the formation of large polycrystalline zeolite crystals, (58) while hydrophobic graphene sheets served as physical barriers to confine zeolite crystal growth with the formation of smaller crystals. (59) GO was further used in a solvent-free synthesis to realize the control over morphology and structure of the resulting zeolites. The addition of GO led to well-dispersed, faceted Si-ZSM-5 crystals, leading to oriented growth of the Si-ZSM-5 crystals along the c-axis. (60)
Carbon Aerogels
Carbon aerogels (CAs) are a version of the resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) aerogel that are pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere. (61−63) Compared to the mentioned mesoporous CMK-n (n = 1–5) templates, carbon aerogels (CAs) have larger mesopores and thicker mesoporous walls, making them more suitable mesopore templates to create intracrystalline mesopores in the zeolites. CAs usually exhibit a monolithic morphology with a three-dimensional pore system formed by the agglomerate structures of uniform spherical carbon particles. (64) Thus, these materials are used as hard templates for the preparation of hierarchically porous zeolites. The zeolite synthesis gel is introduced into the mesopores of CAs, and then, zeolite crystals intergrow within the three-dimensional pore system of the CA monolith. Consequently, zeolite monoliths with open mesopores can be obtained upon the complete removal of the carbon matrix by calcination, thus paving the way for monolithic self-supported mesoporous zeolite catalysts. By using a CA with mesopore size of 23 nm and pore wall thickness of ∼10 nm as a template, ZSM-5 (MFI structure, Figure 3E,F) (65) and Y (FAU structure) (66) zeolites containing uniform and abundant mesopores have been synthesized. The mesopore-size distributions of these zeolites are very narrow with maxima located at 11 nm, corresponding to the wall thickness of the pores in the CAs. Besides, the predominant porosity in CAs can be easily tuned by varying the molar ratios of starting materials (resorcinol/formaldehyde), thus realizing the control over the mesopore size in zeolites. For example, the ZSM-5 zeolite produced from a carbonized resorcinol/formaldehyde ratio of 2:1 had a mesopore volume of 0.98 cm3 g–1, while a ZSM-5 zeolite produced from a resorcinol/formaldehyde ratio of 1:1 had a mesopore volume of 0.34 cm3 g–1. (67) The obtained hierarchically porous N-doped biomass-derived carbonaceous monoliths served as a cost-effective hard template to synthesize hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolite single crystals with intracrystalline mesopores of 12–16 nm in diameter. (68)
Preformed Carbon Templates
Preformed mesoporous carbons have been widely applied in the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites. The carbon templates with ordered mesopores are obtained either by replicating the ordered mesoporous silicates (38−44) or by imprinting of colloidal silicas (16,45−50) to give a hierarchical zeolite with ordered mesopores.
Replications of Ordered Mesoporous Silicates
Ryoo and co-workers developed a series of ordered carbon mesoporous molecular sieves (CMK-n, n = 1–5) possessing high surface area and excellent thermal/hydrothermal stabilities. (69−73) The ordered CMK-1 (cubic structure) (69) and CMK-3 (two-dimensional hexagonal structure) (70,71) materials were prepared by using the ordered mesoporous silicates MCM-48 (74,75) or SBA-15 (76,77) as templates, respectively.
Previous attempts have been made to synthesize MFI zeolites by directly using CMK-n (n = 1–5) as a hard template. Cho et al. investigated the conditions for the synthesis of an ordered mesoporous MFI zeolite using CMK-n (n = 1–5) mesoporous carbons as a template through the dry-gel conversion approach (Figure 3G,H). (38) They concluded that the successful replication of CMK in the dry-gel crystallization process mainly depended on the pore size, humidity, and framework rigidity. By carefully controlling the condition of the dry-gel conversion, Sakthivel et al. (39) prepared mesoporous aluminosilicates (RMM-1 and RMM-3) which precisely replicated the ordered structure of CMK-1 and CMK-3. The RMM-1 and RMM-3 appeared to be composite materials, constructed by mesoporous zeolites with ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals embedded in the pore walls. These works only obtained an aggregate of zeolite nanocrystals with a disordered mesopore structure.
Cho et al. (44) reported a modified synthetic procedure by recrystallization of carbon-filled mesoporous SBA-15. The final product was SBA-15 with zeolitic fragments in the mesopore wall. Fang et al. (41) further reported the successful synthesis of an ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate with a completely crystalline zeolite pore wall structure by recrystallization of SBA-15 using in situ formed CMK-5 as the hard template. This in situ formed CMK-5 hard template not only helped to preserve the original ordered mesoporous structure but also kinetically controlled the crystallization process to avoid the formation of large crystals. Wang et al. (43) confirmed that the prior formation of a well-developed carbon structure inside the mesopores of SBA-15 before the synthesis of Silicalite-1/SBA-15 composites can improve the stability of the meso-structure of the template during the zeolite crystallization process.
Imprints of Colloidal Silica Nanoparticles and Colloidal Silica Crystals
The colloidal crystal templating is a popular method for designing ordered porous carbons. (45) Typically, both colloidal silica nanoparticles and colloidal silica crystals can be used as hard templates and mixed with a certain carbon precursor to prepare a carbon template. (16) After the subsequent carbonization and silica dissolution, carbon templates with ordered meso- or macroporous replicating the initial colloid silica nanoparticles were synthesized. (46) The application of such porous carbon as a mesopore template resulted in different mesoporous zeolite single crystals. Pinnavaia et al. demonstrated for the first time the nanocasting synthesis of uniform ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals using colloid-imprinted carbons (CICs) as hard templates. (47) By varying the particle size of the initial silica colloid, CICs with different pore-size distributions were obtained and used as carbon templates to synthesize zeolite nanocrystals with a controllable size. Fan et al. further reported the successful synthesis of size-tunable, uniformly shaped Silicalite-1 zeolite nanocrystals and ordered–imprinted mesoporous zeolite single crystals within the three-dimensional ordered mesoporous (3DOm) carbon templates, which precisely replicated the ordered colloidal silica crystals composed of size-tunable silica nanoparticles (10–40 nm), via steam-assisted crystallization (SAC). (48) The 3DOm-imprint method was also used to prepare monolithic 3DOm zeolites. Chen et al. introduced a modified hydrothermal synthesis procedure for the synthesis of hierarchical BEA, LTA, FAU, and LTL zeolite nanocrystals with highly ordered, tunable intercrystalline mesopores (Figure 3I,J). (49) As a hard template, 3DOm carbon with a pore size of around 10–40 nm was firstly prepared by a replication process from colloidal crystals made by size-tunable silica nanoparticles. Though the strategy was time-consuming and costly, it still had the guiding significance for the fundamental studies of the relationship between the hierarchical mesopore structures and the catalytic performance in the zeolites. (49)
However, the high cost of these preformed carbon materials has inhibited further industrial applications of their corresponding templated zeolites. (78) A promising alternative to the above porous carbon materials is natural and green materials that are cheap, abundant, and renewable. For example, mesoporous carbon materials derived from sugars such as sucrose (79−82) and glucose (83) were also reported. A sucrose–ammonia mixture was hydrothermally treated and then carbonized. (79) The resultant porous carbon was impregnated with zeolite precursors; subsequently the mixture was hydrothermally treated to achieve the crystalline zeolite architecture. Homogeneously sized mesoporous Silicalite-1 single crystals were finally obtained after the carbon removal. Similarly, another cheap carbon template was in situ fabricated by the pyrolysis of sugar-impregnated silica gels. (82) These well-mixed carbon/silica composites were directly used for hydrothermal synthesis and crystallized into hierarchical ZSM-5/ZSM-11 zeolite nanocrystals (Figure 3K,L).
Polymers
In the past decades, polymers, including polymer aerogels, (84−90) polymer microspheres, (91−101) and resins, (102−109) have also been utilized to synthesize hierarchical zeolite monoliths with bimodal, trimodal, or even tetramodal porosity. Particularly, it is interesting to prepare such hierarchically porous zeolites integrating the advantages of different pore structures. (384) Generally, they are divided into supported and self-supported zeolite monoliths. For the supported ones, a layer of zeolite film is deposited on a rigid porous matrix by either in situ or ex situ coating processes. (223,385−388) However, these supported zeolite monoliths usually have a low zeolite-to-support weight ratio and suffer from an easy exfoliation of the coated zeolite film and a restrained mass transport. Contrarily, the self-supported zeolite monoliths exhibit superior mass and heat transfer performances and are generally prepared by zeolite growth within a macro- or mesoporous matrix. These sacrificial substrates serve as a shape-directing macroporous template and can then be easily removed, e.g., by calcination, leaving a hierarchically porous zeolitic structure. The mostly widely used polymeric templates are carbon/organic aerogels, close-packed ordered polymer arrays, and resins.
Polymer Aerogels
Resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel (RFA), used as the precursor for carbon aerogel, is characterized by its foamy structure, low-density, and open-framework. RFA is the polycondensation product of resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene) with formaldehyde. The subsequent drying of resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) gels with supercritical CO2 or supercritical acetone can retain the previous gel structure. The resultant RFAs are used as templates to fabricate mesoporous zeolites. (84−87) As previously noted, mesoporous ZSM-5 and Y zeolites with high crystallinity were obtained by the CA template, (65,66) but it was difficult to obtain mesoporous zeolite A by such a rigid-structure casting method. (88) Alternatively, by using RFAs with more structural flexibility, mesoporous zeolite A (Linde Type A, LTA structure) (88) with a uniform and interconnected mesoporous structure was obtained. The resultant mesoporous zeolite A exhibited no crystalline defects, and the introduced mesopores strictly replicated the intrinsic pores in RFAs. Furthermore, RFA-templated mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited a smaller pore volume, a larger pore size, and a wider pore-size distribution than the ones templated from CA templating. (89) It was reported that both mesopore sizes and mesopore volumes in the final zeolites are decided by the structures of the templates. (90) Therefore, CAs can create larger mesopore volumes in mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 than those of RFAs due to their thicker pore walls and low mesopore volumes. Contrarily, the RFAs with relatively thicker and nonuniform walls resulted in mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites with larger mesopores and a broader pore-size distribution in the mesoporous ZSM-5.
Recently, a novel polymerization-induced-colloid-aggregation process was developed for the in situ preparation of uniform hierarchical zeolite microspheres with different compositions. (86,87) Urea and formaldehyde solutions were added into the nanozeolite colloidal solutions with different compositions and then in situ polymerized after adding hydrochloric acid. By simply regulating the polymeric acidity, the morphology and composition of products were precisely controlled. The synthesized hierarchical nanozeolite microspheres exhibited a uniform spherical morphology and tunable secondary pore architecture. The change in morphology of the samples under different polymerization conditions can be explained according to the proposed polymerization-velocity match mechanism. (87)
Polymer Microspheres
The first three-dimensionally ordered macroporous zeolites fabricated on the basis of an assembly of PS microspheres as templates were reported by Holland et al. (91) Such macroporous zeolite monoliths with varying compositions and varying frameworks can also be synthesized by the evaporation-induced in situ self-assembly of PS microspheres and zeolite nanocrystals (92) or by casting different zeolite nanocrystals into the ordered PS arrays via infiltration. (93−95)
Hollow zeolite spheres were fabricated by a layer-by-layer strategy via an alternative deposition of zeolite nanocrystals and polyelectrolytes of opposite charges onto polystyrene spheres of positive charges. (96) Different hollow zeolites can be prepared by either changing the type of zeolite nanocrystals or changing the thickness of the deposited layers. (97,98) Such core–shell building blocks, which were exactly PS microspheres with a nanozeolites coating, were also used to prepare macroporous zeolite monoliths. (99) However, hollow zeolite microspheres obtained by the layer-by-layer method usually exhibited weak mechanical strength. To solve this problem, Valtchev et al. reported an effective approach to improve the mechanical strength of the layer-by-layer structured hollow zeolite sphere. (100,101) The surface charge of the polystyrene (PS) microspheres can be easily modified by simply depositing several layers of different polyelectrolytes, leading to enhanced electrostatic interaction with the building zeolite particles (Figure 4A). In this case, PS microspheres can act as sacrificial templates to fabricate hollow zeolites with hierarchically micro-macroporous structures (Figure 4B). These uniform spherical templates can further self-assemble into a highly ordered microporous structure simply by the centrifugation or sedimentation processes (Figure 4C). Therefore, zeolite monoliths with a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure are another main product when PS microspheres are used as macroporogen templates. (101)

Resins
Using an ion exchange resin as a hard template has also been reported for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite materials. In a typical procedure, the zeolite synthesis gel firstly was adsorbed onto the anionic ion-exchange resin beads, and then, the mesoporous Silicalite-1 zeolite microspheres were obtained after crystallization followed by calcination. (102) By this method, hierarchical palladium-containing zeolite has been reported. (103) However, such ion-exchange resins cannot be used to synthesize AlPO-n zeolites due to the existence of positively charged precursor species in the initial AlPO-synthesis gels. (104) Naydenov et al. introduced a modified method to prepare transition-metal-modified AlPO-5 spheres, allowing for the introduction of any metal ions into the AlPO-material. Vanadium-modified mesoporous AlPO-5 spheres were also prepared. (105)
Besides, polyurethane foams (PUFs) can also be used as a hard template. Yoon et al. used PUF to prepare hierarchical zeolite Silicalite-1 and ZSM-5 monoliths with ramified and interconnected macropores together with tailorable sizes and shapes. (106,107) It is interesting that this PUF template gradually decomposed with the growth of the zeolitic shell, and the decomposed fragments of PUF in turn accelerated the crystallization rate. In the previous reports, bimodal porosity (micro-mesopores, micro-macropores) or even trimodal porosity was achieved by zeolite crystallization within appropriate macro- or mesoporous supports. However, for a self-supported zeolite monolith, it is still a challenge to simultaneously control the porosity on all length scales. An ideal hierarchically porous monolithic zeolite should contain macroporosity for fast mass transport, mesoporosity for precise shape selectivity, and microporosity for catalytic active sites. The macropores usually stem from the supports; the mesoporosity can be either the intercrystalline ones from the nanozeolite aggregates or the intracrystalline ones. (65,108) However, the intercrystalline mesopores are unstable and collapse during the catalytic process. Li et al. developed a one-pot synthesis strategy of a ZSM-5 zeolite monolith with controllable tetramodal porosity by using PUF as a sacrificial support through a simple steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) process. (109) A concentrated ZSM-5 precursor solution was soaked into the macropores of PUF supports. After PUF supports were removed by SAC treatment, the first-modal macroporosity in the resultant zeolite monolith (pore size of ∼33 μm) was formed from the PUF structure, the second-modal macroporosity (pore size of 0.2–1.7 μm) from the aggregated zeolite nanocrystals (crystalline size of ∼500 nm) in the voids of PUF, the third-modal template-free-derived mesoporosity (∼53 nm) from the intracrystalline voids in the zeolite nanocrystals, and the fourth-modal microporosity from the intrinsic microporosity.
In conclusion, a monolithic zeolite with a porous hierarchy can be prepared by the zeolite growth onto macro- or mesoporous resins. However, the simultaneous control over multipores inside monolithic zeolites is poor. The macropores templated by the resin are larger than 100 mm, and the macropores in the resins are not fully utilized. The mesopores in the hierarchical monolithic zeolite stemming from the intercrystalline mesopores aggregated by the zeolite nanocrystals are unstable and easily collapse during the catalytic process. Thus, it still remains a great challenge to overcome this drawback.
2.1.1.1.1.2. Inorganic Solid Materials
In addition to carbonaceous materials and polymers, other inorganic solid materials, such as mesoporous silica spheres (110−120) and calcium carbonate nanoparticles, (121,122) were also used as secondary templates in hierarchical zeolite synthesis.
Mesoporous Silica Spheres
It was reported that the usage and removal of polymer templates always result in environmental pollution. Besides, the calcination process to remove the polymer template cores causes considerable shrinkage (more than 20%) or even fracture in the products. (96,99) Alternatively, mesoporous silica spheres can be applied as hard templates to avoid the critical template removal step since they serve both as a mesopore/macropore template and as the silica nutrients for the growth of the zeolites, leading to their continuous digestion during the zeolite crystallization. Currently available methods involve the coating of these mesoporous silica spheres with zeolite seeds through a layer-by-layer deposition process, (110) resulting in hollow capsules with homogeneous and dense zeolitic shells (111) or robust zeolitic membranes with three-dimensional closed (112)/interconnected (113) macroporous structures. To further improve the mechanical stability and intactness of the hollow structure, a seed-induced hydrothermal crystallization process was developed to fabricate uniform hollow zeolite spheres with much lower breakage ratio (<2%) and higher mechanical stability due to the better intergrowth of zeolitic crystals formed under hydrothermal conditions compared to those prepared from the vapor phase transport (VPT) method. (114) Besides, the coordination between the zeolite shell intergrowth rate and the silica core dissolution rate in this approach was reported to be the key factor for the formation of perfect hollow zeolite spheres. (115) Similarly, Xiong et al. used spherically mesoporous SBA-15 as a silicon source and substrate to prepare hollow zeolite ZSM-5 spheres. (116)
The uniform mesoporous silica (MS) spheres have also been employed to prepare three-dimensional porous zeolites with open or closed macropores. (112,113,117) A robust three-dimensional hierarchically macroporous zeolite monolith was obtained after the hydrothermal treatment of the array of nanozeolite coated MS spheres. (112,117) However, the closed macroporous system obtained did not favor mass transport. Therefore, Wang and Caruso reported a modified procedure to prepare zeolite monoliths with three-dimensionally interconnected macropores using open mesoporous silica spheres as templates. (113) The resultant zeolitic monolith with an open three-dimensionally interconnected macroporous structure demonstrated higher enzyme loadings and activities when compared with the corresponding zeolite monolith with a closed macroporous or nonporous structure. Moreover, the morphologies of these obtained hollow zeolite spheres can be easily controlled by varying the initial template morphologies. (118) For example, Song et al. reported the synthesis of a very interesting hexagonal hollow ZSM-5 tube by using mesoporous silica fibers as both the hard template and silica nutrient. (119)
Recently, Machoke et al. developed a simple method to prepare zeolite crystals with an intracrystalline macropore system embedded in the zeolitic matrix (Figure 5). (120,203) This approach utilized the steam-assisted crystallization (SAC) of mesoporous silica particles (MSPs, a in Figure 5A,B) after their impregnation with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH). When these impregnated MSPs (b in Figure 5A) were heated to the crystallization temperature, the outer shell of the MSPs started to dissolve and increased the silica concentration on the external surface of these particles, thus initiating the nucleation and formation of the MFI nanocrystals on the external surface of the MSPs (c in Figure 5A). The dissolved silica was consumed in the following crystallization process to grow and fill the voids between the original packing of the MSPs (d in Figure 5A). This process continued until well-shaped crystals were formed. Finally, these MSP cores were dissolved which left a highly interconnected macropore network with a porosity of about 45% ± 5% distributed within the zeolite crystal with a classical MFI morphology (e in Figure 5A,C). (120) Macroporous zeolite single crystals ZSM-5 (201,202) and TS-1 (204) have been synthesized with the existing methods and exhibited a significantly improved catalyst performance.

Calcium Carbonate Nanoparticles
In addition, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with spherical morphologies have also been used to prepare hierarchically porous zeolites. Xie et al. reported the synthesis of mesoporous MFI zeolites using CaCO3 as a hard template, which is cheap and easily available. (121) Interestingly, nanosized CaCO3 (average sizes of 100 nm) could also be added as a solid template into the solvent-free synthesis system to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites by physically mixing, mechanically grinding, and then heating solid raw materials. (122) A potential advantage of CaCO3 templates is that they can bring some additional functions into zeolites. For example, the trapped CaCO3 in zeolite crystals was converted into basic CaO when the composites were calcined at a high temperature (>600 °C). The resultant CaO/zeolite products exhibited both strong acidity from the zeolite and strong basicity from CaO, which would be very useful for catalysis required for both acidic and basic sites. (11)
Other Inorganic Templates
Other inorganic materials have also been used as templates to construct hierarchically porous zeolites. A typical example is zeolite Beta, which was used as a template to synthesize hollow BEA–FAU zeolite composite spheres through a two-step hydrothermal crystallization process. (123) β-Zeolite was first prepared and used as silicon sources for the synthesis of Y-zeolite as well as the filler template for the formation of hollow spheres. Such an approach successfully avoided the complex removal procedure of the templates because the macropore template core also served as the consumption template to serve as the silica source. The fly ash cenosphere (FAC), an aluminosilicate-rich waste from power plants, was also employed as the rigid spherical template and the silica nutrient to prepare hollow zeolitic microspheres. (124) Based on this method, various hollow zeolite spheres with different frameworks were obtained by pretreating the FAC with different nanozeolite seeds. (124) Furthermore, ice was also used as a template to prepare the zeolite monolith with a microsized honeycomb structure. (125) In this approach, silica hydrogels were firstly obtained by unidirectional freezing, in which the rodlike ice crystals acted as a template for straight macropores. (126−129) After removing the ice crystals by thawing and freeze drying, the silica gel precursor with a well-ordered channel of 10–50 mm was obtained. Then, the obtained precursor silica gels were crystallized under steam at high temperature and pressure by using structure-directing agents (SDAs) to prepare the Silicate-1 zeolite monolith.
2.1.1.1.1.3. Biological Materials
The hard templating method is often limited by multistep procedures, which can be alleviated by using biological templates that are abundant, inexpensive, environmentally friendly, easily available, and renewable sources. Biotemplating techniques for the synthesis of bioinspired zeolites with novel shapes, complex functional patterns, and hierarchical porosity, in which the natural/biological tissues and materials are used as templates, could be of great importance for the development of zeolites with improved performances.
Biological materials, such as bacteria, (145) eggshells, (131) spider silks, (132) insects, (133) sugar cane bagasse, (134) diatoms, (135) leaves, (136,137) Luffa sponges, (138) wood, (139−141) cotton threads, (142) rice husks, (143,144) starch-derived bread, (146) and starch gel, (147) are used as sacrificial templates to create additional pores in zeolites.
Generally, biomimetic zeolite replicas are achieved by adsorption or deposition of nanozeolite seeds onto the biological or natural support surface that was first modified by a cationic polyelectrolyte. (135) This was followed by the crystal growth process under a hydrothermal (139) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) treatment. (135) For example, Valtchev et al. reported the very interesting imprinting of zeolite crystals on a leaf (Equisetum arvense) by a biomineral-silica-induced crystallization process, in which the intrinsic biogenic silica source of the leaf support acted as the promoter for the nucleation of zeolite crystals (Figure 6A,B). (136,137) Biomorphic self-supporting MFI zeolites with hierarchical porosity were prepared by an in situ seeding and secondary growth route with a Luffa sponge as the macroscale sacrificial structure template. (138) The zeolitic replica inherited the complex spongy morphology and the intricate open-porous architecture of Luffa (Figure 6C,D). Cotton threads were used to create hollow structures within zeolites, like bunchy/single hollow fiber, hollow monolith, or honeycomb structures, due to their flexibility and facility (Figure 6E,F). (142) Furthermore, carbonized rice husk was also used to fabricate ZSM-5 zeolite/porous carbon composites (Figure 6G,H). (143) However, hierarchically micro-macroporous zeolite monoliths synthesized by using natural templates usually showed poor mechanical stability and limited practical applications. Until now, only biomorphic replicas in the MFI structure (zeolite Silicalite-1 (131,135,136,138−142,144−147) and zeolite ZSM-5 (134,143)) and BEA structure (zeolite Beta (137)) were synthesized.

2.1.1.1.2. Soft Templating Route
Since the discovery of highly ordered mesoporous molecular sieves (M41S), soft templating methods are widely used for the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites. (75,389) Soft templates, including silylated polymers, (148−150) hydrophilic cationic polymers, (151−168) cationic organosilanes, (169−174) and surfactants, (75,158−163,165,175−197) exhibit inherent flexibility and advantages, such as tunable size and adjustable functionality, and are more versatile than hard templates. During the crystallization process, these templates not only serve as physical supports but also directly interact with the silica species. (390−403)
Thus, the key factor is to choose the appropriate soft templates. The soft templates should (1) be stable in alkaline media even at 140–180 °C as the zeolite synthesis generally occurs in alkaline conditions, (2) be positively charged to achieve the strong interaction with negative silica species, (3) be of suitable mesoscale sizes in aqueous solution, and (4) be of low cost. Besides, the structure of the soft templates can be generally and easily controlled either by altering its functional groups or by changing the packing parameter of the surfactants. Thus, the soft template route offers a versatile way to tailor the mesopores. Using this method, either inter- or intracrystalline mesopores can be created in the zeolites by using designed organic molecules, self-organized molecule arrays, or emulsion forming agents. There are two general approaches, one is primary methods in which all the components (including the surfactant) are introduced into the synthesis system at the beginning of a one-step synthesis; the other is secondary methods in which all the components except the surfactant are introduced at the first step, and the surfactant is then added at the last step of a two-step procedure prior to the hydrothermal synthesis. (15)
2.1.1.1.2.1. Primary Methods
The main characteristic of the primary methods is one-step synthesis in which all the components are added at the beginning of synthesis.
Nonsurfactant Polymers
The largest category of soft templates is macromolecular structures, such as soluble nonsurfactant polymers. They are largely available and tunable in their chemical composition, molar mass, and surface charge. For example, nonsurfactants such as silylated polymers or cationic polymers proved to be effective primary templates. The silylated polymers were used as mesopore templates to create intracrystalline mesopores within the zeolite matrix. (148−150) Pinnavaia et al. reported that the −SiO3 units in the silylated polymer allowed for its graft onto the zeolite surface by the formation of covalent Si–O–Si linkages (Figure 7A). (148) As the zeolite crystals grew, the incorporated polymers were phase-segregated from the zeolite matrix, resulting in an intracrystalline polymer network that was covalently linked to the zeolite framework. Mesoporous MFI zeolites were obtained after the removal of the polymer template. Each particle consisted of randomly oriented small mesopores (Figure 7B). Besides, the lattice fringes extended throughout the whole particle, thus indicating that each particle was a single crystal (Figure 7C). Another successful material was reported by Wang et al. (149) The synthesis was based on reducing the growth of zeolite crystals. Phenylaminopropyltrimethoxy-silane was used as a growth inhibitor to prevent the further aggregation of the zeolite seeds by silanization. Thus, the surface functionalization with silane coupling agents of nanozeolite precursors was considered to be a confined space synthesis. Furthermore, Hu et al. used organosilanes with amino-, mercapto-, and allyl- surface groups to control the growth of ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (206) Various organic functional groups can be regularly grafted on the surface of nanozeolites in situ, and the resulting nanozeolite particles not only preserve their nanosize and high crystallinity but also provide a diverse surface.

Hydrophilic cationic polymers exhibit a strong interaction with silica-based species due to their high positive charge and high alkali resistance stabilities in the high-temperature process (up to 200 °C). The first example of their use as mesopore templates was reported by Xiao et al. (151−153) They used a mesoscale hydrophilic cationic polymer (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDADMAC) to create the intracrystalline mesoporosity in zeolite Beta single crystals (Figure 7D). (151) The high charge density of the soft templates can effectively prevent the interfacial incompatibility between the template and zeolite gel. As mentioned above, the incompatibility always existed between the uncharged and hydrophobic templates such as carbons and the negatively charged aluminosilicate gels. After their self-assembling with aluminosilicate species, the fiberlike polymers dispersed homogeneously within the synthetic gel and were then entirely embedded in zeolite crystals after the hydrothermal crystallization. The calcined samples had a disordered mesopore system between 5 and 40 nm. These mesopores are partially continuous and opened to the external surface of the sample, which significantly improved the accessibility of reactants to the active sites of such mesoporous H-Beta zeolite (Figure 7E,F). The pore size could be tuned in a certain range by simply varying amounts of the soft templates in the synthesis gel during the hydrothermal synthesis. They further demonstrated a series of nonsurfactant polymers as dual-function templates for synthesizing hierarchical zeolites that feature open, interconnected mesopores. (154) The resultant three-dimensional single-crystalline zeolite framework was different from previously reported two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets or agglomerations of zeolite nanocrystals, in which the surfactant templates create an ordered mesostructure at the sacrifice of crystallinity. Nonsurfactant polymers have multiple advantages in synthesizing hierarchical zeolites. They have minimized intermolecular interactions, which have little influence on the zeolite crystallization process and thus contribute to the high zeolitic character of the final products. Besides, the mutual interpenetration of the polymers and the zeolite crystalline network provides disordered but highly interconnected mesopores within zeolites. Thus, nonsurfactant polymers allow for the synthesis of mesoporous zeolite single crystals with various compositions and different framework types. Moreover, extra functional groups can be added in the polymers to incorporate desired functionalities into hierarchical zeolites.
Introducing specially oriented and ordered mesopores within soft templates is still a great challenge. To achieve this, Xiao and coworkers synthesized a designed cationic amphiphilic copolymer by treating the copolymer polystyrene-co-4-polyvinylpyridine with methyl iodide (C-PSt-co-P4VP, Figure 8A, inset). (155) Using this polymer, unidirectional mesopores of 6–60 nm were introduced within the ZSM-5 single crystals along the b-axis owing to their strong interactions with the negatively charged silica species (Figure 8A,B). The resulting zeolite ZSM-5 with oriented mesopores showed a much higher catalytic conversion than that of the ZSM-5 with nonoriented mesopores in the condensation reaction of bulky substrates. They further used a conventional nonsurfactant cationic polymer (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDADMA, Figure 8C, inset) as a dual-function template to simultaneously generate micropores and b-oriented mesopores within zeolite Beta single crystals (Figure 8C,D). (156) The quaternary ammonium groups on the polymer served as a structure-directing agent (SDA) for the zeolite, the same as surfactant-based dual-function templates. (157−164) It should be noted that, without hydrophobic segments, PDADMA did not self-assemble in aqueous solution to form micelles or ordered liquid crystalline structures that would disrupt the crystallization of the zeolite framework. Besides, the flexible PDADMA molecules do not affect the crystallization of zeolites into a thermodynamically stable form, that is, into a single crystal.

Obviously, the cationic polymer templating approach is not limited to hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 and Beta zeolites, which were synthesized by mixing mesoscale PDADMAC with microscale tetraethylammonium hydroxide. By blending mesoscale cationic polymer templates with other small organic ammoniums, a series of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites with various structures are obtained. (153) Moreover, the great diversity of available low-cost industrial cationic polymers makes it possible to fabricate a wide range of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites on an industrial scale.
One of the most important problems in the above-mentioned soft template directed synthesis of hierarchical zeolite is the long hydrothermal time required for zeolite synthesis. In particular, it is of notable concern for zeolites with a relatively high Al content. To solve this problem, a bulk crystal seeding method was developed and found to be effective in the hierarchical zeolite synthesis. (165) In a typical synthesis, a purely microporous ZSM-5 zeolite sample with a Si/Al ratio of 15 was added into the synthesis reaction gel as the crystallization-accelerating seed. This ZSM-5 zeolite was composed of aggregates of 100–200 nm bulk crystals. This resulted in a five-fold rapid generation of MFI nanosheets. It was reported that seeding is an effective way to minimize the use of the organotemplate in the syntheses of hierarchically porous zeolites, resulting in cost and waste reduction and subsequent economic and environmental benefits. (166)
Besides the inclusion in zeolite crystals, polymers can also be used to introduce mesoporosity in zeolites by assisting in the aggregation of zeolite particles, leading to the formation of interparticle mesoporosity. For example, Song et al. reported a novel synthesis route for the self-assembly of Beta zeolite nanocrystals with the help of mesoscale cationic polymer PDADMAC, conducting to the formation of bulky Beta particles containing interparticle mesoporosity. (167) Notably, the mesopores in the bulky Beta zeolite sample are disordered, which may be due to the use of irregular cationic polymers. (151) In comparison, the use of surfactant micelles will usually result in the formation of ordered mesostructures. (75,76) If PDADMAC was substituted by conventional surfactant molecules such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), the bulky particles were not obtained. This suggested that the mesoscale cationic polymers with high charge density are easily assembled with Beta zeolite nanocrystals via their surface hydroxyl groups, leading to the aggregation of Beta zeolite nanocrystals to form bulky Beta zeolite particles. It is difficult for the conventional surfactants with relatively low charge density and small sizes to create a strong interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of Beta zeolite nanocrystals and thus direct the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals. Moreover, polymers can also act indirectly as flocculating agents. Nanozeolite aggregates with tunable interparticle mesopores were synthesized by the flocculating action of a cationic polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA). (168) With PDDA, highly-concentrated zeolite Beta precursor firstly crystallized into zeolite nanocrystals, and then, these crystals aggregated in a one-step procedure with nearly 100% yield, exhibiting interparticle mesopores with very high mesopore volumes and surface areas. In addition, the interstitial mesopore size in the zeolite nanocrystals can be tuned between 40 and 400 nm by varying the polymer concentration, which is an important parameter.
Organosilanes
In order to create mesopores less than 10 nm in zeolites, Pinnavaia and coworkers used silylated polymers to effectively construct zeolite morphologies. (148) The phase separation between the zeolite precursor and the organosilanes is minimized due to the formation of the covalent Si–O–Si linkage. Both the incorporated silicane fraction and the micropore template were removed after calcination. For example, polyethylenimine or poly(propylene oxide) diamine was silylated with glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane and was then incorporated into the zeolite precursor gel. The resultant zeolites exhibited intracrystalline mesopores of 2–3 nm, and the pore size was decided by the silylated polymers. For these silylated templates, the silylated ends are anchored in the zeolites while the alkyl fragments created the mesopores. Tunable length and composition of the alkyl fraction lead to various hierarchically porous zeolites. A great variety of alkylated siloxanes have been reported. Generally, these templates are divided into cationic organosilane surfactants, neutral alkyl amino siloxanes, and alkylated siloxanes. Cationic organosilane surfactants are directly used as mesopore templates to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites, which will be discussed in this section. Neutral alkyl amino siloxanes and alkylated siloxanes are always used to functionalize the zeolitic seeds to further prevent the zeolite growth.
Cationic organosilanes were first synthesized by Ryoo and coworkers to prevent the separate formation of zeolite and ordered mesoporous molecular sieves. (169) The cationic organic molecules balance the negative charge of the zeolite framework, or they fill the space in the voids of zeolite framework, thus stabilizing the formation of zeolite phases under the required conditions. The organosilane surfactant has a hydrolysable methoxysilyl moiety connected to a hydrophilic quaternary ammonium and a hydrophobic alkyl tail. (170) The template 3-(trimethoxysilyl propyl))hexadecyl dimethylammonium chloride ([(CH3O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2C16H33]Cl, TPHAC) was added directly to the conventional MFI synthesis gel and then hydrothermally converted to zeolite phase (Figure 9A). (169) In a typical zeolite synthesis condition, the CH3O–Si bonds in TPHAC firstly hydrolyzed to HO–Si and then formed Si–O–Si or Si–O–Al covalent bonds with silica or alumina sources. Thus, the surfactant micelles of TPHAC were well incorporated within the zeolite product. This was mainly due to the participation of the silica moiety present in TPHAC to the zeolite crystal formation with sodium silicate (or tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS). Meanwhile, the quaternary ammonium head groups serve as SDA, and the hydrophobic alkyl tails assemble into a micelle, creating uniform mesopores within zeolites (Figure 9B,C). Besides, the mesopore size can be precisely controlled by simply extending the hydrophobic tail length of the TPHAC template (169) or by adding higher concentrations of the organosilanes. (172) Depending on the different alkyl chain lengths ranging from C12 to C18 in TPHAC, disordered wormholelike mesopores of about 2–7 nm were created (Figure 9D,E). (169) An extension of mesopore size to 24 nm was observed when the synthesis gel was enriched with the triblock copolymer EO20PO70EO20 (poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide), P123). (172) Xiao and coworkers further extended this synthesis strategy to synthesize a series of aluminosilicate zeolites with other zeolite structures like the LTA structure (zeolite A), (171,172) and other framework compositions like aluminophosphate zeolites with the CHA structure (zeolite SSZ-13), FAU structure (zeolite faujasite-X), (173) AFI structure (zeolite AlPO4-5), (174) and AEL structure (zeolite AlPO4-11). (174) For example, it was generally difficult to introduce mesopores into zeolite X, the high-aluminum version of FAU (Si/Al ratio 1.0–1.5), using the commonly applied desilication route; however, using the octadecyl derivative TPOAB ([(C2H5O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2–C18H37]Br), mesopores were successfully introduced into zeolite X.

The organosilane surfactant is also a promising candidate to control the formation of nanosheets, especially for the zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio that are difficult to be prepared by using other types of SDAs. (173) The direct synthesis of zeolites with layered structures via the SDA approach is still in an early stage of development. Recently, this approach has been employed to prepare hierarchical zeolite nanosheets with MFI and FAU topologies. (405)
Surfactants
Monovalent Surfactants
The specially designed amphiphilic organosilane surfactants and nonsurfactant polymers offer precise control over mesoporosity, but they are difficult to synthesize and very expensive. Thus, it is still desirable to use conventional cationic surfactants, which are cheap and readily scalable porogens to introduce mesopores into zeolites. Due to their excellent mesopore-generating role in the synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials, surfactants are considered as a reasonable template to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites. Initial attempts of such approaches were based on the use of mixed templates of monovalent surfactant molecules, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr, mesopore template) and small organic ions, such as tetrapropylammonium (TPA+, micropore template), to simultaneously generate mesoporous and microporous structures in a single zeolite material. (406) However, the interaction of the zeolite with monofunctional surfactants (e.g., CTABr) is not strong enough to compete with the zeolite-forming SDA (e.g., TPA+ for MFI zeolite). (15,178,383,407) In most cases, only a physical mixture of bulk zeolite and an amorphous mesoporous material was obtained due to the phase separation caused by the competition between the two different templating systems. (175)
To improve the interaction between the conventional monovalent cationic surfactants and the negatively charged silica-based species during zeolite synthesis, cosolvents such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) were introduced into the synthesis system, thus facilitating the condensation of the zeolites around the surfactant micelles and resulting in the formation of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites (Figure 10A). Using this method, hierarchically mesoporous zeolites, such as Y or sodalite, were synthesized (Figure 10B). (176) The addition of cosolvent altered the assembly of the surfactant micelle and increased the charge density of the micelle, resulting in an enhanced interaction between the silica species and the surfactant micelles. The resultant materials exhibited a high surface area and large pore volume from the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals (Figure 10C). (176)

Cotemplates, such as nonionic amphiphilic copolymer F127, (408) sulfonic-acid-ended organosilane, (409) carboxyl-ended organosilane, (410) and amphiphilic organosilane, (179) were added to assist CTABr in synthesizing hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 without the phase separation between the mesoporous phase and microporous zeolite phase. For example, Wang et al. reported the preparation of a hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 on the basis of a dual surfactant system made by mixing an amphiphilic organosilane (3-[(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] octyldimethylammonium chloride, TPOAC) and an ordinary surfactant (CTABr). (179) The effects of different combinations (different molar ratios) of these two mesogeneous templates (TPOAC/CTABr) on the mesoporosity of the highly siliceous mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were also studied. CTABr showed a more effective retarding effect than TPOAC on the nucleation and crystallization of the MFI structure. The effect of hydrothermal conditions on the interactions between surfactant molecules and silicate species has been made evident and has been shown to also play a crucial role in the structural transformations of silica precursors. Chen et al. found that, in the silicate-CTABr system, the original hexagonal structure of MCM-41 transformed to lamellar and then to the microporous MFI framework as the reaction temperature increased from room temperature to 150 °C and then to 165°C, respectively. (210) Besides, several successful attempts were reported in which microporous zeolites were crystallized at room temperature. (211−213) Thus, the low-temperature crystallization of zeolites in the presence of surfactant micelles seemed to be a possible approach to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites. There were a few reports on the synthesis of LTA (Linde type A) zeolite nanocrystals with CTABr. (207−209) In these procedures, the organic surfactant was used as a capping agent to effectively minimize the crystalline size of the zeolite. The surfactant prevented further crystal growth by covering nanoparticle surfaces by electrostatic attraction, coordination bonding, or hydrogen bonding, or even using weak van der Waals interaction to the surface atoms. (180) The observed hierarchically porous structure in the products followed a two-stage growth mechanism. Small zeolite nanoparticles were formed and assembled around the CTABr micelles at the early stage of the gel evolution. The slow crystalline rate of the amorphous phase and the low growth rate of the formed crystals kept the CTABr micelles within the crystalline domain during the second stage. After template removal, the resultant zeolites exhibited abundant mesopores due to the intercrystalline voids among the aggregated zeolite nanocrystals. However, the surfactant capping was not effective enough to generalize the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with other frameworks. The difficulties in the synthesis of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites using the conventional monovalent surfactant as soft templates have been mainly attributed to the weak binding between these monovalent surfactant molecules and silicate species which induces the phase separation. (411−413)
Multivalent Surfactants
To avoid the severe phase separation observed in the synthesis using monovalent surfactants, two-in-one (dual-function) templates have been developed which are surfactant-based. (158−161,177) The synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites using multivalent surfactants has been reported. (178−181) These surfactants directed a periodically ordered mesostructure by the self-assembled supramolecular micelle while micropores were generated by individual surfactant head groups. (182) Thus, the surfactants should have a sufficiently strong interaction with the growing zeolite surface to effectively compete with the zeolite SDA to allow for successful dual-template synthesis of hierarchical zeolites. (183−185) Wu et al. synthesized a mesoporous CHA zeolite by using C22H45N+(Me)2C4H8N+(Me)2C4H9 as a mesopore template in a synthesis mixture containing N,N,N-trimethyl-adamantanammonium hydroxide for the micropore formation. The mesopore was generated by the growth interruption of zeolite crystals. Jo et al. further synthesized FAU-, MOR-, CHA-, and MFI-type zeolite nanocrystals using the capping effect of the multivalent cationic surfactants in the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. (180) The nanocrystals formed due to the stronger and multiple binding effect of the surfactant molecules on the zeolite surfaces when compared with monovalent surfactants. The agglomerated zeolite nanocrystals possessed intercrystalline mesopores. However, the zeolite morphologies (nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets) and the intrinsic zeolite structures were still controlled by the surfactants.
The phase separation could be effectively eliminated in the synthesis using dual-function templates. However, there are still two major processes which are neither thermodynamically nor kinetically compatible: the condensation of aluminosilicates that forms the micropores and the assembly of surfactants that creates mesopores. The mesopores induce great strains inside zeolite structures. A supramolecular self-assembled mesoscale structure forms rapidly while the zeolites crystallize slowly. Therefore, it is quite difficult to simultaneously realize the long-range order of both micropores and mesopores. Surfactant-based templates create the ordered mesopores within zeolites at the cost of the crystallinity of the zeolite structure. Consequently, most developed zeolites possessed a lamellar structure with alternated two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets. For those two-dimensional zeolites (2D zeolites) constructed by nanosheets or nanosheet assemblies, the third dimension is limited to 2–3 nm, that is, a 1–2 unit cell. They exhibited large intersheet mesopore volume, high external surface area, open porous structures, and a large number of exposed acidic or catalytic sites when compared with conventional three-dimensional zeolites.
Long-chain alkyl-quaternary ammonium molecules are usually used to synthesize mesoporous silica materials due to the strong interactions between quaternary ammonium species with the inorganic frameworks. (75,186−189) Choi et al. were the first to succeed in synthesizing lamellar mesostructured zeolites with dual-function surfactants (C22H45–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C6H13, C22-6-6). (157) The ammonium head groups induced the conversion of the amorphous silica precursor to the microporous crystalline zeolitic framework while the self-assembled surfactant tails directed the zeolite crystal morphology into the formation of a lamellar mesostructure. Based on the synthesis condition, the MFI zeolite nanosheets could be obtained in the form of multilamellar stacked MFI nanosheets (Figure 11A–C) or unilamellar MFI nanosheets (Figure 11D–F). For these multilamellar MFI zeolite nanosheets, the samples were arranged in a regular way along b-axis, resulting in the formation of uniform mesopores between neighboring nanosheets. However, the ordered mesopores disappeared after calcination. (157) An effective approach to inhibit the collapse of MFI zeolite layers is to introduce silica pillars in the interlayer space to maintain the ordered mesoporous structure of multilamellar MFI zeolite nanosheets. (158)

After the success of the C22-6-6 dual-functional surfactant, Ryoo and co-workers extended the synthesis strategy to various zeolite structures (MFI, BEA, MRE, and MTW) in the form of nanosheets or nanosponges (165,190,191) by varying the localized SDA groups in surfactant molecules (160−163,192−194) and mesoporous structures.
A series of Gemini-type multiammonium surfactants (Figure 12A) were synthesized and used as structure-directing agents (SDAs) for ordered mesoporous molecular sieves with a crystalline microporous structure. (162,182) For example, a triquaternary ammonium surfactant C18H37–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C18H37 (18-N3-18) generated a hexagonally ordered mesoporous molecular sieve that possessed crystalline walls (Figure 12B–D). (162) The multicationic fractions in the surfactant generated the micropores. Contrarily, the resultant zeolite Beta nanocrystals aggregated in a disordered arrangement when the micropore porogenic part in the surfactants is replaced by a phenyl group, (162) as reported in the synthesis of disordered mesoporous molecular sieves like KIT-1. (414) Besides, the average thickness of the framework is directly decided by the quantities of the ammonium groups in the surfactant. More ammonium groups led to thicker walls. Moreover, the mesopore size was tunable from 3.8 to 21 nm by using 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB) as a micelle-swelling agent. (157)

Recently, Xu et al. reported that aromatic groups introduced into the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant molecules (195,196) not only provide π–π interactions that could stabilize the lamellar micelle but also adjust their configuration to geometrically match the MFI zeolitic framework (Figure 13A). It was found that the dual stabilization effects made by multiple positively charged ammonium heads and the strong π–π interactions in the surfactant template energetically favored the formation of an MFI zeolite framework with a 90° rotational structure (Figure 13B). The resulting zeolite nanosheets had a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure, in which the primary microporosity formed in the MFI nanosheet and the secondary mesopores in the 90° rotational boundary, and the tertiary macropores were constructed by the mutual pillaring between the plates. A theoretical analysis further confirmed that the coexistence of multiple quaternary ammonium heads and aromatic group tails in one surfactant molecule would significantly reduce the binding energies for mesostructured zeolites. Furthermore, they realized the cylindrical assembly of surfactants by introducing azobenzene into the hydrophobic tail of a surfactant with a diquaternary ammonium head group. This allowed the formation of ordered mesoporous MFI zeolite with an ordered two-dimensional square mesostructure (Figure 13C). (197)

2.1.1.1.2.2. Secondary Methods
As previously defined, the secondary methods contain a two-step synthesis process, in which all the components except the surfactant are added in the first step, while in the second step the soft template can either assist the assembly of zeolite seeds into hierarchically porous structures (149,169,214−218,415) or form microemulsions/reverse micelles for “confined space synthesis”/“steam-assisted conversion” of hierarchically porous zeolites. (219−222,416)
Soft Template-Assisted Assembly of Zeolite Seeds into Hierarchically Porous Structures
Neutral organosilanes, such as phenylaminopropyl trimethoxysilane (PHAPTMS), were also used to introduce mesopores in zeolites. Serrano and coworkers reported a multiple-step seed-silanization route to synthesize zeolite nanocrystals with extremely small crystal sizes and enhanced surface area and mesopore volume by interrupting the zeolite crystallization process through seed silanization. (149) The method was based on hindering the zeolite growth by modifying the zeolite seeds with PHAPTMS to avoid aggregating. The incorporated organosilane groups created interparticle mesopores among zeolite nanocrystals. The type and quantity of these organic fractions are key factors to decide the textural properties of the resultant zeolites. By this method, aggregates of zeolite (ZSM-5 and Beta) nanocrystals with interparticle mesopores were obtained. (149) The resultant MFI zeolites have identical textural properties with the ones templated by TPHAC described in the previous section as part of the primary method. (169) Both methods resulted in the aggregation of crystalline zeolite nanocrystals (10 nm) and created a large total surface area of 590 m2 g–1 and a uniform mesopore size centered at about 5 nm. The study on the effect of the nature of surface-silanization species on the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolite ZSM-5 nanocrystals was further carried out and showed that PHAPTMS was the best choice. (415) Moreover, they studied the effect of the main synthesis variables in order to obtain Beta zeolite samples with large external surface area and high pore volume. The mesoporosities of these nanozeolites were easily controlled either by varying the precrystallization conditions or by changing the quantity or the type of the organosilane. (216)
Based on their previous studies, Serrano et al. synthesized mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 by the crystallization of organosilane (PHAPTMS)-functionalized zeolite nanoseeds under hydrothermal conditions. The removal of the structure-directing agent and organosilane was made by calcination. (214) The anchoring of organosilanes on the external surface of the zeolitic seeds was a decisive factor to prevent the nanozeolite from further growing into large crystals (Figure 14A). The resultant mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite particles of about 300–400 nm were aggregations of ultrasmall zeolite crystallites below 10 nm with a significant degree of intergrowth (Figure 14B,C).

Moreover, it was found that, due to the strong interaction between the silanization agent and the linear alcohols, the viscosity of the gel decreased, and the silanization degree of the nanozeolites increased by combining silanization with alkoxylation by adding alcohols like 2-propanol or methanol. (217) For example, based on this strategy, Zhu et al. synthesized hierarchically mesoporous zeolites through the direct self-assembly of the kinetic controlled zeolite seeds. The resultant materials exhibited intercrystalline or intracrystalline mesoporosity. (218) It was realized by a two-step procedure. The zeolite synthesis gel was firstly aged at 100°C for various time intervals to form sub-nanocrystals (zeolite seeds) with various degrees of polymerization. (218) Subsequently, the surfactant was added to direct the self-assembly of these sub-nano-pre-crystalline zeolites in hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Finally, either a mixture of mesoporous silica and microporous zeolite; mesoporous zeolites with cubic shape; or aggregates of nanocrystals with intercrystalline mesopores were obtained depending on the aging time of the zeolite seeds. (218)
Simple alkylated siloxanes (alkyl = methyl, propyl, and octyl) were also reported by Srivastava et al. to synthesize mesoporous ZSM-5. (215) The size of zeolite nanocrystals was reduced to 20 nm by adding alkyltriethoxysilane into the conventional zeolite synthesis gel. Such an alkyltriethoxysilane-mediated synthesis method can effectively control the size of the zeolite crystals, particle morphology, and mesoporosity.
Use of Microemulsions and Reverse Micelles
Another example of soft templating is the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites in microemulsions which function as nanoreactors for the zeolite growth. (416) They are as effective as the confined voids in porous carbons. (16,45−50) Generally, the main principle in this approach is the phase-separation process of a mixture (an organic and an aqueous phase) during the zeolite formation, resulting in a stable, biphasic emulsion formed by the zeolite mixture (aqueous phase) and the porogen (organic solvent). (219,220) Thus, cosurfactants are necessary to assist surfactants to avoid the complete phase-separation in the microemulsion. (221) For example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether (nonionic surfactant) and butanol (cosurfactant) were used as emulsifiers to generate the aqueous droplets, consisting of TEOS/TPAOH/H2O, in heptane (organic solvent). (220) For each aqueous nanodroplet, zeolite Silicate-1 crystallized independently during the hydrothermal process. The surfactant adsorption became obvious as these encapsulated zeolites grew into a certain size, resulting in the aggregation of spherical microparticles constructed by zeolite nanocrystals. The resultant material exhibited intrinsic micropores and additional inter- or intraparticle meso-macropores. The crystallinity and size of such agglomerates can be easily modified by altering the aqueous phase and the concentration of water. (220) Similarly, Lee and Shantz also used microemulsions to synthesize Silicalite-1 microspheres/platelets aggregated by zeolite nanocrystals. (222)
In contrast, Li et al. used a two-step approach. (219) The organic phase (CTAM in ethanol) was emulsified in the aqueous zeolite synthesis solution. The mixture was aged and then dried at 60 °C to obtain an amorphous dry gel containing zeolite precursor, microporous SDA, and CTABr micelles (mesoporogen). The dry gel was then crystallized in the “steam-assisted conversion” process and transformed into hierarchically porous zeolite Silicalite-1 with interconnected trimodal pores. In such a two-step process, the generation of additional meso- or macropores is separated from the formation of crystalline zeolite. Thus, it can also be considered as a crystallization process in which a porous amorphous material successfully transformed into a hierarchically porous zeolite.
2.1.1.2. Indirect Templating Route
Hierarchical zeolite materials, including zeolite composites and zeolite monoliths, can also be prepared without direct mesopore or macropore porogens. In the indirect templating route, hierarchically porous zeolite is synthesized by partial zeolite crystallization of a mesoporous material (active composite partner) or by the deposition of microporous zeolites onto a mesoporous skeleton (inert composite partner). It is actually a borderline between direct templating and nontemplating routes. The indirect templating method typically produces composites consisting of supported nanosized zeolite crystals. Generally, these composite partners are divided into inert supports (223,224,385,386,417−430) and active supports. (108,225−243,431−461)
The inert supports can only be used as a macroporous template and cannot be used as the initial nutrients. (223,224,385,386,417−430) The active supports generally contain one or two components, such as silica materials, porous glass, aluminosilicates, and titanosilicates, which might be able to form the building blocks of the zeolite framework. (108,225−243,431−459)
2.1.1.2.1. Inert Composite Partner
Zeolite composites have at least one additional material apart from zeolites. Generally, the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolite composites includes a zeolite-shaping process (spray drying, granulation, tableting, or extrusion) by using either inorganic (silica, alumina, silica–alumina, or their mixtures) or organic (cellulose) binders (417,418) and ex situ or in situ zeolite coating on additional supports which should either be able to generate intercrystalline porosity or be porous itself, respectively. In most cases, binders such as SiO2 nanoparticles are added to the suspensions or slurries in order to obtain the stable zeolite coatings. Physicochemical interactions occurring between a zeolite and a binder during the shaping process result in composites with properties different from their simple mechanical mixture. However, the addition of binders often causes a decrease in the performance of zeolites due to the micropore blocking or the inactivation of active sites. (419)
To overcome these disadvantages, a number of new methods to synthesize the hierarchically structured zeolite composites with meso- and/or macropores without binders were developed. An alternative way is to deposit zeolite nanoparticles onto the surface of supports with tailored macropores. Hierarchically structured catalysts with zeolites as active components and inert porous materials as supports have been reported. Various porous materials can be used as inert supports, such as glass, (385) porous α-Al2O3, (386,420) alumina ceramic foam, (421) stainless steel, (422,423) cordierite honeycomb, (424) and SiC. (425−429) Generally, the hierarchical zeolite composites were obtained by a conventional one-step hydrothermal crystallization. In a typical process, the supports were first immersed into a zeolite synthesis solution, and then, the surface of the macroporous supports was loaded or coated with the zeolite crystals, leading to the desired inter-macroporosity. Zampieri et al. deposited MFI (Silicalite-1 or ZSM-5) zeolite nanocrystals on the ceramic foam supports through an in situ hydrothermal method, resulting in a novel zeolite–ceramic composite with the bimodal pore system. (223) Similarly, Wang et al. reported the layer-by-layer coating of zeolite nanocrystals on diatom supports. (430) However, in these hierarchically structured zeolite composites, the zeolite loading and the zeolite–support bond still need to be improved since weak acidity and poor mechanical strength will significantly limit their further applications. (224)
2.1.1.2.2. Active Composite Partners
2.1.1.2.2.1. Partial Crystallization of Active Composite Partners
An effective method to ameliorate the mechanical strength of the hierarchically porous zeolitic composites is to use supports that function both as a macroporous template and as initial silica and alumina nutrients. The active support can be partially crystallized during the construction of the micro-macropore structures, resulting in the successful incorporation of the active component into the monolith structure. These supports include hierarchically meso-macroporous silica or aluminosilicates, (227,230,236,238,431−433) sintered kaolin honeycomb, (434,462) diatoms, (435) biomorphic rattan-derived cellular Si-SiC ceramics, (436,437) pumice granules, (438) and porous glass. (439−443) Generally, the preparation routes are divided into in situ and ex situ crystallization of the consolidated supports. Various methods are available for the synthesis of monolithic structures, such as extrusion, (444) inverse replication, (445) hydrothermal treatment, (227,433) dry-gel conversion, (435) and 3D printing. (446) In all these examples, the supports were partly crystallized and still worked as macroporous supports.
In Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners
Hierarchically porous Zeolite composites can be prepared by partial crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 in the presence of appropriate microporous structure-directing agents. The resultant zeolite composites are exactly zeolite nanocrystals supported on or embedded into an amorphous mesoporous matrix. The synthetic approach of partial crystallization of ordered mesoporous silicates was firstly reported by Jansen et al. (225) After the ion exchange with tetrapropyl ammonium cations (TPA+), hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica partially crystallized in glycerol medium to give the formation of mesoporous materials containing very small protozeolitic or tectosilicate structures within the mesopore walls. Huang et al. realized the crystallization of ZSM-5 nanocrystals within the mesopore walls of MCM-41. (226) A hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica MCM-41 was firstly self-assembled from the initial synthesis gel containing the mesopore template and conventional zeolite synthesis components. The resultant support containing microporous structure direct agent TPA+ was subsequently crystallized, and ZSM-5 nanocrystals were formed within the disordered hexagonal mesoporous materials.
Ex Situ Crystallization of the Active Composite Partners
Hierarchically structured zeolite composites can also be prepared by first impregnation of mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) (433) or mesoporous cellular foams (MCFs) (227) with zeolite seeds and then hydrothermal treatment. Trong On and Kaliaguine used larger-pore and thick-walled SBA-15 instead of smaller-pore MCM-41 as the mesoporous support. (228,229) The composites were prepared by impregnating calcined SBA-15 into TPA–OH with designed chemical composition and following hydrothermal synthesis. By this method, both SBA-15/ZSM-5 (228) and SBA-15/TS-1 (229) were obtained. Similarly, another mesoporous composite comprising zeolite ZSM-5 was also obtained by hydrothermal treatment of the TPAOH-impregnated aluminosilicate gel. (447) A similar procedure using mesostructured cellular silica foams allowed the synthesis of mesoporous composites containing zeolites ZSM-5 and Y with larger mesopores. (227) MCM-41 was also reported as mesoporous supports for the synthesis of zeolite Beta nanocrystals. (230)
2.1.1.2.2.2. Complete Crystallization of Active Composite Partners
As discussed above, a partial crystallization of active support yields a zeolite-containing composite material while a complete transformation of ordered mesoporous materials results in a purely crystalline zeolite phase. The crystallization of preformed meso- or microporous supports is an efficient method to prepare zeolitic monoliths with hierarchical porosity.
Ideally, a hierarchically porous catalyst should possess both macropores and mesopores of uniform pore size within the macropore walls which in turn need to be constructed from tunable microporous zeolite units. To achieve this, a complete crystallization of bimodally porous preforms containing mesopores and macropores has been proven to be an efficient strategy to fabricate hierarchically macro-meso-microporous structure in all-zeolite materials. The major challenge is to preserve the macro-mesoporous hierarchy in the preformed supports during the zeolitization process. Therefore, a careful process control or a pore-protected synthesis should be made to yield high-quality zeolites with three-level porosity. Attempts were made previously to transform the amorphous silica skeleton into a crystalline zeolite system through the dry-gel conversion process. The starting porous hierarchy can be well preserved through a vapor atmosphere but not in solution. In this way, zeolite Silicalite-1 with hierarchical porosity can be produced by transforming the skeleton of porous silica into Silicalite-1 crystals. (231) The micropores were from Silicalite-1, and the mesopores and macropores were formed within macroporous silica gel. The same approach was followed to prepare hierarchically meso-macroporous ZSM-5 (108,232,233) and Beta (240) zeolite monoliths, which exhibited a higher catalytic performance in the cracking of large molecules than conventional microporous materials. Sachse et al. developed a pseudomorphic route to transform a macro-mesoporous silica monolith into zeolite composites, while maintaining its complete crack-free morphology allowing its use as a flow-through microreactor. (233) Based on the similar route, an amorphous silicoaluminophosphate monolith was crystallized into a hierarchically macro-meso-microporous zeolite SAPO-34, (236) in which the macropores arose from the interconnected spheres by aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals, and the mesopores were constructed by aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals. Besides, a seed-induced layer-by-layer synthesis method (239) or a vapor phase hydrothermal transformation (238) was also used to synthesize differently shaped binderless zeolite monoliths with interconnected macro-micropores. A pore-protection synthesis was proposed by Tong et al., in which carbon as a solid template was used to preserve the pore channels of the starting silica monolith as a whole without any structure collapse during the zeolitization transformation process. (241)
A novel glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) method was developed by Chen et al. to fabricate a series of highly stable and reusable large zeolite blocks with a hierarchically interconnected three-level micro-meso-macroporous structure. (234,235,237,242,243) Meso-macroporous materials (aluminosilicates, titanosilicates, zirconosilicates, aluminosilicophosphates, etc., ...) with amorphous architectures and well-defined macrochannels and very uniform interconnected interparticle mesopores were used as precursor materials. (448,449)Figure 15A displays the schematic representation of the synthesis of hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolite TS-1 as an representative example by this glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) process. (237) First, the starting titanosilicates with amorphous architecture were synthesized via a spontaneous self-formation procedure on the basis of the chemistry of metal alkoxides (450−459) without any external templates. A droplet of Ti alkoxides and alkoxyl silanes with a defined molar ratio was simultaneously added into aqueous solution. The high-speed hydrolysis and condensation of two alkoxides lead immediately to the formation of a large number of titanosilicate nanocolloids which aggregated together to give a gel structure in the droplet as found in a sol–gel process. Water and alcohol molecules quickly released from high-speed hydrolysis and condensation will generate macrochannels as microporous porogens. Simultaneously, the self-assembly of nanocolloids of titanosilicates gave rise to the formation of well-organized and very uniform mesoporosity. (450−459) These meso-macroporous titanosilicate preforms present thus well-defined macrochannels and interconnected mesopores. The amorphous hierarchical titanosilicate preforms after drying were first impregnated with the TPAOH (SDA) solution, then filled completely with glycerol liquid, and finally gradually transformed into a crystalline material with the zeolite TS-1 framework. The macropore channeled structure was preserved owing to the presence of glycerol liquid in the macrochannels. Furthermore, the crystallization rate was largely reduced due to the quasi-solid-state nature of the amorphous hierarchical titanosilicate preform. The slow crystallization rate allowed the preservation of initial hierarchical mesoporosity and well-organized microchannel arrays. Consequently, the hierarchical micro-, meso-, macro-pore systems obtained were homogeneously distributed throughout the final large zeolite blocks. The hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolite TS-1 materials presented a well-organized macroscopic network with uniform straight channel-shaped macropores, arranged parallel to each other inherited from titanosilicate preforms (Figure 15B). The macropore walls were constructed entirely from uniform zeolite nanocrystals in a size of 150 nm with high crystallinity (Figure 15C), resulting in uniform interparticle mesopores in the products. Furthermore, the synthesis of micro-meso-macroporous materials with a whole zeolitic architecture by using this novel glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) process is not limited to the synthesis of only hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous TS-1 zeolite but has been extended to the synthesis of micro-meso-macroporous zeolites with different crystalline frameworks, such as zeolite ZSM-5 (Figure 15D,E), (234) Beta (Figure 15F), (235) and Zr-Silicalite-1 (Figure 15G). (242) It is envisioned that this synthetic process can be further extended to synthesize a large variety of zeolite and zeotype frameworks such as SAPO, AlPO, Y, and X with highly organized and interconnected hierarchical micro-meso-macroporosity.

In conclusion, many templating routes were attempted to introduce meso- or macropores into zeolites during the past decades, and they can generally be divided into either “direct templating” or “indirect templating” routes. Different synthesis methods result in qualitatively different meso- or macroporosity, such as the amount, location (intra- or intercrystalline), size distribution, and interconnectivity of the additional pores. In addition, different routes have quite different effects on the intrinsic microporosity, crystallinity, acid-site strength, and distribution of the zeolites. Efforts should be made to achieve the optimal balance between the introduced mesoporosity and the intrinsic microporosity, thus realizing the better catalytic performances in zeolites.
2.1.2. Nontemplating Route
Hierarchically porous zeolites can also be prepared without the employment of secondary hard or soft templates. Several methods including engineering of intergrowth, (173,244−251) additive-assisted crystallization, (173,218,252−262) seed-induced synthesis, (263−274,463−465) a controlled crystallization process, (275−289,466,467) and designing special structure-directing agents (290−292) have been reported for the synthesis of hierarchically porous zeolites in the absence of organic templates.
2.1.2.1. Engineering of Intergrowth
Hierarchical materials with interconnected micropores and mesopores have been prepared by branching of zeolite nanosheets by repetitive twinning or other intergrowth processes. The method is applicable to all zeolite structures that can either grow anisotropically as thin layers or support branching at certain acute angles. Zhang et al. reported a mesoporogen-free approach for the synthesis of hierarchically structured zeolite by a repetitive branching mechanism on the basis of the correlation between the presence of structural twins and layerlike crystal growth. (249) The morphology modifying agents were tetrabutylphosphonium and tetrabutylammonium ions, which induced the formation of small amounts of the twin structure MEL as the MFI-type nanosheet branching points. They found that, in an environment that favors the epitaxial intergrowth of two structures with different levels of symmetry, the higher-symmetry structure (MEL) acts as a link to connect the lower-symmetry structures (MFI) to create branching. The regular and repeated intergrowth of these two zeolite frameworks induced mesopores into zeolites, and the mesopore sizes were decided by the frequency of branching (Figure 16A). (250,468) The resultant self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite consisting of orthogonally connected single-unit-cell thick MFI nanosheets was obtained from the intergrowth of two different zeolite frameworks (Figure 16B,C). (573) In a similar strategy, hierarchically structured zeolites were synthesized by sequential intergrowth during a hydrothermal synthesis using solely (C3H7)3N+–(CH2)5N+(C3H7)3 (diquat-C5) (Figure 16D). (251) The resultant single-crystalline hierarchical MFI zeolites had additional mesopores within the zeolite plates and macropores from the intergrown structure (Figure 16E,F). The organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used in this method for the formation of the microporous zeolite framework was slightly different from the tetrapropylammonium cation. In particular, these OSDAs favored the generation of ultrathin plates with perpendicularly rotational intergrowth, resulting in the formation of the hierarchically porous structure. The synthesis of hierarchical zeolite formed by the intergrowth of two zeolite crystal structures has been explored in other systems, such as FAU/EMT, (173) EMT/FAU, (244) ETS-4/ETS-10, (245) CAN/SOD, (246) MFI, (247) and CHA. (248) However, only the SPP morphology has been reported to contain zeolite nanosheets of single-unit-cell thickness. (249)

2.1.2.2. Additive-Assisted Crystallization
In most cases, additives, such as growth inhibitor agents, (218,252,256−258) polyanion nucleation promoter, (253,259,260) and growth modifying agents, (173,254,255,261,262,469,470) were used to control the crystallization process during the hydrothermal crystallization to obtain well-developed mesopores in microporous zeolites.
The growth inhibitor agents, such as amino or ethanol, were reported for the formation of nanozeolite aggregates. Zhang et al. developed a facile amino-acid-assisted strategy for constructing hierarchically nanosized ZSM-5 with a single-crystalline structure, defect-free frameworks, and abundant interconnected interparticle mesopores (Figure 17A). (252) It was achieved by using l-lysine molecules to control both the oriented aggregation of protozeolite nanoparticles formed at low temperature and the intraparticle ripening process at high temperature.

The role of small l-lysine molecules was studied and is essential since they not only inhibited the crystal growth but also facilitated the oriented aggregation of protozeolite nanoparticles in a noncompact manner. For the l-lysine-assisted crystallization, small l-lysine molecules play thus two very important roles. On one hand, a small amount of l-lysine solely acted as a crystal growth inhibitor to produce nanosized zeolite single crystals, while for excess l-lysine, l-lysine molecules induced the aggregation of protozeolitic nanoparticles in an oriented way at low temperature in a noncompact manner. This is particularly applicable for the targeted modified synthesis that results in reduced zeolite crystalline size. Besides, the high-temperature intraparticle ripening resulted in the formation of defect-free hierarchical nanozeolites with abundant interconnected interparticle mesopores (Figure 17B–D). Ni et al. prepared hierarchical zeolite 4A microspheres in a simple ethanol–water mixed solvent system without any templates or structure-directing agents. (256) Adding ethanol into the conventional hydrothermal synthesis could change the physical properties of the synthesis system, such as alkalinity and viscosity, which could further affect the interactions among various species in the mixture and finally lead to products with a different structure and morphology. The presence of ethanol could hinder the overgrowth of zeolites crystals and slow down the crystallization process, which favors the self-assembly of zeolite nanocrystals and their subsequent deposition on the primarily formed crystals to build hierarchical spheres. (257) Similar phenomena were observed in the synthesis of hierarchically mesoporous zeolites by a hydrothermal route using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as mesoporogens. (218,258)
Protocols consisting of multiple reaction steps have been developed for the synthesis of mesoporous nanozeolite aggregates starting from highly diluted “clear solutions”. (259) A polyanion nucleation promoter (H2PO4–) was first reported by Kumar et al. (260) The presence of ionic species with greater polarizing ability enhances the process of crystallization significantly by accelerating the condensation process. (260) By adding H2PO4–, Fang et al. realized the in situ assembly of MFI zeolite nanocrystals into a mesoporous aggregate with single-crystal-like morphology without a secondary mesopore template. (253)
Organic additives, such as 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TPOAC) (254) and low-cost N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), (262) are able to direct the formation of zeolite nanosheets. Figure 18A illustrates the rotational intergrowth of hierarchical FAU/EMT zeolites. (254) The EMT zeolite nucleated close to the edge of sheet 1 on (111) and (111̅) faces followed by branching to generate sheet 2. Further growth results in the formation of interpenetrated sheets with a hierarchically open house-of-cards arrangement (Figure 18B). (254) The EMT domains within the sheets were further confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 18C,D). Low-cost N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was also reported as an additive in the synthesis system to direct a special hierarchical structure in zeolites. (262) The resultant ZSM-5 sample presented a regular house-of-cards-like morphology, which consisted of some orthogonal sheets.

Simple inorganic salts like Zn(NO3)2 and Li2CO3 instead of organic molecules can be used as “morphology modifiers” to generate FAU-type zeolite nanosheets. (173,254) The added Zn2+ ions conducted to the formation of a pronounced layerlike zeolite morphology with a cuboctahedral layer arrangement very similar to the layered morphology of NaX obtained from the synthesis with TPHAC. (255) The presence of Li2CO3 also resulted in the formation of well-defined cuboctahedral nanosheet assemblies but with particularly pronounced hexagonal (111) plates in a more skeleton-like arrangement.
Besides, growth modifying agents were also applied in the formation of layered zeolite crystals. These agents can be selectively adsorbed on certain crystal faces and change their growth rate, (261) leading to intercrystalline mesoporosity (hierarchically porous zeolites) or spanning meso- and/or macropores between the layers (aggregates of layered crystals).
2.1.2.3. Seed-Induced Synthesis
Seed-induced crystallization of zeolites in the absence of organic templates has already been realized in the synthesis of several important zeolites such as ZSM-5 (MFI), (263−265) TS-1(MFI), (471) Beta (BEA), (266−268,472) RUB-13 (RTH), (269) ZSM-12 (MTW), (270,271) RUB-50 (LEV), (268,272) and heulandite (HEU). (268) In this synthesis strategy, seed crystals of the target zeolite are synthesized using the conventional method with an SDA, and then, a small amount of the as-synthesized zeolite seeds are added to the organic template-free reactant gel to form the desired zeolite phase. The added zeolite seed crystals increase the nucleation and crystallization rate and enhance the quality of the desired zeolite phase by improving the crystallization. (463−465) Hierarchical SSZ-13 microspheres, with abundant mesoporous channels, have been successfully synthesized by adding calcined SSZ-13 zeolite crystals in the starting gel without organic templates. (273) This strategy not only remarkably reduced the production cost and environmental pollution but also significantly decreased the crystallization time and reduced the zeolite crystal sizes. High concentrations of zeolite nuclei accelerated the growth and assembly of nanozeolites into easily filterable, stable aggregates. Nada et al. reported the synthesis of nanocrystalline ZSM-5 with a high quality and yield by using a small amount of seeds and a short synthesis time. (274) The addition of preprepared zeolite seeds or seed gels into the zeolite reaction gels can promote the nucleation of the desired phase and suppress side products, resulting in a significant decrease of crystallization times and the reduction of the SDA concentration. The effect of seed size, synthesis temperature, synthesis time, pH, amount of seeds and aging time was systematically investigated. However, the reproducibility is highly dependent on the quality of the preformed zeolite seeds or gels. (274)
2.1.2.4. Controlled Crystallization Process
For the synthesis of hierarchically porous nanozeolite aggregates, the synthetic environment should favor zeolite nucleation rather than crystal growth. Typical synthesis strategies are the conventional hydrothermal treatment and dry-gel conversion process.
2.1.2.4.1. Conventional Hydrothermal Treatment
The nontemplate approach requires critical control over both the zeolite nucleation and growth process. By precisely controlling the kinetics of zeolite nucleation and growth, hierarchically core–shell structured MFI zeolite single crystals were obtained (Figure 19A). The zeolite precursor was first aged at low temperature (T1) for a period (t1) and then heated at higher temperature (T2) for another period (t2), (275) resulting in hierarchically structured zeolites with nonporous core and a hyperbranched shell (Figure 19B,C). (275) Aluminum-zoning was the determinant of the branching epitaxial growth behavior, leading to the generation of a porous shell. Most of the Al-related acid sites were exposed on the shell and were greatly accessible. (275) It was reported that Al facilitated the nucleation and slowed down the growth rate of MFI zeolite during the hydrothermal synthesis. (276) For example, hierarchical ZSM-5 with various morphologies and crystal sizes can be obtained by changing the synthesis conditions, such as the concentration (277) of the precursor solution, or the sequence of preparing aluminate and silicate mixtures. (278) Sodium-rich Na2O–Al2O3–SiO2–H2O precursor suspensions were also favorable for the organotemplate-free synthesis of ultrasmall hexagonal EMT zeolite nanocrystals (6–15 nm in size) at very low temperature (30 °C). (279)

Submicron-sized hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 spherical particles, constructed by a thin intergrown zeolite shell and a micro-mesoporous core formed by the aggregation of 30–50 nm MFI zeolite nanocrystals, were synthesized by regulating the nucleation and the growth of zeolites. (281) Such a unique hierarchical structure led to a wide interparticle mesopore-size distribution (3–15 nm) and created more mesopore volume. The resultant submicrometer spherical catalysts show significant improved mass transport and superior catalytic performance for the self-etherification of benzyl alcohol. A similar morphology was also reported for ZSM-5. (282) On the contrary, a mesoporous shell of uniformly arranged ZSM-5 nanocrystals and a microporous rod with a crystalline ZSM-5 core were synthesized by controlling silica/alumina ratios using conventional hydrothermal treatment under stirring, without any extra additives or pre-/post-treatments. (283) The key to obtain high mesoporosity in the crystals was the stirring of a synthesis mixture containing a relatively high concentration of alumina. Gaber et al. prepared faujasite sheets with a house-of-card assembled skeleton from inorganic sodium aluminosilicate sols simply by utilizing the gel “memory” effect of zeolite sols. (284) The memory meant that the hydrogels in zeolite synthesis were not found to substantially change the distribution of nuclei in the amorphous matrix, and the final crystal size was unaffected by the treatment. (284) The hierarchical morphology was optimized by suitable starting and final compositions, leading to the house-of-card assembly of the faujasite sheet (HCF) morphology with a narrow mesopore-size distribution.
2.1.2.4.2. Dry-Gel Conversion Process
The concentration of the zeolite synthesis gels greatly influences the final morphologies of the product. (473−476) The concentrated reaction mixtures resulted in the generation of mesoporous aggregates of Beta zeolite nanocrystals, while the diluted ones led to isolated zeolite nanocrystals. (259) Thus, the dry-gel conversion process, with a highly concentrated zeolite precursor for promoting nucleation, was found to be a useful way to construct a hierarchical structure aggregated by zeolite nanocrystals. By this method, amorphous mesoporous silica TUD-1 was successfully transformed into zeolite ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (285) Bein et al. reported that mesoporous zeolite Beta nanocrystals were obtained with nearly 100% yield rapidly without templates. (287) Using mesoporous or colloidal silicas together with tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) via a dry-gel conversion process resulted in assembled nanozeolites (20 nm) with intercrystalline mesopores of about 13 nm. Using this method, the Si/Al ratios in zeolite Beta can be tuned from 10 to 30. The synthesis parameters in this dry-gel conversion process should be carefully controlled, such as the drying temperature of the zeolite synthesis precursor, the induction period, and the humidity level, to ensure a high crystallinity and abundant mesoporosity. To simplify this method, Møller et al. used highly concentrated gels in a hydrothermal treatment to accelerate the zeolite nucleation and crystallization (Figure 20). (289) Dense zeolite precursor gels, containing aluminum sulfate as the potential nucleation promoter, were crystallized in a short time, resulting in highly mesoporous zeolite Beta aggregates. Besides, the mesopore size was controllable by tuning the crystalline time. With increased time, zeolite crystals continuously condensed into larger domains, thus generating larger intercrystalline mesopores. Hollow spheres with a 10–20 nm thick shell of Silicalite-1 nanocrystals were prepared by a simple self-aggregation process of nanocrystals without any templates. (286) They first prepared Silicalite-1 nanocrystals via dry-gel conversion, and later these nanocrystals produced hollow spheres with a shell of fused nanocrystals under ultrasound. Although silicalite hollow spheres can be obtained by this simple aggregation process of nanocrystals, the organization phenomenon observed in the sonication of the nanocrystals needs to be further studied. Bein et al. converted an alkali-containing dense precursor gel to hierarchical zeolite Beta utilizing the steam-assisted conversion method. (287) The individual and uniform zeolite Beta nanoparticles were first formed and then condensed into a mesoporous network, resulting in hierarchical self-sustaining macroscopic zeolite aggregates assembled from Beta zeolite nanocrystals. The dry-gel conversion method was also applied to the synthesis of hierarchical Beta zeolites, (287,288) ZSM-5, (253) and TS-1 (467) with similar morphologies. This dry-gel conversion process provided excellent mesoporosity, although it was difficult to scale up.

2.1.2.5. Special Structure-Directing Agents
Almost all the reports reviewed above used a traditional structure-directing agent (SDA) to direct the zeolitic structure. Uncommon cyclic diammonium templates, such as 3,10-diazoniabicyclo[10.2.2] hexadeca-12,14,15-triene-3,3,10,10-tetramethyl-dichloride, can effectively direct the formation to the BEA zeolite framework in a highly concentrated Na+ system (Figure 21). (290) The pseudomorphic crystallization of mesoporous gel resulted in the formation of zeolite BEA nanocrystals containing abundant intercrystalline mesopores. The mesopores were formed due to the strong affinity between the positively charged cyclic diammonium templates and negatively charged silicate species and the effective structure-directing ability of cyclic diammonium templates toward the zeolite BEA framework. This synthesis method is further expanded to other cyclic diammonium compounds that can direct the formation of BEA, MTW, and MFI zeolite nanocrystals. (291) Rigid cyclic diammonium compounds containing phenyl or biphenyl bridges can effectively direct zeolite frameworks containing 12-membered pore channels, such as BEA and MTW, while a cyclic diammonium compound connected with two flexible hexamethylene linkages formed MFI zeolite with a 10-membered pore channel. With the cyclic diammonium compounds, BEA, MTW, and MFI zeolites were formed with tunable Si/Al ratios.

Cost-efficient alternative templates with a rigid cyclic geometry, such as piperidine- or imidazole-based dicationic ionic liquids, were also reported in the synthesis of aggregates of zeolite Beta nanocrystals. (292) Rajkumar et al. prepared a variety of geminal dicationic ionic liquids and investigated their potential in the synthesis of zeolites. In their study, several piperidine- and imidazole-based geminal dicationic ionic liquids were prepared. It was concluded that only the chair conformation rather than the boat conformation in the piperidine-based reagents is favorable for directing zeolite Beta nanocrystals. Besides, only if the two imidazoles in imidazole-based templates generate a certain angle, interparticle mesopores can be created in zeolite Beta aggregates. (292)
Though great achievements have been realized in the nontemplating route for hierarchically porous zeolites during the past several decades, there still exist many challenges in the synthesis process. For example, this approach typically involves precise control over the crystallization process of zeolite synthesis protocols. No generalized approach has been achieved for many available zeolite structures. More efforts should be made to obtain a detailed insight into this synthesis route and to make significant technological developments.
As noted above, most of the research to date has focused on in situ approaches to produce hierarchically porous zeolites. These methods are worthwhile as they can yield solids with exceptional features. However, their further practical applications might be limited for the high cost of appropriate hard or soft templates. Additionally, the key point for the success of the “in situ approach” is the optimized interactions between the templates and the silicate or aluminosilicate species in the zeolite synthesis gels. Therefore, to efficiently mix the zeolite gel and the templates, elaborate synthesis steps are required. Besides, efforts should be made to achieve the optimal balance between the introduced mesoporosity and the intrinsic microporosity and the best control of the amount, location, size distribution, and interconnectivity of the additional pores. The template removal by combustion is a crucial step to obtain high-quality hierarchically porous zeolites, which requires careful consideration especially for large-scale industrial production. Therefore, the development of effective syntheses using low-cost template materials together with efficient and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies allows for the wide application of these template-based syntheses of hierarchically porous zeolites in the industries. As for the nontemplating method, hierarchically porous zeolites are produced without a mesopore or macropore template but instead from specially designed synthesis procedures. Most of these methods are not applicable for industrial synthesis due to their high costs and complicated synthesis routes.
2.2. Postsynthesis Approach
In contrast to the synthesis strategies discussed above, additional porosity can also be created within zeolites by postsynthesis treatment of zeolite crystals that leads to the formation of secondary meso-macropores. (477−485) Generally, the postsynthesis treatments of previously formed zeolites consist of demetalation (extraction of framework atoms) or delamination, which are realized by steam, (293−310) acid, (311,486−494) base, (312−340,495−509) or fluoride treatments (341,510−512) or more refined approaches such as swelling, (345−348) exfoliating, (342,349) or interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica. (350−352) The postsynthetic treatment is largely used in industry and the main source for the great success in the commercialization and application of zeolites in general, yielding superior properties of catalysts and adsorbents with high stability, designed composition, and desired acid site speciation. (353)
The most important advantage of the postsynthetic approach is its simplicity and low cost while the disadvantages of this approach include the requirement of very harsh conditions leading to environmental pollution, defects in zeolites, partial collapse of the zeolite structure, and low control on the selective and precise extraction.
2.2.1. Demetalation
Generally, the demetalation route involves the treatment of a conventional, purely microporous zeolite by selective chemical extraction of one constituent, a metallic or semimetallic component, from the pristine zeolite framework. The typical conditions required to selectively extract some elements from zeolite crystals are quite harsh. Thus, the extracting process usually involves the usage of strong acids or bases, (311−341,486−512) or steam, (293−310) in which the steaming or acid leaching is for aluminum extraction, and the alkaline or fluoride leaching is for silicon removal. (354) Recently, detitanation was also reported as a means to introduce intracrystalline mesoporosity in titanosilicate materials. (355−357)
2.2.1.1. Steaming
Steaming treatment is the most widely used dealumination method invented in the mid-1960s. (293) In a typical approach, zeolite crystals are treated in a water vapor atmosphere at high temperature (>500 °C). Under such conditions, the mobility of aluminum and silicon species is enhanced. The aluminum is finally extracted from the zeolite framework, leaving behind vacancies (hydroxyl nest) or partial amorphization of the framework. Some vacancies can be filled by free silicon species from the amorphous part while others grow to generate mesopores (Figure 22). (294−297) The spherical or cylindrical mesopores (pore size of 10–20 nm) created by dealumination are either isolated or connected. (298) However, their pore shapes are always uncontrollable. (299) Both the steaming temperature and time are decisive factors for the extraction of aluminum and the generation of mesopores. (300) This removed Al neutralizes the lattice charges, stabilizes the skeleton Al atoms, and prevents further dealumination. (301) Therefore, the amount of the extracted aluminum atoms has a limit in a single steaming cycle. (302)

In addition, the removal of aluminum and the migration of silicon lead to an increased framework Si/Al ratio and the formation of mesopores. However, the overall Si/Al ratio of dealuminated zeolites remains almost unchanged since the micropores and mesopores within the zeolites are partly covered by the debris from the amorphous part and the extraframework aluminum species. Mild acids, like diluted nitric acid or organic oxalic acid, can also be used to dissolve these extraframework species. Such a mild acid leaching process will not generate more mesopores. The complete extraction of the amorphous alumina residues finally creates intracrystalline mesopores with wide size distributions. For example, Lohse et al. reported a mesoporous structure (pore size of 10 nm) in zeolite Y formed by a steam treatment. (303) However, the residues of amorphous aluminosilicate fragments within the created mesopores seriously blocked these mesopores, which can be further removed with HCl treatment. After this acid leaching, the mesopore size increased to 20 nm. (303)
Besides, the framework dealumination can stabilize the pristine Y zeolites (FAU topology), since their high framework Al content results in an unstable protonic form, providing zeolites with a larger mesopore volume and a higher Si/Al ratio. The repeated steaming and acid leaching to remove the extraframework species can provide zeolites with a larger mesopore volume and a higher Si/Al ratio. This treatment has been largely used for the production of ultrastable zeolite Y (USY), which is the main component of the fluid cracking catalysts used in crude oil transformation. (304) The dealumination of the framework can also increase (hydro)thermal stability. (305) Nevertheless, most mesopores formed by steam treatment are intracrystalline without good accessibility and thus do not significantly improve the mass transfer of bulky molecules. (307) Some mechanisms in the steam dealumination process still remain unexplained, (308) almost 50 years after their discovery. (309)
The main disadvantage of steaming is that the additional porosity is generated at the sacrifice of framework Al atoms and the crystallinity. The relatively severe treatment causes amorphization of the partial zeolite framework, which decreases crystallinity and partially blocks the active sites. Another disadvantage is that the quantity and strength of the acidic sites are modified by the aluminum removal compared with the pristine zeolite. Besides, the amount and distribution of Al atoms in the zeolite framework are decisive of the quantity, the volume, the distribution, and the interconnectivity of the secondary mesopores. (310) Despite these drawbacks, the steaming treatment is still largely used to create additional porosity, adjust Si/Al ratio, and increase (hydro)thermal stability of zeolites.
2.2.1.2. Chemical Leaching
The chemical leaching as a largely spread post-treatment resulting in dealumination or desilication procedures, which correspond to the selective removal of framework aluminum or silicon atoms, respectively, from the zeolite structure, is an effective method to generate secondary intracrystalline mesopores. Based on sacrificing part of the zeolite frameworks, these leaching processes generate amorphous regions within the crystalline zeolites, and mesopores are formed after the extraction of the amorphous debris. In this section, we present a review of dealumination via acid leaching and desilication methods for the construction of hierarchically porous zeolites.
2.2.1.2.1. Acid Leaching
Acid leaching was first introduced by Barrer and Makki. Mineral acids are used to remove aluminum from clinoptilolite. (486) The acid leaching method can preferentially extract framework aluminum from a microporous zeolite to directly create mesopores within the crystals. Defect sites are formed through hydrolysis and breaking of the Si–O–Al bonds, thus leading to the formation of Si–O– defects and leaving extraframework alumina species behind. Mineral or organic acids with different acid strength such as nitric, sulfuric, or hydrochloric acids and acetic, oxalic, and tartaric acids were used at different concentrations. The effectiveness of this technique depends on the nature of the zeolite and acids used. For example, purely microporous mordenite, Beta, and ZSM-5 zeolites were partially dealuminated in HCl medium in an autoclave under microwave irradiation at 373 K for 15 min. Depending on the crystalline framework structure, Si/Al ratio, and acid leaching conditions, zeolite Beta was much easier to dealuminate than zeolite mordenite, while zeolite ZSM-5 was nearly unaffected. (487,488) The nature of the acid is a decisive factor for the final mesopore structure. For example, zeolite mordenite leached by oxalic acid had a much higher bulk Si/Al ratio but fewer mesopores than the one by nitric acid, owing to the higher pH of the oxalic acid solution and in particular the ability of the oxalate ions to coordinate with the aluminum ions. (487) Recently, Sun et al. reported the preparation of hierarchical SAPO-34 with a butterfly-shaped pore system by hydrothermal synthesis followed by an acid post-treatment. (311) They demonstrated the influence of different acids on the synergic effect of the multipores and acidic sites. The SAPO-34 treated with nitric acid or oxalic acid exhibits multipores including micropores, mesopores (40–50 nm), and macropores (62–500 nm). However, hierarchical SAPO-34 cannot be obtained by treating SAPO-34 with butanedioic acid. It was also found that acidic treatment could optimize the number of acidic sites of SAPO-34. The main disadvantage of acid leaching is the decreased number of acid sites leading to the increased framework Si/Al ratio and acid strength. (489) The creation of mesopores by acid leaching is always accompanied by the changes in number and strength of acid sites, making it complicated to separately study their influences on the catalytic performance. Besides, for the high-silicon-rich zeolites, the low amount of aluminum distributed in the entire framework will hardly be removed to generate a notable mesoporosity, since too few defect sites can be generated. (490−492) For example, it is difficult to induce the mesoporosity in ZSM-5 zeolites by a dealumination process, due to the low amount of framework aluminum that can be extracted. As for the low-silica zeolites (Si/Al < 2.5), dealumination leads to partial structure collapse. (493,494) Moreover, the introduced mesopores are isolated, and the selective dealumination process cannot create an interconnected mesopore system. A pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to study intracrystalline diffusion in a dealuminated Al-rich Y zeolite and indicated that the mesoporosity generated by such acid leaching did not enhance the diffusion of large molecules. (306)
2.2.1.2.1.1. Alkaline Leaching
Alkaline leaching or desilication refers to the selective extraction of silicon from the zeolite framework in alkaline medium. (326−331) Contrary to the difficulty for the acid leaching to extract Al atoms with zeolites of high Si/Al ratio, the alkaline desilication is a promising approach suitable for zeolite with high Si/Al ratio to prepare hierarchically porous zeolites due to its applicability as a postsynthesis treatment of purely microporous zeolites of high Si/Al ratios. (332) The most extensive investigations concerned with the influence of treatment parameters on the mesopore formation have been made for zeolite ZSM-5. (333) The Si/Al ratio was effectively expanded from about 10 to 1, and the mesoporosity was generated in ZSM-5 by desilication. (312−314) Besides, its effectiveness has also been demonstrated for other zeolite framework structures, including MTW, (315) MOR, (316) BEA, (317) AST, (318) FER, (319) MWW, (320) IFR, (321) STF, (322) CHA, (323) FAU, (324) and TON. (325)
When an alkaline treatment is applied, silicon atoms are selectively extracted from the zeolite framework, while aluminum species accumulate on the external surface, playing an important role in pore direction. (313,495) Other trivalent heteroatoms in lattice positions, such as Fe3+, Ga3+, and B3+, were also reported as the pore-directing agent. (496) Several routes were reported to control the desilication process within the optimal range of Si/Al ratios, such as partial detemplation–desilication, (497) microwave irradiation, (498) and the use of alternative bases (499,500) or pore-growth moderators. (13) Moreover, by combining alkaline with steam (501) or acid (495) treatments, the mesopore formation was accompanied by acidity modification.
Contrary to the acid leaching to extract Al species, the mesopores created by desilication are mostly interconnected and highly accessible from the external surface of zeolites, resulting in improved performances in diffusion-controlled reactions. (312) Based on the hydrolysis of Si–O–Si and Si–O–Al bonds in an alkaline environment, the mesopores are first generated on either the outer surface or the defect areas within the crystalline structure. (327,330,502) The hydroxide anions (OH–) would react with the silanol groups (defect sites) within the zeolite framework. The extracted silicate anions are stabilized by the alkali cation, resulting in voids within the framework. The Na+ ion is the best silicon atom leaching agent for its superior capability to stabilize silicate anions. (491)
The alkaline leaching for enhanced adsorptive capacity and improved catalytic activity was first reported by Young. (334) Mao et al. further systematically studied the desilication methods. (335) They used sodium carbonate as the leaching agent to selectively extract silicon atoms within the zeolite frameworks. To realize the control over the desilication process, sodium hydroxide was added to adjust the pH. (336,337) Ogura et al. reported that the alkali treatment with NaOH created mesoporosity in zeolites, leading to enhanced diffusion properties and improved catalytic properties. (338,339) Further works by Groen et al. (327,340) reported that the introduced uniform mesopores have a broad pore-size distribution around 10 nm. (340) The external surface increased from 40 to 130 m2 g–1 in the treated samples after the introduction of mesoporosity, but it was at the cost of microporosity.
Ciziek et al. (503) found a possible relationship between the framework Al within the zeolite and the desilication possibility. Repulsion between the negative AlO4 tetrahedra and OH– was found to prevent the hydrolysis of Si–O–Al bonds rather than the hydrolysis of Si–O–Si bonds, and hence, Al would slow down the dissolution rate. However, these only concerned unselective dissolution of zeolites but not the mesopore formation. Groen et al. systematically studied the role of Al on the controlled formation of mesoporosity in zeolites. (327,332,340,501) A framework Si/Al ratio of 25–50 was reported to be optimal for the controlled desilication of the zeolites ZSM-5, (327) mordenite, (316) and ZSM-12. (315) At lower Si/Al ratios, high Al concentrations (Si/Al < 25) prevented the silicon dissolution and limited the mesopore formation, whereas too high silicon zeolites with Si/Al > 50 showed random and too much Si dissolution, resulting in extensive mesopore generation and serious crystallinity loss (Figure 23). (327) The nonuniform concentration of Al in zeolites would affect the Si removal within the zeolites. Large zeolite ZSM-5 crystals (5–10 μm), with an Al-rich external surface, (504,505) dissolved nonuniformly when treated with alkaline solution. (331) Based on these studies, Groen et al. reported the influence of aluminum gradients and the crystalline size of the zeolites to control the mesopore formation. (328) By the use of the Al gradients in ZSM-5 crystals, they realized the construction of hollow structured zeolites with an Al-rich shell. (328) Besides, the stability of framework Al within the zeolite is also decisive to the created mesoporosity. (14) For zeolite Beta, the alkaline leaching dissolves the framework without keeping the Brønsted acid sites. (317) The poor stability of framework Al within zeolites SSZ-13 is also problematic for their desilication treatment. (323)

In addition to mesopore formation, desilication also impacts the composition and aluminum distribution, which are key properties intimately related to the catalytic performance. (312) Zeolites treated by an alkaline solution usually present a decreased bulk Si/Al ratio, micropore volume, and crystallinity while presenting an increased amount of Lewis acid sites. (314,325,506−509) Understanding the individual effects of the additional porosity and chemical composition of desilicated zeolites on their catalytic performance is thus highly relevant for their optimal design. It was reported that the variation both in chemical composition and in porosity induced by alkaline treatment significantly influences the catalytic performance of desilicated ZSM-5 in the liquid-phase alkylation of toluene with benzyl alcohol. (501) Thus, an optimal alkaline treatment is beneficial for preservation of the Al environment and the related acidic properties. (327)
2.2.1.2.2. Fluoride Leaching
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is often used to partially etch or completely dissolve silicon-containing materials. Valtchev et al. reported the first fluoride leaching, combining a physical and chemical treatment, for generating a controlled secondary pore. (341) The high-energy (238) U ion bombardment was used prior to the fluoride treatment to form amorphous parts in the zeolites which were then selectively removed by HF. (341) The selective removal is based on the more rapid etching rates of the amorphous versus the crystalline regions, leading to the formation of macropores through the entire crystalline structure. The obtained material showed higher catalytic activity and stable product selectivity in the conversion of m-xylene to para- and ortho-isomers. Figure 24 shows the pristine and the corresponding macroporous zeolites. The treated zeolite exhibited both similar crystallinity and similar Si/Al ratio but a negligible increased external surface as compared with the pristine zeolites. The method allows changing both the amount and size of the introduced pores. Besides, no additional framework species were found. A study of the dissolution of ZSM-5 in HF with different concentrations reported that a diluted solution was Al-selective. (510) The selectivity in concentrated HF solution was greatly reduced due to the large presence of difluoride ions (HF2–) having higher activity which can unselectively remove Si and Al atoms from the framework. The resultant hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite had similar compositions to the parent ZSM-5. Lately, similar results were obtained with concentrated NH4F solution, where the release of NH3 produced HF2–. (511) Recently, Qin et al. developed a new method based on etching zeolites with NH4F. (512) Small amounts of HF2– were in situ generated by the double hydrolysis of NH4F and then used to extract framework Si and Al atoms. (512) The etching species were homogeneously distributed inside the crystals. The dissolution kinetics can be controlled by both the concentration and the temperature of the etching solution.

In contrast to steaming or acid or alkaline leaching, this nonselective treatment using NH4F solution (removing Al and Si equally) has important advantages in the preparation of hierarchical materials with additional porosity. This treatment can be applied to zeolite with Si/Al ratios close to 1. Another important advantage is the increased number of Brønsted sites due to the preferential dissolution of defect zones and/or some nonzeolitic material present in the parent zeolites. The stress in these zones and the presence of surface hydroxyls make the defects more vulnerable for chemical etching.
In conclusion, this novel fluoride leaching route using NH4F solution to hierarchical zeolites with additional porosity is very promising. The method is universal and independent of either the composition or the structure of the parent zeolites. Moreover, the resulting hierarchical zeolites have a similar composition to their parents, which is quite different from the steaming or acid or alkaline leaching routes. Zeolite catalysts and adsorbents can now be modified more rationally by postsynthesis treatments.
2.2.2. Delamination
Contrary to the intracrystalline meso- or macropores created by the demetalation approach, delamination results in the formation of intercrystalline meso- or macropores in zeolites. After reducing the individual crystallite size from the micrometer scale to the nanometer scale in the third dimension, hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanolayers are obtained. (358) The interactions between the layers in these hierarchically porous zeolites are relatively weak (van der Waals interaction, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interaction). After the removal of the template, precursors in the hierarchically porous zeolites with a layered structure are usually condensed. (359) To solve this problem, the structures or compositions of these precursor are postmodified by swelling, (345−348) exfoliating, (342,349) or interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica. (350−352)
The swelling of lamellar precursors with surfactant molecules is usually the foundation for other postmodifications. For example, in a typical delamination process, the 2D zeolite precursor is first treated in alkaline solutions to expand the interlayer void assisted with surfactants. The obtained materials usually exhibit a high degree of intercrystalline (interlamellar) mesoporosity (Figure 25). (345) The initial swelling procedure is achieved in a high concentration of hydroxide (OH–) and surfactant with high temperature, which could reduce the desilication and structure degradation. (346) Tsapatsis et al. (360) proposed a milder condition to swell the lamellar precursor at room temperature to protect the layer structure. Then, Zones et al. reported a new swelling mixture containing F– and Cl– ions to swell the lamellar precursor in nearly neutral conditions, leading to increased active sites when compared with leaching in highly alkaline solution. (361) The hierarchically porous zeolite with a delaminated structure and intercrystalline porosity was obtained after the ultrasound treatment of the swollen precursor [MCM-22(P), PREFER, and Nu-6(1)] to form 2D-zeolites (ITQ-2, ITQ-6, and ITQ-18), respectively. (342)

An alternative pillaring step is applied to introduce or to retain the preformed porosity in hierarchically porous zeolites with a layered structure. Typically, pillaring can be achieved by intercalating surfactant molecules into the interlamellar space to expand the interlamellar distance. (362) This approach includes the impregnation of the surfactant chains with a soluble material in the interlamellar space and the following hydrolyzation in an aqueous solution. Finally, hierarchically porous zeolites with stable interlamellar mesopores (expanded interlayer space) are obtained after calcination. (158) The interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica could maintain the large interlayer space, which would disappear upon the calcination of the swollen precursor. (352) Wu et al. developed a versatile method by the interlayer silylation of the precursors with specially chosen silanes to obtain the interlayer expand zeolites (IEZs), (343,344) which resulted in hierarchically porous zeolites with stable interlamellar mesopores and high crystallinity. An additional stabilization of these zeolite sheets is made through pillaring, and the mesoporous voids created by the surfactant tails are retained even after calcination. (158)
The delamination approach leads to the exposure of a larger fraction of the highly acidic zeolite surface for adsorption and catalysis. However, the delamination approach is especially suitable only for a small range of zeolites. The biggest challenges of the delamination process are the high surfactant content and the alkalinity used for swelling leading to partial dissolution of the zeolite framework.
2.2.3. Recrystallization
The recrystallization approach involving zeolite dissolution and reassembly was first reported by Goto et al. in 2002 (513) and later by Ivanova et al. in 2004. (364) The first dissolution step is the partial dissolution of a zeolite framework and the removal of zeolite fragments, while the second reassembling process is to make these dissolving species form a mesoporous phase.
The dissolution degree is decisive for structural and textural properties of the recrystallized products. Various types of micro-mesoporous zeolites are obtained by tuning the corresponding recrystallization degree (Figure 26), (514−516) including coated mesoporous or mesostructured zeolite crystals (RZEO-1) formed by mild recrystallization with intracrystalline and intercrystalline mesopores; (364−372,380,517) micro-mesoporous nanocomposites (RZEO-2) containing cocrystallized zeolites crystals and ordered mesoporous phases obtained by deeper recrystallization; (364−372,513,518,519) and mesoporous materials containing small zeolitic units (RZEO-3) synthesized by full recrystallization. (364−378)

Surfactants are widely used in the recrystallization process to introduce additional porosity into zeolites. (379) The surfactant-templated recrystallization processes are divided into two different methods. The first synthesis is the one-step approach using surfactant templates with alkaline leaching to synthesize intracrystalline mesoporous zeolite single crystals. Based on the use of a dilute NH4OH solution, Garcia-Martinez and co-workers (379−381) first introduced a surfactant-assisted route to create mesopores within zeolites. Surfactants, such as CTAB, can direct well-controlled mesopores within different zeolite frameworks (Y, mordenite, ZSM-5). For example, zeolite USY (CBV720 with a Si/Al ratio of 15) was first treated by steaming and then immersed into a solution of CTAB in 0.37 M NH4OH solution (or 0.09 M tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution, TMAOH). The surfactants’ removal results in the generation of uniformly distributed intracrystalline mesopores. (380)
The second approach is the two-step approach consisting of partial-to-total dissolution of the zeolite in NaOH solution and the subsequent hydrothermal treatment with surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or chloride (CTAB or CTAC). The introduction of well-controlled mesoporosity into zeolite crystals is based on a crystal-rearrangement theory (Figure 27A). (380) Only when the Si–O–Si bonds were opened by a cationic surfactant in base condition and transformed into negatively charged Si–O– species can the structural reorganization be realized. This approach allowed the necessary interactions between the surfactant and the zeolite and avoided the dissolution of the crystals. Almost full retrieval was achieved during this mesostructuring process. SEM images (Figure 27B) indicate that the crystalline morphology remained almost unchanged. The copresence of both additional mesopores and high crystallinity within the zeolite edges is confirmed in the TEM images (Figure 27B). Besides, these intracrystalline mesopores lead to a significantly high hydrothermal stability. (380) This method successfully avoided excess silica loss or crystallinity loss of the zeolites and is applicable to various Si/Al ratio zeolites from a high Si/Al ratio (USY, mordenite, ZSM-5) to low Si/Al ratio (NaY and NaA), (363) by a pretreatment approach with a weak organic or inorganic acid.

In conclusion, the recrystallization route contains the primary desilication/depolymerization process and the secondary reassembling process. The former has been applied to various zeolite types with high Si/Al ratios while the latter has few reports. The synthesis can be easily controlled by changing the alkalinity during the desilication step and various mesoporosities can be introduced into the materials. However, mesoporosity is introduced into the zeolites at the expense of microporosity in the recrystallization route. This calls for further study of the depolymerization/reassembling approach for its wider use in zeolites with low Si/Al ratios. Finally, the range of the organic surfactants for the reassembling step should be widened in order to enhance the variety of the final hierarchically porous zeolites.
As noted above, most postsynthetic approaches including steaming and acid or alkaline leaching have been used to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites for decades due to their simplicity, scalability, and low cost. In these methods, most of the created mesopores are isolated cavities in the crystals and thus cannot significantly contribute to accelerating the mass transport. For example, the desilication has poor capabilities to tailor the mesoporosity and is seriously restricted by the relevant Si/Al ratio, leaching temperature, and leaching time. Dealumination decreases the number of acid sites with the Al-extraction from the framework. Accordingly, more efforts should be directed toward the controlled postsynthetic treatment, thus widening the applicability of this treatment. The postsynthesis of hierarchical zeolites with high structural stability and the design of such multimodal porous zeolitic materials with a better understanding of the cooperation between different pore systems still remain great challenges.
3. Hierarchical Structure
As discussed in section 2, a wide variety of strategies, such as in situ and postsyntheses, have been so far developed for generating additional pores, either inter- or intracrystalline or even a combination of both. The diffusion of molecules depending on the size and shape of pores plays a central role in the performance of zeolites. Figure 28 demonstrates the effect of pore size on the diffusion of molecules with varying dimensions. The configurational diffusion of these tightly fitting molecules into the micropores of zeolites is often the rate-limiting step of a catalytic reaction, and the molecular diffusivity is much smaller than that in larger mesopores or macropores.

For the simplest example of a diffusion limitation imposed by a uniform pore framework, the relative molecular uptake and release obey the following equation (521,522)
(1)
where R is the radius of the sample assumed to be a sphere, and DT is the intraparticle transport.
In the limiting cases of process control by intraparticle diffusion and surface permeation (surface-barrier control (523)), the respective moments (time constants of molecular uptake, release, or exchange) are
(2)
(3)
where DT is the intraparticle transport diffusivity, α is the permeability through the particle surface (“surface barrier”), and R is the radius of the particle assumed to be a sphere.
For purely microporous zeolites, DT in eq 1 refers to the micropore diffusivity Dmicro.
Equation 1 is also applicable for the microporous zeolites with additional (meso- and/or macroporous) transport pores when the exchange between the micropores and the transport pores is sufficiently rapid. In this case, DT refers to effective diffusivity DTeff
(4)
(5)
where Dmeso and Dmacro stand for the meso- and macropore diffusivity (with the first-order estimate as given by eqs 6–7) estimated by the Knudsen relation (521,524,525)
(6)
(7)
where d is the mean pore diameter, R is the gas constant, and M is the molar mass. The tortuosity factor τ considers the extension of the diffusion pathways by the pore space tortuosity and is typically of the order of 2–4. (521,526−528)
pmeso and pmacro are the relative amount of molecules in the transport (meso- and macro-) pores and can be estimated as (529)
(8)
(9)
where c is the guest concentration (in moles per unit mass), p is the gas pressure, and R is the universal gas constant. Vmeso, Vmacro, and Vmicro stand for the specific (per sample weight) total volumes of mesopores, macropores, and micropores.
With eq 2, the introduced transport pores into purely microporous zeolites will improve the mass transport under the fast-exchange conditions by enhancing the diffusivity DT (eqs 4 and 5).
Therefore, mass transport in hierarchically porous materials is highly dependent on the rate of mass exchange between these pore spaces. It is determined by the permeability of the interface between these spaces and by the hierarchy factor (13) defined as (Vmicro/Vtotal) × (Smeso/Stotal(BET)), where the mesopore surface area represents the interface between mesopore and micropores. Increasing hierarchy factors are known to result in increasing catalytic performance. (13,412)
As discussed above, the interconnected hierarchy between the transport pores (meso- or macropores) and the micropores allows for the accelerated intracrystalline diffusion.
As a consequence, the spatial arrangement of the introduced larger pores is of key importance. The introduction of two or three levels of porosities in microporous zeolites with the interconnected hierarchy offers an effective solution to achieve a faster mass transfer in the zeolite framework, in which the macropores provide an unimpeded transport path, and the mesopores provide a fast pathway for mass transportation and enhanced micropore accessibility, thus preventing the further conversion of reactants into undesirable side products (coke precursors) and thereby extending catalyst lifetime.
Table 1 summarizes the different strategies employed for different zeolites and structures with hierarchical porosity. Different geometries with isolated voids imbedded in the zeolites and open pore channels through the whole zeolite crystal are obtained according to the in situ or postsynthesis approaches, thus leading to notably different mass transfer patterns. It is still a great challenge to achieve an optimized porous hierarchy within zeolites. (384,530−533) To take full advantage of hierarchically porous structure in a catalytic reaction, it is important to maximize the interconnectivity among pores of multilevels. Thus, the fabrication of hierarchically porous zeolites needs an elaborated design that aims both at creating abundant meso- and/or macropores and at guaranteeing their interconnectivity within the microporous structure without compromising intrinsic properties of zeolites. Generally, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are divided into three groups based on the additional pore size, namely, micro-mesoporous zeolites (containing micropores and mesopores), micro-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores and macropores), and micro-meso-macroporous zeolites (containing micropores, mesopores, and macropores). This section presents some concrete examples on how to select and how to combine different preparation strategies described above in section 2 to fabricate each type of hierarchically structured zeolites.
3.1. Micro-Mesoporous Structured Zeolites
Extending the catalytic applications of the microporous zeolites to bulky organic molecules has long been a driving force for study aimed at mesoporous zeolites. Mesoporous zeolites combine the advantages of both the inherent crystalline structure of the microporous zeolite and an additional connected or disconnected, ordered or disordered, inter- or intracrystalline mesopore system. The introduced mesopores result in the exposure of a larger fraction of the highly acidic zeolite surface, thus making more pore openings accessible to the bulky reactants and further improving the already highly valued catalytic capabilities of microporous zeolites. The synthesis of mesoporous zeolites can be achieved either by introducing an additional pore system into zeolite single crystals, either during the crystallization process of the zeolite crystal or in an already synthesized microporous zeolite (intracrystalline mesopore, Figure 29A), or by a purposeful aggregation of individual zeolite nanocrystals or nanosheets (intercrystalline mesopore, Figure 29C,E).

3.1.1. Disordered Micro-Mesoporous Structured Zeolites
Many different strategies exist for tailoring the mesopore structure within zeolites to meet specific goals. The diversity of available approaches is discussed in section 2. Among them, the in situ templating synthesis is currently the most widely used method because of its versatility. The templating method is based on the addition of mesopore-scale hard and soft templates or supports into the synthesis mixture of microporous zeolites. The amount, size, distribution, and interconnectivity of the secondary porosity created in the microporous zeolites are directly related to the space occupied by the templates. This method can be applied to different zeolite structures with high yields and is especially suitable for preparing mesoporous zeolites with high zeolitic character and a large amount of introduced mesopores. However, the main drawback of this method is the difficulty of scaling-up due to the fact that the templates must be removed either by calcination (for organic templates) or by dissolution (for inorganic templates) under severe conditions after the crystallization process. For example, the high temperature during the calcination process can cause a strong damage of the zeolite crystalline structure.
The postsynthetic selective extraction of specific framework constituents (Al atoms or Si atoms) of the presynthesized microporous zeolite is another direct approach to prepare mesoporous zeolites. Obviously, these postsynthetic methods are not limited to the microporous zeolite systems to form mesoporous zeolite crystal but are also applied to introduce an additional mesoporosity in already mesoporous zeolite. These procedures are indeed destructive processes to scarify part of the as-synthesized zeolite crystals for creating larger mesopores. Thus, the main drawback of these methods is the dissolution and the great loss of the zeolite mass (up to 40% weight). The high-temperature steaming (534) and acid leaching techniques for removal of Al-atoms are widely used for zeolite Y, (535) mordenite, Beta, and ferrierite. The resultant mesoporous zeolites always exhibit low pore interconnectivity, disordered intracrystalline mesopore structure, and partial collapse of the microporous structure due to the relative uncontrollability of the treatments. For example, the steam-created mesopores in ultrastable Y (USY) are mainly isolated rather than interconnected and, hence, could not improve the diffusion of large molecules. (306) In addition, dealumination usually leads to an obvious change in Si/Al ratio and thus the acidity of the zeolites. Alternatively, desilication is more appropriate for creating an interconnected mesopore system. Basic media is used for the postsynthetic treatment to preferentially remove the framework silica atom from a given zeolite framework. This approach has been applied successfully to many zeolite topologies, such as MFI, (339) MTW, (315) MOR, (316) BEA, (317) AST, (318) FER, (319) MWW, (320) IFR, (321) STF, (322) CHA, (323) FAU, (324,536,537) TON, (325) and TUN. (538) However, its effectiveness strongly depends on the Si/Al ratio of the original zeolites. The presence of a high concentration of negatively charged AlO4– tetrahedra tends to stabilize the Si species, preventing its extraction from the framework. Contrarily, the silica-rich zeolites suffer from uncontrolled and excessive silicon atom extraction, resulting in wide pore-size distributions and extremely low yields. Besides, the desilication process usually leads to deposition of partial Al species on the external surface of zeolites and thus negatively affects the catalytic performance. (539)
Another type of mesoporous zeolite is the aggregate of zeolite nanocrystals/nanosheets. These aggregates are ideal candidates to facilitate mass transport based on their interconnected secondary pore system, large external surface areas, and short intraparticle diffusion pathways (Figure 29C,D). (157,540) Hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanocrystals can be prepared by the assembly and condensation of zeolite nanocrystals around surfactant micelles. This includes the use of common templates under specific synthesis conditions that favor nanozeolite growth. Seed-induced synthesis, multiple-step pretreatment, additive-assisted crystallization, and a controlled crystalline process are often used. The use of uncommon structure-directing agents, such as cyclic or linear diamino- or diamine structure-directing agents, under a common synthesis condition, or the self-assembly is also an applicable method to form larger and mechanically stable aggregates avoiding using a mesopore template. Hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanosheets can be obtained by postsynthesis (Figure 29E,F), such as swelling, (346−348) exfoliating, (342,349) or interlayer pillaring with amorphous silica, (350−352) or in situ synthesis, such as soft template synthesis which was successfully applied to the synthesis of layered aluminosilicates (157,158) and aluminophosphates. (161) These intercrystalline mesopores are unstable and can be easily destroyed when treated under high stress. It is still a great challenge to improve the structural stability of the zeolite nanocrystal aggregates.
3.1.2. Ordered Micro-Mesoporous Structured Zeolites
All of the aforementioned mesopores are often disordered in hierarchically porous zeolites. Generally, an interconnected and three-dimensionally ordered mesopore system is introduced into zeolites during the crystallization process. Additionally, the precise control over the ordered mesoporous structure in these zeolites is difficult to achieve. In this subsection, we select the strategies and methods to realize pore interconnectivity (ordered mesopores).
The most straightforward technique for constructing an ordered mesoporous structure within zeolites is the replication in ordered porous structures produced by templated synthesis using colloidal assemblies. The general idea for these replications is to partially or fully replicate the preformed sacrificial templates which direct the final structures. Additionally, morphological characteristics of the mesopores can be precisely controlled. The diameter of the mesopores in 3DOM/m materials can be tuned by altering the size of the original colloidal spheres. For example, Tsapatsis and his co-workers prepared microporous zeolites with ordered mesoporosity by using three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOm) carbons with a face-centered-cubic structure as hard templates (Figure 30A). (48,49) The confined growth of Silicalite-1 zeolite crystals in these templates afforded 3DOm-imprinted single-crystal zeolite particles, which showed a network particulate structure consisting of primary nanoparticles (about 10, 20, or 40 nm in diameter) (Figure 30B). A wide range of crystal morphologies can be imprinted into zeolite crystals by replication of size-tunable mesoporous carbon templates. (48) Moreover, this novel method can be applied to synthesize not only the aforementioned Silicalite-1 zeolite but also many other types of zeolites, like BEA, LTA, FAU, and LTL. (49) Collectively, the 3DOm structure endows zeolites with a highly ordered pore system and thus promises a fluent mass transport ability, which is useful in various applications like catalysis, sensing, and adsorption–separation.

The soft templating method is another conventional and general method for the synthesis of ordered micro-mesoporous structured zeolites. The diameter of the mesopores can be tuned by changing the surfactant. Additionally, the pores can be aligned perpendicular or parallel to the surface of the spheres. For instance, Ryoo and his co-workers prepared a functionalized surfactant and used it as a structure-directing agent (SDA) to synthesize zeolite MFI nanosheets with a thickness of 2 nm by the hydrothermal method. (158) The surfactant tails outside these obtained zeolite nanosheets direct their further aggregation into an ordered mesoporous multilamellar structure. Moreover, the diameter of interlayer mesopores can be controlled by tuning the surfactant tail length. Notably, the mesopores between zeolite nanosheets can be preserved by using silica pillars, even after surfactant removal (Figure 30C). In addition, it was observed that some paralleled zeolite nanosheets have single-unit-cell (Figure 30D). The pillared zeolite with a hierarchically ordered mesoporous structure possessed many advantageous features, like an ordered micro-mesoporous structure, large surface area, abundant pore volume, highly accessible acid sites, and tunable interlayer mesopores. (158) The hierarchically ordered meso-microporous zeolites will offer a short diffusion path during catalytic reactions, especially when large molecules are involved.
As a result of the numerous templating approaches that have been developed in past decade, researchers now hold in hand a vast choice of synthesis methods to construct micro-macroporous structured zeolites. More importantly, the in situ approach including hard and soft templating methods can produce ordered micro-mesoporous zeolite materials, which are very hardly obtained with postsynthesis methods. These ordered micro-mesoporous zeolites have the maximized connectivity between pores of various levels and can fully realize the benefits of hierarchy in catalytic reactions.
3.2. Micro-Macroporous Structured Zeolites
Macroporous zeolites constitute another important category of hierarchically porous zeolites. The introduction of a macroporous structure into a microporous zeolite results in a reduced diffusion path, accelerated mass transfer, and increased coke resistance in catalytic reactions. Many efforts have been devoted to synthesize macroporous zeolites. Various morphologies, such as hollow spheres (Figure 31A), (101) fibers, (145) and boxes (Figure 31B); (541) macroporous zeolite single crystals (Figure 31C); (120) and three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically macrostructured monoliths, were obtained.

The in situ templating method is an effective method to synthesize macroporous zeolites. Polymer spheres (97,99,430) or silica spheres (111,114,115) and other special materials, such as hydrothermally pretreated carbon black microspheres, (542) hydrothermally pretreated micron-sized carbon fibers, (543−547) the fly ash cenosphere, (124) silica-containing vegetal cells, (137) and CaCO3, (548) are widely used to template hollow macroporous structures in the zeolites. The final morphologies of the hollow structure in macroporous structured zeolites can be easily controlled by changing the initial template morphologies. (118) For example, most of the methods for preparing macroporous zeolite with a hollow sphere structure are based on a layer-by-layer assembly technology. This includes the first alternative deposition of oppositely charged zeolite nanoparticles and polyelectrolytes onto the polymer spheres (97,99,430) or silica spheres (111,114,115) to form a core–shell composite followed by the removal of the template core to fabricate a hollow structure. Macroporous zeolites with a hollow fiber structure are synthesized by incorporating bacterial supercellular threads into the as-synthesized silicalite nanoparticles. (145)
The self-assembly of the uniform spherical templates mentioned above can also be used to fabricate zeolite monoliths with closed or interconnected macropores. (112,113,117) Indirect templating involving both the inert support and the active support can also be used to synthesize macroporous zeolite monoliths. Inert supports are divided into permanent inorganic supports and sacrificial supports. In a typical synthesis, the microporous supports are immersed into the zeolite precursor solution, and then, the mixture is crystallized via a conventional one-step hydrothermal method. The synthesized zeolite nanocrystals are either loaded onto or coated onto the surface of these supports after impregnating the supports into the zeolite precursor solution. Different micro-macroporous zeolite monoliths are prepared by choosing various inert supports, such as diatoms, (430) porous Al2O3 beads/extrudes, (549) silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramic foams, (223,550) ZrO2/Y2O3, (421) cordierite honeycomb, (551) and stainless steel. (422) Sacrificial supports, including natural templates (bacterial supercellular threads, (145) starch gels, (147) wood cells, (139,141) egg membranes (131)) and artificial templates (polyurethane foam, PUF (106)), are also used to prepare hierarchically micro-macroporous zeolite monoliths. The resultant materials exhibit a diverse hierarchical structure but a relatively low mechanical stability. To further improve the mechanical stability, macroporous supports containing the initial nutrients for the zeolite growth, such as active silica or alumina, are used. (135,434−439,441−443) After the complete or partial crystallizations, binder-free hierarchically porous zeolites or partly zeolite materials with hierarchical macroporous supports are obtained. Thus, the resultant macroporous zeolites exhibit a high mechanical stability owing to the strong interaction between zeolite nanocrystals or zeolite coatings and supports.
Mesoporous silica spheres (120) and other templates, such as nanosized CaCO3, (121) can also be used as hard templates to introduce intracrystalline macropores in zeolites. For example, the MFI-type zeolite single crystal with a classical morphology and well-interconnected intracrystalline macropores can be prepared using mesoporous silica spheres as both a silica nutrient and a sacrificial macropore porogen. Intracrystalline macropores that are connected to the crystal external surface are formed after the crystallization process by the sacrifice of silica particles (Figure 31E,F). (120)
The in situ nontemplating route can also be used to prepare macroporous zeolites with a hollow sphere structure. For example, Silicalite-1 zeolite nanocrystals with a size less than 30 nm are self-assembled to form hollow spheres with a diameter of 100–300 nm after sonication in an ammonia–ethanol solution. (286)
The postsynthesis desilication process is also an efficient methodology to construct hollow micro-macroporous zeolite architectures. For example, macroporous zeolite with a hollow microbox structure are prepared by treating the high-quality ZSM-5 zeolite single crystal in a mildly alkaline Na2CO3 solution, avoiding the excessive destruction of ZSM-5 zeolite crystals (Figure 31C,D). (541) Besides, the postsynthetic recrystallization approach is also developed for the preparation of macroporous zeolite TS-1 (552) and microporous zeolite ZSM-5 (553) with hollow structures.
3.3. Micro-Meso-Macroporous Structured Zeolites
Most reported hierarchically porous zeolites contain either mesopores or macropores. However, hierarchically porous structured catalysts with both mesopores and macropores are more desirable in catalytic applications. Nowadays, it is still highly challenging to simultaneously create both mesopores and macropores within zeolites. Until now, only a few micro-meso-macroporous zeolites with pores at three length scales are reported.
The in situ direct template method can be used to obtain hollow SAPO-34 zeolite nanocrystals with intracrystalline meso-macropores. The catalysts are prepared via the seed-assisted crystallization using triethylamine as the sole structure-directing agent. The samples exhibited a hollow structure with mesopores and macropores throughout the entire crystals. (554)
The in situ indirect templating route is usually used for the synthesis of meso-macroporous zeolites. For example, a complete zeolitization of bimodally porous silica monoliths with a hierarchically meso-macroporous structure is an effective method to prepare various hierarchical zeolites with micro-meso-macroporous structures. For example, hierarchically porous Silicalite-1, (231) ZSM-5, (108) and Beta (240) zeolite monoliths are obtained by the transformation of the bimodally porous silica skeleton through a steam-assisted conversion. Thus, the sodalite (233) and SAPO-34 (236) zeolite monoliths with a hierarchical pore can be prepared by a pseudomorphic transformation of the meso-macroporous silica monolith (233) or a dry-gel conversion of amorphous silico aluminophosphate. (236)
The connectivity between the various levels of pores in hierarchical zeolites is the key to maximize the benefits of hierarchy in catalytic reactions. An ideal hierarchically porous catalyst should contain well-defined macropores, interconnected and uniform mesopores within the macropore walls, and tunable microporous zeolite units. To realize this, a novel glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization (QSSC) process was used to synthesize hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolites. (237) All pores were introduced throughout the entire product to give highly interconnected macrochannels with uniform mesopores and micropores (Figure 32A–C). By using this method, a series of hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolites have been synthesized. (234,235,237,242)

Hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous MFI-type zeolites, with a core–shell architecture composed of a nonporous core and an epitaxially grown hyperbranched shell full of mesopores and macropores, were prepared by an in situ nontemplating two-step controlled crystallization process. (275) The first step was synthesized at low temperatures (20–80 °C), and most precursors hydrolyzed and condensed to obtain precrystallized clusters, which further aggregated in an oriented order at medium temperatures (100–140 °C) during the second synthesis step. The branching epitaxial growth due to aluminum-zoning resulted in the synthesis of the hierarchically porous zeolites.
The postsynthetic recrystallization can be used to prepare metal-encapsulated hollow zeolite nanocrystals. The synthesis consisted of two steps. First, a template-free hydrothermal synthesis of hollow aggregates of metal-containing zeolite nanocrystals was realized, and then, a selective desilication–recrystallization together with a leaching–hydrolysis was performed to transform the metal-containing zeolites into metal-encapsulated hollow zeolite crystals. The obtained material was found to possess a microporous (0.4–0.6 nm) wall of hollow zeolite crystals and a mesoporous (5–17 nm) shell of a nanovesicle with macropores of about 350 nm in the core (Figure 32D–F). (555)
In conclusion, hierarchically porous zeolites available today can be divided according to the size range of the additional porosity from micro-mesoporous structured zeolites, micro-macroporous structured zeolites, and micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites, in which the secondary porosity can be found either within the zeolite crystals or in the intercrystalline voids. Numerous preparation methods are applied for hierarchically porous zeolites (Table 1). However, the underlying synthetic principles are simple, which are crystallization, aggregation, and extraction. (130) Hierarchically porous zeolites can be prepared by using a single principle or a combination of two or three principles during the synthesis process.
4. Applications
4.1. Catalytic Application
The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts. (556,557) Therefore, hierarchically structured porous zeolites are quite desirable for catalysis and other processes. (9,558,559) In this section, we illustrate the abundant catalytic applications of hierarchically porous zeolites as catalysts in various reactions and show how the hierarchical porosities in zeolites can improve the catalytic properties of parent zeolites. Figure 33 and Table 2 give an overview of the catalytic applications of hierarchically porous zeolites.

Table 2. Catalytic Reactions Employed over Hierarchical Zeolites
4.1.1. Friedel–Crafts Reaction
4.1.1.1. Friedel–Crafts Alkylation of Arenes
The liquid-phase catalytic conversion of bulky molecules mainly takes place on the external surface of microporous zeolites and is an important probe reaction to evaluate the structural advantages of hierarchical zeolites. The Friedel–Crafts (F–C) alkylation is one of the most important approaches to produce value-added aromatic compounds in industry via the formation of new carbon–carbon bonds between aromatic hydrocarbons and other aromatic agents. (726) Among these alkylations, the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, (162,574,576) toluene, (577) and mesitylene, (249,409,560,561,575,578) etc.) with benzyl alcohol (BA) or benzyl chloride (BC) in the liquid phase can produce diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are important intermediates widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and many other chemicals. (727) These reactions can be catalyzed by Lewis or Brønsted acids. Zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, (562,563) H-Beta, (564) HY, (565) and H-SAPO-5, (566) have been widely used in benzylation reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability. However, microporous zeolites are less active and deactivate rapidly in the benzylation of bulky reactants due to their relatively small micropore size. (567−570) Besides, as the contacting time of the reactants with the catalysts increases, further alkylation and isomerization of the alkylated products can occur. Polyalkylation, isomerization, transalkylation, dealkylation, and polymerization are all the possible side reactions under the normal reaction conditions. Thus, it is very important to choose appropriate catalysts to decrease these side reactions. Christensen et al. (563) demonstrated that the mesoporous zeolite catalyst had higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher selectivity to ethylbenzene (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, although the conventional zeolite catalyst had almost twice as many acidic sites as the mesoporous zeolite catalyst. This activity difference can be attributed to improved mass transport in the mesoporous zeolite. Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites could be the ideal catalysts for the F–C alkylation involving large molecules due to the facile diffusion through the meso-macropores, high stabilities, low apparent activation energy of the crystalline zeolite frameworks, and easy accessibility of acid sites to bulky reactants. (329,571,572)
4.1.1.1.1. F–C Alkylation Using Benzyl Alcohol (BA) as the Aromatic Agent
A hexagonally ordered mesoporous molecular sieve with a 1.7 nm thick wall of crystalline MFI-like microporous framework exhibited much higher catalytic conversion (44 wt %) in alkylation of benzyl with benzyl alcohol than both conventional Beta zeolite (19 wt %) and ordered mesoporous amorphous materials Al-MCM-4 (8 wt %). (162) This was due to the abundant accessible external acid sites in the as-synthesized mesoporous molecular sieves, as compared with Al-MCM-41 or conventional zeolite Beta. The acid number was characterized by titration of the zeolites using triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) as the probe molecule while the acid strength was measured by 31P magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR). (728,729) The bulky TPPO molecules are too large for the 12-member-ring micropores and thus can only reach the external acid sites on the mesopore surfaces. It was found that the 31P NMR chemical shift of TPPO increased with increasing binding affinity toward Brønsted acid sites. (728) The crystalline mesoporous molecular sieves titrated with TPPO exhibited 31P NMR signals up to 55.7 ppm compared with 44.3 ppm for Al-MCM-41, indicating that the mesoporous molecular sieves exhibit stronger acid sites than Al-MCM-41. Conventional zeolite Beta also showed NMR signals up to 55.7 ppm, but the amount of the strongest external acid sites was less than that of crystalline mesoporous molecular sieves. When the mesoporosity was introduced into bulky Beta zeolite resulting in the formation of mesoporous Beta zeolite with a nanosponge morphology, improved catalytic turnovers and extended lifetime in benzene alkylation with benzyl alcohol were observed. (574) The benzene conversion remained as high as 80 wt % even after 50 h. In contrast, the purely microporous Beta zeolite gave a benzene conversion of less than 20 wt % and deactivated rapidly after about a 10 h reaction (Figure 34). The high catalytic performance was attributed to the higher concentrations of accessible external acid sites on the large accessible surface due to the introduction of mesopores in the Beta zeolites. The 31PMAS NMR measurements proved that the quantity of the strongest external acid sites of mesoporous molecular sieves is much larger than that of bulky Beta zeolites. (162) These accessible active sites could catalyze the alkylation reactions even after active sites inside the zeolite micropores were deactivated. Similar results were observed for hierarchically porous zeolites with other morphologies, such as MFI nanosheets, MTW nanosponge, and MRE nanosponge. (574) Li et al. (576) prepared a series of hierarchically mesoporous mordenites by three different methods, which are acid leaching followed by base leaching (the samples HMOR-A1 treated with 72 mL of 0.2 M NaOH and HMOR-A2 treated with 87 mL of 0.2 M NaOH), soft templating using [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl][hexadecyldimethylammonium] chloride (the sample HMOR-TPHAC), and hard templating using carbon black (the sample HMOR-carbon). The HMOR-A1 and HMOR-A2 had highest BET surface area (524 vs 530 m2 g–1), which are 1.4 times higher than that of H-mordenites (378 m2 g–1) and 1.7 times higher than that of HMOR-carbon (317 m2 g–1). They further compared their catalytic performances in the liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with benzyl alcohol. The conversion of benzyl alcohol over HMOR-A1 and HMOR-A2 was near 100% after 3 h, but the conversion of benzyl alcohol on HMOR-TPHAC and HMOR-carbon was less than 3%. This was because diphenylmethane which was formed has a large size, and the conventional mordenite does not provide enough space for this molecule to diffuse through the micropores while the introduced mesopores enabled diphenylmethane to escape from the mordenite crystal.

Compared with benzene, toluene has a larger molecular size of 0.54 nm. Its alkylation with benzyl alcohol over hierarchically mesoporous mordenites and microporous mordenites confirmed the superiority of the introduced mesopores. (577) Hierarchically porous mordenites were prepared by a sequential post-treatment method based on a commercial mordenite with a Si/Al molar ratio of 15. (577) The hierarchically porous mordenites with acid–base–acid treatment (HM-ABA) had a mesopore volume of 0.32 cm3 g–1, which was three times higher than that of the parent mordenite (0.10 cm3 g–1). The HM-ABA also had the highest external surface area (119 m2 g–1), which was more than 3 times higher compared with that of H-mordenites (36 m2 g–1) and more than twice compared with that of acid-leached mordenite (49 m2 g–1) and acid–base-leached mordenite (58 m2 g–1). The results indicated that the acid-washing after base treatment can significantly increase the external surface area of the samples, which resulted from the complete removal of the deposited aluminum species from the framework. The high mesopore volume and external surface area of HM-ABA led to more accessible acid sites and accelerated mass transport. The apparent reaction rate constant for acid–base–acid-leached mordenite (HM-ABA) was 15 times higher than that for H-mordenite and twice those of acid-leached mordenite and acid–base-leached mordenite. (577)
Mesitylene has a kinetic molecular diameter of 0.87 nm, which is much larger than the entrance size of micropores in zeolite ZSM-5. Therefore, these bulky molecules cannot penetrate into the inner microchannels of ZSM-5, and the alkylation can happen only on the accessible external surface of the catalyst. (383) The introduction of meso- or macroporosity into microporous zeolites can facilitate the access of mesitylene to more active centers and thus leads to excellent catalytic conversions. Besides, the amount of accessible acid sites is the determinant of the product selectivity since the desired alkylation of benzene to 1-benzyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene cannot take place in the micropores whereas the side etherification of benzyl alcohol to dibenzyl ether can. (730) The base treatment of microporous Beta zeolites can significantly increase the accessible framework surface area and thus the number of accessible framework Brønsted acid sites. The hierarchically porous Beta zeolites prepared by base treatment exhibited excellent catalytic properties and remarkable product selectivity in the benzylation of mesitylene. (575) Zhang et al. (573) synthesized self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite by an MFI/MEL intergrowth and used it in mesitylene alkylation (Figure 35A). The orthogonally connected nanosheets created a permanent network of mesopores (Figure 35B). (158) Such nanometer-scale diffusion lengths offered fast transport even for molecules with a small micropore diffusivity. The catalytic properties of SPP zeolites at Si/Al of 253 were compared with those of pillared MFI prepared by hydrothermal synthesis via the cooperative assembly between silica and an organic surfactant functionalized with a diquaternary ammonium group, (158) three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous-imprinted (3Dom-i)) MFI, and three conventional MFI zeolite catalysts with a crystal size of 1.4 μm. The number of accessible acid sites was determined by a titrant molecule, 2,6-ditert-butylpyridine (DTBP), which cannot enter the zeolite micropores. Specifically, 30% and 45% of the acid sites in pillared MFI and SPP, respectively, were accessible by a molecule that cannot penetrate into the internal micropores. But only 2% of acid sites were accessible in a micrometer-sized zeolite crystal. Due to these more accessible acid sites, the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the alkylation of bulky mesitylene by benzyl alcohol increased by more than 2 orders of magnitude (Figure 35C). Jin and co-workers (409,560) systematically investigated the influence of mesopores on product selectivity in the benzylation of mesitylene over different ZSM-5 catalysts with various mesoporosities. Mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were obtained by the assembly via ionic interaction between sulfonic-acid-functionalized or nonfunctionalized ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals and counter cationic surfactant CTAB under microwave [Meso ZSM-5 (SO3H-CTAB)-MW and Meso ZSM-5 (CTAB)-MW] and hydrothermal synthesis [ZSM-5 (SO3H-CTAB)-HT] and ZSM-5 (HT)] (Figure 36A). Whichever synthesis treatment is used, the sulfonic acid functionalizations of zeolite crystals led to a large surface area and porous volume while microwave treatment induced mesoporosity. The surface area SBET and mesopore volume Vmeso varied as Meso ZSM-5 (SO3H-CTAB)-MW (529 m2 g–1 and 0.75 cm3 g–1) > Meso ZSM-5 (CTAB)-MW (500 m2 g–1 and 0.35 cm3 g–1) > ZSM-5 (SO3H-CTAB)-HT (388 m2 g–1 and 0.21 cm3 g–1) > ZSM-5 (HT) (348 m2 g–1 and 0.11 cm3 g–1), while the acid strengths were found to be approximately similar to the conversional ZSM-5 [ZSM-5 (HT)]. (409,560) The external acid sites in mesoporous ZSM-5 were more accessible for the guest molecules, leading to a nearly 5-fold increased catalytic activity than that of microporous ZSM-5 in the aromatic benzylation (Figure 36B). (409,560) The selectivity of desired monobenzylated aromatic molecules was determined by the degree of mesoporosity. As a result, mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 with the larger mesopore volume exhibited increased selectivity toward the desired bulky monobenzylated aromatics than those of microporous ZSM-5, which had dibenzyl ether as a major product due to the diffusion limitation.

4.1.1.1.2. F–C Alkylation Using BC as an Aromatic Agent
Dai et al. prepared hierarchical mordenite zeolite nanorod bundles by using organosilane functioned fumed silica as the silicon source. (578) The organic moiety linked on the surface of fumed silica inhibited the growth of zeolite crystal into a large size, leading to the assembled nanorod bundles. Samples prepared by organosilane functioned fumed silica with different ratios gave different BET surface areas, external surface areas, and mesoporous volumes. (578) The size of mordenite nanorods decreased as the organic function degree increased, leading to samples with a higher mesoporous volume (0.15 cm3 g–1) and larger external surface area (148 m2 g–1). The hierarchical mordenite nanorod bundles exhibited increased accessible active sites and thus increased benzylation (78.9 wt %) as compared with conventional mordenite (13.4 wt %). A similar phenomenon was observed for the spherical-like self-assemblies of ZSM-5 nanocrystals with controllable hierarchical architectures, which were prepared by using organofunctionalized mesoporous silica as the silica source. These spontaneously stacked nanocrystals had a large accessible surface area, and therefore, 67% of the Brønsted acid sites were accessible to bulky molecules. These hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals showed significantly high benzyl chloride conversion in the benzylation of mesitylene, and the reaction rate increased by more than 50 times as compared to that achieved by conventional ZSM-5. (561)
4.1.1.2. Friedel–Crafts Acylation of Arenes
The Friedel–Crafts (F–C) acylation of arenes is an important industrial process to synthesize aromatic ketones, which are widely utilized in pharmaceuticals, fragrance products, fine chemicals, and so on. (731) It involves the reaction of an aromatic hydrocarbon with acylating agents such as acyl chlorides (ACs) and acid anhydrides (AAs) in the presence of acid catalyst. (732) Recently, economical and ecofriendly heterogeneous solid catalysts have gained more attention. (733,734) Among these materials, zeolites exhibit a high activity in F–C acylation due to their strong acid sites and high stability. (735−737) Zeolite Beta and Y are known to be the most efficient catalysts for the F–C acylation of aromatic compounds due to their relatively large 12-membered-ring micropores. (582,738) However, they still suffer from fast deactivation due to the adsorption of heavy products and the permanent deposition of carbonaceous substances. This problem can only be solved by introducing mesopores into the zeolite framework. (739) The F–C acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride produced p-methoxy acetophenone (p-MAP) and o-methoxy acetophenone. All the catalysts showed a selectivity >99% for the product p-MAP. p-MAP yield based on the initial amount of acetic anhydride was thus used to compare the catalytic performance. (579) Hierarchical zeolite Beta was rapidly synthesized within 4 h with a high yield using a layered silicate precursor (H-kanemite) as the silica nutrient (Figure 37A). (579) The obtained hierarchical zeolite Beta consisted of self-sustaining macron-sized zeolitic aggregates assembled by uniform nanosized crystals and possessed relatively narrowly distributed intercrystalline mesopores around 20 nm with a high pore volume and external surface area. Their catalytic properties were investigated in the F–C acylation reaction and were compared with commercially available or traditional Beta zeolites. Traditional Beta with Si/Al of 20 (T-Beta-20) and conventional Beta with Si/Al of 20 (C-Beta-20) gave 20% and 30% yield of p-MAP in 30 min, respectively. It reached 26% and 35% in 1 h, and 33% and 43% in 3 h, respectively. In contrast, the hierarchical Beta zeolites with Si/Al of 20 (N-Beta-20) gave an enhanced yield of p-MAP, which reached 45%, 50%, and 57% in 30 min, 1 h, and 3 h, respectively. The highly improved catalytic performance of hierarchical Beta zeolite (N-Beta) was due to eliminated diffusion constraints contributed by the intercrystalline mesopores (Figure 37B).

Similar results were obtained by Kore et al. (580) Hierarchical Beta zeolites with inter-/intracrystalline mesoporosity exhibited excellent activity and selectivity for the synthesis of a wide range of aromatic ketones. Generally, conventional MFI zeolites were not suitable for the F–C acylation due to their relatively small 10-memberd-ring micropores. To solve this problem, Kim et al. (190) synthesized MFI zeolite nanosponges with disordered intracrystalline macropores. The abundant acid sites on the large external surface areas served as excellent catalytic active centers for the conversion of bulky aromatic compounds in the acylation of anisole with acetic anhydride. The hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolite thus exhibited a much higher anisole conversion (>80 wt %) when compared with micron-sized ZSM-5 crystals (14 wt %), which was attributed to the improved accessibility of the reactant molecules to the acid sites and the enhanced diffusion of the reactant/products through the intercrystalline mesopores. (582,583) Yan et al. (581) systematically reviewed the catalytic applications of hierarchical zeolites in a series of liquid-phase F–C acylation reactions, focusing on hierarchical ZSM-5 and Beta prepared by different methods. The nanohierarchical materials exhibited a higher catalytic activity than conventional zeolites in all liquid-phase reactions. The reduced crystal size of nanozeolites in the hierarchically porous zeolites provided short diffusion channels and thus increased the conversion rate of the reactants. Besides, the deactivation rate of nanozeolites was greatly reduced because the short diffusion path in hierarchically porous zeolites aggregated by nanozeolites allowed the fast transport of reactants/products and prevented coke deposition in the micropores.
The catalytic applications of hierarchical zeolites in the liquid-phase F–C alkylation and F–C acylation are briefly reviewed. Hierarchical zeolites are more active and more selective than the conventional zeolites in these liquid-phase reactions, thus making them appropriate for the conversion of a bulky molecule. Moreover, the abundant accessible active sites are decisive in the liquid-phase reactions. Therefore, efforts should be made to develop hierarchical zeolite materials containing both exciting structures and an increased external surface.
In conclusion, the Friedel–Crafts (F–C) alkylation and the acylation of arenes are both important approaches to produce value-added aromatic compounds in industry. Zeolites are widely used in the F–C reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability. However, conventional zeolites with relatively small micropores are less active and deactivate rapidly in F–C reactions due to the serious adsorption of heavy products and the permanent deposition of carbonaceous substances in their relatively small micropore size. Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites are the ideal catalysts for F–C reactions involving large molecules due to the facile diffusion through the meso-macropores and easy accessibility of acid sites to bulky reactants.
4.1.2. Beckmann Rearrangement
Zeolites with additional large pore systems are common strategies to reduce diffusion limitations in diffusion-controlled catalytic reactions. (85) Vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement reactions are usually carried out over zeolite catalysts. The introduction of additional porosity, such as mesoporosity, into zeolites seemed to be the best choice. The Beckmann rearrangement of ketoximes into amides is known as a fundamental chemical reaction in organic synthesis. (740) One of the most important rearrangement reactions used in industry is the conversion of cyclohexanone and cyclododecanone oximes into ε-caprolactam and ω-laurolactam, which are widely used as raw materials for the production of polyamides such as nylon-6 and nylon-12. (584) Hierarchically porous (HP) SAPO-34 zeolite was synthesized by a one-pot soft templating method using dimethyl octadecyl[(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl] ammonium chloride (DMOD). (585) The rodlike mesopores were interconnected within the micropores. The HP SAPO-34 contained both isolated weak Brønsted acid sites (red diamond, Figure 38A) and silanol sites within the mesopores (blue circle and square, Figure 38A). The obtained hierarchical zeolites showed excellent catalytic properties in the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to ε-caprolactam (Nylon-6), but their microporous counterparts showed lower catalytic activities and shortened lifetimes. The comparison shown in Figure 38B indicates that the conversion of the cyclic oxime over the microporous SAPO-34 significantly decreased (90% to about 40%) as the oxime size increased, while HP SAPO-34 retained almost 100% conversion, in spite of the cyclic oxime size. Similar results were also observed with hierarchical Beta zeolite, formed by the aggregates of nanozeolites with an additional mesoporosity. (584) Besides, hierarchically porous Silicalite-1, which contained Silicalite-1 nanocrystals and mesopores (5–20 nm), exhibited a high catalytic performance in the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to εε-caprolactam. (586) Under the same reaction conditions, hierarchically porous Silicalite-1 exhibited both higher conversion of cyclohexanone oxime (97% vs 60%) and higher selectivity (92% vs 42%) of ε-caprolactam as compared to conventional Silicalite-1. The high catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of hierarchical porosity for increasing the diffusion rate of the reactants (cyclohexanone oxime) and products (ε-caprolactam) in Beckmann rearrangement. (586) Erigoni et al. (587) further evaluated the catalytic performances of the desilicated ZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios in the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to ε-caprolactam. They found that the hierarchical catalysts exhibited an increased selectivity toward ε-caprolactam, compared with the microporous H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The superior catalytic performance was due to the improved diffusion and the enhanced accessibility of acid sites through the intracrystalline mesopores.

In conclusion, the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime is a reaction that either proceeds on the external surface of zeolites or is severely diffusion-limited, thus benefiting from an additional larger-pore transport system in the zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites show high selectivity to ε-caprolactam along with an increased reaction rate. The largest improvement in catalytic performances was found in these well-connected mesopores within the microporous framework which are accessible to the external surface.
4.1.3. Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis Process
The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process is a widely used heterogeneous catalytic process for the production of clean hydrocarbon fuels or chemicals from syngas (CO + H2) derived from nonpetroleum feedstocks such as natural gas, coal, or biomass. (741) Recently, the FTS process has attracted great interest due to the global demand to reduce the dependence on petroleum for producing fuels and chemicals. The key challenge for FTS is the control of product distributions, which are typically unselective and generally follow the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution. (742) Numerous studies have been carried out to synthesize efficient FTS catalysts with high C5+ selectivity. (743) Co nanoparticle (NP)-supported catalysts are widely used due to their high selectivity toward n-paraffins, and the acidic zeolites are commonly used as carriers for FTS catalyst. (743−746) However, severe diffusion limits in conventional zeolites lead to high CH4 and C2–C4 selectivities. (747) Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites are considered to be promising supports in bifunctional FTS catalysts, which provide improved product selectivity toward long-chain hydrocarbons. Besides, sintering, which is the main cause of deactivation for cobalt-based FTS catalysts, (748,749) can be prevented by maximizing the spatial distribution of active-phase crystallites over the support surface. (749,750) Thus, the availability of accessible surface area is crucial when designing stable FTS catalysts. Sartipi and co-workers (593,594) reported that the large external surface areas of hierarchically mesoporous MFI zeolites enabled the large loading amounts of Co NPs and improved their accessibility to reactants, thus leading to high catalytic activity in the FTS process and low selectivity of short-chain hydrocarbons (<C4) when compared with the microporous counterparts. Hierarchically porous ultrastable Y (USY) and Y zeolites were also used as catalytic supports for FTS. (588,589) The mesoporous H-USY zeolites used as supporting materials for Co NPs can improve catalytic activity. (588) The increased mesopore surface areas of the hierarchical zeolites enabled a larger loading of cobalt onto the samples (593,594) and improved their accessibility to reactant molecules, thus ameliorating the activity and selectivity performance of the bifunctional reactions in comparison with their microporous counterparts. (751) Peng et al. (589) further reported the advantages of mesoporosity in FTS. The Co-supported mesoporous Y zeolites exhibited an improved catalytic conversion as compared to Co-supported microporous Y zeolites. The MCM-22 molecular sieve, a layered zeolite with MWW structure, was constructed by layers linked together along the c-axis by oxygen bridges and having two independent multidimensional pore systems. Besides, its special thin platelet morphology resulted in high external surface area. (590,591) This new micro- and mesoporous material with controlled acid–base properties was also employed as a support for Co NPs. (752) Co/MCM-22 contained a smaller and uniform Co nanocluster than the sample using amorphous SiO2 as carriers (Co/SiO2). Co/MCM-22 exhibited the highest selectivity to long-chain hydrocarbons (C5+) when using MCM-22 supports with the appropriate Si/Al ratio. The higher C5+ selectivity was attributed to particular properties of the Co particles, indicating that the structure of the MCM-22 played an important role in determining and controlling the selectivity in FTS. (752) ITQ-2 and ITQ-6 zeolites were prepared by the delamination of layered zeolite precursors with the MWW (MCM-22) and FER (ferrierite) structure, respectively. ITQ-6 contained a larger fraction of accessible external surface than ITQ-2, which was due to the distinct rearrangement of the layers in the two materials that originated from the different structures and dimensions of the zeolitic layers in ITQ-2 and ITQ-6. These delaminated zeolites, with a very high external surface area of more than 600 m2 g–1, were found to be efficient supports for dispersing active metal phases. (592) For a comparison, a mesoporous silica MCM-41 and a commercial amorphous SiO2 were used as supports. MCM-41 had a narrow distribution of pores in the mesopore range. The pore diameter of MCM-41 calculated by the BJH method was observed to be 3.1 nm while the delaminated ITQ-2 and ITQ-6 zeolites exhibited a wide pore-size distribution ranging from micro- to macropores. The Co-supported pure-silica ITQ-2 and ITQ-6 exhibited a much higher reducibility (88–89 wt %) as compared to MCM-41 (38 wt %). The C5+ selectivities over the Co-supported ITQ-2 and ITQ-6 were approximately 72%, which were much higher than those using mesoporous silica MCM-41 (Co/MCM-41, 45 wt %) and amorphous SiO2 as supports (Co/SiO2, 65 wt %).
Constructing a special hierarchically porous zeolite catalyst with a core–shell structure is another effective way to increase the selectivity toward desired products. He et al. (595) developed a hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolite with a core–shell structure by coating the H-ZSM-5 membranes on the surface of the preshaped Co/SiO2 pellets. The prepared hierarchically porous zeolite with a core–shell structure exhibited an improved selectivity toward light hydrocarbons and efficiently inhibited the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons of C11+. Besides, the catalyst was stable in a 100 h test reaction. Kim et al. (596) prepared Co NP-encapsulated mesoporous zeolite nanosponge (Co/NS-MFI) for FTS. The zeolite support was constructed by disordered stacking of 2.5 nm thick MFI zeolite nanolayers, which had a narrow mesopore distribution centered at 4 nm. The Co/NS-MFI exhibited a similar CO conversion (11.2 vs 11.3 mmol h–1) as compared to the conventional alumina-based catalysts (Co/γ-Al2O3). However, the product distributions were completely different. Co/NS-MFI showed an increased selectivity toward branched hydrocarbons in the gasoline range (C5–C11) while Co/γ-Al2O3 exhibited higher selectivity toward hydrocarbons in the diesel range (C12+). The high selectivity of the Co/NS-MFI catalyst to gasoline-range hydrocarbons was due to the highly accessible strong Brønsted acid sites in the hierarchically porous zeolite support. (597) From the above results, it is believed that the ultrathin zeolite frameworks and additional porosity due to the stacking of these nanolayers offered a short diffusion path for branched hydrocarbons. (596) Similarly, Han et al. (598) realized the large loading amounts of Co NPs on mesoporous ZSM-5 (Co/MFI-NS) and Beta zeolite nanosponges (Co/Beta-NS), resulting in Co nanowires or networks that filled throughout the mesoporous channels (Figure 39A–C). The catalytic conversion rate of these samples was measured in the FTS reaction. For a comparison, an ordered amorphous mesoporous aluminosilicate (MCM-41) was used to support the same amount of Co. Figure 39D indicates the FTS catalytic performance depending on the Co loading on the catalysts. This result showed that the Co/NS-zeolites achieved much higher CO conversion rates as compared with the Co/MCM with the same Co loading. The excellent catalytic activities of these supported mesoporous zeolite nanosponges indicated that a large portion of the surfaces was accessible for high catalytic activity through the zeolitic micropore apertures located on the mesopore wall. (598)

In conclusion, the FTS is a structure-sensitive reaction exhibiting maximum catalytic activity when the cobalt particle diameter is in the range 4–6 nm. Hierarchically ordered porous zeolites having a high surface area and a narrow pore-size distribution have been used as supports for preparing Co-based FTS catalysts with the aim of improving Co dispersion and controlling the product distributions by confining the cobalt particles inside the mesopores. The introduced meso- or macropores in the hierarchically porous zeolites also improved their accessibility to reactant molecules, benefiting the activity and selectivity of the FTS reactions compared to their purely microporous counterparts. Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites with large surface areas, ordered and uniform mesopores, and abundant meso- or macropores are desired catalysts for FTS synthesis.
4.1.4. Hydroconversion Process
The hydroconversion processes, including hydrocracking (HDC), hydroisomerization (HDI), and hydrodesulfurization (HDS), require bifunctional catalysts containing both acidic and metal functions. The balance between these two functions plays a key role in the design of novel hydroconversion catalysts. Nanozeolites and hierarchically porous zeolites have been widely used as supports due to their appropriate acidic properties, improved molecular transport properties, and high metal dispersion.
4.1.4.1. Hydrocracking Process
Unlike fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) which produces gasoline from heavier oil fractions based on a monofunctional acidic catalyst, hydrocracking (HDC) produces high-value middle-distillates (diesel and kerosene) and base oils from the upgrading of vacuum gas oil (VGO), light cycle oil (LCO), and demetallized oil (DMO) fractions by a hydrogen-addition process using a bifunctional (acidic and metallic) catalyst. (753) HDC catalysts are bifunctional catalysts with both hydrogenation and acid functions, in which the acidic components assist in the cracking and isomerization activities while the supported metals assist in hydrogenation activity. (754)
Currently, many efforts are made to develop new types of catalysts based on hierarchical zeolites in the HDC reaction. (672,755,756) Introducing mesopores into the zeolites or reducing the zeolite crystalline size can efficiently overcome the diffusion limitations and significantly accelerate the mass transfer to and away from the catalytic centers, thus reducing the possibility of secondary reactions which cause coke formation and catalyst deactivation. (757) Therefore, catalyst supports with open hierarchical pore structures contribute to high catalytic activity.
Hierarchical USY zeolite was prepared using commercially available zeolite H–Y (Zeolyst, CBV760) as the original material by steaming and acid leaching. (599,307) Base leaching and the following acid-wash were also used on H–Y, according to the systematic studies of Groen et al. (491) The resultant hierarchical USY zeolite with an intracrystalline trimodal porosity containing micropores (ca. 1 nm, from the zeolite), smaller spongelike mesopores (ca. 3 nm, from base desilication), and large mesopores (ca. 30 nm, from steaming and acid leaching) was used as a cosupport with alumina for the NiMoS2 catalyst in the HDC of VGO. (324) The trimodal porosities in the hierarchical USY zeolite crystals were interconnected in a single zeolite crystal. Owing to the rapid mass transfer of hydrocracking products from the micropores, the secondary cracking was thus almost fully suppressed. (8) The Pt/hierarchical USY zeolite showed high selectivity toward higher-boiling-point fractions and exhibited extremely low coke formation. Besides, the coke formation over the Pt/hierarchical USY zeolite was significantly reduced as compared to that in the commercial catalyst, indicating a higher catalyst stability which is a direct benefit of its enhanced porosity.
Hierarchically porous zeolite with various morphologies, such as core–shell and fibers, were reported. (601,604) For example, hierarchically core–shell structured ZSM-5 composite, containing an ordered mesoporous aluminosilicate shell and a mesoporous ZSM-5 core, was obtained by a one-pot two-step treatment including a controlled desilication in NaOH solution and a self-assembly with the help of a triblock copolymer. (601) The obtained sample contained interconnected mesopores and a gradient acidity distribution from shell to core. Further incorporation of Pt nanoparticles into the mesoporous shell resulted in a highly efficient catalyst for the n-hexadecane hydrocracking (Figure 40A). The catalysts achieved a higher n-hexadecane conversion and a higher C5–C11 selectivity than those of Pt/ZSM-5 in the whole reaction time (Figure 40B,C). (601) Hierarchical structured fibers constructed by NiO–WO3 and Y zeolite nanocrystals were also used as catalysts for n-heptane hydrocracking. (604) The hierarchically porous zeolite composite fibers showed a high conversion of 98.81 wt % and a low coke amount of 0.40 wt % at 350 °C. Such a superior performance was attributed to the enhanced accessibility due to the nonwoven mesh/network of catalytic hierarchically porous fibers which prevent the agglomeration of the zeolite nanoparticles. The nanosized nature of zeolite, the shape of the fibrous catalyst, and the mesoporous character of the hierarchically porous zeolite composite fibers accelerated diffusion and improved accessibility of the reactants to the catalyst active sites as proven by the high total n-heptane conversion and high hexane and isohexane selectivity in n-heptane hydrocracking.

In conclusion, the hydrocracking process is achieved by the initial upgradation of polyaromatics which requires catalysts with efficient catalytic performances and low deactivation and the second hydrocracking process of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons using a bifunctional and hierarchically porous catalyst (i.e., catalyst possessing both acid and metal functions). Therefore, one of the most important factors in the hydrocracking process is the choice of catalyst. Hierarchically porous zeolites with highly interconnected pores and strong zeolite characters are proven to be highly desirable.
4.1.4.2. Hydroisomerization Process
The hydroisomerization process of linear alkanes (n-alkanes) is a key refinery process to transform petroleum fractions into high-octane gasoline. n-Heptane is usually used as a model reactant for fundamental research. (758) The catalysts used for hydroisomerization reactions usually contain two components, i.e., noble metals for hydrogenation and acid sites for skeletal isomerization. However, no catalysts have been practically used for the hydroisomerization process of longer-chain alkanes (C7–C8). According to the kinetic studies undertaken on the hydroisomerization of C5–C7 alkanes over platinum-containing mordenite, the reaction rate for C5–C6 alkanes was primarily constrained by the isomerization process on acid sites while, for n-alkanes (n > 6), it was mainly limited by diffusion. (759) The introduction of mesopores into the catalyst support can efficiently solve the problem. For example, a hexagonal structured mesoporous SAPO-5 was prepared by assembly of SAPO-5 building units and used as the catalyst support for the hydroisomerization of the long-chain hydrocarbon (1-octene). (760) The resulting mesoporous SAPO-5-based catalysts exhibited excellent branched isomer selectivity (25–30%) compared to SAPO-5-based catalysts, which showed relatively low selectivity toward branched isomers (5%). Besides, the mesoporous SAPO-5 yielded higher 1-octene conversion (∼85% 1-octene) than most of the reported microporous SAPO-n. Liu et al. (761) synthesized Beta-MCM-41 composites combining the advantages of both the micropores from microporous zeolite Beta and the mesopores from the MCM-41. The catalysts were used as porous supports and showed excellent catalytic performance in the hydroisomerization of n-heptane. Furthermore, the effects of the micro-mesoporous structure with dealuminated mesopores in the hydroisomerization of n-heptane were investigated. (762) Tao et al. (600) prepared a series of hierarchical SAPO-11 zeolites (samples SAPO-11-H1 to SAPO-11-H12) via the dry-gel conversion of a silicoaluminophosphate–organosilane composite with different compositions. For SAPO-11-H1, it was assembled by nanosheets with thicknesses of 50 nm, which were in turn aggregated by SAPO-11 nanocrystals with sizes of 10–50 nm (Figure 40F). The resultant hierarchical SAPO-11 zeolite microspheres had uniform intercrystalline mesoporosity (ca. 4.3 nm). After loading Pt nanoparticles, the catalysts were evaluated in the hydroisomerization of n-dodecane and showed much higher isomerization selectivity than the catalysts that used conventional SAPO-11 as supports (Pt/SAPO-11-C) at the same conversion, indicating that the introduced mesopores in the zeolites can significantly boost their catalytic performances (Figure 40G,H). Kim et al. (763) prepared hierarchically porous SAPO-11 with carbon templating (C2-SAPO-11). The carbon-templated SAPO-11 catalysts showed remarkably enhanced isomerization yields (84%) compared with Pt/SAPO-11 (44%). Thus, it was concluded that the introduction of secondary mesoporosity is beneficial for hydroisomerization. Hierarchically porous BEA zeolite aggregated by nanocrystals was also used as cosupports for the n-hexadecane hydroisomerization reaction. (764) The composite catalysts showed a catalytic activity 3.5 times greater than that of the purely microporous zeolite. Besides, the yield of isomers increased from 35 to 80 wt %.
In conclusion, the hydroisomerization reactions required bifunctional catalysts containing both the noble metals for (de)hydrogenation and the acid sites such as zeolites for skeletal isomerization. However, the narrow micropores in conventional zeolites usually cause severe diffusion limitation on the reactants and products. Therefore, it is of significant importance to shorten the diffusion length and expose more available acid sites. Integrating additional pores into microporous zeolites is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent diffusion limitations and improve the utilization of zeolites.
4.1.4.3. Hydrodesulfurization Process
To comply with strict environmental regulations, the complete removal of highly refractory molecules such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DM-DBT) from petroleum feedstock and especially from inferior diesel is highly required. The hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process is one of the most effective methods to convert the organic sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfides. (603) The hydrocracking and hydroisomerization processes summarized above usually involve hydrogenation of sulfur-containing substances. In order to better distinguish the hydrotreating process of sulfur-containing substances and non-sulfur-containing substances, the hydrodesulfurization process is reviewed separately in this section. It is confirmed that noble-metal-supported catalysts have a much better hydrogenation performance than conventional metal sulfides in HDS. (602) γ-Al2O3 is the widely used commercial HDS catalyst support due to its low cost, large surface area, high stability, and excellent formability. (606) However, these commercial HDS catalysts produce diesels that hardly meet the strict specifications of diesel quality from increasingly lower-quality raw diesels. (765) Thus, novel HDS catalysts with high catalytic efficiency are desired. Both the active centers and the supports play an important role in the catalytic performance of catalysts. The pore structures of support materials are considered as the most important factors in deciding the final catalytic performance of the related HDS catalysts. (605) Zeolites have large surface areas that facilitate metal dispersion and unique zeolite frameworks that enable strong metal–support interactions. (766) Moreover, the active metal clusters can be confined in the microporous zeolite channels. As discussed above, the further introduction of mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites could significantly accelerate the mass transfer of the reactants and products to and from the active sites, thus making them ideal support or cosupport materials for HDS. (607)
Sun et al. (767) were the first to report that the mesoporous Na-ZSM-5-supported Pt catalysts (Pd/MNZ-5) exhibited a much higher HDS conversion (86% vs 3%) than the catalysts that used conventional Na-ZSM-5 as supports (Pd/NZ-5). The sulfur removal by Pd/MNZ-5 was 29 times higher than for Pd/NZ-5. The bulky 4,6-DM-DBT molecule cannot enter the small micropores in MNZ-5; thus, they can only react on the outer surface of the zeolites and cannot reach many active centers. These results indicated that MNZ-5 with mesopores was a better catalyst support in the HDS of 4,6-DM-DBT than NZ-5 without mesopores, thus proving that mesoporosity in the supports played a positive role in sulfur removal. The catalytic performance of Pd-supported mesoporous Y, Beta, and ZSM-5 in the HDS was studied. (768) Mesoporous zeolite Y was prepared by using N,N-dimethyl-N-octadecyl-N-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) ammonium [(C2H5O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2C18H37]+ as a mesopore template. After loading Pd on the mesoporous zeolite HY, the catalyst showed a higher catalytic performance in the HDS of 4,6-DM-DBT. Compared with Pd-supported mesoporous zeolites Beta and ZSM-5 (80.0% and 73.4% for Pd/HBeta-M and Pd/HZSM-5-M, respectively), Pd/HY-M showed an improved catalytic performance in HDS of 4,6-DM-DBT (97.3%). The higher activity of Pd/HY-M than those of Pd/HBeta-M and Pd/HZSM-5-M was ascribed to the introduced mesoporosity and the larger micropores of zeolite Y than those of zeolite Beta and ZSM-5. Besides, both theory and experiment confirmed that 4,6-DM-DBT was too large to enter the internal micropores of zeolites ZSM-5 and Beta, but the micropores within zeolite Y are more accessible due to the additional interconnected mesoporosity. (768) Hierarchically porous mordenite made by crystalline nanosheet assemblies (NS-HMOR) with a large external surface area and intercrystalline mesoporous structure was also prepared as a support material in HDS catalysts. (608) After the dispersion of nickel and phosphorus species onto NS-HMOR, the obtained Ni2P/NS-HMOR catalyst exhibited a higher HDS activity (TOF = 1.9 × 10–3 s–1) and better stability in 4,6-DM-DBT HDS than a porous SiO2-supported Ni2P catalyst. The large amount of accessible acidic hydroxyl groups on the NS-HMOR surface facilitated the formation of small Ni2P clusters on the external surface. Besides, the open micropores at the NS-HMOR surface helped to prevent their aggregation. Zhang et al. (611) prepared hierarchically porous zeolite TS-1 with crystalline nanorods (NTS-1) (Figure 40D) having a large accessible surface area. Following the introduction of Co and Mo species and sulfidation, the obtained catalyst (CoMoS2/NTS-1) showed a higher catalytic activity in the HDS of 4,6-DM-DBT than the γ-Al2O3 and binary SiO2–TiO2-supported catalysts (Figure 40E).
Generally, zeolite nanocrystals were mixed with mesoporous alumina to form the zeolite–alumina cosupport for HDS catalyst. The micro-mesoporous composite materials aim at combining the advantage of microporous and mesoporous materials and overcoming the disadvantages of both the weak acidity in the mesoporous zeolites and the diffusion limits in the microporous zeolites. For example, the as-synthesized ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals were enwrapped by mesoporous KIT-6 materials to form a composite support for HDS catalyst. (609) The mesoporous KIT-6 material was reported to possess a large pore diameter of ∼8 nm (610) and complementary pores between the two main channel systems, (612) which could enhance the accessibility of the active sites. The ZSM-5/KIT-6-supported NiMo sulfides showed a 4,6-DMDBT conversion double that of a conventional NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst under the same reaction conditions. Except the pore size, the morphology and mesochannel in the supports also had a great effect on the catalytic performance. Gao et al. (613) synthesized mesoporous Beta-SBA-15 zeolites with different morphologies, such as platelet (BS-PL), sphere (BS-SP), short-rod (BS-SR), and long-rod (BS-LR), and used them as catalyst supports for the HDS of FCC gasoline. The platelet BS-PL exhibited large pores and short mesochannels that accelerated the mass diffusion. The sphere BS-SP showed higher mesopore volumes that facilitate the bulky reactants to and away from the active sites. However, the short-rod BS-SR and long-rod BS-LR had long mesochannels and fewer mesopore cavities, resulting in a poor diffusion ability. The catalytic results confirmed that the platelet CoMo/Beta-SBA-15 exhibited the highest HDS conversion (97.6 wt %). Such an excellent HDS ability was attributed to the special morphology and appropriate mesochannels of the catalysts.
In conclusion, the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene and its derivatives in the crude oils is an important process for first-stage desulfurization in the refinery industry owing to its high activity, recyclable, and stability together with large sulfur tolerance. Generally, HDS catalysts are synthesized by dispersing active phases on a support. The support, providing high surface area to maximize active phase dispersion and strong acidic sites to give additional reactivity, is decisive for its final catalytic performance. The mesopores and/or the macropores of the catalysts are crucial factors for the dispersion of active metal species and the diffusion of the reactants and the products. Therefore, hierarchically porous zeolite-based supports with interconnected meso- or macropores, large surface area, strong acidity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability are desired catalysts for the HDS reaction.
4.1.5. Oxidation Reaction
4.1.5.1. Direct Oxidation of Benzene to Phenol
Phenol and its derivatives are important raw materials for drugs, insecticides, and dyes in industry. (769,770) Currently, the dominant industrial route to produce phenol is the environmentally unfriendly partial oxidation of cumene. An alternative process is the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol (BTOP) with nitrous oxide. Almost 100% selectivity toward phenol was reported over Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites in this reaction. (614) However, the sole and relatively small micropores in ZSM-5 zeolite cause poor diffusivity of benzene and phenol, leading to the heavy coke deposition on the micropores and fast deactivation. An efficient solution is to introduce secondary pores into zeolites. Mesoporous Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by a hydrothermal process and a subsequent desilication treatment. The resultant zeolites exhibited an improved catalytic performance and increased stability in the BTOP reaction due to the decreased diffusion path and increased accessibility to the active sites. (615) Shahid et al. (616) further subjected the purely microporous ZSM-5 zeolite (HM27) to alkali treatment (HM27_AT) and a combination of post-treatment sequences by steam-acid-alkali treatments (HM27_St_AcT_AT). The SBET and Vmeso of HM27, HM27_AT, and HM27_St_AcT_AT increased from 414 m2 g–1 and 0.10 cm3 g–1, to 434 m2 g–1 and 0.21 cm3 g–1, and to 489 m2 g–1 and 0.49 cm3 g–1. The catalytic performances of these three samples (HM27, HM27_AT, and HM27_St_AcT_AT) were tested in the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol. The HM27_St_AcT_AT sample exhibited not only the highest initial benzene conversion but also a high catalyst stability with time on stream. After 3 h of reaction, the benzene conversion of HM27_St_AcT_AT, HM27_AT, and HM27 decreased from 40% to 24%, 35% to 13%, and 29% to 6%, respectively. The decrease rates in the phenol selectivity of the HM27_St_AcT_AT, HM27_AT, and HM27 sample at 480 °C are 9%, 78%, and 99% of its initial value, respectively. The results indicated that dealumination (steam treatment followed by acid treatment) can boost the catalytic performance more effectively than desilication (alkali treatment) in the BTOP reaction. The hierarchical Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, which were directly synthesized by adding an amphiphilic organosilane (618,619) and a diquaternary ammonium surfactant (617,620) into a Fe-ZSM-5 synthesis gel, were reported to exhibit much lower deactivation rates compared to conventional Fe-ZSM-5. For example, Koekkoek et al. (620) synthesized hierarchically porous Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite for the first time by the stacking of nanosheets using diquaternary ammonium structure-directing agents [SDAs, [C22H45–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C3H7–Br4, C22–6–6–6–3·Br4] and [C22H45–N+(CH3)2–C6H12–N+(CH3)2–C3H7–Br2, C22–6–3·Br2], Figure 41A]. The small size along the b-direction in zeolite nanosheets significantly shortened the intracrystalline pathways, thus reducing the mass transfer limitations caused by the long diffusion paths in the micropores that the reactants and products of similar size had to travel. (617) The hierarchically porous zeolites synthesized by C22–6–6–6–3·Br4 (Fe/ZSM-5(4N,360)-st) and C22–6–3·Br2 (Fe/ZSM-5(2N,360)-st) were made by the stacking of nanosheets with a thickness of ∼6–8 and 3 nm. Fe/ZSM-5(2N,360)-st produced a higher phenol yield (185.2 mmol g–1 after a 24 h reaction) in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol than both Fe/ZSM-5(4N,360)-st (145.1 mmol g–1 after a 24 h reaction) and bulk zeolites Fe/ZSM-5(TPA,360)-st (85.8 mmol g–1 after a 24 h reaction, Figure 41B,C). (617) Moreover, the zeolite nanosheets retained more than half of their initial activity after 24 h. The improved catalytic stability was due to the shorter diffusion pathways of coke or coke precursors to the external surface of the hierarchically porous zeolite nanosheets. The carbonaceous coke was mostly deposited in the mesopores. In contrast, diffusion paths to the external surface of bulk zeolite were much longer. The cokes mostly deposited in the micropores. Besides, the formation of coke was largely reduced in the hierarchically porous zeolites made by the stacking of zeolite nanosheets because of the short molecular traffic distances in the zeolite nanosheets. The carbonaceous byproducts were mainly deposited in the mesopores between the nanosheets rather than in the micropores. Contrarily, it was found that the micropore volume in the bulk Fe/ZSM-5 decreased greatly due to the rapid blockage of micropores. Moreover, the secondary reactions were effectively suppressed due to the small length of the zeolite nanosheets in the direction of the straight channels. (620) Hierarchical Fe/ZSM-5 zeolites made of nanosheets were also prepared from a typical synthesis gel for Fe/ZSM-5, in which the conventional structure-directing agent TPAOH was replaced by a silane coupling agent comprising a polar head group with two quaternary ammonium centers and a hydrophobic tail. (621) The resultant hierarchical zeolite had a similar thin sheet morphology as the zeolites reported by the Ryoo group. (157,158) Their crystallinity was equally high as the crystallinity of bulk Fe/ZSM-5 except that the coherent length of the crystals in the b-direction was limited for the sheetlike zeolites. The samples exhibited improved activity and enhanced stability in the BTOP, realizing more than 20 wt % in benzene conversion as compared to conventional ones. (621)

4.1.5.2. Oxidation Reactions with Peroxides
Titanosilicates are highly active and environmentally friendly catalysts used in a series of industrially important organic oxidation reactions using peroxide as an oxidant, such as the epoxidation of linear alkenes (237,622,625−628) and cyclic olefins, (177,771−776) the oxidative desulfurization, (200,629−633,777−787) the hydroxylation of phenol, (467,634,635,788−792) and the ammoxidation of cyclohexanone. (194,636−641,793−795) The most common titanosilicate zeolites are titanium Silicalite-1 (TS-1). (796,797) However, they are limited in catalytic oxidation reactions of the substrates with relatively small molecular sizes due to the medium pores of the 10-membered ring (about 0.5–0.6 nm pore diameter). The relatively narrow micropores in the TS-1 zeolite limit the diffusion of reactants and products. Thus, the bulky reactants cannot enter into the micropores and diffuse to active sites. (790) The generated larger product molecules cannot diffuse out of the micropores quickly and further convert to undesired byproducts, leading to pore blocking and coke formation. (798) The catalytic applications of titanosilicate zeolites are greatly broadened when the diffusion path length is reduced. To overcome the problems arising from the microporous structure of zeolites, meso- and/or macropores are introduced by either in situ or postsynthesis approaches. (15)
4.1.5.2.1. Epoxidation of Linear Alkenes and Cyclic Olefins
1-Hexene and 1-octene are small linear alkenes without sterically requirements. Wu et al. introduced titanium atoms into the MWW framework using hexamethylene imine or piperidine as structure-directing agents. (622−624) The titanosilicate MWW (Ti-MWW) is a medium pore zeolite with a two-dimensional system of 10-ring pores and 7.1 × 18.1 Å supercages. (590) Moreover, the MWW-type lamellar precursor converted into a micro-mesoporous hybrid (346) or formed an assembly of ultrathin nanosheets by delamination, (342) both having active sites highly accessible to the bulky molecules. Thus, the Ti-MWW zeolite produced a conversion of 44.8 wt % in the 1-hexene epoxidation while the conversion over the TS-1 was only 5.8 wt %. (622) Similarly, Kim et al. (625) prepared hierarchical Ti-MCM-36 formed by pillared MWW catalyst which exhibited a turnover number (TON) 3 times higher than that of conventional TS-1 in 1-hexene epoxidation. In 1-octene epoxidation, similar results for 1-hexene were obtained. (626,627) Conventional TS-1 catalysts provided a similar conversion (2.5 wt %) (626) while Ti-MWW catalysts with a hierarchical structure once again exhibited the highest yield of cyclooctene oxide. (627) Furthermore, hierarchical TS-1 zeolite nanocrystals were obtained by the crystallization of silanized seeds. (628) The resultant catalysts exhibited a higher catalytic conversion than their microporous counterparts in the 1-octene epoxidation with TBHP and showed very high oxidant efficiencies and extremely stable 100% epoxide selectivity. . (628)
Moreover, hierarchically porous zeolite catalysts are mostly applied in the epoxidation of sterically demanding molecules. The oxidation of bulky molecule 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene is often used as a probe reaction to study the sterical effect. Chen et al. (237) prepared a novel hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous zeolitic TS-1 architecture using a glycerol-assisted quasi-solid-state crystallization process described in section 2. (235,242,243) All pores of over three length scales were incorporated throughout the final solid body to construct a highly interconnected network of well-defined macrochannels with uniform mesoporosity and zeolitic microchannels. The introduced mesopores or macropores were directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal and effectively enhanced the molecular transport to/from the active sites. Such full interconnectivity between the various levels of pores in the resultant hierarchical zeolites maximized the benefits of hierarchy in catalytic reactions, thus leading to superior catalytic performances in the oxidation of 2,4,6-trimethylstyrene with a conversion 17 times higher than that of their microporous analogues. Contrarily, the introduced mesopores/macropores are transport-wise ineffective if they are not accessible to the outer surface of the zeolites.
The molecular dimension of cyclohexane is around 5.0 Å, being comparable with the micropore size of medium pore TS-1 zeolites. These molecules suffer from severe diffusion limitations in the 10-membered-ring micropores when compared with 1-hexene. (771) Hierarchical TS-1 with highly connected mesoporous channels was successfully synthesized using poly(vinyl alcohol)-modified carbon nanotubes as hard templates. (772) The catalyst exhibited a much higher catalytic activity than the conventional TS-1 in the epoxidation of cyclohexene. The greatly improved catalytic performance was attributed to the abundant wormlike and fully interconnected mesopores, which made the active sites in the TS-1 zeolite more accessible to the bulky molecules. Furthermore, alkaline treatment of TS-1 also resulted in the formation of hierarchical structures. The well-developed intracrystalline mesoporosity together with the isolated Ti atoms in the tetrahedral framework achieved a cyclohexene conversion 7-fold higher than that of the conventional untreated microporous TS-1 while the selectivity toward epoxide reached as high as 96%. Hierarchically structured Ti-ECNU-7P (Ti-MWW) nanosheets were prepared using boron to assist crystallization and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to swell and pillar interlayers. (773) The resultant Ti-ECNU-7P contained 2.5 nm thickness zeolite nanosheets with stacked interlamellar mesopores. Besides, such large interlayer spacing cannot be obtained by the conventional hydrothermal method. Due to more accessible active sites on the external surface, hierarchical Ti-ECNU-7 zeolites showed a much higher cyclohexene conversion (29.8 wt %) than Ti-MWW (7.2 wt %).
Cyclooctene is another widely used bulky model substrate to study the steric effect. The cyclooctene molecules cannot enter the micropores of zeolites, and therefore, their further epoxidation can only take place on the external surface of the zeolites. The hierarchically porous titanosilicates with a lamellar structure possessed the active Ti sites on the external surface of the crystalline layers, which are accessible without diffusion restrictions of the micropore system. Their superiority over the conventional TS-1 was noticeable. For example, a hierarchically porous titanosilicate with Si/Ti molar ratio of 30 made by the UTL layers [Ti-IPC1-PITi (30)] was prepared. (774) The resultant Ti-IPC1-PITi (30) had a much higher SBET and Vtot (910 m2 g–1 and 0.46 cm3 g–1 vs 339 m2 g–1 and 0.19 cm3 g–1) than the conventional large-pore Ti-BEA catalyst, thus leading to a cyclooctene conversion (35.8% vs 14.0%) much higher than that of Ti-BEA. (774) Hierarchically porous Del-Ti-MWW with a layered structure prepared by delaminating the Ti-MWW precursor was found to have an enlarged accessible surface area, thus leading to a greatly improved catalytic performance for the epoxidation of cyclooctene. (775) Furthermore, hierarchical Ti-Beta zeolite, prepared by simultaneous desilication and titanation, exhibited intracrystalline mesopores and outperformed its microporous counterpart in the liquid-phase epoxidation of cyclooctene. (776) The epoxide yield achieved with the hierarchical sample was nearly 3 times higher than that with the microporous sample. The superior catalytic performance of hierarchical Ti-Beta was assigned to the presence of larger transport pores and the significantly higher accessibility of the active Ti sites.
4.1.5.2.2. Oxidative Desulfurization
The oxidative desulfurization (ODS) reaction of sulfides to sulfoxides or sulfones can be undertaken under mild conditions, which is an effective method to produce fuels with very low sulfur content and considered to be the most promising process to replace the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. (777,778) Titanosilicates as catalysts were mostly studied. (779,780) However, their intrinsic small micropores impose serious diffusion constraints on bulky sulfides such as dibenzothiophene (DBT) and alkylated-DBT such as 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT). (781) Earlier studies reported that TS-1 was almost inactive for the epoxidation of the aromatic thiophene molecule and had no catalytic activity toward DBT and 4,6-DMDBT. (200) The development of hierarchical titanosilicates can overcome the constraints presented by solely microporous zeolites. (629) Hierarchically porous TS-1 nanocrystals (HTS-1), prepared by using commercial polymer PVA as a mesoporogen (Figure 42A), contained rich intracrystalline mesopores formed by the stacking of nanocrystals. (630) The steric hindrance of two methyl-groups in 4,6-DMDBT seriously restrained its accessibility to the active site of conventional TS-1. However, the diffusion of 4,6-DMDBT in HTS-1 became easier because the size of mesopores (4–20 nm) is much larger than that of 4,6-DMDBT, leading to much higher 4,6-DMDBT conversion than that obtained by conventional TS-1 (84% vs 18%, Figure 42B).

Hierarchical TS-1 catalyst with a smaller mesopore size (2–3 nm) was prepared through the hydrothermal method by using the green and cheap surfactant Triton X-100 (polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether) as the mesoporous template. (631) The catalytic performances of the hierarchical TS-1 (HTS-1) and the conventional TS-1 (CTS-1) were compared in the DBT oxidation. It can be seen that the DBT removal rate reached 100% after 3 h for HTS-1 but only 70.8% after 6 h for CTS-1. Obviously, CTS converted bulky DBT at a relatively low rate while the HTS-1 showed a much higher removing efficiency for DBT. It was inferred that the catalytic activity of the catalysts increased as their mesoporous volume and the accessible surface area increased. (631) The enhanced catalytic activity of the HTS-1 catalyst was mainly attributed to the introduced mesopores in the zeolites. These intracrystalline mesopores offered easy accessibility to the active sites and accelerated the mass transport of bulky molecules, thus facilitating the diffusion of DBT and sulfone to the internal active sites through the mesopores and avoiding the rapid deactivation. (632) Hierarchical TS-1 zeolites with larger intracrystalline mesopores (centered around 10 nm) were further obtained from silanized protozeolitic units. These nanounits were not independent and isolated units but presented significant intergrowth, providing hierarchical TS-1 with a high thermal and mechanical stability. The hierarchical TS-1 achieved a DBT conversion of 95% after only 30 min of reaction and a total conversion after 1 h, much higher when compared with the conventional TS-1 (33% DBT conversion after 1 h). Besides, the obtained hierarchical TS-1 showed a much higher DBT conversion than a silylated Ti-MCM-41 (11% DBT conversion after 30 min), which was related to the crystalline nature of titanium active sites in TS-1 zeolite compared with the amorphous Ti environment of the Ti-MCM-41 material. (799)
Leng et al. prepared Ti-modified hierarchical mordenites (Ti/MM) via an incipient wetness impregnation technique by using tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBOT) as the precursor of Ti species. (784) The introduced Ti species were located outside the micropores in mordenite due to the large molecular size of TBOT, leading to easily accessible Ti active sites over Ti/MM. The sulfur removal content over Ti/MM reached 98.6% after 120 min, which was nearly 4 times that of Ti-modified conventional mordenite. (784) Moreover, hierarchical Beta prepared by the post-treatment process was reported to have rich mesoporosity, (575) and the four-coordinated Al atoms in the framework of zeolite Beta could be easily removed by acid treatment and replaced by other metals. (785) Leng et al. (633) thus prepared Ti-containing hierarchical Beta zeolite by the desilication–dealumination process and found that the resultant catalyst exhibited better catalytic performances than that obtained by direct desilication or dealumination. It was attributed to the special post-treatment that provided catalysts with the easier accessibility of highly active sites and richer mesoporosity.
Generally, lamellar zeolites combine the advantages of both the crystalline microporous structure and mesoporous molecular sieves, providing abundant active centers with easy accessibility. Kon et al. (786) compared the catalytic performances of the ODS reaction for various alkyl-sulfides over Ti-MWW and interlayer-expanded Ti-IEZ-MWW. The conversion over Ti-IEZ-MWW (64 wt %) was nearly double that for Ti-MWW (36 wt %), confirming that enlarged porosity by the interlayer expansion can significantly boost the diffusion performance of the bulky diphenyl sulfide molecules in the catalyst of the ODS reaction.
4.1.5.2.3. Hydroxylation of Phenol
Titanosilicate catalysts can catalytically oxidize both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons to corresponding alcohols, ketones, and phenols. The methyl or hydroxyl substituents on the aromatic rings are beneficial for further hydroxylation. Thus, titanosilicates are promising catalysts for the conversion of phenol hydroxylation to hydroquinone and catechol. Besides, the phenol hydroxylation is a diffusion-controlled reaction. (788) As introducing mesoporosity into microporous zeolite can greatly improve the diffusion performances of zeolite, (789) Tao et al. prepared hierarchical TS-1 zeolite microspheres with a nanorod oriented-assembled structure by a space-confined synthesis method, which exhibited a large external surface and rich mesoporosity. (790) The phenol conversion on such a catalyst (29.8 wt %) was almost 2-fold higher than that on the conventional TS-1 (15.7 wt %), confirming that fast diffusion to and out of micropores and the rich external acidic sites were essential for the improved catalytic performance. Tsai et al. (634) investigated the influence of crystalline size of TS-1 (micrometer-sized μm TS-1 and nanometer sized nm TS-1) and different post-treating methods described in section 2 on the hierarchical pores and the catalytic properties in phenol hydroxylation. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) post-treatment generated a hollow structure and increased external surface of μm TS-1 without sacrificing micropores, while selective Si removal by NaOH leaching resulted in hierarchically mesoporous zeolite nanocrystals. The micrometer-sized μm TS-1 catalyst gave a lower conversion and lower selectivity toward dihydroxybenzenes (DHBs) than the nanometer-sized nm TS-1 sample. Moreover, subsequent post-treatment by TPAOH followed by NaOH can create larger pores than the micropores of TS-1 zeolite. A higher titanium amount, faster mass transfer, and larger pore volumes introduced by successive post-treatment greatly improved the catalytic activity of TS-1.
The selective oxidation of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) to 2,3,5-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone (TMBQ) is an important reaction since the TMBQ is the key intermediate in producing vitamin E. (635) Hierarchical TS-1 made by the assembly of nanocrystals, possessing randomly arranged mesopores of 26 nm and uniform particle size of 200–300 nm, was prepared through a one-step hydrothermal synthetic strategy by utilizing the green and cheap ammonium-modified chitosan (N-2-hydroxy-propyl-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride, HTCC) as the mesopore porogen agent. The resultant catalysts were used to evaluate the effects of the mesoporosity on the catalytic performance of the 2,3,6-trimethylphenol (TMP) oxidation reactions. (791) Since the bulky 2,3,6-TMP molecules can hardly diffuse into the micropores, the oxidation of TMP mainly occurs on the external surface of the microporous zeolites or in the larger mesopores of the hierarchically porous zeolites. The TMP conversion and the TMBQ selectivity on the conventional TS-1 were around 2.13 wt % and 59.62%, but it sharply increased to 62.22 wt % and 96.97%, respectively, on the hierarchically porous TS-1, which was also much higher than those of Ti-SBA-15 and Ti-MCM-41. (792) Zhou et al. (467) further prepared hierarchically mesoporous TS-1 zeolite by a simple steam-assisted crystallization method. The resultant catalyst had a high surface area and large mesopore volume, thus providing significantly higher catalytic activity and longer catalytic lifetime than the conventional TS-1 in the selective oxidation of TMP to TMBQ.
4.1.5.2.4. Ammoxidation of Cyclohexanone
The cyclohexanone oxime is the key intermediate for synthesizing ε-caprolactam, which is the monomer for Nylone-6. The TS-1-catalyzed cyclohexanone ammoximation with NH3 and H2O2 was first reported by Enichem Corporation and is considered environmentally friendly with a high selectivity toward cyclohexanone oxime and water as the only side product. (793) However, the relatively short catalyst lifetime of TS-1 in the cyclohexanone ammoximation severely limits its further application in industry. The decreased activity was due to the severe deposition of bulky byproducts on the internal surface. (794)
Post-treatments, as described in section 2, can effectively generate hollow zeolite crystals with large external surface area and mesopore volume, which can significantly facilitate the mass transfer of bulky molecules inside the zeolite crystal. (795) For example, hierarchically mesoporous TS-1 hollow crystals were constructed by assembling TS-1 nanocrystalline blocks through a hydrothermal post-treatment method. (636) Compared with the hierarchically mesoporous TS-1 crystals, the hierarchically mesoporous TS-1 hollow crystals exhibited a high cyclohexanone conversion with oxime selectivity up to 100%. The hollow crystalline structure contributed to high surface areas, hierarchical meso-macroporosities, and thus excellent catalytic performances.
The alkali treatment is widely used as an effective method to generate mesopores. For example, hierarchical TS-1 zeolites, prepared by the dissolution–recrystallization method, exhibited abundant large mesopores on the external surface and small voids homogeneously distributed throughout the crystal. (637) These materials showed 85 wt % conversion after 90 min of the reactions while the conventional TS-1 gave only 35 wt %. The superior catalytic activity was thus due to the enhanced diffusion and the easy accessibility to the catalytic active sites in the presence of open mesopores (Figure 42C,D). Wu et al. (638) demonstrated that the catalyst stability of TS-1 in the cyclohexanone ammoximation was greatly prolonged after the TPAOH treatment. The MFI structure was not destroyed while the intracrystalline mesopores were created, and the pore diameters increased as the TPAOH concentrations increased. The catalysts exhibited more than 98% cyclohexanone conversions and more than 99% cyclohexanone oxime selectivity. Similar results can be found for the triethylamine-treated TS-1 catalysts. (639) Some irregular hollow cavities were created after the treatment by desilication. The catalyst lifetime was significantly prolonged to 30 h, which was 10 times longer than that of the conventional TS-1.
It was reported that Ti-MWW can efficiently catalyze the ammoxidation of cyclohexanone, which gave both cyclohexanone conversion and oxime selectivity over 99%. (640) Besides, Ti-MWW showed a longer catalytic lifetime than other titanosilicates, such as TS-1. (641) However, Ti-MWW suffered from the rapid deactivation due to the deposition of byproducts. To overcome this, Xu et al. (194) coated a mesoporous silica shell over zeolite crystallites by the sol–gel self-assembling route. The mesoporous silica shell in the novel Ti-MWW@mesoporous-SiO2 composite catalysts efficiently prevented the active zeolite core from rapid coke formation, leading to a stable duration of the catalysts.
In conclusion, the relatively narrow micropores in the conventional zeolites usually impose a severe diffusion limitation on the catalytic oxidation reactions of bulky substrates. The introduction of mesopores or macropores into microporous zeolites is an effective method for the improvement of mass transfer and the accessibility of active sites. The hierarchically porous zeolites with interconnected pores that are accessible to the external surface are mostly desired in the catalytic oxidation reactions.
4.1.6. Transformation of Methanol
Nowadays, with the rapidly rising demand for energy and the scarcity of crude oil resources, it becomes increasingly significant to find alternative energy sources. Among several alternatives, the conversion of syngas (CO + H2), produced via the gasification or reforming process of coal, (800,801) natural gas, (802) or biomass, (803,804) into hydrocarbons is a potential process to provide fuels and raw materials for petrochemicals in the future. (805) The Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) process, catalyzed by Co- or Fe-based catalysts, is a well-known process for converting syngas to hydrocarbons, such as diesel fuels and waxes (see section 4.1.3). (742) As an alternative to the FTS process, methanol is mass-produced from syngas and converted to a hydrocarbon. Such a methanol to hydrocarbon (MTH) process has been used commercially for a long time and is a key route to produce high-value chemicals from nonpetroleum C1 sources. (806) Almost all petroleum-related chemicals, especially olefin monomers and polymers, can be produced from methanol by this process. (807) The zeolite-catalyzed MTH process exhibited excellent product selectivity as compared with the FT process. (808) Chang and Silvestri first used zeolites to catalyze the MTH process. (809) The MTH process occurred mostly inside the micropores of the zeolite. Thus, the medium- and large-pore zeolites selectively led to the formation of the high-molecular-weight aromatics and paraffins (C5–C7), while the small-pore zeolites such as erionite (ERI), zeolite T (Linde Type T), chabazite (CHA), and ZK-5 (KFI) formed lower olefins (C2–C4). (810,811) The MTH process was widely used to synthesize several different classes of hydrocarbons, including gasoline-range hydrocarbons (methanol to gasoline, MTG), (157,277,282,642,643,812−827) light olefins (methanol to olefins, MTO), (34,236,554,644−656,828−861) propylene (methanol to propylene, MTP), (90,109,657−661,862−874) or aromatics (methanol to aromatics, MTA) (662−664,875−901) depending on the catalyst and/or the process operation conditions. Besides, the methanol dehydration leads to the formation of dimethyl ether (methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether, MTD). (665,666,902,903)
4.1.6.1. Methanol-to-Gasoline-Range Hydrocarbons Process
The zeolite-catalyzed methanol-to-gasoline-range hydrocarbons (MTG) process, first discovered by Exxon Mobil, is complementary to Fischer–Tropsch synthesis for the conversion of methanol to high-octane index gasoline. (812) Various types of zeolites were tested for the production of gasoline; among them, ZSM-5 proved to be the most promising catalyst for the production of high-quality gasoline. (813−815) The unique interconnected micropore systems in ZMS-5 zeolites allow for the gasoline-range hydrocarbons to diffuse out. (816) However, they suffered from the drawbacks of high coproduction of environmentally unfriendly aromatic compounds, especially 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, (817,818) and the frequent necessity for regeneration due to their fast deactivation caused by coke formation. (819) Successive efforts were put into the development of new MTG zeolite catalysts to suppress the formation of aromatics. Di et al. (820) synthesized a ZSM-5/MCM-48 aluminosilicate composite material by a simple two-step crystallization process, in which the precrystallized colloidal zeolite was added into a synthesis system of MCM-48. After the second crystallization, the ZSM-5 phase in the composite was interconnected with the mesostructured MCM-48 phase. The obtained catalyst possessed a high catalytic activity, improved selectivity toward C5–C10, and reduced formation of aromatics and carbon depositions, which were attributed to the enhanced mass transfer properties in the hierarchically micro-mesoporous ZSM-5/MCM-48 composite catalysts.
The slow transportation of the reactants and products in the relatively small micropores of the zeolite are the main causes for the short catalyst life. (277) The introduction of additional pores can significantly boost the diffusion rate of molecules in the zeolites, thus leading to a prolonged catalyst life. (821) The hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite was directly prepared by hydrothermal treatment of a clear solution made by mixing anhydrous sodium aluminate, tetraethyl orthosilicate, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and deionized water without using an additional template or zeolite seeding crystals. (282) The influence of intercrystalline mesoporosity on the catalytic performance in the MTG reactions was carefully investigated. The intercrystalline space referred to the network of voids generated by the aggregation of microporous ZSM-5 nanocrystals, which were directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite aggregates. The resultant ZSM-5 with interconnected porous hierarchy exhibited almost 100 wt % methanol conversion and 59% selectivity toward the gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Its coke formation was less than 2 wt % after 24 h of reaction, while the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited nearly 8 wt % carbon deposition. For zeolites with an interconnected hierarchy, the mesopores in the microporous crystals should be directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal to ensure that the synthesized hierarchically porous zeolite is effective for mass transport. For example, Fathi et al. (642) studied the catalytic performance of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores. The presence of intracrystalline mesopores generated by the post-treatment of HZSM-5 catalyst using CaCO3, Na2CO3, and NaOH solutions ameliorated the catalytic performance to produce a higher amount of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. It is interesting to note that the sample treated by Na2CO3 showed the most appropriate acidity and greater catalytic performance among the other treated and untreated samples in the methanol to gasoline reactions. The yield of gasoline C5+ increased by about 43% after 4 h on stream, and the catalyst lifetime extended by about 11.5% when compared with the conventional ZSM-5 catalyst owing to the presence of intracrystalline mesopores. Liu et al. (643) systematically explored the influence of mesoporosity in zeolite Beta on its catalytic performance for the MTH reaction. They found that the mesoporous Beta showed a higher selectivity toward higher aliphatics (C4–C7) than that of conventional Beta at both low and high conversions ranging from 20% to 100%. This was attributed to the hierarchically porous structure of Beta, which offered full accessibility of reactants to all catalytically active sites. However, the conventional Beta was easily deactivated due to the fast coke deposition on the outer surface of the catalyst crystals, which impeded access of reactants to interior active sites. Such a hierarchical structure reduced the resident time of methylbenzenes in zeolite micropores and inhibited the propagation of the aromatic-based catalytic cycle. Choi et al. (157) synthesized hierarchical MFI zeolite made of nanosheets that were only 2 nm thick, corresponding to the b-axis dimension of a single MFI unit cell (Figure 43A). In the MTG conversion, the hierarchical MFI zeolites made of nanosheets exhibited an increased catalyst lifetime and deactivated far more slowly than the conventional MFI. The hierarchical MFI nanosheets exhibited a much slower coke deposition rate than conventional MFI (45 vs 170 mg g–1 zeolite at 5 days). For the hierarchical MFI zeolites made of nanosheets, the coke formed mainly at the mesopore surface while, for the conventional MFI zeolites, the coke mainly formed inside the micropores (Figure 43B,C). (822,823) The extended catalyst lifetime of the MFI nanosheets was due to the slow deposition of coke exclusively at external surfaces that can be attributed to the improved mass transfer of coke precursors out of the zeolite micropores.

4.1.6.2. Methanol to Olefin Process
Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, are important raw chemicals in industry. Light olefins are traditionally obtained by the thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil or by the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The limited crude oil availability calls for an urgent alternative technology. (828) The methanol to olefin (MTO) process is a successful nonpetrochemical route for the production of light olefins from abundant nonoil resources and links the nonpetroleum chemical and modern petrochemical industries together. (829) The MTO process, therefore, exhibits a superior economic advantage over the conventional naphtha cracking process and has been studied over different types of zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, MOR, etc.).
Compared to zeolite ZSM-5, SAPO-34 with a larger pore cavity (9.4 Å in diameter) and a smaller eight-membered-ring micropore (3.8 Å × 3.8 Å) exhibited a much higher catalytic performance in the MTO reaction (100 wt % methanol conversion and over 90% selectivity to C2–C4 light olefins) due to its unique CHA framework. (830−834) However, it usually suffers from a slow mass transport to and away from the catalytic centers, thus increasing the possibility of secondary reactions and finally leading to coke formation. The coke deposition covered the active sites of the catalysts, (835) resulting in a short catalytic lifetime and low selectivity of light olefins during the MTO reactions. (836−838)
Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the diffusion performances in the SAPO-34 catalyst. Previous studies reported that the SAPO-34 zeolites with small crystallite size exhibited great advantages in decreasing the coke formation rate and accelerating the mass transfer performance. (839−842) In particular, for nanosized SAPO-34s, they exhibited an improved methanol conversion efficiency and prolonged catalyst lifetime in the MTO conversion. (843−846) The shortened diffusion path in zeolite nanocrystals reduced the coke formation and thus contributed to their extended catalyst life. (847) Hierarchically porous SAPO-34 was prepared as cubic aggregates of intergrown nanocrystals using an organosilane surfactant [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TPOAC) as the mesopore template through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis (Figure 43D). (849) The as-synthesized hierarchically porous SAPO-34 had a 4 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and more than 10% improvement of light olefin (C2H4 + C3H6) selectivity in MTO conversion than microporous zeolite SAPO-34 (Figure 43E). (849) Another hierarchically ordered mesoporous zeolite SAPO-34 (3DOm-i SAPO-34) was hydrothermally prepared within confined ordered mesoporous carbons. (851) The synthesized 3DOm-i SAPO-34 showed an ordered mesoporous-imprinted structure consisting of spherical zeolite nanocrystals and exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime and higher selectivity toward light olefins than conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34 in the MTO reaction. (851)
The introduction of mesopores and/or macropores into the microporous SAPO-34 zeolite can also significantly accelerate the molecular transfer, reduce the coke formation, and therefore extend the catalyst lifetime. (648) Many hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared using synthesis methods described in section 2. (236,849) For example, hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolites with a hollow structure were synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide as the only template through a one-step nanoseed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. (554) The as-synthesized SAPO-34 zeolites exhibited remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in the MTO reaction with about a 4-fold extended catalyst lifetime and more than 10% increase of the selectivity for C2H4 and C3H6 as compared to conventional microsized microporous SAPO-34 zeolites. By using a similar method, they further synthesized a series of zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals in an Al2O3/H3PO4/SiO2/triethylamine (TEA)/H2O system. (647) The hierarchical SH-0.3 zeolite nanocrystals (TEA/Al2O3 = 3.0) showed the highest crystallinity, abundant intracrystalline meso-macropores, and optimized acidity, exhibiting the highest selectivity toward ethylene and propylene (85.4%). Besides, hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 monoliths were synthesized by the dry-gel conversion of the amorphous silicoaluminophosphate monolith. (236) The as-synthesized hierarchical SAPO-34 had a macroporous framework constructed by interconnected and aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals and a mesoporous structure formed by the closely stacked zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals. Hierarchically structured zeolite SAPO-34 possessed a much higher catalytic activity in MTO reactions than that of conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34. (236) However, it is difficult to use traditional acidic or alkali treatment to synthesize hierarchically porous SAPO zeolites due to their unstable frameworks. (858) Liu et al. (649) developed a novel tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching post-treatment method to obtain hierarchically porous SAPO-34 under mild conditions. The resultant SAPO-34 was constructed by the original micropores, mesopore (3.5 nm), and macropore (100 nm). The single-run lifetime of the hierarchical zeolites in MTO increased without sacrificing the excellent methanol conversion and light olefin selectivity. Chen et al. (650) applied the fluoride post-treatment route to obtain hierarchical SAPO-34 crystals. The treatment of SAPO-34 zeolites with a fluoride solution resulted in a preferential dissolution of the high-defect and Si-rich interface between crystalline domains. The newly formed mesopores were parallel to the zeolite crystalline faces. The intersecting mesopores separated crystalline domains, thus providing improved access to all the microporosity. The resultant hierarchical zeolites exhibited an improved light olefin selectivity in the MTO reaction. Besides, the fluoride etching method can be expanded to obtain other hierarchal SAPO-34 catalysts with improved MTO performances. (651,652)
A better understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical pore structure in ZSM-5 zeolites and their catalytic performance in the MTO reaction is crucial to design optimal catalysts. Kim et al. (644) carefully investigated the effects of mesoporosity on catalyst activity of the MTH reaction using a series of MFI zeolites with various mesoporosities. The reason for catalyst longevity was the improved diffusion of coke precursors from the micropores to the external surfaces owing to the short pathways provided by the introduced mesopores. They also monitored the quantity and the location of coke in the catalyst and found that in mesoporous zeolites the coke formed mainly on the mesopore walls while in microporous zeolites the coke mostly deposited inside the micropores. Internal coke deposition caused serious deactivation of the catalyst because it covered the acidic sites and blocked the micropores even at a low coking level. However, external cokes caused little hindrance to the diffusion performances unless it covered the entire external surface of the catalyst. Meng et al. (645) used cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA) as the sole organic template to synthesize hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite in a one-step approach. The introduction of additional mesoporosity decreased the intracrystalline residence time of the intermediates and extended the catalyst lifetime. The desilication was also applied by Bleken et al. to prepare mesoporous H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. (646) The catalysts showed an improved lifetime and resistance toward deactivation in the MTO reaction.
The interconnectivity between the additional pores and the micropores in the hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites determines their final catalytic performances. Schmidt et al. (34) introduced transport pores into SAPO-34 using carbon nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes as secondary templates as described in section 2. The carbon nanotube-templated materials (M/T-3) contained mesopores accessible from the outside of the particle. However, for the mesopores created by carbon nanoparticles (M/T-2), they were located inside the particle and did not form a three-dimensional interconnected mesopore network. The methanol conversion of the parent (M/T-1) and the M/T-2 decreased after 120 min drastically until there was no further conversion. The M/T-3 showed a full conversion of methanol and dimethyl ether for almost 300 min time on stream. Similarly, enhanced catalytic performances were also found for hierarchically porous SAPO-34 catalysts with open mesopores. (852−854) Milina and co-workers (855,856) further established the relationship between the mesopore quality (i.e., the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals) and the catalyst lifetime in the MTO reaction. They found that the extended lifetime resulted from the presence of open mesopores with a well-connected intracrystalline hierarchical pore network rather than constricted mesopores with poor connectivity. The global connectivity of the intracrystalline pore network, therefore, is a decisive factor in extending the lifetime of the zeolite catalysts in the MTO reaction. Their findings emphasized the need to appropriately tailor the hierarchically porous structure for the optimal catalytic advantage. Sun et al. (857) synthesized the trilevel hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolite with an intracrystalline micro-meso-macropore structure for the first time. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibited a superior catalytic performance in the MTO reaction with about a 6 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and nearly 5% improvement in selectivity toward ethylene and propylene compared with the conventional microporous SAPO-34.
In addition to SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 catalysts, other zeolites like SSZ-13, (859) ZSM-22, (654) ZSM-58, (655) SAPO-5, (654) SAPO-11, (653,656) SAPO-18, (656) and SAPO-35 (653) were also reported in the MTO process. Based on its unique crystalline structure, zeolite ZSM-58 exhibits a strong shape selectivity when compared with SAPO-34. The micropores of ZSM-58 have narrow entrances in the range of 0.45 nm × 0.36 nm, providing the desired shape selectivity toward short-chained olefins in the MTO reaction. However, the increase in the diffusion properties of reactants and products is desirable. Selzer et al. (860) synthesized hierarchical ZSM-58 zeolite via postsynthetic desilication by sodium hydroxide and using TEA+ ions as a pore growth moderator. The introduced intracrystalline mesopores exhibited a size of 3–25 nm. By increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide, the mesopore volume increased up to 0.50 cm3 g–1. The desilicated ZSM-58 showed an extended catalytic lifetime and improved product yields in the MTO reaction as compared to conventional microporous ZSM-58. Ahmed et al. (861) adopted multistep sequential alkaline and acid treatments to develop a more mesoporous surface area and to offer more active sites on EU-1 zeolite. The multistep sequential treatment was successful in creating more mesopores as compared with the single-step treatment. The selectivity of propylene in the MTO process was increased from 0%, in the case of parent EU-1, to 50% together with an enhanced catalyst stability and extended lifetime.
4.1.6.3. Methanol to Propylene Process
Propylene is an important basic chemical for the production of polymer and chemical intermediates, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, oxo alcohols, and cumene. (862) Naphtha thermal cracking and petroleum refining in fluid catalytic cracking units are two major commercial methods for the propylene production, and both are dependent on crude oil resources. (863) Due to the increasing demand for propylene and rapid depletion of oil resources, new processes with high propylene yield are needed. (864) The methanol to propylene (MTP) process is a promising alternative approach for the production of propylene. (865) Thus, it is highly desirable to develop catalysts that can efficiently produce propylene.
To develop an ideal catalyst for the MTP reaction, stable and high methanol conversion and propylene selectivity are crucial. (866) ZSM-5 zeolites usually exhibit low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation. (867) Numerous studies were undertaken to further improve the propylene selectivity and catalyst lifetime compared to the ZSM-5 catalyst for the MTP reaction. (657,658,661,868) Rownaghi et al. (657) reported that the zeolite nanocrystals exhibited a higher catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity toward propylene compared with micronized zeolites due to their rapid mass transfer which accelerated the overall reaction rates, indicating that diffusion limitations are important parameters. (658) Moreover, hierarchically meso-macroporous zeolite nanocrystals were prepared in a quasi-solid-state system based on the passivation concept of the strong self-condensation of the short-chain organosilane 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane (APTES) on the surfaces of nanocrystals. (661) APTES directed the generation of zeolite nanocrystals and guaranteed the in situ assembly of these nanocrystals into a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure. The resultant catalysts exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime, which was almost 8 times longer than that of the purely microporous ZSM-5. They also exhibited a higher propylene selectivity (41.89%). The improved adsorption capacity was due to the abundant mesopores and macropores in the catalysts, providing a shortened diffusion path length and increased accessibility of reactants to active sites for catalytic reactions.
ZSM-5 with a high mesoporosity had a high propylene selectivity and a long catalyst lifetime during the MTP reaction due to its improved diffusion performance and increased tolerance toward greater coke formation. (109,870−874) This further indicated that the introduction of mesopores in zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transfer, inhibit the coke deposition, and extend the catalyst lifetime. (90) To gain a better insight into the influence of the pore connectivity of zeolites in the MTP reaction, Mei et al. (660) prepared hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolites with open and closed mesopores by desilication and templating with starch, respectively. The introduction of open mesopores in ZSM-5 enabled the catalysts to exhibit a high propylene selectivity (42.2%) and propylene/ethylene (P/E) ratio (10:1). However, for the closed mesopores that are randomly located inside the zeolite crystals, the amelioration in propylene selectivity and P/E ratio of the catalyst is not easily noticeable. The results demonstrated that the creation of additional open mesoporosity in ZSM-5 zeolite is a crucial factor in the preparation of optimal catalysts for the MTP reaction.
In theory, a maximized molecular diffusion would be achieved if the size of the zeolite crystal is reduced to the single unit cell dimension. (157) Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with a high-silica MFI nanosheet with an only 2 nm thickness was successfully synthesized by using a special bifunctional organic surfactant. (659) This catalyst was an efficient catalyst with high propylene selectivity (51.0%), high propylene/ethylene (P/E) ratio (12.1), and long catalyst lifetime in the MTP reaction because of its excellent diffusivity. (659) Such excellent catalytic performances were attributed to the relatively large accessible surface area, short diffusion path length, and high mesoporosity in the hierarchical zeolite made of the ultrathin nanosheets that enabled it to accommodate more coke deposition, which also contributed to the improvement in catalyst lifetime. Thus, the reaction products could easily escape from the zeolite micropores, and the secondary reactions, such as aromatization and hydrogen transfer, were effectively prevented, leading to a low deactivation rate. Besides, the relatively large accessible surface area and high mesoporosity in the zeolite nanosheets helped to accommodate more coke deposition, which also contributed to the increase in the catalyst lifetime.
4.1.6.4. Methanol to Aromatics Process
Aromatics are some of the most important fundamental raw materials in the polymer and organic industry. (875) BTX-benzene (B), toluene (T), and xylenes (X) are the most widely used aromatic hydrocarbons. The demand for aromatics is rapidly increasing worldwide. (876) The actual commercial processes for aromatic hydrocarbon production are mainly based on petrochemical processes, such as catalytic reforming or cracking gasoline hydrogenation using crude oil. (877) As a promising alternative, the methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) process on microporous solid acid catalysts is an important nonpetroleum route to obtain valuable chemicals and attracted great interest. (878) The first efficient catalyst Mo-ZSM-5 for the MTA reaction was reported in 1993. (879) Since then, this reaction has been studied by many groups. Aromatization of methanol over ZSM-5 could be promoted by the interaction–dehydrogenation of surface metal oxides, (880) such as ZnO, (881) Ga2O3, (882) and SnO2. (883)
The performance of the catalyst in the MTA process is greatly influenced by many conditions such as the acidic strength, (884) the pore architecture, (885,886) the crystal size, (887,888) and the morphology. (889) Therefore, the preparation of suitable catalysts which exhibit high diffusion and suitable acidity is important for the MTA reaction. An effective method to reduce the diffusion limitation is introducing additional pores into zeolites, which can significantly facilitate the diffusion performance of the bulky aromatic molecules (894−900) and prevent the coke deposition on the micropores (901) in the MTA process. Wang et al. (662) synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 with a hollow structure, in which the shell was aggregated by small coffinlike ZSM-5 crystals (Figure 43F). The synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 with a hollow structure (ZSM-5-h (38)) exhibited a long catalyst lifetime of 186 h, which was 1.69 times longer than that of conventional ZSM-5 zeolite (ZSM-5-c1) (Figure 43F,G). This was due to their much lower coking rate than that of ZSM-5-c1 (0.0061 vs 0.0096 mg h–1). Besides, it also exhibited a higher aromatics selectivity (40.1%) than ZSM-5-c1 (33.9%) by suppressing the production of C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons. Wang et al. (663) synthesized a macroscopic bayberry-like MFI zeolite with a micrometer thick shell and densely grown nanocrystals with an ordered packed channel. The catalyst exhibited a higher methanol conversion and a longer catalyst lifetime, confirming the advantage of hierarchically porous structures in heterogeneous catalytic reactions over pure microcrystals and nanocrystals. Zhou et al. (664) prepared various MFI zeolites with different mesoporosities and acidities and systematically investigated the effects of the mesopore quality and the acidity strength on the catalyst performance in the MTA reactions. They found that desilication post-treatment of zeolites can significantly increase the mesopore volumes and decrease the strong acid density. The resulting mesoporous catalyst can efficiently inhibit the coke formation and increase the catalytic stability in the MTA reaction.
4.1.6.5. Methanol Dehydration to Dimethyl Ether Process
Generally, the dehydration temperature of methanol in the methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (MTD) process is much lower than that of the MTG, MTO, and MTP processes. Dimethyl ether (DME) is the intermediate product during the MTH reaction, which further gets converted into olefins, paraffins, aromatics, and other chemicals by combining with methanol and water at high temperature. (902,903) In addition to the reaction temperature, the textural properties of catalysts such as porosity (introduced meso-macropores), crystal size, and morphology could also greatly influence the catalytic performance in the MTD reaction. Currently, ZSM-5 zeolite is the most important catalyst used in the MTD reaction. Rownaghi et al. (665) investigated the effects of crystalline size and mesoporosity on the catalytic performance of various mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites in the MTD process. They found that uniform nanocrystal catalysts showed the highest catalytic activity and DME yield due to their reduced mass transport resistance. Thus, it can be concluded that decreasing the crystalline size of the zeolites is an effective way to improve their catalytic activities in the MTD process. Hierarchically porous ZSM-5 with intracrystalline mesopores also showed a long catalyst lifetime and 100.0% selectivity toward DME in the MTD process. This was due to the large mesopore volume in mesoporous ZSM-5 that can greatly improve the coke tolerance and thus efficiently prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. (666)
In conclusion, an ideal catalyst with the stable and high methanol conversion and product selectivity is mostly desired in the zeolite-catalyzed methanol transformation process. However, the slow transportation of the reactants and products in the relatively small micropores of conventional zeolite is the main causes for the short catalyst life. The hierarchically porous zeolites can effectively reduce the intracrystalline diffusion path, greatly enhance the reactants/products to and away from the active centers, and thus improve the catalytic conversion, inhibit the undesired secondary reaction, reduce the coke formation, and finally extend the catalyst lifetime.
4.1.7. Catalytic Cracking Reaction
Hierarchical zeolites are widely used in cracking reactions due to their improved diffusion of reactants and products within the hierarchical structures of catalysts. Catalytic cracking of different types of feedstocks, i.e., heavy fractions of crude oil, aromatic compounds, hydrocarbons, and polyolefins, will be reported in this section.
4.1.7.1. Fluid Catalytic Cracking Process
The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is one of the most important conversion technologies in the oil refinery industry. (904) This process converts heavy fractions of crude oil, i.e., heavy gas oil (HGO), vacuum gas oil (VGO), or residue feedstocks, into useful products, such as gasoline and chemical feedstocks. (905) Therefore, developing more effective FCC catalysts is of great importance for the industrial production. (906)
Currently, FCC catalyst particles consist of Y zeolite, active matrix, clays (fillers), various additives, and binders, in which zeolite Y (FAU type) is the primary active component of the cracking catalyst used in the FCC process due to its high surface area, supercage structure, strong Brønsted acidity, excellent thermal/hydrothermal stability, and low cost. (907) However, the bulky molecules in heavy oil or residues have such a large molecular dynamic size ranging from 1.2 to 15 nm (boiling point >400 °C, carbon number >20) that they cannot enter into the micropores of the Y zeolite (0.74 nm). (205,908) Even the size of the deformed molecules allowed to penetrate into Y-zeolite pores is less than 1.02 nm. (909) Only hydrocarbons with a carbon number less than 20 can enter the micropores of Y-zeolite, but this process cannot happen for fractions with boiling points higher than 400 °C. Similarly, larger intermediate molecules are tightly fitted within the micropores and can take a relatively long time to leave the zeolite crystal. (381) The relatively long residence time leads to reduced catalytic effectiveness and increased undesired reactions, such as hydrogen transfer, overcracking, olefin interconversion, and, in particular, coking. (14,910,911) Thus, the desired FCC catalysts should have improved diffusion performances and enhanced acid site accessibility. (912) These can be realized by constructing interconnected hierarchical pore systems (pore hierarchization), (913−915) or aggregates of zeolite nanocrystals. (8)
Zeolite Y with well-controlled intracrystalline mesoporosity was prepared by a surfactant templating synthesis. (380) It was the first report concerning the introduction of well-controlled mesoporosity into Y zeolites with low Si/Al ratios. This mesostructured zeolite Y catalyst produced much more gasoline and light cycle oil (LCO), and less bottoms and coke. Such improved product selectivity was due to the mesopores introduced into the zeolites which can reduce the diffusion limitation in the microporous zeolites. (667) The larger mesopores allow bulky reactants to access the catalytic sites within the zeolite crystals, thereby promoting the primary reactions to yield more gasoline and LCO. Besides, the mesopores facilitate the transport of the reactants and the products in and out of the zeolite crystals, thus reducing the undesirable secondary reactions, such as the overcracking of the valuable gasoline and LCO to the low-value coke and dry gases. The hydrogen transfer side reaction was also inhibited, which contributed to higher C3 and C4 olefin yields. (667) Moreover, composite catalysts based on such hierarchical zeolite Y also showed excellent catalytic activity in the FCC process. (668) The hydrothermally stable hierarchically macro-meso-microporous zeolite composites were prepared by the overgrowth of ordered mesoporous Y on kaolin spheres through the in situ assembly of preformed zeolite Y nanoclusters on kaolin using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as soft template under alkaline conditions. (668) The zeolite Y gave micropores and mesopores in the composite and the macroporous kaolin substrate contributes macropores. Besides, the mesopores of the composite Y/kaolin were entirely accessible from outside and well interconnected. The mesopores in the catalysts can facilitate the mass transfer in the zeolites, thus decreasing the secondary reactions resulting in dry gas and coke formation. (667) The Y/kaolin composites exhibited a relatively low dry gas yield (1.5 wt %) and a very low coke yield (6.9 wt %). (668)
Recently, the core–shell structured zeolite has attracted great attention due to the definite reaction pathways and excellent connection between meso- and microporosities. (669) Many core–shell structured “zeolite@porous matrix composites” were developed to crack heavy oil more efficiently. (671−673) A new core–shell zeolite catalyst with a hierarchical macro-meso-micropore network was developed by controlling overgrowth of a zeolite ZSM-5 shell on the surface of a purely microporous Y-zeolite. (670) The heavy oil was cracked step-by-step into the required products over the designed zeolite catalyst. The meso-macroporous shell facilitated the precracking of the large heavy oil molecules into moderate ones, which can directly diffuse into the micropores of the Y-zeolite for further cracking into the desired products. The results showed that both the conversion of heavy oil and the yield of gasoline increased when compared with conventional FCC catalyst.
4.1.7.2. Catalytic Cracking of Aromatic Compounds
Owing to their importance and wide applications in the fluid catalytic cracking process, the optimization of hierarchically porous zeolites has become one of the researchers’ focuses in recent years. Special cracking reactions were chosen to investigate the catalytic performance of catalysts in cracking reactions and to choose the optimum hierarchical structure. The cracking of isopropyl benzene was chosen as a probe reaction to study the catalytic performance and anticoking ability of hierarchically porous zeolites. Peng et al. (674) prepared hierarchically micro-mesoporous MFI-type zeolite by steam-assisted conversion (SAC). The precursors were confined in the porous carbon template. The hierarchically structured zeolite had interconnected mesopores and micropores. The resultant hierarchically porous ZSM-5 showed a much higher conversion (74.5 wt %) in the catalytic cracking of isopropyl benzene than nanosized ZSM-5 (30 wt %) and bulky ZSM-5 (28.6 wt %). (10)
The bulky 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) is regarded as a model compound for heavy gas oil molecules, and the catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-TIPB is widely used as a probe reaction to estimate the improvement on catalytic performance due to hierarchical porosity in the zeolites (Figure 44A). 1,3,5-TIPB has a dynamic size (9.5 Å) larger than the micropore pore size in zeolites used for cracking reactions, such as Y, Beta, MOR, and ZSM-5, and cannot penetrate into the internal micropore channels. (108) Thus, the cracking reactions can only be realized at the external surface of conventional ZSM-5 zeolites. The introduced hierarchical porosity greatly boosted the catalytic conversion. (146,675−677) For example, hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous ZSM-5 with a house-of-cards-like structure (HCL-ZSM-5) was prepared by a template-free zeolite synthesis system assisted by the low-cost N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). (262) The synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 sample had a regular house-of-cards-like morphology (∼10 mm), which consisted of orthogonal sheetlike crystals with a typical thickness of about 100 nm. The micro- and macropores had a broad distribution of 5–80 nm, which mainly came from the aggregation of zeolite nanosheets. The abundant acid sites on the HCL-ZSM-5 were more accessible to the bulky 1,3,5-TIPB molecules, which in turn produced greatly improved 1,3,5-TIPB conversion (90.5 wt %) when compared to conventional ZSM-5 (15.7 wt %). The layered zeolite precursor is a special intermediate to synthesize various hierarchical zeolites with open mesopore structures due to its diverse layer stackings. A swelling-type mesostructured multilamellar ECNU-7P zeolite with large interlayer spacing (25 Å), consisting of an alternative stacking of inorganic MWW zeolite nanosheets and organic CTAB layers, was prepared through a dissolution–recrystallization approach (Figure 44B). (678) The calcined material turned into a hierarchical zeolite catalyst (Al-ECNU-7, Si/Al = 15) and showed improved 1,3,5-TIPB conversion (∼72% at 1 h), which was 3 times higher than that of the conventional MCM-22 (∼24% at 1 h, Figure 44C,D). The cracking activity of 1,3,5-TIPB was also tested over hierarchical ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (679) The TIPB conversion increased as the crystalline size of the zeolites nanocrystals decreased. Their large external surface with abundant active sites facilitated the fast cracking of bulky molecules and thus increased the catalytic conversion of TIPB. Hierarchical Y zeolite nanocrystals with various sizes (10 nm, sample Y-10; 70 nm, sample Y-70; and 400 nm, sample Y-400) were prepared in the absence of template (Figure 44E). (280) The abundant intercrystalline mesopores facilitated the movement of reactants/products to and away from the catalytically active sites, thus leading to a superior catalytic performance and high selectivity toward the primary dialkylated products in the 1,3,5-TIPB cracking process (Figure 44F,G). When a hierarchical interconnected micro-meso-macroporous ZSM-5 zeolite was used in the 1,3,5-TIPB cracking process, its meso-macroporosity and interconnecting structure permitted cracking at both internal and external surfaces and favored the access of bulky1,3,5-TIPB molecules to the active sites, resulting in a 4-fold increased conversion. (234) These zeolitic nanocrystal aggregates with a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure were prepared by the direct transformation of amorphous nanoparticles into meso-macroporous aluminosilicates, which also acted as the support template. (234) A similar improved conversion of 1,3,5-TIPB was also found for carbon-templated mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite as compared with microporous zeolite (42.1% vs 6.8%). (30)

As discussed above, the introduction of a hierarchical structure into zeolites can greatly improve the catalytic conversion. The same applies to the product selectivity. The 1,3,5-TIPB cracking is known to be a three-step successive dealkylation reaction in which 1,3,5-TIPB first cracks into diisopropyl benzene (DIPB) and isopropylbenzene (IPB), followed by DIPB cracking to IPB, and then IPB further cracking to benzene (Bz). Side reactions such as disproportionation, isomerization, and condensation also occur. (680) The effective catalytic sites for the first dealkylation of 1,3,5-TIPB mainly happen on the external surface of the catalysts while the further deep cracking, such as cumene to benzene, occurs mainly on the acid sites inside the micropores. (151,232,916) Thus, the cracking extent of 1,3,5-TIPB over purely microporous zeolites is relatively low, leading to high product selectivity to DIPB (>50%). (681) For hierarchical zeolites, the deeper cracked products, such as benzene and IPB, become the predominant products due to the further cracking of DIPB in 1,3,5-TIPB cracking. (108,681) The mesoporous ZSM-5 prepared by the soft templating method exhibited a 100 wt % 1,3,5-TIPB conversion and 100% selectivity to Bz and IPB, while conventional ZSM-5 showed a much lower 1,3,5-TIPB conversion (71.4 wt %) and high selectivity toward DIPB under the same conditions. (682) The high catalytic performance of the resultant mesoporous ZSM-5 in the 1,3,5-TIPB cracking was attributed to its open mesoporous structure and exposed catalytic active sites. Similarly, an intracrystalline mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite, synthesized by employing an organosiloxane C24H57O12NSi3 as a mesopore-directing template, exhibited an extremely high catalytic conversion and selectivity toward Bz which mainly came from the cracking of IPB. (683) This was attributed to the abundant accessible acid sites where the primary products (DIPB and IPB) could further crack to secondary products.
4.1.7.3. Catalytic Cracking of Hydrocarbons
As mentioned above, for a certain cracking reaction, both the catalytic conversion and the product selectivity are improved after the introduction of a hierarchically porous structure into the zeolite catalysts. This also applies to the steam cracking process of hydrocarbons with light olefins (ethylene and propylene) as main products. Light olefins are basic raw materials for polyethylene, polypropylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide, ethylbenzene, and other chemicals. (684) The higher selectivity to light olefins in the cracking reactions depends on the reduced reaction path, shortened residence time, and increased accessibility of the catalyst sites. (917) Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites with precise selectivity toward a certain product are highly desired. Catalytic cracking of different types of hydrocarbons will be reported in the following sections.
4.1.7.3.1. Catalytic Cracking of Naphtha
Various zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and MCM-22 are used as catalysts in naphtha cracking to produce ethylene and propylene. Among them, ZSM-5 is considered to be the best material owing to its unique shape selectivity that influences the preferential formation of light olefins. Naphtha consists of different hydrocarbons such as linear alkanes, naphthenes, isoparaffins, olefins, and aromatics. (918) These bulky hydrocarbons suffer from severe diffusion limitations. The restricted access to the active sites reduces the catalytic effectiveness while the slow mass transport extends the residence time of products in the zeolite micropores, leading to increased coke deposition and decreased catalytic activity and selectivity toward light olefins. (919) Introducing the mesopore structure in microporous zeolites using the principles of hierarchical structure design is recognized as a promising route for eliminating their transport limitations and, thus, for improving their catalytic performances. For example, a higher selectivity toward light olefins was achieved over a mesoporous ZSM-5 with isolated mesopores, which was synthesized using carbon black as a mesopore template with an average particle diameter of 12 nm. The mesoporosity of ZSM-5 significantly enhanced the production of light olefins (24.0 wt %), showing a 2-fold increase in ethylene and propylene yields when compared with the conventional ZSM-5 catalyst (13.7 wt %). (920) Besides, the reduced residence time and the fast mass transfer of intermediate products in the mesoporous zeolites can efficiently inhibit the olefins consuming hydrogen transfer reactions and other secondary reactions. However, the incorporation of carbon black into the zeolite structure created cavelike mesopores that were not interconnected. To further increase the selectivity toward light olefins, many efforts were made to synthesize zeolites with interconnected meso- or macropores. For example, using carbon nanotubes leads to the creation of mesopore channels passing through the whole zeolite crystal. (921) A much higher olefin yield (54 wt %) was obtained over the synthesized mesoporous ZSM-5. In the following section, the catalytic cracking of the typical alkane components in naphtha (C6–C8 alkanes), such as n-hexane, n-heptane, and n-octane, used as a probe reaction to investigate the influence of meso- or macropore quality in hierarchically porous zeolites on their catalytic performance, is reviewed.
4.1.7.3.1.1. Catalytic Cracking of n-Hexane
The pore structure is considered to be an essential factor to evaluate the conversion, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts during the cracking of n-hexane. (922) Appropriate post-treatment synthesis was necessary to develop an optimal hierarchical zeolite with a reduced diffusion limit. (922) Hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolites, prepared by the HF-NH4F etching method, showed a higher BET surface area, larger mesoporous volume, fewer defect zones, and commensurable microporous structure as compared with the parent ZSM-5. They showed a better catalytic performance with less carbon deposition (23 mg g–1, which was 4 times less than that of the parent ZSM-5) due to their large mesoporous and macroporous structure. (685) Similarly, interconnected mesopores were introduced into the as-synthesized ZSM-5 crystals by alkaline desilication with the addition of organic amines (piperidine and hexamethylenimine), which can protect the zeolite crystals from excess dissolution and thus minimize the loss of micropores and catalytically active sites. (686) In the catalytic cracking of n-hexane, the coke amounts formed on alkali-treated zeolites were much lower than that of the parent zeolites. This was due to the shortened diffusion path length offered by the interconnection of zeolite intrinsic microporosity and the generated mesoporosity which could effectively facilitate the diffusion of coke precursors out of the micropores, thus suppressing the formation of heavy coke. Thus, the primary products also rapidly diffuse out of the zeolites, effectively suppressing the secondary reactions.
4.1.7.3.1.2. Catalytic Cracking of n-Heptane
To investigate the effect of mesopore quality on the catalytic cracking of n-heptane, hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with various intercrystalline mesopore volumes were prepared. (687) The results revealed that a larger mesopore volume led to a greater improvement of selectivity toward light olefins. Zhang et al. (688) further explored the effect of external acidity strength of the hierarchical zeolites on the catalytic cracking performance. They found that the more external acid sites are selectively eliminated, the better catalytic performance can be achieved due to the suppressed bimolecular reactions of ethylene and propylene and the inhibited coke formation. Besides, the addition of ZRP-1 zeolite (50 wt % loading), which is an MFI structure zeolite containing rare earth elements and phosphorus, during the hydrothermal synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite yielded composite zeolites with bimodal porosity. (689) The aggregation of zeolite nanocrystals resulted in hierarchically porous ZSM-5-ZRP-1 zeolites with an interconnected but disordered mesoporous structure (15–55 nm), which were more active than conventional ZSM-5 zeolites and more selective toward ethylene and propylene than conventional ZRP-1 zeolites in the cracking of n-heptane.
4.1.7.3.1.3. Catalytic Cracking of n-Octane
Highly crystalline mesoporous IM-5 zeolite, prepared by alkaline treatment, exhibited a higher light olefins yield (especially propylene) and longer catalyst lifetime in cracking n-octane than conventional ZSM-5 zeolites. (690) Similarly, the alkali-treated MFI zeolites also showed a greatly improved catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propene in the cracking of n-octane. (691) The addition of mesopores formed during the alkali treatment can efficiently suppress the production of long-chain alkanes. The cracking activity of n-octane was also tested over hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals. (692) The catalyst showed an extended catalyst lifetime as compared to the microporous ZSM-5. Such a higher catalytic stability was attributed to the fast diffusion of reactants in a hierarchically porous system. A zeolite composite with MFI and MOR zeolite structures was also investigated. (693) The existence of intracrystalline mesopores (4 nm, created in MOR zeolites) and macropores (50–100 nm, formed by the polycrystalline aggregation) in the zeolite composite facilitated the molecular transport and increased the active-site accessibility, thus leading to a higher catalytic activity in the cracking of n-octane.
4.1.7.3.2. Catalytic Cracking of C4 Alkene
Hierarchically porous zeolites are also used in the cracking of low-valued C4 olefin to produce high-valued propylene. The relatively fast mass transport facilitates the primary product out of the zeolites and effectively suppresses the hydrogen transfer reactions that produce aromatics and alkanes, which lowers the yield of targeted propylene and accelerates the catalyst deactivation. Hierarchically structured ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized by a mesoporogen-free steam-assisted crystallization procedure, showed an enhanced propylene yield (40 wt %) when compared with the microporous ZSM-5 (27 wt %). (694) Mesoporous ZSM-5 was prepared by alkali treatment and applied in butene catalytic cracking. (695) The introduced mesopores effectively increased the accessible active sites and facilitated the product molecule out of the zeolites, thus leading to an improved catalytic performance. The selectivity of ethylene and propylene over the mesoporous ZSM-5 reached 81.76% while, for the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite, the corresponding value was only 39.37%. Similar results were found for surface silicon-rich hierarchically porous ZSM-5, which was prepared by hydrothermal dealumination. (696) They exhibited an excellent catalytic performance and high selectivity toward propylene and ethylene in the cracking of butylene, which was attributed to their abundant mesoporosity and large external surface. Arudra et al. (697) reported that Silicate-1 zeolite is an efficient catalyst for propylene production from 1-butene cracking due to the absence of strong acid sites. Based on this conclusion, they further modified the surface of ZSM-5 by silica deposition using the chemical liquid deposition method and synthesized a hierarchically porous silicalite composite material with a core–shell structure by the hydrothermal method. (698) The propylene yield and the selectivity toward light olefins were higher on this core–shell silicalite composite than on silica deposited ZSM-5, which was prepared via the chemical liquid deposition (CLD) method. The increased selectivity was attributed to their large mesopore voids, which reduced the hydrogen transfer reactions that form alkanes and aromatics.
4.1.7.4. Catalytic Cracking of Polyolefin
Plastic waste is of great environmental concern worldwide. The main components of plastic waste are polyolefins, consisting of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP). (923) The recycling of plastic waste is a highly challenging task since the carbon chain is typically in the range of tens of thousands. The catalytic cracking of polyolefins over zeolite catalysts to useful products such as fuels or chemicals is a good option. (924) Hierarchically porous zeolites used for this purpose showed a high potential in solving this important environment problem. (925,926) In the cracking process, large molecules in polyolefins cannot enter into the micropores, and thus, the catalytic degradation of polyolefins first takes place on the external acidic sites of the zeolite catalysts. The catalytic activity of the catalysts strongly depends on their external surface area. (927) For example, hierarchical ZSM-5 aggregates, synthesized by the addition of surfactant, exhibited excellent catalytic activity in LDPE cracking. (699) The improved catalytic performance in the reactions involving large molecules was attributed to the improved accessibility to the active sites. Similarly, the introduction of mesopores into Beta zeolites by silanization significantly increased the catalytic cracking degree of HDPE. (700) Besides, hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals with abundant intercrystalline mesopores also exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity in the LDPE cracking reaction. (701) The catalyst with more accessible acid sites and higher acid strength provided an improved catalytic activity under mild conditions. In the sequential detemplation–desilication process, Perez-Ramirez et al. (497) also found that the excellent catalytic cracking performance resulted from the suitable treatment of the zeolite to generate mesoporosity while maintaining the crystallinity and intrinsic acidity. Furthermore, the interplay between the overall catalytic cracking performance in LDPE cracking and the large external surface of hierarchical zeolite ITQ-4 was investigated. (321) The hierarchy factor (HF) was appropriately related the introduced mesoporosity to catalytic activity. (13) To optimize the hierarchical structure, the HF needs to be maximized, comprising the increase of the mesopore surface area without a severe sacrifice of the micropore volume. It was found that the optimal activity in LDPE cracking required both a large mesoporous surface area and suitable Brønsted acidity. Therefore, the amount of the introduced mesoporous porosity should be weighted carefully against the compromised microporosity. Furthermore, Lee et al. (702) investigated the contribution of mesopores on the catalytic degradation of HDPEs. They prepared four mesoporous MFI zeolites with different mesopores by treatment with an alkaline solution (MFI-alk), the addition of a special structure-directing agent (MFI-sda) and an oxyacid (MFI-oxy), and the synthesis of a mesoporous material from a synthetic mixture containing dissolved MFI fragments (MFI-syn) (Figure 45A–L). The conversion of HDPE was very fast on MFI-sda, MFI-alk, and MFI-syn, and 100 wt % conversion was achieved in 60 min, while the degradation on MFI-oxy was slow due to its small pore volume (Figure 45M,N). This was indicative of the fact that the characteristics of mesopores were important in determining catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites. However, the internal diffusion limitations within the micropores leads to severe pore blocking and delayed mass transport. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites for alleviating the diffusion limitations. Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions.
4.1.8. Biomass Conversion
Growing demand for sustainable fuels and chemicals has renewed the interest toward alternative feedstocks replacing crude oil in traditional refineries. Thus, biomass, as the only renewable carbon source, has attracted great attention in the past several decades. (928) It can be divided into two main categories: lignocellulose feedstock and oleaginous feedstock. Typically, biomass conversion is the decomposition of bulky biopolymers into small basic molecules and/or the further processing of small basic molecules to value-added end-products. Microporous zeolites with various structures, such as MFI, (929) USY, (87,704) Beta, (706) and MOR, (708) were employed to catalyze the biomass conversion. For each process, the accelerated diffusion performance and the improved accessibility toward active sites are the determining factors. Hierarchically porous zeolites play an important role in many biomass conversions.
4.1.8.1. Lignocellulose Biomass Conversion
4.1.8.1.1. Lignocellulose Biomass Feedstock Processing
4.1.8.1.1.1. Lignocellulose to Bio-Oils
Lignocellulose biomass is the most abundant biomass resource and consists of three polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and extractives (terpenes, etc.). Most of the biomass-derived materials exhibit low density, making them difficult to store and transport. One way to overcome this limitation is to increase biomass density. (930) Cracking or pyrolysis is probably the most efficient method to increase the energy-density of these renewable materials. Bio-oil, which is considered as the energy-dense form of biomass, can be produced by a catalytic pyrolysis treatment. Hierarchical zeolites are the most promising catalysts for biomass pyrolysis. The increased external surface area and the improved diffusion performance in the zeolite crystal can greatly boost its catalytic activity and thus result in high-quality bio-oils and lower coke yields, as observed for hydrolysis of (hemi)cellulose, (931,932) catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignocellulose, (703) cellulose, (929)Miscanthus, (929) and lignin. (933) The hierarchical zeolites exhibit slower deactivation of the active sites, shorter retention time of products in the micropores, and less secondary coke product formation. (934) For example, a better catalytic stability was reported for the CFP of lignocellulose with mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by desilication with NaOH solutions, in which only a lower amount of coke was deposited. (703)
Lignocellulose to Platform Molecules
The transformation of lignocellulosic biomass to small useful molecules can be realized by the following process: the controlled lignocellulosic (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose) depolymerization to simple sugars and subsequent sugar transformations to targeted molecules. These molecules are regarded as the platform materials for the production of polymers, fine chemicals, and transportation fuels. Among these platform molecules, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and levulinic acid (LA) are of special interest.
The major component of the lignocellulosic biomass is cellulose (40–50 wt %), and its structural unit is glucose. 5-HMF, obtained from the dehydration of glucose (708,935,936)/its isomer fructose (704,706,937) or the direct dehydration of cellulose, (705,707) is a value-added chemical and has various applications in chemicals and fuels. (938) As an isomer of glucose, fructose could be rapidly dehydrated to HMF. Yang et al. (706) synthesized a hierarchically porous Beta zeolite single crystal via the steam-assisted crystallization of a carbon–silica composite monolith. The resultant catalysts composed of connected nanoparticles were applied for the dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF. The conversion of fructose over hierarchically porous Beta reached 100 wt % in 2 h with an HMF yield of 78.5 wt % while, over conventional Beta, the reaction time for the total conversion of fructose was increased to 3 h, and it was achieved with a lower HMF yield (58.7 wt %). The greatly improved catalytic performance over hierarchically porous Beta zeolite was due to the free and efficient diffusion of bulky molecules and the high accessibility of external acidic sites. Similar observations were found on hierarchical USY zeolite and ZSM-5 zeolite, which also exhibited higher selectivity towards 5-HMF in the dehydration of fructose than that of the conventional ones. (87,704) The conversion of fructose to 5-HMF is easier than that of glucose due to the presence of the furanose group. However, the high cost of fructose limits their further applications. Thus, the direct conversion of glucose to 5-HMF has attracted increasing attention. It was reported that a combination of micropores and mesopores was helpful in increasing the yield of 5-HMF from glucose. (936) Velaga and Peela (708) observed that the mesoporous MOR exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards glucose dehydration to 5-HMF with a selectivity to 5-HMF of 87% at a glucose conversion of 76 wt %. The high yield and selectivity to 5-HMF with minimal side products were due to the introduced mesoporosity and the optimized amount of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites in the catalysts. Hierarchically porous zeolite catalysts were also designed to efficiently convert cellulose to HMF. Nandiwalet et al. (705) prepared 5-HMF from cellulose over desilicated zeolite ZSM-5, which gave a cellulose conversion of 67 wt % and a 5-HMF yield of 46 wt % at 190 °C in 4 h. Dealuminated zeolite Beta with tunable Brønsted and Lewis acid site distribution and mesoporosity improved the conversion of cellulose to 5-HMF with similar results to those obtained by Nandiwalet et al. with desilicated ZSM-5. (707) The catalyst exhibited a 42 wt % yield of 5-HMF with a full conversion of cellulose at 200 °C in 5 h. Moreover, the consecutive rehydration of 5-HMF generated levulinic acid (LA), another important intermediate. (939) The yield of LA obtained from glucose over a micro-mesoporous catalyst composite (with ZSM-5 crystalline structure) was almost doubled (36 wt %) compared with the parent material. (940)
Terpene Transformations
Terpenes refer to extractives, consisting mainly of α-pinene (60–85 wt %). (941) Considering the abundance of α-pinene in inexpensive turpentine oil, its conversion to more valuable chemicals is of great interest. α-Pinene can be converted into a variety of important chemical intermediates, like terpinene, camphene, limonene, or cymenes that are essential for the synthesis of many fine chemicals. (942) The dominant factor influencing the conversion of the bulky biomass molecule is the catalyst lifetime influenced by coke formation that possibly blocks the micropores. (943) The hierarchical zeolites have an extended catalyst lifetime since the larger external surface area gives a slower deactivation, and the shorter retention time of products in the zeolites results in lesser secondary coke formation. To improve the catalytic performance of the conventional ZSM-5 zeolites, mesopores were introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite by desilication treatment with NaOH. (320) The resultant catalysts displayed an increased α-pinene conversion from 11 to about 27 wt % when compared with conventional ones. (944) Similarly, a lower amount of deposited coke over hierarchical USY, ZSM-5, and Beta zeolites was also reported in the isomerization of α-pinene. (709,710,945) The importance of mesopores in boosting catalytic properties was also confirmed by another successful application of mesoporous H-ferrierite. The zeolite exhibited an improved α-pinene conversion (from 72 to 97 wt %) and an increased selectivity towards limonene. (946)
4.1.8.1.2. Lignocellulosic-Based Feedstock Processing
The usage of lignocellulosic biomass in a refinery can be accomplished in different ways. An effective option is the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to a fluid by pyrolytic treatment, leading to the production of a liquid called bio-oil. The bio-oil is a highly oxofunctionalized mixture of light-to-medium hydrocarbons with a high oxygen content, high viscosity, and low stability. To widen their potential applications, oxygen must be removed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) processes, such as hydrodehydration and hydrodecarboxylation. (947) It was reported that bifunctional catalysts containing both the metal nanoparticles and acidic zeolites favored the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis oil. (947) Hierarchical zeolites with introduced mesopores or macropores are promising candidates as HDO catalyst supports due to the large size of lignocellulosic biomass. The meso- or macroporosity can enhance the dispersion of the metal phase and improve the accessibility of the relatively bulky reactant molecules to the active sites. (948,949) Veses et al. (949) investigated the metal-loaded hierarchically structured mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts for the deoxygenation of bio-oil. The mesopores were introduced by desilication. The hierarchical zeolites after impregnation with different metals (Sn, Cu, Ni, or Mg) exhibited an increased deoxygenation compared to the parent acidic hierarchical zeolite. The Mg-loaded hierarchical zeolite led to the production of fuels with the best characteristics, achieving the greatest reduction in the oxygen content and the lowest acidity. (949) Also, the hierarchical porosity in the zeolites plays a dominant role in deciding the cracking degree of the desired fraction and avoiding the unwanted byproducts in the HDO reactions involving acid-catalyzed bond-cleavage. (169,378,950) These advantages were observed in the upgrading reactions of bio-oils with desilicated Y zeolite. (711) The catalysts showed an increased selectivity toward primary cracking and deoxygenation products and decreased selectivity toward aromatic hydrocarbons due to the suppressed possibility of secondary oligomerization, cyclization, and hydrogen transfer reactions.
4.1.8.2. Oleaginous Biomass Conversion
4.1.8.2.1. Triglyceride Processing
Oleaginous feedstocks, such as animal fats and vegetable oils, are completely composed of triglycerides and are mixtures of esters made by glycerol and fatty acid alkyl (varied in alkyl-chain length and number of unsaturated bonds). (951,952) Generally, triglycerides cannot be used directly as combustible fuels due to their high viscosity and low volatility. Thus, the processing of triglyceride-rich biomass in chemical reactions such as transesterification, catalytic cracking, or pyrolysis represents a promising future option to replace the limited petroleum resources with biofuels and chemicals. (953) In particular, the transesterification of triglyceride in the presence of a short-chain alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, can produce biodiesels that are considered to be an important renewable source to alternative diesel fuel. (954,955) Hierarchically porous zeolites were proven to be excellent catalysts with a high catalytic efficiency in the transformation of triglyceride. The introduction of secondary mesopores or macropores into the zeolite frameworks can significantly improve the accessibility of bulky triglycerides to the active sites and thus boost the conversion efficiencies, (956) as observed in the conversion of crude vegetable oil (palm oil) by Ni/HBEA (712) or Pt/HBEA, (713) rapeseed by Ni/ZSM-5, (714) used vegetable oil (waste cooking oil) by NiMo/USY (715) or Ni/Y, (716) animal fats (fish oil) by Ga/MFI, (717) and nonedible oil (safflower oil and microalga oil) by USY (957) and NiMo/ZSM-5, (958) respectively. For example, Verma et al. (958) employed mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 and Ni–W metal components as a composite catalyst and found that the hierarchically structured catalyst showed a high yield of C9–C15 hydrocarbons (40–45%) and high isomerization selectivity (isomer/n-alkane, i/n ∼2–6) from Jatropha oil. However, the Ni–W/SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst could only yield ∼33% of jet-range hydrocarbons but with low selectivity to the isomers (i/n ∼1.1).
4.1.8.2.2. Glycerol Processing
The transesterification of triglycerides to biodiesels generates large amounts of glycerol byproducts. (959) Thus, the conversion of glycerol into value-added chemicals has attracted great attention. (960) Many glycerol transformation methods which have been developed like dehydration, acetalization, etherification, and aromatization will be discussed in this section.
4.1.8.2.2.1. Glycerol Dehydration
The dehydration of glycerol to acrolein is an important reaction. (961) Possato et al. (718) investigated the catalytic performance of mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite and found that the catalytic life is greatly improved by the increased mesopore volume in the catalyst. Zhang et al. (719) further investigated the influence of mesopore quality on the catalytic performance. A series of ZSM-5 zeolites with various mesopore structures were prepared, including bulky ZSM-5 with fewer closed intracrystalline mesopores (H-Z5-1), nanosized ZSM-5 with more closed intracrystal mesopores (H-Z5-2), oriented self-assembled ZSM-5 nanocrystals with abundant open intercrystalline mesopores (H-Z5-3), and self-assembled ZSM-5 nanocrystals with intra- and intercrystalline mesopores (H-Z5-4) (Figure 46A–D). The conventional ZSM-5 (C-Z5) catalyst suffered from the fastest deactivation after 3 h. The catalytic conversion over C-Z5 even decreased to less than 45 wt % after 8 h. This was due to the extremely slow diffusion. In contrast, the incorporation of mesopores within microporous zeolites prolonged the catalyst lifetime (comparing H-Z5-x with C-Z5). All of the four hierarchically structured catalysts showed slower deactivation than C-Z5 (Figure 46E). The H-Z5-3 and HZ5-4 samples with open and interconnected mesopores exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime than H-Z5-1 and H-Z5-2 samples containing isolated intracrystalline mesopores. This is due to the facilitated mass transfer and hindered coke formation offered by open and interconnected mesopores. The relationships between the catalytic performance (lifetime and initial activity) and the structural properties (Vmeso,N2, Vmeso,Hg, and Smeso) are shown in Figure 46F–I. This further confirmed the positive role of the mesopores on extending the catalyst lifetime and increasing catalytic activity. Figure 46F,G shows the relationship between the catalyst lifetime and total mesopore volume (Vmeso,N2). The lifetime increased with increasing Vmeso,N2. The structural parameter of Vmeso,Hg indicated the accessible mesopores by mercury intrusion from the zeolite outer surface (Figure 46H,I). The relationship between lifetime and Vmeso,Hg excluded the influence of closed mesopores. The longest catalyst lifetime was observed for H-Z5-3 and H-Z5-4. It further confirmed that the sole existence of closed mesopores in ZSM-5 zeolites can also extend the catalyst lifetime. Besides, the mesoporous zeolites also exhibited higher selectivity toward acrolein than C-Z5. It was noteworthy that the open and interconnected mesopores (H-Z5-3 and H-Z5-4) are more effective than closed ones (H-Z5-1 and H-Z5-2). The presence of small intracrystalline mesopores could result in a reduced lifetime and decreased catalytic activity (H-Z5-2 < H-Z5-1 < H-Z5-4 < H-Z5-3). This catalytic property was due to the pore condensation of glycerol or its heavier derivatives. (719)

The catalyst lifetime is defined as the time for which the conversion exceeds the 80%, while the initial activity is defined as the glycerol conversion at the initial reaction period of 2–3 h.

4.1.8.2.2.2. Glycerol Acetalization
The catalytic activity of zeolites in glycerol acetalization can be greatly improved by the fabrication of a hierarchical porosity. (962) For example, mesoporous zeolite Beta, prepared by the dealuminated method, exhibited an improved catalytic activity due to the accelerated mass transfer and enhanced accessibility provided by the mesopores and the controllable acidity offered by the dealumination treatment. It was noteworthy that the reduction of crystalline size of the zeolite can greatly improve the catalytic activity and selectivity toward the dioxolane product when using Beta zeolite (720) and ZSM-5 zeolite (721) as catalysts.
4.1.8.2.2.3. Glycerol Etherification
The etherification of glycerol is an important reaction aimed at producing oxygenated blending stocks as diesel fuels. (963−965) The acid strength and porosity of the catalysts have a great impact on the glycerol conversion and the selectivity toward desirable products. A treatment of HY zeolite with citric or nitric acids resulted in the generation of mesopores in which the citric acid created pores with a diameter larger than 3 nm, and nitric acid produced pores with a diameter less than 3 nm. These mesoporous zeolites showed improved catalyst acidity. (722) Consequently, increased glycerol conversion and selectivity toward di-tert-butylglycerols were observed. Similarly, Saxena et al. (723) reported that the use of mesoporous Beta zeolite led to a higher glycerol conversion (98 wt %) than conventional Beta (85 wt %), demonstrating the superior catalytic performance of the mesoporous Beta in the etherification of glycerol.
4.1.8.2.2.4. Glycerol Aromatization
The development of a new approach for synthesizing aromatics by glycerol conversion has attracted great attention. Hoang et al. (724) confirmed that ZSM-5 zeolites provided a higher aromatic conversion than other types of zeolite catalysts due to their suitable microporous structure and acidity. However, ZSM-5 suffered rapid deactivation due to heavy coke deposition. The catalytic lifetime can be significantly extended after the introduction of mesopores into the ZSM-5 zeolites. For example, mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by Xiao et al. exhibited a nearly 2-fold increase in benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) yield and a 3-fold improvement in catalyst life as compared to conventional microporous ZSM-5 (13.9 wt % BTX yield and 4 h catalyst life). (725) Such superior catalytic properties were attributed to the mesopores in the ZSM-5 catalyst. One possible source of the aforementioned challenges may be the presence of transport limitations in the catalyst pore structure. Bulky oxygenates formed during the initial stages of pyrolysis may not be able to efficiently reach the active sites within the catalyst micropores. Application of a mesoporous catalyst can be advantageous, as enlarging the pore structure results in increased accessibility of reactants to catalyst acid sites.
In conclusion, biomass conversion generally involves the conversion of a broad range of chemical species with different sizes. Obviously, the accessibility of the active sites by the reactants in the catalysts is of great importance, and many efforts are made to enhance the transport of the reactant and product to and away from the active sites. Besides, in the biomass conversion, the tunable pore size and pore architecture of hierarchically porous zeolites offer great possibilities for the conversion of various biomass-derived feedstocks. Thus, it can be concluded that the rational design of the hierarchically porous zeolites with improved mass transfer, inhibited undesired transformations, and reduced catalyst deactivations is of great importance.
4.1.9. Conclusion
As discussed in section 4.1, catalytic applications of hierarchical zeolites are tested in different industrially relevant reactions, such as the Friedel–Crafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion. The hierarchical zeolite catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites, which is due to their optimal mesopore quality, such as the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals. Depending on the synthesis approaches enumerated in section 2, quite diverse geometries of the imbedded meso- or macropores are obtained in the hierarchically porous zeolites, ranging from isolated mesovoids to open mesoporous channels through the whole microporous crystal. In turn, different geometries with different interconnectivities lead to notably different mass transfer patterns. Thus, investigating the structure–performance relationships in these zeolites with multiple porosities is vital to improve their catalytic properties. However, it still remains a great challenge. More importantly, most previous studies reported that the improved catalytic performances of hierarchical zeolites are due to the enhanced mass transfer, but they failed to present direct evidence of diffusion characteristics. Thus, the diffusion on hierarchical zeolites should be further studied to confirm the advantages of the hierarchically porous system in hierarchical zeolites.
4.2. Environmental Applications
4.2.1. Wastewater Treatment
Removal of biotoxic heavy metals, such as Sr2+ and Hg2+, from the industrial wastewater has attracted great attention worldwide due to their damaging impact on the environment and public health. The adsorption and ion-exchange approaches are the simplest and most effective methods to remove harmful elements from contaminated industrial water. Generally, zeolites are efficient adsorbents/ion exchangers in wastewater treatment across a wide range of contaminants. (966) Zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio such as NaA and NaX zeolites were used to remove heavy metal ions, such as Cs+, (967) Sr2+, (967) and Zn2+, (968) from water by an ion-exchange process due to the high concentration of exchangeable nonframework cations available in their microporous structure. (967,968) However, their ion-exchange capacity was still affected by the diffusion limitation in the microporous network. The hierarchical zeolites are considered to be ideal materials for ion exchange due to their significantly superior ion-exchange performance. For example, a hierarchically structured porous composite constructed by clinoptilolite supported on date stone carbon was prepared by fixing a natural zeolite (clinoptilolite) on the porous date stone carbon or by direct hydrothermal method on the surface of porous date stone carbon to offer a supported high-surface-area ion-exchange material to remove metal ions from aqueous streams. Sucrose and citric acid were used as a binder to fix the clinoptilolite. The hierarchically structured composite exhibited a much higher ion exchange capacity of Sr2+ ions from an aqueous solution than that of conventional clinoptilolite. (969) Similarly, the hierarchical zeolite X/diatomite composite was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis of a zeolite X layer over diatomite. (970) Both hierarchically porous zeolite X composites exhibited a significantly improved ion-exchange behavior for manganese ion removal when compared with purely microporous zeolites X. Moreover, Fardmousavi et al. (971) prepared the thiol-functionalized Beta zeolite/MCM-41 mesoporous silica nanocomposites and then grafted them with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. The hierarchically porous zeolite/MCM-41 composite was employed in the extraction of Hg2+ from aqueous solutions. The material showed an excellent capacity for the Hg2+ ion exchange from aqueous solutions, kinetically fast adsorption process, and extremely short equilibrium state. A maximum ion-exchange capacity of 8.2 mequiv g–1 was obtained with the hierarchical zeolite/MCM-41.
4.2.2. Adsorptive Desulfurization
Conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is widely used in the refinery to remove most aliphatic sulfur compounds such as sulfides, disulfides, and mercaptans. However, the HDS reaction is less efficient for aromatic refractory sulfur compounds such as thiophene (TP), benzothiophene (BTP), dibenzothiophene (DBTP), and their derivatives. New technologies have been developed to realize the ultradeep desulfurization. (972) Among these, adsorptive desulfurization is regarded as a promising technology in the selective removal of thiophenic sulfur compounds under moderate conditions. (973) It is based on the physisorption or chemisorption process of organosulfur compounds on ion-exchanged zeolites. The highly dense Brønsted acid sites in the zeolites act as an adsorption platform by donating a proton to the nearby adsorbate molecules. Deep adsorptive desulfurization is decided by the charge of metal cations, the acid properties of the zeolites, the Si/Al ratio, and the pore size of the zeolites. The utilization of zeolites as liquid-phase sulfur adsorbents is receiving significant attention. The removal of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels can be an ideal desulfurization method due to the low energy and low cost of such a process. However, diffusion constraints within the micropore structure of zeolites can significantly reduce their adsorption capacity, especially when bulky sulfur compounds are present in fuels. Hierarchical zeolites showed high performances in the desulfurization of liquid fuels. The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites. Tian et al. (974) investigated the sulfur removal from a model fuel containing various thiophenic compounds and found that hierarchical H-Beta zeolite by desilication removed about twice as much total sulfur when compared with the parent Beta zeolite. However, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of zeolite Beta is much higher than that of Y, thus limiting the amount of metal ions in Beta zeolite introduced by ion exchange, which are the main adsorption sites for the adsorption of sulfur aromatic compounds. They further developed a novel desulfurization sorbent based on Y zeolite that exhibited a high sulfur capacity and low mass transfer resistance. (975,976) The metal-exchanged hierarchical Y zeolite containing abundant mesopores to improve diffusion performances and large external surface area provided abundant active sites for sulfur adsorption. Bimetals were introduced into hierarchical Y zeolites to further enhance the selective adsorption of sulfur compounds from a model fuel mixture. Wang et al. (977) demonstrated that the desulfurization performance of hierarchically porous NiCe-exchanged zeolite Y in removing DBTP was higher when compared with Ni-exchanged zeolite Y and Ce-exchanged zeolite Y. Wang et al. (978) further investigated the role of the mesoporosity in CuCe mesoporous Y zeolites on the desulfurization process. Such bimetallic mesoporous Y zeolites exhibited a DBTP capacity 5 times more than parent Y due to both improved mass transfer and high adsorption energy.
In conclusion, the synthesis and modification of zeolite-based adsorbents have received considerable attention in adsorptive desulfurization. Zeolites showed a high sulfur loading capacity, easy regenerability, and a stable crystalline structure for adsorptive removal of sulfur compounds. It is highly advantageous in the removal of small molecules in various adsorption applications. However, their relatively small micropores restrict the transfer of the bulky aromatic refractory sulfur compounds, such as DBTPs and other alkyl-branched dibenzothiophenes. Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules.
4.2.3. CO2 Capture
Capturing carbon dioxide is of great importance to mitigate climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions. (979) Recent studies reported that the adsorption processes using hierarchically micro-mesoporous zeolites are a promising technology for CO2 capture because they possessed a larger surface area to allow for increased adsorption of CO2. (980,981) Gong et al. (982) reported a biosynthesis route to prepare hierarchically porous SAPO-34 constructed by nanosheets. The obtained hierarchically porous SAPO-34 showed a distinctive morphology with nanosheets and gaps between nanosheets, giving rise to a blooming flowerlike structure. This hierarchically porous SAPO-34 exhibited a much higher CO2 adsorption capacity of 2.77 mmol g–1 at 100 kPa with the CO2/CH4 ideal separation factor of 8.2 as compared to the conventional SAPO-34. It took 6.1 min for CO2 to reach the adsorption equilibrium, which was much faster than conventional SAPO-34 due to the nanosheet-constructed porous structure. By combining sacrificial templating and freeze-casting techniques, Besser et al. synthesized hierarchically porous zeolite 13X monoliths. (983) The hierarchically porous monoliths exhibited a high working capacity and a fast CO2 uptake when compared with commercially available zeolite 13X. Ojuva et al. (984) synthesized hierarchical macro-microporous zeolite 13X with a laminar structure by the freeze-casting method. The zeolite showed a high and rapid CO2 adsorption. This hierarchical zeolite 13X exhibited a very fast initial uptake, in which more than half of the maximum uptake was achieved within 15 s. Moreover, ZSM-5 has a good affinity for the CO2 molecule, and the desorption of CO2 from ZSM-5 can be controlled under mild conditions. (985) Hierarchically porous ZSM-5 with a large surface area and an introduced mesoporous structure is expected to be a high-performance adsorbent for CO2 removal. (986) Thus, Liu et al. (987) developed hierarchically porous ZSM-5 using organosilanes as templates and found that the CO2 adsorption capacity was much higher than that of the microporous ZSM-5. The effective improvement of CO2 adsorption mainly originated from the large surface area, which promoted the CO2 adsorption capacity.
4.2.4. Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds
The removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), mainly consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes, is an urgent necessity since these compounds are harmful for the environment and human health. (988) Advanced technologies for reducing VOCs have been well developed, such as adsorption (989,990) and catalytic combustion. (991−993)
4.2.4.1. Adsorption of Volatile Organic Compounds
MFI-type zeolites with a purely siliceous form (Silicalite-1) are considered to be potential adsorbents of VOCs. (994) However, the relatively small and sole micropores in conventional zeolites result in relatively slow mass transport, hindering their further use in adsorption processes. (783) Hierarchically porous materials are designed and developed to improve their diffusion performance. Coating or supporting zeolite crystals on the surface of a permanent porous support to fabricate hierarchically porous composites (supported zeolites) has been proven to be an effective method. Yu et al. (989) prepared hierarchically porous diatomite/MFI-type zeolite composites, which exhibited hierarchical porosity with micropores from the microporous zeolite and macropores from the macroporous diatomite support. The prepared composites exhibited higher benzene adsorption capacity per unit mass of zeolite and less mass transfer resistance than microporous Silicalite-1. They further improved the diffusion performance of diatomite/zeolite composites by coating desilicated zeolite crystals on the surface of diatomite. (990) The resultant materials exhibited a special trimodal porosity: macroporosity from the diatomite support, mesoporosity from desilication treatment, and microporosity from MFI-type zeolite. Benzene was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the adsorption performance of the resulting composites for VOCs. The resultant sample exhibited a higher adsorption capacity, better affinity, and faster adsorption kinetics toward benzene than the parent ones. The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment. Kabalan et al. (995) investigated the effect of the morphology (microcrystals, nanocrystals, nanosponges, and nanosheets) of MFI and BEA type zeolites on their adsorption capacities of n-hexane at room temperature (Figure 47A–D). The adsorption capacity of n-hexane, which was very sensitive to the mesopore volume in the adsorbents, was greatly improved in zeolite nanocrystals or hierarchical nanoporous materials (nanosheets and nanosponges). The n-hexane adsorption capacities of hierarchical MFI and BEA zeolites reached about 790 and 693 mg g–1, which were much higher than those of microcrystals (130 and 103 mg g–1, respectively, Figure 47E,F).

4.2.4.2. Catalytic Combustion of Volatile Organic Compounds
Catalytic combustion is an efficient, economically feasible, and environmentally friendly technology for the removal of VOCs. Both noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Au) and transition metal oxides (Co3O4, FeOx, MnOx, NiO, ZnO, and CuO) are used as active sites for catalytic combustion of VOCs. Zeolite-supported noble metal nanoparticles were reported to exhibit the best catalytic performance for the combustion of VOCs. (996) However, microporous zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation caused by the poor adsorption and diffusion of reactant molecules. To accelerate the mass transfer, Chen and co-workers (991,997) synthesized mesoporous Beta and mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites and used them as catalytic supports for toluene combustion. The mesoporous zeolites displayed a much better catalytic activity than the conventional ones. Similar results were found in the case of Pt-loaded hierarchically porous MOR zeolite. (992) The materials exhibited a superior catalytic performance and extraordinary long catalyst lifetime in toluene combustion when compared with Pt-loaded microporous zeolites. Wang et al. (993) synthesized Ru/hierarchical ZSM-5 as an efficient bifunctional adsorbent/catalyst system for the removal of bulky aromatic VOCs. The value of turnover frequency of the Ru/hierarchical ZSM-5 was about 2, 3, and 4 times higher than that of Ru/conventional ZSM-5 toward toluene, o-xylene, and TMB combustion, respectively, indicating that the Ru/hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites had a much better performance in catalyzing the combustion of bulkier molecules.
4.3. Biological Applications
The capacity of zeolites as carriers for large biological active species can be improved by introducing meso- or macropores into the microporous structure. The mesopores thus serve as hosts for large biological molecules or metal complexes.
Enzymes are one of the most active and selective biocatalysts used in many chemical reactions. However, the low thermal stability and poor recycling performances severely limit their further use in industry. Many efforts have been devoted to improving the stability and catalytic performance of enzymes by supporting them on different materials. Materials with highly accessible surface areas are typically preferred to obtain high loadings of the catalytic species. Hierarchical zeolites with large external surface area and tunable surface properties have received much interest. Mitchell and Pérez-Ramírez (998) studied the application of hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites as carriers for lipase enzymes. Enzymes immobilized on purely inorganic supports exhibited rapid deactivation due to the enzyme leaching. The one-dimensional mesopores of the surface-functionalized MCM-41 resulted in a limited accessibility and a decreased enzyme uptake. In contrast, the interconnected mesopores in the surface-functionalized hierarchical zeolites still remained accessible and showed a good adsorption ability. Lipase immobilized on thiol-functionalized mesoporous ZSM-5 was also an efficient biocatalyst (Figure 48). Similarly, a hierarchical Zn2+-exchanged ZSM-5/fly ash cenosphere material was also prepared for separating two different proteins. (999)

Moreover, zeolites with a hierarchically porous structure (86) and magnetically separable zeolite nanocrystals (1000) have been reported for the separation or immobilization of biomolecules. The catalysts showed almost the same enzyme-immobilized capacity and biocatalytic activity when compared with the microporous zeolites. Besides, they can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by simple filtration or centrifugation.
Furthermore, the layered zeolite materials provide a large external surface area for the attachment or entrapment of enzyme. Hierarchical ITQ-6 zeolite made by the aggregated nanosheets delaminated from the lamellar precursor of the ferrierite zeolite was employed as an excellent support for immobilization of enzymes and was proven to be an efficiently recyclable enzyme support. (1001,1002) The enzymes were supported on hierarchically structured ITQ-6 zeolites by covalent bonding, resulting in extremely stable catalysts when compared with the enzyme in free form and that chemically bonded to amorphous silica. (1002)
4.4. Conclusions
Hierarchically porous zeolites have attracted continuously increasing interests. Different applications of hierarchically porous zeolites are systematically introduced. Hierarchically porous zeolites are widely used in catalysis, environmental, and biological fields due to their large surface area, shortened mass diffusion path, improved mass transport, and increased accessibility for reactants.
Hierarchically porous zeolites can be effectively used in the catalytic applications. The catalytic reactions with industrial relevance such as the Friedel–Crafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion have been chosen to test the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity when compared with microporous zeolites, due to the presence of meso- or macropores. Besides, the introduced mesopores also facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thus leading to an improved resistance to coking.
In addition, hierarchically porous zeolites have long been utilized for environmental applications. Their multiple pore sizes leading to reduced diffusion resistance and high surface areas can be expected to improve their performances in wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds. Besides, the diffusion improvement within the hierarchically porous zeolites can significantly increase their adsorption capacity, especially when bulky compounds are present.
Hierarchically porous zeolites are also widely used as biomaterials. Their high external surface area and large pore volume result in increasing bioactivity and offer more choices to be functionalized by different groups for novel properties and improved biocompatibility.
In conclusion, great progress has been made in the field of hierarchically porous zeolites. The integration of multilevel porosities into a single zeolite crystal can offer a large surface area and fast diffusion performance, thus improving the catalytic performances and adsorption/separation properties of the catalyst. To improve the properties of the hierarchically porous zeolite, the hierarchical pore systems should be highly interconnected, and the introduced meso- or preferably macropores should be accessible from the outer surface of the crystal. It is envisioned that many new and exciting applications of the hierarchically porous zeolites will emerge owing to the optimization of tunable meso- or macroporous zeolite structures.
5. Conclusion and Future Trends
The field of hierarchically porous zeolites in general has seen tremendous growth during the past decades. The main motivation is to reduce the diffusion limitations of molecules that are imposed by the micropores in the conventional zeolites. Many new approaches, herein classified as either the “in situ approach” or “postsynthetic approach”, have been developed. Most “bottom-up” strategies involve the use of meso- or macroscale templates, either direct templates, such as the hard template and soft template, or indirect templates, such as inert composite partners and active composite partners. Optimal interactions between the templates and the silicate or aluminosilicate species in the zeolite synthesis gels are essential for the success of the “in situ approach”. Different synthesis methods result in different meso- or macroporosity. Thus, in order to realize better catalytic performances in zeolites, efforts should be made to achieve the optimal balance between the introduced mesoporosity, the intrinsic microporosity, and the best control of the amount, location, size distribution, and interconnectivity of the additional pores. In addition, the economic and environmental costs should be considered due to the relatively expensive and irretrievable templates. Although the “in situ approach” without the use of templates has been reported, it is still difficult for a large-scale synthesis due to the time-consuming preparative procedure and the rigid synthesis condition.
In the “postsynthetic approach”, demetalation was known for about half a century. The important issue is that not all of the mesopores are open to the external surface of the zeolite crystals. Thus, they cannot fully enhance the diffusion through zeolites. Dealumination was first developed and widely used in industry. However, the number of acid sites decreased with the Al-extraction from the framework. The desilication is another demetalation method to create hierarchical porosity by dissolving Si in the zeolite framework. Other methods like the delamination approach lead to the exposure of a larger fraction of the highly acidic zeolite surface for adsorption and catalysis. Nevertheless, it can be applied only to a small range of zeolites. Besides, the high surfactant content and the alkalinity used for the delamination process result in the partial dissolution of the zeolite framework. Zeolite recrystallization through the initial desilication/depolymerization and the following reassembling process in the presence of conventional surfactants gives high yield and relatively low environmental damage when compared with the demetallization, delamination, and the “in situ approach”. For example, the FCC catalysts using mesoporous zeolite Y prepared by zeolite recrystallization were scaled up and successfully utilized in North American refineries. (381) Although various hierarchical zeolites can be prepared, the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with high structural stability and the design of such multimodal porous zeolitic materials with a better understanding of the cooperation between different pore systems still remain great challenges. Based on the analysis of the function of each pore system, the hierarchical zeolites with an interconnected micro-meso-macroporous structure are supposed to be the most efficient materials. Developing new synthesis strategies to effectively construct the ideal hierarchical pore architecture with low economic cost and environmental damage and wide versatility still remains a great challenge.
Three different types of hierarchically porous zeolites are distinguished and systematically discussed according to their different levels of porosity, the micro-mesoporous structured zeolites, the micro-macroporous structured zeolites, and the micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Concrete examples are given to show how to select and to combine different preparation strategies to fabricate each type of hierarchically structured zeolite.
In catalytic, environmental, and biological applications, hierarchically porous zeolites prove to be the most desirable catalysts/adsorbents/supports. This is due to the introduced meso- or macropores into the microporous zeolites which can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of the active sites, thus leading to an increased performance in certain applications. Some industrially relevant reactions, such as the Friedel–Crafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion, are selected to evaluate the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchical zeolite catalysts exhibited a superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites due to the improved mass transport and the shortened diffusion path length. In addition, the multilevel pores in the hierarchically porous zeolites offer reduced diffusion resistance and high surface areas for an improved adsorption performance, especially when bulky compounds are present, in wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds. Besides, hierarchically porous zeolites are also widely used in the biological domain owing to their high surface area and large pore volume which would improve their bioactive behavior for biological species and allow them to be loaded with various functional groups to obtain excellent new functionalities, new properties, and biocompatibility. The above-mentioned large variety of existing and promising industrial applications is largely due to the benefits of a larger additional pore system in the microporous zeolites. Many new and exciting applications could be found after creating hierarchically porous zeolites with optimized properties.
Although a large volume of research is found in the scientific literature, few reports focus on the establishment of the quantitative link between the performance and the amount, location, size, shape, and dimension of each porosity to find the principles and rules for the design of materials with predictable properties. The design and preparation of high-performance hierarchically porous materials still remain quite empirical. We still follow the “trial–testing–modification–retesting” process to reach the optimized, but not the best, target materials. Such a situation is due to the lack of principles, rules, and theories in the design of advanced materials.
“Learning from nature” could be an important inspiration to find the concrete examples which serve as rules to follow and to emulate. The evolution by selection gives various classes of hierarchically porous organisms, in which pore sizes decrease along different scales and end in units of constant size, such as those found in plant stems, leaf veins, and vascular and respiratory systems. These living hierarchically porous systems connected within a finite volume can minimize transport resistance and ensure accelerated transfer over the entire hierarchical system as a decisive factor for organisms. To maximize the exchange surface, the living hierarchically porous networks of organisms have to be evolved with macropores, expanded by multisized pores with increasing amounts but decreasing diameters. In 1926, Murray, an American biologist, established for the first time, on the basis of numerous examples of living hierarchically porous systems, an empirical equation referred to as “Murray’s law” with precise diameter ratios for interconnected multiscale pores from macroscopic to microscopic levels to quantitatively describe living hierarchically porous systems of organisms. Indeed, Murray’s law stipulates the optimized hierarchical design for porous materials and chemical reactions with maximized transfer properties. However, since its discovery, Murray’s law has not received the merit it deserved. Only few works in the design of chemical reactors based on Murray’s law can be found in the literature. (1003−1005) The main issue is that Murray’s law is only an empiric description of hierarchically porous systems of organisms but does not consider the mass variation and constant surface substance exchange during the mass transportation. Su’s group very recently revisited the Murray’s law and developed a “generalized Murray’s law” taking the mass variation and constant surface substance exchange into account during the mass transportation. (10) Such a generalized Murray’s law has been used to design and synthesize a series of bioinspired hierarchically porous materials which emulate the natural vascular structure whose pore sizes decrease across macro-meso-micrometer scales and finally terminate in size-invariant, as in leaves, and blood vascular and respiratory systems. (10) The obtained biomimics enable highly enhanced mass exchange and transfer in liquid–solid, gas–solid, and electrochemical reactions and exhibit outstanding properties in photocatalysis, gas sensing, and Li-ion batteries. (10) This first example of “learning from nature” can serve as a guideline and lead to further inspiration in the quantitative design and synthesis of high-performance hierarchically porous materials with a desirable texture and advanced properties.
Recently, following such a generalized Murray’s law, Su’s group again successfully synthesized hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 single crystals, containing a micro-mesoporous structure. (674) The hierarchical ZSM-5 materials showed superior catalytic activity, twice as high as that shown by the bulky ZSM-5 in the catalytic cracking reaction of isopropyl benzene owing to its high mass transfer. Besides, this type of unique ZSM-5 also has outstanding thermal/hydrothermal stability because of its bioinspired hierarchically porous structure which leads to homogeneous heat and vapor transfer and dissipation. A smart moisture-wicking fabric based on biomimetic micro- and nanofibrous membranes with macro-, micron-, and submicron-sized pores obeying the “generalized Murray’s law” by introducing the surface energy gradient has been prepared. Such biomimetic membranes with multibranched pores possessed an excellent moisture-wicking performance, far superior to the conventional porous membranes. (1006)
Based on this, Su and co-workers further demonstrated an in situ bottom-up confined crystallization process to synthesize a zeolite ZSM-5 single-crystal reactor (OMMS-ZSM-5) (1007) and zeolite Beta single-crystal reactor (OMMS-Beta) (1008) that have a fully interconnected and highly ordered intracrystalline macro-meso-microporosity. Such a novel hierarchically porous structure offering accelerated mass transport and improved accessibility to active sites can not only increase catalytic activities and lifetime of OMMS-ZSM-5 in the bulky-molecule cracking process and methanol-to-olefins reaction (1007) but also greatly enhance catalytic performances of OMMS-Beta in gas-phase and liquid-phase acid-catalyzed reactions involving bulky molecules. (1008) Most importantly, such a strategy is quite simple and versatile and has been extended to the synthesis of other zeolitic materials, including TS-1 and SAPO-34.
Through rational and quantitative design based on this generalized Murray’s law, the performance of materials can be significantly ameliorated, and in particular, the bioinspired hierarchically porous material design based on this generalized Murray’s law can achieve predictable and optimized functions.
The new era of “material-properties-by-quantitative and real rational design” based on the “generalized Murray’s law” that enables the predictable and controlled production of bioinspired hierarchically porous materials with a quantitative hierarchy in terms of amount, location, shape, size, and dimension at every micro-meso-macrometer length scale for optimized structural features and outstanding performance can emerge. Hierarchically porous materials with highly enhanced efficiency, minimum energy, time, and raw material consumption can also revolutionize the design of reactors for a sustainable life.
