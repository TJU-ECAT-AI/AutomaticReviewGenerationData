On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form.
In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces.
Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the adsorption of ethene, are influenced by factors including the chemical qualities of the surface (like bond types) and morphological characteristics. For instance, on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, ethene predominantly forms a η2 di-σ-bonded conformation, which is more stable compared to a π-bonded conformation. The π-bonded ethene is found to be more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy. Moreover, the High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on these surfaces exhibit slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks, indicating subtle variations in their adsorption characteristics.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如乙烷的吸附，受表面化学性质（如键类型）和形貌特征等因素的影响。例如，在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上，乙烷主要以η2 di-σ键的形式吸附，这比π键形式更稳定。在Pt2Sn表面合金上，π键形式的乙烷比其他表面上更为丰富。此外，乙烷在这些表面的高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)谱图中，在损失峰的能量位置上有轻微的差异，表明它们的吸附特性存在细微的差别。
