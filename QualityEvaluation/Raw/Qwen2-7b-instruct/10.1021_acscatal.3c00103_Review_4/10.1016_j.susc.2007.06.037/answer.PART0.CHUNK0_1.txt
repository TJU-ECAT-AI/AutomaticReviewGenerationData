On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form. In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces. Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The adsorption of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys shows that the most stable form is an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene. This form is predominant on both surfaces. However, a minor amount of π-bonded ethene is also identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy compared to the other surfaces. Moreover, the High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys exhibit slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

在Pt(1 1 1)和Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1)以及Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，乙烯吸附的最稳定形式是η2双σ键结构。这种形式在两种表面上都占主导地位。然而，在Pt2Sn表面合金上发现的少量π键乙烯比其他表面上更多。此外，高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的乙烯光谱在损失峰的能量位置上有轻微差异。
