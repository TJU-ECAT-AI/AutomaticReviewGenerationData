[1] "On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form."
[2] "In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces."
[3] "The HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks."

1. The most stable adsorbed form of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys is the η2 di-σ-bonded conformation. 
2. π-bonded ethene is less abundant but present, especially more so on the Pt2Sn surface alloy compared to other surfaces.
3. The High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys show slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

1. 在Pt(1 1 1)以及PtSn表面合金上，最稳定的吸附形式为乙炔的η2 di-σ键结构。
2. π键化的乙炔存在但较少，尤其是在Pt2Sn表面合金中比其他表面更为丰富。
3. 高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的乙炔谱图显示了损失峰能级位置的微小差异。
