On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form.
In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces.
Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

The adsorption of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys shows that the most stable adsorbed form is the η2 di-σ-bonded conformation. A minor amount of π-bonded ethene is also identified, with its abundance varying between the different surface alloys. The High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on these surfaces exhibit slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

在Pt(1 1 1)和Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1)以及Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，乙炔吸附的最稳定形式是η2双σ键结构。还识别出了一种π键合的乙炔，其在不同表面合金中的丰度不同。高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）中，乙炔在这几个表面上的谱图在失活峰的能量位置上表现出微小差异。
