[1] "On Pt(1 1 1) as well as on the PtSn surface alloys an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene has been found to be the most stable adsorbed form."
[2] "In addition to this majority species a minor amount of π-bonded ethene has been identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy than on the other surfaces."
[3] "Additionally the HREELS spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys differ only slightly in terms of the energetic positions of the loss peaks."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene being the most stable adsorbed form on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, indicate that these catalysts favor a specific bonding state of ethene. The presence of π-bonded ethene, more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy, suggests variations in bonding states depending on the catalyst type. These differences in bonding states could influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. The slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks in HREELS spectra further highlight subtle variations in the interaction between ethene and different catalyst surfaces, which may affect their catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上乙烯以η2 di-σ键形式是最稳定的吸附形态，表明这些催化剂倾向于特定的乙烯结合状态。在Pt2Sn表面合金上发现的π键乙烯，比其他表面上更丰富，表明不同催化剂类型之间存在变化。这些不同的结合状态可能影响脱氢反应的动力学和产物选择性。在HREELS光谱中损失峰能级位置的微小差异进一步表明，不同催化剂表面与乙烯之间的相互作用存在细微差别，这可能会影响它们的催化效率和选择性。
