The adsorption of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1) and Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloys shows that the most stable form is an η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene. This form is predominant on both surfaces. However, a minor amount of π-bonded ethene is also identified, which is more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy compared to the other surfaces. Moreover, the High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on Pt(1 1 1) and the PtSn surface alloys exhibit slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks.

在Pt(1 1 1)和Pt3Sn/Pt(1 1 1)以及Pt2Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上，乙烯吸附的最稳定形式是η2双σ键结构。这种形式在两种表面上都占主导地位。然而，在Pt2Sn表面合金上发现的少量π键乙烯比其他表面上更多。此外，高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上的乙烯光谱在损失峰的能量位置上有轻微差异。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the η2 di-σ-bonded conformation of ethene being the most stable adsorbed form on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, indicate that these catalysts favor a specific bonding state of ethene. The presence of π-bonded ethene, more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy, suggests variations in bonding states depending on the catalyst type. These differences in bonding states could influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. The slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks in HREELS spectra further highlight subtle variations in the interaction between ethene and different catalyst surfaces, which may affect their catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上乙烯以η2 di-σ键形式是最稳定的吸附形态，表明这些催化剂倾向于特定的乙烯结合状态。在Pt2Sn表面合金上发现的π键乙烯，比其他表面上更丰富，表明不同催化剂类型之间存在变化。这些不同的结合状态可能影响脱氢反应的动力学和产物选择性。在HREELS光谱中损失峰能级位置的微小差异进一步表明，不同催化剂表面与乙烯之间的相互作用存在细微差别，这可能会影响它们的催化效率和选择性。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as the adsorption of ethene, are influenced by factors including the chemical qualities of the surface (like bond types) and morphological characteristics. For instance, on Pt(1 1 1) and PtSn surface alloys, ethene predominantly forms a η2 di-σ-bonded conformation, which is more stable compared to a π-bonded conformation. The π-bonded ethene is found to be more abundant on the Pt2Sn surface alloy. Moreover, the High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra of ethene on these surfaces exhibit slight differences in the energetic positions of the loss peaks, indicating subtle variations in their adsorption characteristics.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如乙烷的吸附，受表面化学性质（如键类型）和形貌特征等因素的影响。例如，在Pt(1 1 1)和PtSn表面合金上，乙烷主要以η2 di-σ键的形式吸附，这比π键形式更稳定。在Pt2Sn表面合金上，π键形式的乙烷比其他表面上更为丰富。此外，乙烷在这些表面的高分辨率电子能量损失光谱(HREELS)谱图中，在损失峰的能量位置上有轻微的差异，表明它们的吸附特性存在细微的差别。
