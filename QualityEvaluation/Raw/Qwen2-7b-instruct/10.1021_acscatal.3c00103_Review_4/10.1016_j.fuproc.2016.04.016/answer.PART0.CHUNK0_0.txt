Answering the questions:

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Acid strength can affect the rate of hydrogen abstraction or deprotonation reactions, while stability ensures that the catalyst maintains its activity over multiple reaction cycles. Morphological features, like pore size and shape, dictate the accessibility of substrates to the active sites. To optimize these properties, strategies such as modifying the support material, adjusting the loading of the active metal, or incorporating promoters can be employed. For instance, using a zeolite support can enhance stability and control the size of the active sites, while modifying the metal's surface state through alloying or doping can improve reactivity.

2. Current industrial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are primarily platinum and chromium-based. Challenges include high cost, rapid deactivation due to coke formation, and limited selectivity towards higher alkenes. Platinum is selective due to its high CH rupture and low CC scission activity, while chromium oxide-based catalysts are superior for non-oxidative dehydrogenation due to their ability to activate CH bonds via hydrogen abstraction.

3. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation strategies include autothermal and oxidative approaches. Autothermal strategies aim to reduce external energy input by utilizing sacrificial fuels or selective hydrogen combustion, but face challenges in reactor design and process control. Oxidative dehydrogenation offers a simpler reactor design but lacks attractive performances for industrial applications.

4. Key findings on non-oxidative dehydrogenation using platinum and chromium oxide catalysts include the role of electronic promotion effects, the importance of coordination unsaturation in the catalyst surface, and the influence of surface oxygen species on CH activation. These insights guide the design of improved catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.

5. Zeolite-based catalysts contribute to understanding alkane dehydrogenation through their role in adsorption and dehydrogenation of propane. Zeolites with well-defined structures allow for detailed investigation of adsorption mechanisms and dehydrogenation pathways, informing the development of more efficient catalysts.

6. Challenges in autothermal alkane dehydrogenation include managing multiple catalyst beds, feeds, and process controls. Sacrificial fuel and selective hydrogen combustion protocols offer potential solutions by addressing energy input and enhancing selectivity.

7. Single and multi-catalyst systems for autothermal alkane dehydrogenation have different benefits and limitations. Single catalyst systems rely on a single phase, whereas multi-catalyst systems utilize distinct active phases or membranes for improved selectivity and efficiency.

8. Trends in oxidative dehydrogenation highlight the importance of catalyst design for achieving high propene yields and acceptable performance. Challenges include low propene selectivity and the need for catalysts that can efficiently balance energy input and output.

9. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence dehydrogenation performance. Strategies such as modifying the support material, adjusting the metal loading, or incorporating promoters can optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

回答问题：

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。酸强度可以影响氢提取或去质子反应的速度，而稳定性确保催化剂在多次反应周期中保持活性。形态特性，如孔径大小和形状，决定了底物对活性位点的可访问性。为了优化这些属性，可以通过修改支持材料、调整活性金属负载或引入促进剂等策略进行优化。例如，使用沸石作为支持材料可以增强稳定性并控制活性位点的尺寸，而通过合金化或掺杂改变金属表面状态可以提高反应性。

2. 当前的工业烷烃脱氢催化剂主要为铂和铬基催化剂。面临的挑战包括成本高、由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活以及对更高不饱和烃选择性的限制。铂因其高CH断裂和低CC断裂活性而具有选择性，而铬氧化物基催化剂由于能够通过氢抽象激活CH键而在非氧化脱氢方面表现出色。

3. 非氧化脱氢策略包括自热和氧化途径。自热策略旨在通过利用牺牲燃料或选择性氢燃烧来减少外部能量输入，但面临着设计复杂性和过程控制的挑战。氧化脱氢提供了一个更简单的反应器设计，但缺乏吸引工业应用的性能。

4. 关于使用铂和铬氧化物催化剂的非氧化脱氢的关键发现包括电子促进效应的作用、协调不饱和在催化剂表面的重要性以及表面氧物种对CH激活的影响。这些见解指导了设计具有增强活性和选择性的改进催化剂。
