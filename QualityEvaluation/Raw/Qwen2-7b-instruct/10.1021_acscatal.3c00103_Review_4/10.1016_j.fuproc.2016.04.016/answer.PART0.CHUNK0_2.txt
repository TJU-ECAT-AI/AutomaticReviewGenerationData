<p>Despite the high alkene selectivity attained in the designs of platinum-based catalysts, there are still unexplored areas with the potential to enhance catalyst activity. For example, using zeolites enhances stability of platinum nanoparticles and rational incorporation of a redox active adatom in a zeolite framework can be exploited to enhance the CH activation activity via the Lewis base-assisted deprotonation mechanism.</p>
<p>The autothermal dehydrogenation approach seeks to reduce the external energy input required for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over Pt-based catalysts. This approach is still at the concept stage and is less favored by industry due to the requirement for multiple catalyst beds, feeds and process controls that make the reactor design and process operations in this approach more demanding.</p>
<p>Among the catalysts explored, VOx-based catalysts are most promising for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 alkanes. The nature of the VOx phase is critical to the performance of VOx-based catalysts.</p>
<p>Analyses of NiOx (NiOLiCl/SZ); Li-doped MgO and halide-containing catalysts (MgDyLiCl, CeO2/2CeF3, etc.) suggest electrophilic and nucleophilic CH activation mechanisms.</p>
<p>CH activation is achieved at relatively milder conditions in these homogeneous catalyst systems. Insights from the homogeneous catalyst systems can provide new perspectives in the quest for efficient heterogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.</p>
