[1] "Recent access to measuring techniques covering the whole scale of diffusion phenomena relevant for heterogeneous catalysis demands reconsideration of the transport phenomena inherent to heterogeneous catalysis with respect to the options of their quantitation."
[2] "The PFG NMR method is presented as a particularly versatile technique, being able to reflect aspects of both microscopic and macroscopic observation."
[3] "In addition to the direct measurement of the coefficients of intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion, it is as well able to provide information about deviations from normal diffusion such as, e.g., in the case of single-file diffusion, and about the existence of transport barriers."
[4] "With diffusion studies of FCC catalysts an example of the practical application of PFG NMR, including its inherent limitations, is given."

Quantitation of diffusion in zeolite catalysts involves understanding the transport phenomena related to heterogeneous catalysis. Techniques like PFG NMR offer versatility by providing insights into both microscopic and macroscopic observations. They allow for the direct measurement of diffusion coefficients within crystals and particles, as well as revealing deviations from normal diffusion patterns, such as single-file diffusion, and the presence of transport barriers. Practical applications of these techniques, such as studying FCC catalysts, demonstrate their utility while acknowledging their inherent limitations.

对沸石催化剂中的扩散量化的量化涉及理解与异相催化相关的传质现象。像PFG NMR这样的技术因其能够反映从微观到宏观观察的各个方面而具有灵活性。它们允许直接测量晶体和颗粒内的扩散系数，并揭示偏离正常扩散模式的情况，如单行扩散，以及运输障碍的存在。这些技术在研究FCC催化剂等实际应用中展示了其优势，同时也认识到它们固有的局限性。
