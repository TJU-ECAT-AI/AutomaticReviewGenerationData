[1] "Recent access to measuring techniques covering the whole scale of diffusion phenomena relevant for heterogeneous catalysis demands reconsideration of the transport phenomena inherent to heterogeneous catalysis with respect to the options of their quantitation."
[2] "With respect to the relevant diffusion paths the measuring techniques may be classified as microscopic and macroscopic and with respect to the thermodynamic regime as equilibrium techniques and non-equilibrium techniques."
[3] "The PFG NMR method is presented as a particularly versatile technique, being able to reflect aspects of both microscopic and macroscopic observation."
[4] "In addition to the direct measurement of the coefficients of intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion, it is as well able to provide information about deviations from normal diffusion such as, e.g., in the case of single-file diffusion, and about the existence of transport barriers."
[5] "With diffusion studies of FCC catalysts an example of the practical application of PFG NMR, including its inherent limitations, is given."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties affect how effectively the catalyst can convert reactants into products under specific conditions. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, modification strategies can be employed. Such strategies might involve altering the catalyst's surface area, acidity, or pore structure. By doing so, one can improve the catalyst's ability to facilitate the desired reaction pathways while minimizing unwanted side reactions. The PFG NMR method provides insights into the diffusion processes within the catalyst, which are crucial for understanding and optimizing its performance. This method allows for the measurement of intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion coefficients, as well as the detection of deviations from normal diffusion, such as single-file diffusion and transport barriers. These findings can guide the development of more efficient catalysts through tailored modification strategies.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。这些性质影响催化剂在特定条件下如何有效地将反应物转化为产物。为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用修改策略。这些策略可能涉及改变催化剂的比表面积、酸度或孔结构。这样做可以改善催化剂促进所需反应路径的能力，同时减少不希望的副反应。PFG NMR方法为理解并优化催化剂性能提供了见解。这种方法允许测量晶体内部和粒子内部的扩散系数，并检测偏离正常扩散的情况，例如单文件扩散和传输障碍。这些发现可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，通过定制修改策略。
