[1] "Recent access to measuring techniques covering the whole scale of diffusion phenomena relevant for heterogeneous catalysis demands reconsideration of the transport phenomena inherent to heterogeneous catalysis with respect to the options of their quantitation."
[2] "With respect to the relevant diffusion paths the measuring techniques may be classified as microscopic and macroscopic and with respect to the thermodynamic regime as equilibrium techniques and non-equilibrium techniques."
[3] "The PFG NMR method is presented as a particularly versatile technique, being able to reflect aspects of both microscopic and macroscopic observation."
[4] "In addition to the direct measurement of the coefficients of intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion, it is as well able to provide information about deviations from normal diffusion such as, e.g., in the case of single-file diffusion, and about the existence of transport barriers."
[5] "With diffusion studies of FCC catalysts an example of the practical application of PFG NMR, including its inherent limitations, is given."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity by understanding how these properties affect the diffusion phenomena and transport barriers within the catalyst.

2. The PFG NMR method is a versatile technique that can provide insights into the diffusion processes within heterogeneous catalysts, covering both microscopic and macroscopic observations. It allows for the direct measurement of diffusion coefficients and provides information about deviations from normal diffusion, such as single-file diffusion, which can help in identifying transport barriers and optimizing catalyst design.
