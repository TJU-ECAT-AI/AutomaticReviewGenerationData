[1] "Recent access to measuring techniques covering the whole scale of diffusion phenomena relevant for heterogeneous catalysis demands reconsideration of the transport phenomena inherent to heterogeneous catalysis with respect to the options of their quantitation."
[2] "The PFG NMR method is presented as a particularly versatile technique, being able to reflect aspects of both microscopic and macroscopic observation."
[3] "In addition to the direct measurement of the coefficients of intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion, it is as well able to provide information about deviations from normal diffusion such as, e.g., in the case of single-file diffusion, and about the existence of transport barriers."
[4] "With diffusion studies of FCC catalysts an example of the practical application of PFG NMR, including its inherent limitations, is given."

Quantitative analysis of diffusion in zeolite catalysts involves considering various factors such as physicochemical properties, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics. These properties significantly influence the performance of catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. Techniques like PFG NMR, which can measure intracrystalline and intraparticle diffusion coefficients, provide insights into deviations from normal diffusion and transport barriers. This method, while useful, has inherent limitations in its practical application. The optimization of these properties can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity through tailored modification strategies.

量化表征在多相催化反应中扩散现象时，需要考虑催化剂的物理化学性质，包括酸强度和稳定性等化学特性以及形态特征。这些性质对脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有重大影响。如PFG NMR等技术能够直接测量晶内和粒子内部的扩散系数，并提供偏离正常扩散的现象和运输障碍的信息。这种方法在实际应用中虽然很有用，但也存在局限性。通过定制化的优化策略，可以增强催化剂的效率和选择性。
