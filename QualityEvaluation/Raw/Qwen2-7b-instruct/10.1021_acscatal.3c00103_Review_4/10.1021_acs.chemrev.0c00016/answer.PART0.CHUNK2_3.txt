[1] "Among these alkylations, the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, (162,574,576) toluene, (577) and mesitylene, (249,409,560,561,575,578) etc.) with benzyl alcohol (BA) or benzyl chloride (BC) in the liquid phase can produce diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are important intermediates widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and many other chemicals."
[2] "Christensen et al. (563) demonstrated that the mesoporous zeolite catalyst had higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher selectivity to ethylbenzene (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, although the conventional zeolite catalyst had almost twice as many acidic sites as the mesoporous zeolite catalyst. This activity difference can be attributed to improved mass transport in the mesoporous zeolite."
[3] "These reactions can be catalyzed by Lewis or Brnsted acids. Zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, (562,563) H-Beta, (564) HY, (565) and H-SAPO-5, (566) have been widely used in benzylation reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, in the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, mesoporous zeolites demonstrate higher benzene conversion and selectivity for ethylbenzene compared to conventional zeolites. This enhancement in activity is attributed to the improved mass transport within the mesoporous zeolite structure. Zeolites, known for their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high stability, are frequently used as catalysts in benzylation reactions due to these advantageous properties.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是酸强度和稳定性，在脱氢反应中对催化性能有着显著的影响。例如，在芳烃的苄基化反应中，介孔沸石的苯转化率和乙基苯选择性高于传统沸石。这种活性增强归因于介孔沸石结构中的改进质量传输。由于其强酸性、形状选择性和高热稳定性和化学稳定性，沸石经常被用作苄基化反应的催化剂，这些优势特性是其广泛应用的基础。
