[1] "For example, in the catalytic cracking process, the physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in the performance of the reaction."
[2] "The introduction of mesopores into zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transfer, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of the active sites, thus leading to an increased performance in certain applications."
[3] "To improve the properties of the hierarchically porous zeolite, the hierarchical pore systems should be highly interconnected, and the introduced meso- or preferably macropores should be accessible from the outer surface of the crystal."
[4] "In the postsynthetic approach, demetalation was known for about half a century. The important issue is that not all of the mesopores are open to the external surface of the zeolite crystals."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in catalytic cracking processes. 

2. Introducing mesopores into zeolites enhances mass transfer, shortens the diffusion path of reactants, and improves access to active sites, increasing the overall performance.

3. To optimize hierarchical zeolites, interconnected pore systems are crucial, and accessible meso- or macropores from the crystal's outer surface are preferred.

4. In postsynthetic demetalation, not all mesopores are open to the crystal's exterior, posing a significant issue.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括如酸强度和稳定性等化学特性以及形态特征，在催化裂解过程中对反应性能有着重要影响。

2. 在沸石中引入介孔可以显著加速物质传输，缩短反应物扩散路径，并提高活性位点的可接近性，从而增加特定应用中的性能。

3. 为了优化分级沸石，需要构建高度互联的孔系统，并且引入的介孔或优选的大孔应从晶体的外表面可及。

4. 在后合成去金属化方法中，所有介孔并非都开放到晶体的外部表面，这是一个主要问题。
