[1] "The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."
[2] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and their morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of meso- or macropores into zeolites enhances mass transport and reduces diffusion paths, improving reactant access and product escape, thus boosting reactant conversion and product selectivity. This results in an extended catalyst lifetime.
