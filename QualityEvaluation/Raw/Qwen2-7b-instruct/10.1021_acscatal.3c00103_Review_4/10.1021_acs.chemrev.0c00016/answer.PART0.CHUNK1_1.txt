[1] "The introduction of meso- or macropores into microporous zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of reactants to and the escape of products from the catalytic active sites in the catalytic reaction, leading to an increased reactant conversion/product selectivity and an extended lifetime of catalysts."
[2] "The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions."

1. The introduction of meso- or macropores into zeolites can enhance mass transport, reduce reactant diffusion paths, and improve accessibility to and product escape from catalytic sites, leading to higher reactant conversion and product selectivity, and longer catalyst life.
2. The chemical qualities of catalysts, such as acid strength and stability, along with their morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions.
