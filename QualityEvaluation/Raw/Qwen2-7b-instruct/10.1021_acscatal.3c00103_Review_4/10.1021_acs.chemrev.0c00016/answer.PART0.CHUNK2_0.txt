[1] "Compared with benzene, toluene has a larger molecular size of 0.54 nm. Its alkylation with benzyl alcohol over hierarchically mesoporous mordenites and microporous mordenites confirmed the superiority of the introduced mesopores."

[2] "The results indicated that the acid-washing after base treatment can significantly increase the external surface area of the samples, which resulted from the complete removal of the deposited aluminum species from the framework."

[3] "The external acid sites in mesoporous ZSM-5 were more accessible for the guest molecules, leading to a nearly 5-fold increased catalytic activity than that of microporous ZSM-5 in the aromatic benzylation."

[4] "The size of mordenite nanorods decreased as the organic function degree increased, leading to samples with a higher mesoporous volume (0.15 cm3 g1) and larger external surface area (148 m2 g1)."

[5] "These spontaneously stacked nanocrystals had a large accessible surface area, and therefore, 67% of the Brnsted acid sites were accessible to bulky molecules."

[6] "Traditional Beta with Si/Al of 20 (T-Beta-20) and conventional Beta with Si/Al of 20 (C-Beta-20) gave 20% and 30% yield of p-MAP in 30 min, respectively."

[7] "The highly improved catalytic performance of hierarchical Beta zeolite (N-Beta) was due to eliminated diffusion constraints contributed by the intercrystalline mesopores."

[8] "The microporous Beta zeolite gave a benzene conversion of less than 20 wt % and deactivated rapidly after about a 10 h reaction."

[9] "The benzene conversion remained as high as 80 wt % even after 50 h."

[10] "The high catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of hierarchical porosity for increasing the diffusion rate of the reactants (cyclohexanone oxime) and products (ε-caprolactam) in Beckmann rearrangement."

[11] "The large external surface areas of hierarchically mesoporous MFI zeolites enabled the large loading amounts of Co NPs and improved their accessibility to reactants, thus leading to high catalytic activity in the FTS process."

[12] "The mesoporous H-USY zeolites used as supporting materials for Co NPs can improve catalytic activity."

[13] "The Co-supported mesoporous Y zeolites exhibited an improved catalytic conversion as compared to Co-supported microporous Y zeolites."

[14] "The Co/MCM-41 had a narrow distribution of pores in the mesopore range."

[15] "The Co/NS-zeolites achieved much higher CO conversion rates as compared with the Co/MCM with the same Co loading."

[16] "Introducing mesopores into the zeolites or reducing the zeolite crystalline size can efficiently overcome the diffusion limitations and significantly accelerate the mass transfer to and away from the catalytic centers."
