Compared to zeolite ZSM-5, SAPO-34 with a larger pore cavity (9.4 Å in diameter) and a smaller eight-membered-ring micropore (3.8 Å × 3.8 Å) exhibited a much higher catalytic performance in the MTO reaction (100 wt % methanol conversion and over 90% selectivity to C2C4 light olefins) due to its unique CHA framework. (830834)

However, it usually suffers from a slow mass transport to and away from the catalytic centers, thus increasing the possibility of secondary reactions and finally leading to coke formation. The coke deposition covered the active sites of the catalysts, (835) resulting in a short catalytic lifetime and low selectivity of light olefins during the MTO reactions. (836838)

Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the diffusion performances in the SAPO-34 catalyst. Previous studies reported that the SAPO-34 zeolites with small crystallite size exhibited great advantages in decreasing the coke formation rate and accelerating the mass transfer performance. (839842) In particular, for nanosized SAPO-34s, they exhibited an improved methanol conversion efficiency and prolonged catalyst lifetime in the MTO conversion. (843846) The shortened diffusion path in zeolite nanocrystals reduced the coke formation and thus contributed to their extended catalyst life. (847)

Hierarchically porous SAPO-34 was prepared as cubic aggregates of intergrown nanocrystals using an organosilane surfactant [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TPOAC) as the mesopore template through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis (Figure 43D). (849) The as-synthesized hierarchically porous SAPO-34 had a 4 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and more than 10% improvement of light olefin (C2H4 + C3H6) selectivity in MTO conversion than microporous zeolite SAPO-34 (Figure 43E). (849)

Another hierarchically ordered mesoporous zeolite SAPO-34 (3DOm-i SAPO-34) was hydrothermally prepared within confined ordered mesoporous carbons. (851) The synthesized 3DOm-i SAPO-34 showed an ordered mesoporous-imprinted structure consisting of spherical zeolite nanocrystals and exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime and higher selectivity toward light olefins than conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34 in the MTO reaction. (851)

The introduction of mesopores and/or macropores into the microporous SAPO-34 zeolite can also significantly accelerate the molecular transfer, reduce the coke formation, and therefore extend the catalyst lifetime. (648) Many hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared using synthesis methods described in section 2. (236,849) 

Liu et al. (649) developed a novel tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching post-treatment method to obtain hierarchically porous SAPO-34 under mild conditions. The resultant SAPO-34 was constructed by the original micropores, mesopore (3.5 nm), and macropore (100 nm). The single-run lifetime of the hierarchical zeolites in MTO increased without sacrificing the excellent methanol conversion and light olefin selectivity. 

Chen et al. (650) applied the fluoride post-treatment route to obtain hierarchical SAPO-34 crystals. The treatment of SAPO-34 zeolites with a fluoride solution resulted in a preferential dissolution of the high-defect and Si-rich interface between crystalline domains. The newly formed mesopores were parallel to the zeolite crystalline faces. The intersecting mesopores separated crystalline domains, thus providing improved access to all the microporosity. The resultant hierarchical zeolites exhibited an improved light olefin selectivity in the MTO reaction.

Sun et al. (857) synthesized the trilevel hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolite with an intracrystalline micro-meso-macropore structure for the first time. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibited a superior catalytic performance in the MTO reaction with about a 6 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and nearly 5% improvement in selectivity toward ethylene and propylene compared with the conventional microporous SAPO-34.

In addition to SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 catalysts, other zeolites like SSZ-13, (859) ZSM-22, (654) ZSM-58, (655) SAPO-5, (654) SAPO-11, (653,656) SAPO-18, (656) and SAPO-35 (653) were also reported in the MTO process. Based on its unique crystalline structure, zeolite ZSM-58 exhibits a strong shape selectivity when compared with SAPO-34. The micropores of ZSM-58 have narrow entrances in the range of 0.45 nm × 0.36 nm, providing the desired shape selectivity toward short-chained olefins in the MTO reaction.

Milina and co-workers (855,856) further established the relationship between the mesopore quality (i.e., the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals) and the catalyst lifetime in the MTO reaction. They found that the extended lifetime resulted from the presence of open mesopores with a well-connected intracrystalline hierarchical pore network rather than constricted mesopores with poor connectivity. The global connectivity of the intracrystalline pore network, therefore, is a decisive factor in extending the lifetime of the zeolite catalysts in the MTO reaction.

For a certain cracking reaction, both the catalytic conversion and the product selectivity are improved after the introduction of a hierarchically porous structure into the zeolite catalysts. This also applies to the steam cracking process of hydrocarbons with light olefins (ethylene and propylene) as main products. Light olefins are basic raw materials for polyethylene, polypropylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide, ethylbenzene, and other chemicals. (684) The higher selectivity to light olefins in the cracking reactions depends on the reduced reaction path, shortened residence time, and increased accessibility of the catalyst sites. (917)

Various zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and MCM-22 are used as catalysts in naphtha cracking to produce ethylene and propylene. Among them, ZSM-5 is considered to be the best material owing to its unique shape selectivity that influences the preferential formation of light olefins. Naphtha consists of different hydrocarbons such as linear alkanes, naphthenes, isoparaffins, olefins, and aromatics. (918) These bulky hydrocarbons suffer from severe diffusion limitations. The restricted access to the active sites reduces the catalytic effectiveness while the slow mass transport extends the residence time of products in the zeolite micropores, leading to increased coke deposition and decreased catalytic activity and selectivity toward light olefins. (919)

To improve the catalytic performance of the conventional zeolites, mesopores were introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite by desilication treatment with NaOH. (320) The resultant catalysts displayed an increased α-pinene conversion from 11 to about 27 wt % when compared with conventional ones. (944) Similarly, a lower amount of deposited coke over hierarchical USY, ZSM-5, and Beta zeolites was also reported in the isomerization of α-pinene. (709,710,945)

The introduction of mesopores into zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transfer, inhibit the coke deposition, and extend the catalyst lifetime. (90) This further indicated that the introduction of mesopores in zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transfer, inhibit the coke deposition, and extend the catalyst lifetime. (90)

The synthesis and modification of zeolite-based adsorbents have received considerable attention in adsorptive desulfurization. Zeolites showed a high sulfur loading capacity, easy regenerability, and a stable crystalline structure for adsorptive removal of sulfur compounds. It is highly advantageous in the removal of small molecules in various adsorption applications. However, their relatively small micropores restrict the transfer of the bulky aromatic refractory sulfur compounds, such as DBTPs and other alkyl-branched dibenzothiophenes. Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization.

Hierarchically porous zeolites have attracted continuously increasing interests. Different applications of hierarchically porous zeolites are systematically introduced. Hierarchically porous zeolites are widely used in catalysis, environmental, and biological fields due to their large surface area, shortened mass diffusion path, improved mass transport, and increased accessibility for reactants.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions by affecting the rate of reactant adsorption and desorption, the accessibility of active sites, and the prevention of unwanted side reactions. Chemical qualities determine the strength and selectivity of the catalytic activity, while morphological characteristics affect the diffusion and transport of reactants and products. Strategies to optimize these properties often involve modifying the catalyst's surface area, pore size, and pore structure. For instance, the introduction of mesopores can enhance mass transport and reduce coke formation, thereby improving catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. Support modification strategies that aim to optimize physicochemical properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions typically involve:
   - Modifying the acid strength and stability of the catalyst to match the reaction requirements. For example, adjusting the pH, adding promoters, or changing the support material can alter the acidity of the catalyst, affecting its catalytic activity.
   - Adjusting the pore size and pore structure to optimize the diffusion paths of reactants and products. This can be achieved through templating, demetallation, or dealumination methods to introduce mesopores or macropores.
   - Enhancing the surface area through techniques like milling, grinding, or the use of nanocrystals to increase the contact area between the catalyst and reactants.
   - Incorporating functional groups or additives to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity. This can include surface modifications, doping with metals, or the use of bifunctional catalysts.

These strategies can be tailored to the specific dehydrogenation reaction, the feedstock composition, and the desired product profile to achieve optimal catalytic performance.
