[1] "In dehydrogenation reactions, the physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance."
[2] "For instance, the acidity of a catalyst determines its ability to facilitate dehydrogenation reactions, while stability ensures consistent performance over multiple cycles."
[3] "To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies can be employed."
[4] "These strategies aim to tailor the surface chemistry and pore structure of the support material to complement the catalyst, thereby enhancing its activity and selectivity."

Dehydrogenation reactions' performance is influenced by catalysts' physicochemical properties, specifically their chemical qualities like acidity and stability, and morphological characteristics. Optimization of these properties for improved efficiency and selectivity can be achieved through support modification strategies. These strategies aim to adjust the surface chemistry and pore structure of the support material to enhance the catalyst's performance.
