To optimize the physicochemical properties of catalysts for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions, various support modification strategies can be employed. These strategies aim to improve the chemical qualities of the catalysts, such as acid strength and stability, and to enhance the morphological characteristics that facilitate better reactivity and selectivity. For instance, the addition of promoters or modifiers can alter the acid properties of the support, while changes in the support's structure, such as porosity and surface area, can influence the catalyst's reactivity and selectivity in dehydrogenation processes.
