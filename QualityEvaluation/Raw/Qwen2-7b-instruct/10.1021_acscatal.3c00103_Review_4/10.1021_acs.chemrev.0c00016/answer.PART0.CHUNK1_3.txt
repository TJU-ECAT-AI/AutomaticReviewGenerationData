1. Hierarchically porous zeolite composites can be prepared through in situ crystallization of mesoporous molecular sieves, like MCM-41, in the presence of appropriate microporous structure-directing agents.

2. Hierarchically structured zeolite composites can also be synthesized through ex situ crystallization by first impregnating mesoporous silicas (SBA-15) or mesoporous cellular foams (MCFs) with zeolite seeds followed by hydrothermal treatment.

3. A complete crystallization process transforms ordered mesoporous materials into a purely crystalline zeolite phase.

4. Most postsynthetic methods, including steaming, acid or alkaline leaching, have been widely used for synthesizing hierarchically porous zeolites due to their simplicity, scalability, and low cost.

1. 通过就地结晶介孔分子筛（如MCM-41）以及适当的微孔结构导向剂，可以制备具有分级孔隙结构的择形分子复合材料。

2. 通过将择形种子浸渍在介孔硅（SBA-15）或介孔细胞泡沫（MCF）中，然后进行水热处理，可以合成具有分级结构的择形分子复合材料。

3. 完全结晶过程将有序介孔材料转化为纯结晶择形分子。

4. 大多数后合成方法，包括蒸煮、酸或碱性浸出，由于其简单性、可扩展性和低成本，广泛用于合成分级孔隙择形分子。
