[1] "The introduction of additional pores into the microporous SAPO-34 zeolite can also significantly accelerate the molecular transfer, reduce the coke formation, and therefore extend the catalyst lifetime."

[2] "The shortened diffusion path in zeolite nanocrystals reduced the coke formation and thus contributed to their extended catalyst life."

[3] "The as-synthesized hierarchically porous SAPO-34 had a 4 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and more than 10% improvement of light olefin (C2H4 + C3H6) selectivity in MTO conversion than microporous zeolite SAPO-34."

[4] "In conclusion, an ideal catalyst with the stable and high methanol conversion and product selectivity is mostly desired in the zeolite-catalyzed methanol transformation process."

[5] "However, the slow transportation of the reactants and products in the relatively small micropores of conventional zeolite is the main causes for the short catalyst life."

[6] "The improved catalytic performance in the reactions involving large molecules was attributed to the improved accessibility to the active sites."

[7] "The presence of small intracrystalline mesopores could result in a reduced lifetime and decreased catalytic activity (H-Z5-2 < H-Z5-1 < HZ5-4 < H-Z5-3)."

[8] "The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment."

[9] "The materials exhibited a superior catalytic performance and extraordinary long catalyst lifetime in toluene combustion when compared with Pt-loaded microporous zeolites."

[10] "Such a strategy is quite simple and versatile and has been extended to the synthesis of other zeolitic materials, including TS-1 and SAPO-34."
