[1] "The liquid-phase catalytic conversion of bulky molecules mainly takes place on the external surface of microporous zeolites and is an important probe reaction to evaluate the structural advantages of hierarchical zeolites."
[2] "Among these alkylations, the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, (162,574,576) toluene, (577) and mesitylene, (249,409,560,561,575,578) etc.) with benzyl alcohol (BA) or benzyl chloride (BC) in the liquid phase can produce diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are important intermediates widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and many other chemicals."
[3] "Christensen et al. (563) demonstrated that the mesoporous zeolite catalyst had higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher selectivity to ethylbenzene (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, although the conventional zeolite catalyst had almost twice as many acidic sites as the mesoporous zeolite catalyst. This activity difference can be attributed to improved mass transport in the mesoporous zeolite."

1. The catalytic conversion of bulky molecules often occurs on the external surface of microporous zeolites, serving as a key indicator of the structural benefits of hierarchical zeolites. 
2. Benzylation reactions, particularly those using benzyl alcohol or benzyl chloride, are crucial in the production of valuable aromatic compounds like diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are extensively used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and other industries.  
3. Mesoporous zeolite catalysts exhibit enhanced benzene conversion and ethylbenzene selectivity compared to conventional zeolites due to superior mass transport properties within the mesoporous structure.

1. 大分子的催化转化通常发生在微孔沸石的外部表面，这成为评估分级沸石结构优势的关键指标。
2. 特别是使用苯甲醇或苯基氯化物进行的烷基化反应，在制药、石油化学和其它行业中广泛用于生产如二苯基甲烷和取代二苯基甲烷等有价值的芳香化合物。
3. 界面沸石催化剂在苯和乙基苯的转化率以及选择性上比常规沸石催化剂更优，这是由于界面沸石中更好的质量传输特性。
