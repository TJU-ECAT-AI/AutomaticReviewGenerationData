[1] "The liquid-phase catalytic conversion of bulky molecules mainly takes place on the external surface of microporous zeolites and is an important probe reaction to evaluate the structural advantages of hierarchical zeolites."
[2] "Among these alkylations, the benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, (162,574,576) toluene, (577) and mesitylene, (249,409,560,561,575,578) etc.) with benzyl alcohol (BA) or benzyl chloride (BC) in the liquid phase can produce diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are important intermediates widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and many other chemicals."
[3] "These reactions can be catalyzed by Lewis or Brnsted acids. Zeolites, such as H-ZSM-5, (562,563) H-Beta, (564) HY, (565) and H-SAPO-5, (566) have been widely used in benzylation reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability."
[4] "Christensen et al. (563) demonstrated that the mesoporous zeolite catalyst had higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher selectivity to ethylbenzene (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, although the conventional zeolite catalyst had almost twice as many acidic sites as the mesoporous zeolite catalyst."

1. The conversion of bulky molecules predominantly occurs on the external surface of microporous zeolites and serves as a key test for assessing the structural benefits of hierarchical zeolites.
2. The benzylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with benzyl alcohol or benzyl chloride in the liquid phase forms diphenylmethane and substituted diphenylmethanes, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, fine chemicals, dyes, and other chemicals.
3. Zeolites like H-ZSM-5, H-Beta, HY, and H-SAPO-5 are frequently used in benzylation reactions due to their strong acidity, shape selectivity, and high hydrothermal/chemical stability.
4. Mesoporous zeolite catalysts exhibit higher benzene conversion (18% vs 15%) and higher ethylbenzene selectivity (83% vs 74%) than conventional zeolites in the catalytic alkylation of benzene with ethene, despite having fewer acidic sites.

1. 大分子的液相催化转化主要发生在微孔沸石的表面，并且是评估分级沸石结构优势的重要探针反应。
2. 苯、甲苯和间二甲苯等芳香烃与苯基醇或苯基氯化物在液相中的烷基化反应，可以生成二苯甲烷及其衍生物，这些化合物广泛用于制药、石油化工、精细化学品、染料和其他化学领域。
3. H-ZSM-5、H-Beta、HY、H-SAPO-5等沸石由于其强酸性、形状选择性和高热稳定性和化学稳定性，经常用于烷基化反应。
4. 在乙苯烷基化反应中，介孔沸石催化剂的苯转化率（18% vs 15%）和异丙苯选择性（83% vs 74%）高于传统沸石催化剂，尽管后者具有更多的酸性中心。
