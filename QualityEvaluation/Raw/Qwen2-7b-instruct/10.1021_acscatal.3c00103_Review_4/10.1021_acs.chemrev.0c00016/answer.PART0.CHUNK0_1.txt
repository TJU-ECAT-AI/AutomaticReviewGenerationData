[1] "Hierarchical zeolites combining the intrinsic microporosity from the zeolitic framework and the introduced inter- or intracrystalline meso- or macropore system, showing great potential in a wide range of catalytic reactions, such as alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion."
[2] "In addition to the above-mentioned excellent catalytic properties, hierarchically porous zeolites also show exceptional sorption characteristics useful for the environmental benefits (wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds) together with carrier qualities that enable them to be desirable hosts in biological applications."

Hierarchically porous zeolites possess outstanding catalytic properties, including use in alkylation, acylation, rearrangement, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydroconversion, oxidation, methanol conversions, cracking, and biomass conversion. They also demonstrate exceptional sorption capabilities for environmental benefits like wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds. These zeolites are valuable in biological applications as carriers due to their unique structural features.
