[1] "In the past decade, many different strategies to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites with both an abundant secondary porosity and full interconnected mesopores or macropores have been developed."
[2] "These materials are the most desirable catalysts and sorbents for industry and become a highly evolving field of important current interests."
[3] "Notably, the intracrystalline molecular mobility in the zeolites is the determining factor of the overall reaction rate and separation efficiency."
[4] "One fundamental approach to minimize the diffusion limitation is to shorten the diffusion path length, which can be realized by developing hierarchically porous materials that integrate porosities of multiple levels in a single solid body."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The intracrystalline molecular mobility in zeolites determines the overall reaction rate and separation efficiency. To enhance this mobility and minimize diffusion limitations, developing hierarchically porous materials with integrated porosities of multiple levels is crucial. These materials offer shorter diffusion paths and improved mass transfer, which can lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
