[1] "The introduction of a hierarchical structure into zeolites can greatly improve the catalytic conversion."
[2] "The catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites."
[3] "The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites."
[4] "The catalytic lifetime can be significantly extended after the introduction of mesopores into the ZSM-5 zeolites."
[5] "Hierarchically porous materials with a quantitative hierarchy in terms of amount, location, shape, size, and dimension at every micro-meso-macrometer length scale for optimized structural features and outstanding performance can emerge."

1. The hierarchical structure of zeolites significantly enhances their catalytic conversion capabilities. 

2. The catalytic efficiency and selectivity of zeolites for cracking reactions are highly dependent on the accessibility of the active sites, which is influenced by both pore size and connectivity.

3. The addition of mesoporosity in zeolites enables larger molecules to enter the micropores, enhancing access to the active sites and improving catalytic performance.

4. The incorporation of mesopores into zeolites like ZSM-5 notably increases their catalytic lifetime.

5. Bioinspired hierarchically porous materials with precisely controlled micro-meso-macroporosity can be synthesized for optimized structural features and exceptional performance.
