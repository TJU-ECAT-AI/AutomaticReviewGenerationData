Compared to zeolite ZSM-5, SAPO-34 with a larger pore cavity (9.4 Å in diameter) and a smaller eight-membered-ring micropore (3.8 Å × 3.8 Å) exhibited a much higher catalytic performance in the MTO reaction (100 wt % methanol conversion and over 90% selectivity to C2C4 light olefins) due to its unique CHA framework. (830834) However, it usually suffers from a slow mass transport to and away from the catalytic centers, thus increasing the possibility of secondary reactions and finally leading to coke formation. The coke deposition covered the active sites of the catalysts, (835) resulting in a short catalytic lifetime and low selectivity of light olefins during the MTO reactions. (836838) Considerable efforts have been made to optimize the diffusion performances in the SAPO-34 catalyst. Previous studies reported that the SAPO-34 zeolites with small crystallite size exhibited great advantages in decreasing the coke formation rate and accelerating the mass transfer performance. (839842) In particular, for nanosized SAPO-34s, they exhibited an improved methanol conversion efficiency and prolonged catalyst lifetime in the MTO conversion. (843846) The shortened diffusion path in zeolite nanocrystals reduced the coke formation and thus contributed to their extended catalyst life. (847) Hierarchically porous SAPO-34 was prepared as cubic aggregates of intergrown nanocrystals using an organosilane surfactant [3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-octadecyldimethylammonium chloride (TPOAC) as the mesopore template through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis (Figure 43D). (849) The as-synthesized hierarchically porous SAPO-34 had a 4 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and more than 10% improvement of light olefin (C2H4 + C3H6) selectivity in MTO conversion than microporous zeolite SAPO-34 (Figure 43E). (849) Another hierarchically ordered mesoporous zeolite SAPO-34 (3DOm-i SAPO-34) was hydrothermally prepared within confined ordered mesoporous carbons. (851) The synthesized 3DOm-i SAPO-34 showed an ordered mesoporous-imprinted structure consisting of spherical zeolite nanocrystals and exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime and higher selectivity toward light olefins than conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34 in the MTO reaction. (851) The introduction of mesopores and/or macropores into the microporous SAPO-34 zeolite can also significantly accelerate the molecular transfer, reduce the coke formation, and therefore extend the catalyst lifetime. (648) Many hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 zeolites were prepared using synthesis methods described in section 2. (236,849) For example, hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolites with a hollow structure were synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide as the only template through a one-step nanoseed-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. (554) The as-synthesized SAPO-34 zeolites exhibited remarkably enhanced catalytic activity in the MTO reaction with about a 4-fold extended catalyst lifetime and more than 10% increase of the selectivity for C2H4 and C3H6 as compared to conventional microsized microporous SAPO-34 zeolites. By using a similar method, they further synthesized a series of zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals in an Al2O3/H3PO4/SiO2/triethylamine (TEA)/H2O system. (647) The hierarchical SH-0.3 zeolite nanocrystals (TEA/Al2O3 = 3.0) showed the highest crystallinity, abundant intracrystalline meso-macropores, and optimized acidity, exhibiting the highest selectivity toward ethylene and propylene (85.4%). Besides, hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous SAPO-34 monoliths were synthesized by the dry-gel conversion of the amorphous silicoaluminophosphate monolith. (236) The as-synthesized hierarchical SAPO-34 had a macroporous framework constructed by interconnected and aggregated zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals and a mesoporous structure formed by the closely stacked zeolite SAPO-34 nanocrystals. Hierarchically structured zeolite SAPO-34 possessed a much higher catalytic activity in MTO reactions than that of conventional microporous zeolite SAPO-34. (236) However, it is difficult to use traditional acidic or alkali treatment to synthesize hierarchically porous SAPO zeolites due to their unstable frameworks. (858) Liu et al. (649) developed a novel tetraethylammonium hydroxide etching post-treatment method to obtain hierarchically porous SAPO-34 under mild conditions. The resultant SAPO-34 was constructed by the original micropores, mesopore (3.5 nm), and macropore (100 nm). The single-run lifetime of the hierarchical zeolites in MTO increased without sacrificing the excellent methanol conversion and light olefin selectivity. Chen et al. (650) applied the fluoride post-treatment route to obtain hierarchical SAPO-34 crystals. The treatment of SAPO-34 zeolites with a fluoride solution resulted in a preferential dissolution of the high-defect and Si-rich interface between crystalline domains. The newly formed mesopores were parallel to the zeolite crystalline faces. The intersecting mesopores separated crystalline domains, thus providing improved access to all the microporosity. The resultant hierarchical zeolites exhibited an improved light olefin selectivity in the MTO reaction. Besides, the fluoride etching method can be expanded to obtain other hierarchal SAPO-34 catalysts with improved MTO performances. (651,652) A better understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical pore structure in ZSM-5 zeolites and their catalytic performance in the MTO reaction is crucial to design optimal catalysts. Kim et al. (644) carefully investigated the effects of mesoporosity on catalyst activity of the MTH reaction using a series of MFI zeolites with various mesoporosities. The reason for catalyst longevity was the improved diffusion of coke precursors from the micropores to the external surfaces owing to the short pathways provided by the introduced mesopores. They also monitored the quantity and the location of coke in the catalyst and found that in mesoporous zeolites the coke formed mainly on the mesopore walls while in microporous zeolites the coke mostly deposited inside the micropores. Internal coke deposition caused serious deactivation of the catalyst because it covered the acidic sites and blocked the micropores even at a low coking level. However, external cokes caused little hindrance to the diffusion performances unless it covered the entire external surface of the catalyst. Meng et al. (645) used cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA) as the sole organic template to synthesize hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite in a one-step approach. The introduction of additional mesoporosity decreased the intracrystalline residence time of the intermediates and extended the catalyst lifetime. The desilication was also applied by Bleken et al. to prepare mesoporous H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. (646) The catalysts showed an improved lifetime and resistance toward deactivation in the MTO reaction.
The interconnectivity between the additional pores and the micropores in the hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolites determines their final catalytic performances. Schmidt et al. (34) introduced transport pores into SAPO-34 using carbon nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes as secondary templates as described in section 2. The carbon nanotube-templated materials (M/T-3) contained mesopores accessible from the outside of the particle. However, for the mesopores created by carbon nanoparticles (M/T-2), they were located inside the particle and did not form a three-dimensional interconnected mesopore network. The methanol conversion of the parent (M/T-1) and the M/T-2 decreased after 120 min drastically until there was no further conversion. The M/T-3 showed a full conversion of methanol and dimethyl ether for almost 300 min time on stream. Similarly, enhanced catalytic performances were also found for hierarchically porous SAPO-34 catalysts with open mesopores. (852854) Milina and co-workers (855,856) further established the relationship between the mesopore quality (i.e., the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals) and the catalyst lifetime in the MTO reaction. They found that the extended lifetime resulted from the presence of open mesopores with a well-connected intracrystalline hierarchical pore network rather than constricted mesopores with poor connectivity. The global connectivity of the intracrystalline pore network, therefore, is a decisive factor in extending the lifetime of the zeolite catalysts in the MTO reaction. Their findings emphasized the need to appropriately tailor the hierarchically porous structure for the optimal catalytic advantage. Sun et al. (857) synthesized the trilevel hierarchically porous SAPO-34 zeolite with an intracrystalline micro-meso-macropore structure for the first time. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibited a superior catalytic performance in the MTO reaction with about a 6 times prolonged catalyst lifetime and nearly 5% improvement in selectivity toward ethylene and propylene compared with the conventional microporous SAPO-34.
In addition to SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 catalysts, other zeolites like SSZ-13, (859) ZSM-22, (654) ZSM-58, (655) SAPO-5, (654) SAPO-11, (653,656) SAPO-18, (656) and SAPO-35 (653) were also reported in the MTO process. Based on its unique crystalline structure, zeolite ZSM-58 exhibits a strong shape selectivity when compared with SAPO-34. The micropores of ZSM-58 have narrow entrances in the range of 0.45 nm × 0.36 nm, providing the desired shape selectivity toward short-chained olefins in the MTO reaction. However, the increase in the diffusion properties of reactants and products is desirable. Selzer et al. (860) synthesized hierarchical ZSM-58 zeolite via postsynthetic desilication by sodium hydroxide and using TEA+ ions as a pore growth moderator. The introduced intracrystalline mesopores exhibited a size of 325 nm. By increasing the concentration of sodium hydroxide, the mesopore volume increased up to 0.50 cm3 g1. The desilicated ZSM-58 showed an extended catalytic lifetime and improved product yields in the MTO reaction as compared to conventional microporous ZSM-58. Ahmed et al. (861) adopted multistep sequential alkaline and acid treatments to develop a more mesoporous surface area and to offer more active sites on EU-1 zeolite. The multistep sequential treatment was successful in creating more mesopores as compared with the single-step treatment. The selectivity of propylene in the MTO process was increased from 0%, in the case of parent EU-1, to 50% together with an enhanced catalyst stability and extended lifetime.
4.1.6.3. Methanol to Propylene Process
Propylene is an important basic chemical for the production of polymer and chemical intermediates, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, oxo alcohols, and cumene. (862) Naphtha thermal cracking and petroleum refining in fluid catalytic cracking units are two major commercial methods for the propylene production, and both are dependent on crude oil resources. (863) Due to the increasing demand for propylene and rapid depletion of oil resources, new processes with high propylene yield are needed. (864) The methanol to propylene (MTP) process is a promising alternative approach for the production of propylene. (865) Thus, it is highly desirable to develop catalysts that can efficiently produce propylene.
To develop an ideal catalyst for the MTP reaction, stable and high methanol conversion and propylene selectivity are crucial. (866) ZSM-5 zeolites usually exhibit low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation. (867) Numerous studies were undertaken to further improve the propylene selectivity and catalyst lifetime compared to the ZSM-5 catalyst for the MTP reaction. (657,658,661,868) Rownaghi et al. (657) reported that the zeolite nanocrystals exhibited a higher catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity toward propylene compared with micronized zeolites due to their rapid mass transfer which accelerated the overall reaction rates, indicating that diffusion limitations are important parameters. (658) Moreover, hierarchically meso-macroporous zeolite nanocrystals were prepared in a quasi-solid-state system based on the passivation concept of the strong self-condensation of the short-chain organosilane 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane (APTES) on the surfaces of nanocrystals. (661) APTES directed the generation of zeolite nanocrystals and guaranteed the in situ assembly of these nanocrystals into a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure. The resultant catalysts exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime, which was almost 8 times longer than that of the purely microporous ZSM-5. They also exhibited a higher propylene selectivity (41.89%). The improved adsorption capacity was due to the abundant mesopores and macropores in the catalysts, providing a shortened diffusion path length and increased accessibility of reactants to active sites for catalytic reactions.
ZSM-5 with a high mesoporosity had a high propylene selectivity and a long catalyst lifetime during the MTP reaction due to its improved diffusion performance and increased tolerance toward greater coke formation. (109,870874) This further indicated that the introduction of mesopores in zeolites can significantly accelerate the mass transfer, inhibit the coke deposition, and extend the catalyst lifetime. (90) To gain a better insight into the influence of the pore connectivity of zeolites in the MTP reaction, Mei et al. (660) prepared hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolites with open and closed mesopores by desilication and templating with starch, respectively. The introduction of open mesopores in ZSM-5 enabled the catalysts to exhibit a high propylene selectivity (42.2%) and propylene/ethylene (P/E) ratio (10:1). However, for the closed mesopores that are randomly located inside the zeolite crystals, the amelioration in propylene selectivity and P/E ratio of the catalyst is not easily noticeable. The results demonstrated that the creation of additional open mesoporosity in ZSM-5 zeolite is a crucial factor in the preparation of optimal catalysts for the MTP reaction.
In theory, a maximized molecular diffusion would be achieved if the size of the zeolite crystal is reduced to the single unit cell dimension. (157) Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with a high-silica MFI nanosheet with an only 2 nm thickness was successfully synthesized by using a special bifunctional organic surfactant. (659) This catalyst was an efficient catalyst with high propylene selectivity (51.0%), high propylene/ethylene (P/E) ratio (12.1), and long catalyst lifetime in the MTP reaction because of its excellent diffusivity. (659) Such excellent catalytic performances were attributed to the relatively large accessible surface area, short diffusion path length, and high mesoporosity in the hierarchical zeolite made of the ultrathin nanosheets that enabled it to accommodate more coke deposition, which also contributed to the improvement in catalyst lifetime. Thus, the reaction products could easily escape from the zeolite micropores, and the secondary reactions, such as aromatization and hydrogen transfer, were effectively prevented, leading to a low deactivation rate. Besides, the relatively large accessible surface area and high mesoporosity in the zeolite nanosheets helped to accommodate more coke deposition, which also contributed to the increase in the catalyst lifetime.
4.1.6.4. Methanol to Aromatics Process
Aromatics are some of the most important fundamental raw materials in the polymer and organic industry. (875) BTX-benzene (B), toluene (T), and xylenes (X) are the most widely used aromatic hydrocarbons. The demand for aromatics is rapidly increasing worldwide. (876) The actual commercial processes for aromatic hydrocarbon production are mainly based on petrochemical processes, such as catalytic reforming or cracking gasoline hydrogenation using crude oil. (877) As a promising alternative, the methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) process on microporous solid acid catalysts is an important nonpetroleum route to obtain valuable chemicals and attracted great interest. (878) The first efficient catalyst Mo-ZSM-5 for the MTA reaction was reported in 1993. (879) Since then, this reaction has been studied by many groups. Aromatization of methanol over ZSM-5 could be promoted by the interactiondehydrogenation of surface metal oxides, (880) such as ZnO, (881) Ga2O3, (882) and SnO2. (883) The performance of the catalyst in the MTA process is greatly influenced by many conditions such as the acidic strength, (884) the pore architecture, (885,886) the crystal size, (887,888) and the morphology. (889) Therefore, the preparation of suitable catalysts which exhibit high diffusion and suitable acidity is important for the MTA reaction. An effective method to reduce the diffusion limitation is introducing additional pores into zeolites, which can significantly facilitate the diffusion performance of the bulky aromatic molecules (894900) and prevent the coke deposition on the micropores (901) in the MTA process. Wang et al. (662) synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 with a hollow structure, in which the shell was aggregated by small coffinlike ZSM-5 crystals (Figure 43F). The synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 with a hollow structure (ZSM-5-h (38)) exhibited a long catalyst lifetime of 186 h, which was 1.69 times longer than that of conventional ZSM-5 zeolite (ZSM-5-c1) (Figure 43F,G). This was due to their much lower coking rate than that of ZSM-5-c1 (0.0061 vs 0.0096 mg h1). Besides, it also exhibited a higher aromatics selectivity (40.1%) than ZSM-5-c1 (33.9%) by suppressing the production of C5+ aliphatic hydrocarbons. Wang et al. (663) synthesized a macroscopic bayberry-like MFI zeolite with a micrometer thick shell and densely grown nanocrystals with an ordered packed channel. The catalyst exhibited a higher methanol conversion and a longer catalyst lifetime, confirming the advantage of hierarchically porous structures in heterogeneous catalytic reactions over pure microcrystals and nanocrystals. Zhou et al. (664) prepared various MFI zeolites with different mesoporosities and acidities and systematically investigated the effects of the mesopore quality and the acidity strength on the catalyst performance in the MTA reactions. They found that desilication post-treatment of zeolites can significantly increase the mesopore volumes and decrease the strong acid density. The resulting mesoporous catalyst can efficiently inhibit the coke formation and increase the catalytic stability in the MTA reaction.
4.1.6.5. Methanol Dehydration to Dimethyl Ether Process
Generally, the dehydration temperature of methanol in the methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (MTD) process is much lower than that of the MTG, MTO, and MTP processes. Dimethyl ether (DME) is the intermediate product during the MTH reaction, which further gets converted into olefins, paraffins, aromatics, and other chemicals by combining with methanol and water at high temperature. (902,903) In addition to the reaction temperature, the textural properties of catalysts such as porosity (introduced meso-macropores), crystal size, and morphology could also greatly influence the catalytic performance in the MTD reaction. Currently, ZSM-5 zeolite is the most important catalyst used in the MTD reaction. Rownaghi et al. (665) investigated the effects of crystalline size and mesoporosity on the catalytic performance of various mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites in the MTD process. They found that uniform nanocrystal catalysts showed the highest catalytic activity and DME yield due to their reduced mass transport resistance. Thus, it can be concluded that decreasing the crystalline size of the zeolites is an effective way to improve their catalytic activities in the MTD process. Hierarchically porous ZSM-5 with intracrystalline mesopores also showed a long catalyst lifetime and 100.0% selectivity toward DME in the MTD process. This was due to the large mesopore volume in mesoporous ZSM-5 that can greatly improve the coke tolerance and thus efficiently prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. (666) In conclusion, an ideal catalyst with the stable and high methanol conversion and product selectivity is mostly desired in the zeolite-catalyzed methanol transformation process. However, the slow transportation of the reactants and products in the relatively small micropores of conventional zeolite is the main causes for the short catalyst life. The hierarchically porous zeolites can effectively reduce the intracrystalline diffusion path, greatly enhance the reactants/products to and away from the active centers, and thus improve the catalytic conversion, inhibit the undesired secondary reaction, reduce the coke formation, and finally extend the catalyst lifetime.
4.1.7. Catalytic Cracking Reaction
Hierarchical zeolites are widely used in cracking reactions due to their improved diffusion of reactants and products within the hierarchical structures of catalysts. Catalytic cracking of different types of feedstocks, i.e., heavy fractions of crude oil, aromatic compounds, hydrocarbons, and polyolefins, will be reported in this section.
4.1.7.1. Fluid Catalytic Cracking Process
The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process is one of the most important conversion technologies in the oil refinery industry. (904) This process converts heavy fractions of crude oil, i.e., heavy gas oil (HGO), vacuum gas oil (VGO), or residue feedstocks, into useful products, such as gasoline and chemical feedstocks. (905) Therefore, developing more effective FCC catalysts is of great importance for the industrial production. (906) Currently, FCC catalyst particles consist of Y zeolite, active matrix, clays (fillers), various additives, and binders, in which zeolite Y (FAU type) is the primary active component of the cracking catalyst used in the FCC process due to its high surface area, supercage structure, strong Brnsted acidity, excellent thermal/hydrothermal stability, and low cost. (907) However, the bulky molecules in heavy oil or residues have such a large molecular dynamic size ranging from 1.2 to 15 nm (boiling point >400 C, carbon number >20) that they cannot enter into the micropores of the Y zeolite (0.74 nm). (205,908) Even the size of the deformed molecules allowed to penetrate into Y-zeolite pores is less than 1.02 nm. (909) Only hydrocarbons with a carbon number less than 20 can enter the micropores of Y-zeolite, but this process cannot happen for fractions with boiling points higher than 400 C. Similarly, larger intermediate molecules are tightly fitted within the micropores and can take a relatively long time to leave the zeolite crystal. (381) The relatively long residence time leads to reduced catalytic effectiveness and increased undesired reactions, such as hydrogen transfer, overcracking, olefin interconversion, and, in particular, coking. (14,910,911) Thus, the desired FCC catalysts should have improved diffusion performances and enhanced acid site accessibility. (912) These can be realized by constructing interconnected hierarchical pore systems (pore hierarchization), (913915) or aggregates of zeolite nanocrystals. (8) Zeolite Y with well-controlled intracrystalline mesoporosity was prepared by a surfactant templating synthesis. (380) It was the first report concerning the introduction of well-controlled mesoporosity into Y zeolites with low Si/Al ratios. This mesostructured zeolite Y catalyst produced much more gasoline and light cycle oil (LCO), and less bottoms and coke. Such improved product selectivity was due to the mesopores introduced into the zeolites which can reduce the diffusion limitation in the microporous zeolites. (667) The larger mesopores allow bulky reactants to access the catalytic sites within the zeolite crystals, thereby promoting the primary reactions to yield more gasoline and LCO. Besides, the mesopores facilitate the transport of the reactants and the products in and out of the zeolite crystals, thus reducing the undesirable secondary reactions, such as the overcracking of the valuable gasoline and LCO to the low-value coke and dry gases. The hydrogen transfer side reaction was also inhibited, which contributed to higher C3 and C4 olefin yields. (667) Moreover, composite catalysts based on such hierarchical zeolite Y also showed excellent catalytic activity in the FCC process. (668) The hydrothermally stable hierarchically macro-meso-microporous zeolite composites were prepared by the overgrowth of ordered mesoporous Y on kaolin spheres through the in situ assembly of preformed zeolite Y nanoclusters on kaolin using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as soft template under alkaline conditions. (668) The zeolite Y gave micropores and mesopores in the composite and the macroporous kaolin substrate contributes macropores. Besides, the mesopores of the composite Y/kaolin were entirely accessible from outside and well interconnected. The mesopores in the catalysts can facilitate the mass transfer in the zeolites, thus decreasing the secondary reactions resulting in dry gas and coke formation. (667) The Y/kaolin composites exhibited a relatively low dry gas yield (1.5 wt %) and a very low coke yield (6.9 wt %). (668) Recently, the coreshell structured zeolite has attracted great attention due to the definite reaction pathways and excellent connection between meso- and microporosities. (669) Many coreshell structured zeolite@porous matrix composites were developed to crack heavy oil more efficiently. (671673) A new coreshell zeolite catalyst with a hierarchical macro-meso-micropore network was developed by controlling overgrowth of a zeolite ZSM-5 shell on the surface of a purely microporous Y-zeolite. (670) The heavy oil was cracked step-by-step into the required products over the designed zeolite catalyst. The meso-macroporous shell facilitated the precracking of the large heavy oil molecules into moderate ones, which can directly diffuse into the micropores of the Y-zeolite for further cracking into the desired products. The results showed that both the conversion of heavy oil and the yield of gasoline increased when compared with conventional FCC catalyst.
4.1.7.2. Catalytic Cracking of Aromatic Compounds
Owing to their importance and wide applications in the fluid catalytic cracking process, the optimization of hierarchically porous zeolites has become one of the researchers focuses in recent years. Special cracking reactions were chosen to investigate the catalytic performance of catalysts in cracking reactions and to choose the optimum hierarchical structure. The cracking of isopropyl benzene was chosen as a probe reaction to study the catalytic performance and anticoking ability of hierarchically porous zeolites. Peng et al. (674) prepared hierarchically micro-mesoporous MFI-type zeolite by steam-assisted conversion (SAC). The precursors were confined in the porous carbon template. The hierarchically structured zeolite had interconnected mesopores and micropores. The resultant hierarchically porous ZSM-5 showed a much higher conversion (74.5 wt %) in the catalytic cracking of isopropyl benzene than nanosized ZSM-5 (30 wt %) and bulky ZSM-5 (28.6 wt %). (10) The bulky 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) is regarded as a model compound for heavy gas oil molecules, and the catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-TIPB is widely used as a probe reaction to estimate the improvement on catalytic performance due to hierarchical porosity in the zeolites (Figure 44A). 1,3,5-TIPB has a dynamic size (9.5 Å) larger than the micropore pore size in zeolites used for cracking reactions, such as Y, Beta, MOR, and ZSM-5, and cannot penetrate into the internal micropore channels. (108) Thus, the cracking reactions can only be realized at the external surface of conventional ZSM-5 zeolites. The introduced hierarchical porosity greatly boosted the catalytic conversion. (146,675677) For example, hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous ZSM-5 with a house-of-cards-like structure (HCL-ZSM-5) was prepared by a template-free zeolite synthesis system assisted by the low-cost N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). (262) The synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 sample had a regular house-of-cards-like morphology (10 mm), which consisted of orthogonal sheetlike crystals with a typical thickness of about 100 nm. The micro- and macropores had a broad distribution of 580 nm, which mainly came from the aggregation of zeolite nanosheets. The abundant acid sites on the HCL-ZSM-5 were more accessible to the bulky 1,3,5-TIPB molecules, which in turn produced greatly improved 1,3,5-TIPB conversion (90.5 wt %) when compared to conventional ZSM-5 (15.7 wt %). The layered zeolite precursor is a special intermediate to synthesize various hierarchical zeolites with open mesopore structures due to its diverse layer stackings. A swelling-type mesostructured multilamellar ECNU-7P zeolite with large interlayer spacing (25 Å), consisting of an alternative stacking of inorganic MWW zeolite nanosheets and organic CTAB layers, was prepared through a dissolutionrecrystallization approach (Figure 44B). (678) The calcined material turned into a hierarchical zeolite catalyst (Al-ECNU-7, Si/Al = 15) and showed improved 1,3,5-TIPB conversion (72% at 1 h), which was 3 times higher than that of the conventional MCM-22 (24% at 1 h, Figure 44C,D). The cracking activity of 1,3,5-TIPB was also tested over hierarchical ZSM-5 nanocrystals. (679) The TIPB conversion increased as the crystalline size of the zeolites nanocrystals decreased. Their large external surface with abundant active sites facilitated the fast cracking of bulky molecules and thus increased the catalytic conversion of TIPB. Hierarchical Y zeolite nanocrystals with various sizes (10 nm, sample Y-10; 70 nm, sample Y-70; and 400 nm, sample Y-400) were prepared in the absence of template (Figure 44E). (280) The abundant intercrystalline mesopores facilitated the movement of reactants/products to and away from the catalytically active sites, thus leading to a superior catalytic performance and high selectivity toward the primary dialkylated products in the 1,3,5-TIPB cracking process (Figure 44F,G). When a hierarchical interconnected micro-meso-macroporous ZSM-5 zeolite was used in the 1,3,5-TIPB cracking process, its meso-macroporosity and interconnecting structure permitted cracking at both internal and external surfaces and favored the access of bulky1,3,5-TIPB molecules to the active sites, resulting in a 4-fold increased conversion. (234) These zeolitic nanocrystal aggregates with a hierarchically micro-meso-macroporous structure were prepared by the direct transformation of amorphous nanoparticles into meso-macroporous aluminosilicates, which also acted as the support template. (234) A similar improved conversion of 1,3,5-TIPB was also found for carbon-templated mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite as compared with microporous zeolite (42.1% vs 6.8%). (30) Figure 44 Figure 44.

As discussed above, the introduction of a hierarchical structure into zeolites can greatly improve the catalytic conversion. The same applies to the product selectivity. The 1,3,5-TIPB cracking is known to be a three-step successive dealkylation reaction in which 1,3,5-TIPB first cracks into diisopropyl benzene (DIPB) and isopropylbenzene (IPB), followed by DIPB cracking to IPB, and then IPB further cracking to benzene (Bz). Side reactions such as disproportionation, isomerization, and condensation also occur. (680) The effective catalytic sites for the first dealkylation of 1,3,5-TIPB mainly happen on the external surface of the catalysts while the further deep cracking, such as cumene to benzene, occurs mainly on the acid sites inside the micropores. (151,232,916) Thus, the cracking extent of 1,3,5-TIPB over purely microporous zeolites is relatively low, leading to high product selectivity to DIPB (>50%). (681) For hierarchical zeolites, the deeper cracked products, such as benzene and IPB, become the predominant products due to the further cracking of DIPB in 1,3,5-TIPB cracking. (108,681) The mesoporous ZSM-5 prepared by the soft templating method exhibited a 100 wt % 1,3,5-TIPB conversion and 100% selectivity to Bz and IPB, while conventional ZSM-5 showed a much lower 1,3,5-TIPB conversion (71.4 wt %) and high selectivity toward DIPB under the same conditions. (682) The high catalytic performance of the resultant mesoporous ZSM-5 in the 1,3,5-TIPB cracking was attributed to its open mesoporous structure and exposed catalytic active sites. Similarly, an intracrystalline mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite, synthesized by employing an organosiloxane C24H57O12NSi3 as a mesopore-directing template, exhibited an extremely high catalytic conversion and selectivity toward Bz which mainly came from the cracking of IPB. (683) This was attributed to the abundant accessible acid sites where the primary products (DIPB and IPB) could further crack to secondary products.
4.1.7.3. Catalytic Cracking of Hydrocarbons
As mentioned above, for a certain cracking reaction, both the catalytic conversion and the product selectivity are improved after the introduction of a hierarchically porous structure into the zeolite catalysts. This also applies to the steam cracking process of hydrocarbons with light olefins (ethylene and propylene) as main products. Light olefins are basic raw materials for polyethylene, polypropylene, vinyl chloride, ethylene oxide, ethylbenzene, and other chemicals. (684) The higher selectivity to light olefins in the cracking reactions depends on the reduced reaction path, shortened residence time, and increased accessibility of the catalyst sites. (917) Thus, hierarchically porous zeolites with precise selectivity toward a certain product are highly desired. Catalytic cracking of different types of hydrocarbons will be reported in the following sections.
4.1.7.3.1. Catalytic Cracking of Naphtha
Various zeolites such as ZSM-5, Y, and MCM-22 are used as catalysts in naphtha cracking to produce ethylene and propylene. Among them, ZSM-5 is considered to be the best material owing to its unique shape selectivity that influences the preferential formation of light olefins. Naphtha consists of different hydrocarbons such as linear alkanes, naphthenes, isoparaffins, olefins, and aromatics. (918) These bulky hydrocarbons suffer from severe diffusion limitations. The restricted access to the active sites reduces the catalytic effectiveness while the slow mass transport extends the residence time of products in the zeolite micropores, leading to increased coke deposition and decreased catalytic activity and selectivity toward light olefins. (919) Introducing the mesopore structure in microporous zeolites using the principles of hierarchical structure design is recognized as a promising route for eliminating their transport limitations and, thus, for improving their catalytic performances. For example, a higher selectivity toward light olefins was achieved over a mesoporous ZSM-5 with isolated mesopores, which was synthesized using carbon black as a mesopore template with an average particle diameter of 12 nm. The mesoporosity of ZSM-5 significantly enhanced the production of light olefins (24.0 wt %), showing a 2-fold increase in ethylene and propylene yields when compared with the conventional ZSM-5 catalyst (13.7 wt %). (920) Besides, the reduced residence time and the fast mass transfer of intermediate products in the mesoporous zeolites can efficiently inhibit the olefins consuming hydrogen transfer reactions and other secondary reactions. However, the incorporation of carbon black into the zeolite structure created cavelike mesopores that were not interconnected. To further increase the selectivity toward light olefins, many efforts were made to synthesize zeolites with interconnected meso- or macropores. For example, using carbon nanotubes leads to the creation of mesopore channels passing through the whole zeolite crystal. (921) A much higher olefin yield (54 wt %) was obtained over the synthesized mesoporous ZSM-5. In the following section, the catalytic cracking of the typical alkane components in naphtha (C6C8 alkanes), such as n-hexane, n-heptane, and n-octane, used as a probe reaction to investigate the influence of meso- or macropore quality in hierarchically porous zeolites on their catalytic performance, is reviewed.
4.1.7.3.1.1. Catalytic Cracking of n-Hexane
The pore structure is considered to be an essential factor to evaluate the conversion, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts during the cracking of n-hexane. (922) Appropriate post-treatment synthesis was necessary to develop an optimal hierarchical zeolite with a reduced diffusion limit. (922) Hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolites, prepared by the HF-NH4F etching method, showed a higher BET surface area, larger mesoporous volume, fewer defect zones, and commensurable microporous structure as compared with the parent ZSM-5. They showed a better catalytic performance with less carbon deposition (23 mg g1, which was 4 times less than that of the parent ZSM-5) due to their large mesoporous and macroporous structure. (685) Similarly, interconnected mesopores were introduced into the as-synthesized ZSM-5 crystals by alkaline desilication with the addition of organic amines (piperidine and hexamethylenimine), which can protect the zeolite crystals from excess dissolution and thus minimize the loss of micropores and catalytically active sites. (686) In the catalytic cracking of n-hexane, the coke amounts formed on alkali-treated zeolites were much lower than that of the parent zeolites. This was due to the shortened diffusion path length offered by the interconnection of zeolite intrinsic microporosity and the generated mesoporosity which could effectively facilitate the diffusion of coke precursors out of the micropores, thus suppressing the formation of heavy coke. Thus, the primary products also rapidly diffuse out of the zeolites, effectively suppressing the secondary reactions.
4.1.7.3.1.2. Catalytic Cracking of n-Heptane
To investigate the effect of mesopore quality on the catalytic cracking of n-heptane, hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with various intercrystalline mesopore volumes were prepared. (687) The results revealed that a larger mesopore volume led to a greater improvement of selectivity toward light olefins. Zhang et al. (688) further explored the effect of external acidity strength of the hierarchical zeolites on the catalytic cracking performance. They found that the more external acid sites are selectively eliminated, the better catalytic performance can be achieved due to the suppressed bimolecular reactions of ethylene and propylene and the inhibited coke formation. Besides, the addition of ZRP-1 zeolite (50 wt % loading), which is an MFI structure zeolite containing rare earth elements and phosphorus, during the hydrothermal synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite yielded composite zeolites with bimodal porosity. (689) The aggregation of zeolite nanocrystals resulted in hierarchically porous ZSM-5-ZRP-1 zeolites with an interconnected but disordered mesoporous structure (1555 nm), which were more active than conventional ZSM-5 zeolites and more selective toward ethylene and propylene than conventional ZRP-1 zeolites in the cracking of n-heptane.
4.1.7.3.1.3. Catalytic Cracking of n-Octane
Highly crystalline mesoporous IM-5 zeolite, prepared by alkaline treatment, exhibited a higher light olefins yield (especially propylene) and longer catalyst lifetime in cracking n-octane than conventional ZSM-5 zeolites. (690) Similarly, the alkali-treated MFI zeolites also showed a greatly improved catalytic activity and high selectivity toward propene in the cracking of n-octane. (691) The addition of mesopores formed during the alkali treatment can efficiently suppress the production of long-chain alkanes. The cracking activity of n-octane was also tested over hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals. (692) The catalyst showed an extended catalyst lifetime as compared to the microporous ZSM-5. Such a higher catalytic stability was attributed to the fast diffusion of reactants in a hierarchically porous system. A zeolite composite with MFI and MOR zeolite structures was also investigated. (693) The existence of intracrystalline mesopores (4 nm, created in MOR zeolites) and macropores (50100 nm, formed by the polycrystalline aggregation) in the zeolite composite facilitated the molecular transport and increased the active-site accessibility, thus leading to a higher catalytic activity in the cracking of n-octane.
4.1.7.3.2. Catalytic Cracking of C4 Alkene
Hierarchically porous zeolites are also used in the cracking of low-valued C4 olefin to produce high-valued propylene. The relatively fast mass transport facilitates the primary product out of the zeolites and effectively suppresses the hydrogen transfer reactions that produce aromatics and alkanes, which lowers the yield of targeted propylene and accelerates the catalyst deactivation. Hierarchically structured ZSM-5 zeolites, which were synthesized by a mesoporogen-free steam-assisted crystallization procedure, showed an enhanced propylene yield (40 wt %) when compared with the microporous ZSM-5 (27 wt %). (694) Mesoporous ZSM-5 was prepared by alkali treatment and applied in butene catalytic cracking. (695) The introduced mesopores effectively increased the accessible active sites and facilitated the product molecule out of the zeolites, thus leading to an improved catalytic performance. The selectivity of ethylene and propylene over the mesoporous ZSM-5 reached 81.76% while, for the conventional ZSM-5 zeolite, the corresponding value was only 39.37%. Similar results were found for surface silicon-rich hierarchically porous ZSM-5, which was prepared by hydrothermal dealumination. (696) They exhibited an excellent catalytic performance and high selectivity toward propylene and ethylene in the cracking of butylene, which was attributed to their abundant mesoporosity and large external surface. Arudra et al. (697) reported that Silicate-1 zeolite is an efficient catalyst for propylene production from 1-butene cracking due to the absence of strong acid sites. Based on this conclusion, they further modified the surface of ZSM-5 by silica deposition using the chemical liquid deposition method and synthesized a hierarchically porous silicalite composite material with a coreshell structure by the hydrothermal method. (698) The propylene yield and the selectivity toward light olefins were higher on this coreshell silicalite composite than on silica deposited ZSM-5, which was prepared via the chemical liquid deposition (CLD) method. The increased selectivity was attributed to their large mesopore voids, which reduced the hydrogen transfer reactions that form alkanes and aromatics.
4.1.7.4. Catalytic Cracking of Polyolefin
Plastic waste is of great environmental concern worldwide. The main components of plastic waste are polyolefins, consisting of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polypropylene (PP). (923) The recycling of plastic waste is a highly challenging task since the carbon chain is typically in the range of tens of thousands. The catalytic cracking of polyolefins over zeolite catalysts to useful products such as fuels or chemicals is a good option. (924) Hierarchically porous zeolites used for this purpose showed a high potential in solving this important environment problem. (925,926) In the cracking process, large molecules in polyolefins cannot enter into the micropores, and thus, the catalytic degradation of polyolefins first takes place on the external acidic sites of the zeolite catalysts. The catalytic activity of the catalysts strongly depends on their external surface area. (927) For example, hierarchical ZSM-5 aggregates, synthesized by the addition of surfactant, exhibited excellent catalytic activity in LDPE cracking. (699) The improved catalytic performance in the reactions involving large molecules was attributed to the improved accessibility to the active sites. Similarly, the introduction of mesopores into Beta zeolites by silanization significantly increased the catalytic cracking degree of HDPE. (700) Besides, hierarchically porous ZSM-5 zeolite nanocrystals with abundant intercrystalline mesopores also exhibited a remarkable catalytic activity in the LDPE cracking reaction. (701) The catalyst with more accessible acid sites and higher acid strength provided an improved catalytic activity under mild conditions. In the sequential detemplationdesilication process, Perez-Ramirez et al. (497) also found that the excellent catalytic cracking performance resulted from the suitable treatment of the zeolite to generate mesoporosity while maintaining the crystallinity and intrinsic acidity. Furthermore, the interplay between the overall catalytic cracking performance in LDPE cracking and the large external surface of hierarchical zeolite ITQ-4 was investigated. (321) The hierarchy factor (HF) was appropriately related the introduced mesoporosity to catalytic activity. (13) To optimize the hierarchical structure, the HF needs to be maximized, comprising the increase of the mesopore surface area without a severe sacrifice of the micropore volume. It was found that the optimal activity in LDPE cracking required both a large mesoporous surface area and suitable Brnsted acidity. Therefore, the amount of the introduced mesoporous porosity should be weighted carefully against the compromised microporosity. Furthermore, Lee et al. (702) investigated the contribution of mesopores on the catalytic degradation of HDPEs. They prepared four mesoporous MFI zeolites with different mesopores by treatment with an alkaline solution (MFI-alk), the addition of a special structure-directing agent (MFI-sda) and an oxyacid (MFI-oxy), and the synthesis of a mesoporous material from a synthetic mixture containing dissolved MFI fragments (MFI-syn) (Figure 45AL). The conversion of HDPE was very fast on MFI-sda, MFI-alk, and MFI-syn, and 100 wt % conversion was achieved in 60 min, while the degradation on MFI-oxy was slow due to its small pore volume (Figure 45M,N). This was indicative of the fact that the characteristics of mesopores were important in determining catalytic activity.

In conclusion, the catalytic performance for the catalytic cracking reactions of bulky molecules are strongly correlated with the accessibility of the catalytically active sites, which is decided by both the pore size and the pore connectivity in the zeolites. However, the internal diffusion limitations within the micropores leads to severe pore blocking and delayed mass transport. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to synthesize hierarchically porous zeolites for alleviating the diffusion limitations. Hierarchically porous zeolites with abundant meso- or macropores that are directly accessible from the outer surface of the zeolite crystal are highly desired for the catalytic cracking reactions.
4.1.8. Biomass Conversion
Growing demand for sustainable fuels and chemicals has renewed the interest toward alternative feedstocks replacing crude oil in traditional refineries. Thus, biomass, as the only renewable carbon source, has attracted great attention in the past several decades. (928) It can be divided into two main categories: lignocellulose feedstock and oleaginous feedstock. Typically, biomass conversion is the decomposition of bulky biopolymers into small basic molecules and/or the further processing of small basic molecules to value-added end-products. Microporous zeolites with various structures, such as MFI, (929) USY, (87,704) Beta, (706) and MOR, (708) were employed to catalyze the biomass conversion. For each process, the accelerated diffusion performance and the improved accessibility toward active sites are the determining factors. Hierarchically porous zeolites play an important role in many biomass conversions.
4.1.8.1. Lignocellulose Biomass Conversion
4.1.8.1.1. Lignocellulose Biomass Feedstock Processing
4.1.8.1.1.1. Lignocellulose to Bio-Oils
Lignocellulose biomass is the most abundant biomass resource and consists of three polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and extractives (terpenes, etc.). Most of the biomass-derived materials exhibit low density, making them difficult to store and transport. One way to overcome this limitation is to increase biomass density. (930) Cracking or pyrolysis is probably the most efficient method to increase the energy-density of these renewable materials. Bio-oil, which is considered as the energy-dense form of biomass, can be produced by a catalytic pyrolysis treatment. Hierarchical zeolites are the most promising catalysts for biomass pyrolysis. The increased external surface area and the improved diffusion performance in the zeolite crystal can greatly boost its catalytic activity and thus result in high-quality bio-oils and lower coke yields, as observed for hydrolysis of (hemi)cellulose, (931,932) catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignocellulose, (703) cellulose, (929)Miscanthus, (929) and lignin. (933) The hierarchical zeolites exhibit slower deactivation of the active sites, shorter retention time of products in the micropores, and less secondary coke product formation. (934) For example, a better catalytic stability was reported for the CFP of lignocellulose with mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by desilication with NaOH solutions, in which only a lower amount of coke was deposited. (703) Lignocellulose to Platform Molecules The transformation of lignocellulosic biomass to small useful molecules can be realized by the following process: the controlled lignocellulosic (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose) depolymerization to simple sugars and subsequent sugar transformations to targeted molecules. These molecules are regarded as the platform materials for the production of polymers, fine chemicals, and transportation fuels. Among these platform molecules, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and levulinic acid (LA) are of special interest.
The major component of the lignocellulosic biomass is cellulose (4050 wt %), and its structural unit is glucose. 5-HMF, obtained from the dehydration of glucose (708,935,936)/its isomer fructose (704,706,937) or the direct dehydration of cellulose, (705,707) is a value-added chemical and has various applications in chemicals and fuels. (938) As an isomer of glucose, fructose could be rapidly dehydrated to HMF. Yang et al. (706) synthesized a hierarchically porous Beta zeolite single crystal via the steam-assisted crystallization of a carbonsilica composite monolith. The resultant catalysts composed of connected nanoparticles were applied for the dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF. The conversion of fructose over hierarchically porous Beta reached 100 wt % in 2 h with an HMF yield of 78.5 wt % while, over conventional Beta, the reaction time for the total conversion of fructose was increased to 3 h, and it was achieved with a lower HMF yield (58.7 wt %). The greatly improved catalytic performance over hierarchically porous Beta zeolite was due to the free and efficient diffusion of bulky molecules and the high accessibility of external acidic sites. Similar observations were found on hierarchical USY zeolite and ZSM-5 zeolite, which also exhibited higher selectivity towards 5-HMF in the dehydration of fructose than that of the conventional ones. (87,704) The conversion of fructose to 5-HMF is easier than that of glucose due to the presence of the furanose group. However, the high cost of fructose limits their further applications. Thus, the direct conversion of glucose to 5-HMF has attracted increasing attention. It was reported that a combination of micropores and mesopores was helpful in increasing the yield of 5-HMF from glucose. (936) Velaga and Peela (708) observed that the mesoporous MOR exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards glucose dehydration to 5-HMF with a selectivity to 5-HMF of 87% at a glucose conversion of 76 wt %. The high yield and selectivity to 5-HMF with minimal side products were due to the introduced mesoporosity and the optimized amount of Lewis and Brnsted acid sites in the catalysts. Hierarchically porous zeolite catalysts were also designed to efficiently convert cellulose to HMF. Nandiwalet et al. (705) prepared 5-HMF from cellulose over desilicated zeolite ZSM-5, which gave a cellulose conversion of 67 wt % and a 5-HMF yield of 46 wt % at 190 C in 4 h. Dealuminated zeolite Beta with tunable Brnsted and Lewis acid site distribution and mesoporosity improved the conversion of cellulose to 5-HMF with similar results to those obtained by Nandiwalet et al. with desilicated ZSM-5. (707) The catalyst exhibited a 42 wt % yield of 5-HMF with a full conversion of cellulose at 200 C in 5 h. Moreover, the consecutive rehydration of 5-HMF generated levulinic acid (LA), another important intermediate. (939) The yield of LA obtained from glucose over a micro-mesoporous catalyst composite (with ZSM-5 crystalline structure) was almost doubled (36 wt %) compared with the parent material. (940) Terpene Transformations Terpenes refer to extractives, consisting mainly of α-pinene (6085 wt %). (941) Considering the abundance of α-pinene in inexpensive turpentine oil, its conversion to more valuable chemicals is of great interest. α-Pinene can be converted into a variety of important chemical intermediates, like terpinene, camphene, limonene, or cymenes that are essential for the synthesis of many fine chemicals. (942) The dominant factor influencing the conversion of the bulky biomass molecule is the catalyst lifetime influenced by coke formation that possibly blocks the micropores. (943) The hierarchical zeolites have an extended catalyst lifetime since the larger external surface area gives a slower deactivation, and the shorter retention time of products in the zeolites results in lesser secondary coke formation. To improve the catalytic performance of the conventional ZSM-5 zeolites, mesopores were introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite by desilication treatment with NaOH. (320) The resultant catalysts displayed an increased α-pinene conversion from 11 to about 27 wt % when compared with conventional ones. (944) Similarly, a lower amount of deposited coke over hierarchical USY, ZSM-5, and Beta zeolites was also reported in the isomerization of α-pinene. (709,710,945) The importance of mesopores in boosting catalytic properties was also confirmed by another successful application of mesoporous H-ferrierite. The zeolite exhibited an improved α-pinene conversion (from 72 to 97 wt %) and an increased selectivity towards limonene. (946)
4.1.8.1.2. Lignocellulosic-Based Feedstock Processing
The usage of lignocellulosic biomass in a refinery can be accomplished in different ways. An effective option is the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to a fluid by pyrolytic treatment, leading to the production of a liquid called bio-oil. The bio-oil is a highly oxofunctionalized mixture of light-to-medium hydrocarbons with a high oxygen content, high viscosity, and low stability. To widen their potential applications, oxygen must be removed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) processes, such as hydrodehydration and hydrodecarboxylation. (947) It was reported that bifunctional catalysts containing both the metal nanoparticles and acidic zeolites favored the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis oil. (947) Hierarchical zeolites with introduced mesopores or macropores are promising candidates as HDO catalyst supports due to the large size of lignocellulosic biomass. The meso- or macroporosity can enhance the dispersion of the metal phase and improve the accessibility of the relatively bulky reactant molecules to the active sites. (948,949) Veses et al. (949) investigated the metal-loaded hierarchically structured mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts for the deoxygenation of bio-oil. The mesopores were introduced by desilication. The hierarchical zeolites after impregnation with different metals (Sn, Cu, Ni, or Mg) exhibited an increased deoxygenation compared to the parent acidic hierarchical zeolite. The Mg-loaded hierarchical zeolite led to the production of fuels with the best characteristics, achieving the greatest reduction in the oxygen content and the lowest acidity. (949) Also, the hierarchical porosity in the zeolites plays a dominant role in deciding the cracking degree of the desired fraction and avoiding the unwanted byproducts in the HDO reactions involving acid-catalyzed bond-cleavage. (169,378,950) These advantages were observed in the upgrading reactions of bio-oils with desilicated Y zeolite. (711) The catalysts showed an increased selectivity toward primary cracking and deoxygenation products and decreased selectivity toward aromatic hydrocarbons due to the suppressed possibility of secondary oligomerization, cyclization, and hydrogen transfer reactions.
4.1.8.2. Oleaginous Biomass Conversion
4.1.8.2.1. Triglyceride Processing
Oleaginous feedstocks, such as animal fats and vegetable oils, are completely composed of triglycerides and are mixtures of esters made by glycerol and fatty acid alkyl (varied in alkyl-chain length and number of unsaturated bonds). (951,952) Generally, triglycerides cannot be used directly as combustible fuels due to their high viscosity and low volatility. Thus, the processing of triglyceride-rich biomass in chemical reactions such as transesterification, catalytic cracking, or pyrolysis represents a promising future option to replace the limited petroleum resources with biofuels and chemicals. (953) In particular, the transesterification of triglyceride in the presence of a short-chain alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol, can produce biodiesels that are considered to be an important renewable source to alternative diesel fuel. (954,955) Hierarchically porous zeolites were proven to be excellent catalysts with a high catalytic efficiency in the transformation of triglyceride. The introduction of secondary mesopores or macropores into the zeolite frameworks can significantly improve the accessibility of bulky triglycerides to the active sites and thus boost the conversion efficiencies, (956) as observed in the conversion of crude vegetable oil (palm oil) by Ni/HBEA (712) or Pt/HBEA, (713) rapeseed by Ni/ZSM-5, (714) used vegetable oil (waste cooking oil) by NiMo/USY (715) or Ni/Y, (716) animal fats (fish oil) by Ga/MFI, (717) and nonedible oil (safflower oil and microalga oil) by USY (957) and NiMo/ZSM-5, (958) respectively. For example, Verma et al. (958) employed mesoporous zeolite ZSM-5 and NiW metal components as a composite catalyst and found that the hierarchically structured catalyst showed a high yield of C9C15 hydrocarbons (4045%) and high isomerization selectivity (isomer/n-alkane, i/n 26) from Jatropha oil. However, the NiW/SiO2Al2O3 catalyst could only yield 33% of jet-range hydrocarbons but with low selectivity to the isomers (i/n 1.1).
4.1.8.2.2. Glycerol Processing
The transesterification of triglycerides to biodiesels generates large amounts of glycerol byproducts. (959) Thus, the conversion of glycerol into value-added chemicals has attracted great attention. (960) Many glycerol transformation methods which have been developed like dehydration, acetalization, etherification, and aromatization will be discussed in this section.
4.1.8.2.2.1. Glycerol Dehydration
The dehydration of glycerol to acrolein is an important reaction. (961) Possato et al. (718) investigated the catalytic performance of mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite and found that the catalytic life is greatly improved by the increased mesopore volume in the catalyst. Zhang et al. (719) further investigated the influence of mesopore quality on the catalytic performance. A series of ZSM-5 zeolites with various mesopore structures were prepared, including bulky ZSM-5 with fewer closed intracrystalline mesopores (H-Z5-1), nanosized ZSM-5 with more closed intracrystal mesopores (H-Z5-2), oriented self-assembled ZSM-5 nanocrystals with abundant open intercrystalline mesopores (H-Z5-3), and self-assembled ZSM-5 nanocrystals with intra- and intercrystalline mesopores (H-Z5-4) (Figure 46AD). The conventional ZSM-5 (C-Z5) catalyst suffered from the fastest deactivation after 3 h. The catalytic conversion over C-Z5 even decreased to less than 45 wt % after 8 h. This was due to the extremely slow diffusion. In contrast, the incorporation of mesopores within microporous zeolites prolonged the catalyst lifetime (comparing H-Z5-x with C-Z5). All of the four hierarchically structured catalysts showed slower deactivation than C-Z5 (Figure 46E). The H-Z5-3 and HZ5-4 samples with open and interconnected mesopores exhibited a longer catalyst lifetime than H-Z5-1 and H-Z5-2 samples containing isolated intracrystalline mesopores. This is due to the facilitated mass transfer and hindered coke formation offered by open and interconnected mesopores. The relationships between the catalytic performance (lifetime and initial activity) and the structural properties (Vmeso,N2, Vmeso,Hg, and Smeso) are shown in Figure 46FI. This further confirmed the positive role of the mesopores on extending the catalyst lifetime and increasing catalytic activity. Figure 46F,G shows the relationship between the catalyst lifetime and total mesopore volume (Vmeso,N2). The lifetime increased with increasing Vmeso,N2. The structural parameter of Vmeso,Hg indicated the accessible mesopores by mercury intrusion from the zeolite outer surface (Figure 46H,I). The relationship between lifetime and Vmeso,Hg excluded the influence of closed mesopores. The longest catalyst lifetime was observed for H-Z5-3 and H-Z5-4. It further confirmed that the sole existence of closed mesopores in ZSM-5 zeolites can also extend the catalyst lifetime. Besides, the mesoporous zeolites also exhibited higher selectivity toward acrolein than C-Z5. It was noteworthy that the open and interconnected mesopores (H-Z5-3 and H-Z5-4) are more effective than closed ones (H-Z5-1 and H-Z5-2). The presence of small intracrystalline mesopores could result in a reduced lifetime and decreased catalytic activity (H-Z5-2 < H-Z5-1 < H-Z5-4 < H-Z5-3). This catalytic property was due to the pore condensation of glycerol or its heavier derivatives. (719) Figure 46 Figure 46.

The catalyst lifetime is defined as the time for which the conversion exceeds the 80%, while the initial activity is defined as the glycerol conversion at the initial reaction period of 23 h.

4.1.8.2.2.2. Glycerol Acetalization
The catalytic activity of zeolites in glycerol acetalization can be greatly improved by the fabrication of a hierarchical porosity. (962) For example, mesoporous zeolite Beta, prepared by the dealuminated method, exhibited an improved catalytic activity due to the accelerated mass transfer and enhanced accessibility provided by the mesopores and the controllable acidity offered by the dealumination treatment. It was noteworthy that the reduction of crystalline size of the zeolite can greatly improve the catalytic activity and selectivity toward the dioxolane product when using Beta zeolite (720) and ZSM-5 zeolite (721) as catalysts.
4.1.8.2.2.3. Glycerol Etherification
The etherification of glycerol is an important reaction aimed at producing oxygenated blending stocks as diesel fuels. (963965) The acid strength and porosity of the catalysts have a great impact on the glycerol conversion and the selectivity toward desirable products. A treatment of HY zeolite with citric or nitric acids resulted in the generation of mesopores in which the citric acid created pores with a diameter larger than 3 nm, and nitric acid produced pores with a diameter less than 3 nm. These mesoporous zeolites showed improved catalyst acidity. (722) Consequently, increased glycerol conversion and selectivity toward di-tert-butylglycerols were observed. Similarly, Saxena et al. (723) reported that the use of mesoporous Beta zeolite led to a higher glycerol conversion (98 wt %) than conventional Beta (85 wt %), demonstrating the superior catalytic performance of the mesoporous Beta in the etherification of glycerol.
4.1.8.2.2.4. Glycerol Aromatization
The development of a new approach for synthesizing aromatics by glycerol conversion has attracted great attention. Hoang et al. (724) confirmed that ZSM-5 zeolites provided a higher aromatic conversion than other types of zeolite catalysts due to their suitable microporous structure and acidity. However, ZSM-5 suffered rapid deactivation due to heavy coke deposition. The catalytic lifetime can be significantly extended after the introduction of mesopores into the ZSM-5 zeolites. For example, mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by Xiao et al. exhibited a nearly 2-fold increase in benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) yield and a 3-fold improvement in catalyst life as compared to conventional microporous ZSM-5 (13.9 wt % BTX yield and 4 h catalyst life). (725) Such superior catalytic properties were attributed to the mesopores in the ZSM-5 catalyst. One possible source of the aforementioned challenges may be the presence of transport limitations in the catalyst pore structure. Bulky oxygenates formed during the initial stages of pyrolysis may not be able to efficiently reach the active sites within the catalyst micropores. Application of a mesoporous catalyst can be advantageous, as enlarging the pore structure results in increased accessibility of reactants to catalyst acid sites.
In conclusion, biomass conversion generally involves the conversion of a broad range of chemical species with different sizes. Obviously, the accessibility of the active sites by the reactants in the catalysts is of great importance, and many efforts are made to enhance the transport of the reactant and product to and away from the active sites. Besides, in the biomass conversion, the tunable pore size and pore architecture of hierarchically porous zeolites offer great possibilities for the conversion of various biomass-derived feedstocks. Thus, it can be concluded that the rational design of the hierarchically porous zeolites with improved mass transfer, inhibited undesired transformations, and reduced catalyst deactivations is of great importance.
4.1.9. Conclusion
As discussed in section 4.1, catalytic applications of hierarchical zeolites are tested in different industrially relevant reactions, such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion. The hierarchical zeolite catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites, which is due to their optimal mesopore quality, such as the size, distribution, and connectivity of mesopores inside the crystals. Depending on the synthesis approaches enumerated in section 2, quite diverse geometries of the imbedded meso- or macropores are obtained in the hierarchically porous zeolites, ranging from isolated mesovoids to open mesoporous channels through the whole microporous crystal. In turn, different geometries with different interconnectivities lead to notably different mass transfer patterns. Thus, investigating the structureperformance relationships in these zeolites with multiple porosities is vital to improve their catalytic properties. However, it still remains a great challenge. More importantly, most previous studies reported that the improved catalytic performances of hierarchical zeolites are due to the enhanced mass transfer, but they failed to present direct evidence of diffusion characteristics. Thus, the diffusion on hierarchical zeolites should be further studied to confirm the advantages of the hierarchically porous system in hierarchical zeolites.
4.2. Environmental Applications
4.2.1. Wastewater Treatment
Removal of biotoxic heavy metals, such as Sr2+ and Hg2+, from the industrial wastewater has attracted great attention worldwide due to their damaging impact on the environment and public health. The adsorption and ion-exchange approaches are the simplest and most effective methods to remove harmful elements from contaminated industrial water. Generally, zeolites are efficient adsorbents/ion exchangers in wastewater treatment across a wide range of contaminants. (966) Zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio such as NaA and NaX zeolites were used to remove heavy metal ions, such as Cs+, (967) Sr2+, (967) and Zn2+, (968) from water by an ion-exchange process due to the high concentration of exchangeable nonframework cations available in their microporous structure. (967,968) However, their ion-exchange capacity was still affected by the diffusion limitation in the microporous network. The hierarchical zeolites are considered to be ideal materials for ion exchange due to their significantly superior ion-exchange performance. For example, a hierarchically structured porous composite constructed by clinoptilolite supported on date stone carbon was prepared by fixing a natural zeolite (clinoptilolite) on the porous date stone carbon or by direct hydrothermal method on the surface of porous date stone carbon to offer a supported high-surface-area ion-exchange material to remove metal ions from aqueous streams. Sucrose and citric acid were used as a binder to fix the clinoptilolite. The hierarchically structured composite exhibited a much higher ion exchange capacity of Sr2+ ions from an aqueous solution than that of conventional clinoptilolite. (969) Similarly, the hierarchical zeolite X/diatomite composite was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis of a zeolite X layer over diatomite. (970) Both hierarchically porous zeolite X composites exhibited a significantly improved ion-exchange behavior for manganese ion removal when compared with purely microporous zeolites X. Moreover, Fardmousavi et al. (971) prepared the thiol-functionalized Beta zeolite/MCM-41 mesoporous silica nanocomposites and then grafted them with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. The hierarchically porous zeolite/MCM-41 composite was employed in the extraction of Hg2+ from aqueous solutions. The material showed an excellent capacity for the Hg2+ ion exchange from aqueous solutions, kinetically fast adsorption process, and extremely short equilibrium state. A maximum ion-exchange capacity of 8.2 mequiv g1 was obtained with the hierarchical zeolite/MCM-41.
4.2.2. Adsorptive Desulfurization
Conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is widely used in the refinery to remove most aliphatic sulfur compounds such as sulfides, disulfides, and mercaptans. However, the HDS reaction is less efficient for aromatic refractory sulfur compounds such as thiophene (TP), benzothiophene (BTP), dibenzothiophene (DBTP), and their derivatives. New technologies have been developed to realize the ultradeep desulfurization. (972) Among these, adsorptive desulfurization is regarded as a promising technology in the selective removal of thiophenic sulfur compounds under moderate conditions. (973) It is based on the physisorption or chemisorption process of organosulfur compounds on ion-exchanged zeolites. The highly dense Brnsted acid sites in the zeolites act as an adsorption platform by donating a proton to the nearby adsorbate molecules. Deep adsorptive desulfurization is decided by the charge of metal cations, the acid properties of the zeolites, the Si/Al ratio, and the pore size of the zeolites. The utilization of zeolites as liquid-phase sulfur adsorbents is receiving significant attention. The removal of sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels can be an ideal desulfurization method due to the low energy and low cost of such a process. However, diffusion constraints within the micropore structure of zeolites can significantly reduce their adsorption capacity, especially when bulky sulfur compounds are present in fuels. Hierarchical zeolites showed high performances in the desulfurization of liquid fuels. The introduction of mesoporosity into zeolites allows for bulky sulfur compounds, such as DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, to enter the zeolite micropores, thus improving accessibility to the active sites. Tian et al. (974) investigated the sulfur removal from a model fuel containing various thiophenic compounds and found that hierarchical H-Beta zeolite by desilication removed about twice as much total sulfur when compared with the parent Beta zeolite. However, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of zeolite Beta is much higher than that of Y, thus limiting the amount of metal ions in Beta zeolite introduced by ion exchange, which are the main adsorption sites for the adsorption of sulfur aromatic compounds. They further developed a novel desulfurization sorbent based on Y zeolite that exhibited a high sulfur capacity and low mass transfer resistance. (975,976) The metal-exchanged hierarchical Y zeolite containing abundant mesopores to improve diffusion performances and large external surface area provided abundant active sites for sulfur adsorption. Bimetals were introduced into hierarchical Y zeolites to further enhance the selective adsorption of sulfur compounds from a model fuel mixture. Wang et al. (977) demonstrated that the desulfurization performance of hierarchically porous NiCe-exchanged zeolite Y in removing DBTP was higher when compared with Ni-exchanged zeolite Y and Ce-exchanged zeolite Y. Wang et al. (978) further investigated the role of the mesoporosity in CuCe mesoporous Y zeolites on the desulfurization process. Such bimetallic mesoporous Y zeolites exhibited a DBTP capacity 5 times more than parent Y due to both improved mass transfer and high adsorption energy.
In conclusion, the synthesis and modification of zeolite-based adsorbents have received considerable attention in adsorptive desulfurization. Zeolites showed a high sulfur loading capacity, easy regenerability, and a stable crystalline structure for adsorptive removal of sulfur compounds. It is highly advantageous in the removal of small molecules in various adsorption applications. However, their relatively small micropores restrict the transfer of the bulky aromatic refractory sulfur compounds, such as DBTPs and other alkyl-branched dibenzothiophenes. Hierarchically porous zeolites with introduced meso- or macropores have been utilized for the adsorptive desulfurization. The meso- or macropores shorten the diffusion path to the internal active sites of the zeolite, which are beneficial for the interaction with bulky molecules.
4.2.3. CO2 Capture
Capturing carbon dioxide is of great importance to mitigate climate change resulting from greenhouse gas emissions. (979) Recent studies reported that the adsorption processes using hierarchically micro-mesoporous zeolites are a promising technology for CO2 capture because they possessed a larger surface area to allow for increased adsorption of CO2. (980,981) Gong et al. (982) reported a biosynthesis route to prepare hierarchically porous SAPO-34 constructed by nanosheets. The obtained hierarchically porous SAPO-34 showed a distinctive morphology with nanosheets and gaps between nanosheets, giving rise to a blooming flowerlike structure. This hierarchically porous SAPO-34 exhibited a much higher CO2 adsorption capacity of 2.77 mmol g1 at 100 kPa with the CO2/CH4 ideal separation factor of 8.2 as compared to the conventional SAPO-34. It took 6.1 min for CO2 to reach the adsorption equilibrium, which was much faster than conventional SAPO-34 due to the nanosheet-constructed porous structure. By combining sacrificial templating and freeze-casting techniques, Besser et al. synthesized hierarchically porous zeolite 13X monoliths. (983) The hierarchically porous monoliths exhibited a high working capacity and a fast CO2 uptake when compared with commercially available zeolite 13X. Ojuva et al. (984) synthesized hierarchical macro-microporous zeolite 13X with a laminar structure by the freeze-casting method. The zeolite showed a high and rapid CO2 adsorption. This hierarchical zeolite 13X exhibited a very fast initial uptake, in which more than half of the maximum uptake was achieved within 15 s. Moreover, ZSM-5 has a good affinity for the CO2 molecule, and the desorption of CO2 from ZSM-5 can be controlled under mild conditions. (985) Hierarchically porous ZSM-5 with a large surface area and an introduced mesoporous structure is expected to be a high-performance adsorbent for CO2 removal. (986) Thus, Liu et al. (987) developed hierarchically porous ZSM-5 using organosilanes as templates and found that the CO2 adsorption capacity was much higher than that of the microporous ZSM-5. The effective improvement of CO2 adsorption mainly originated from the large surface area, which promoted the CO2 adsorption capacity.
4.2.4. Removal of Volatile Organic Compounds
The removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), mainly consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons and aldehydes, is an urgent necessity since these compounds are harmful for the environment and human health. (988) Advanced technologies for reducing VOCs have been well developed, such as adsorption (989,990) and catalytic combustion. (991993)
4.2.4.1. Adsorption of Volatile Organic Compounds
MFI-type zeolites with a purely siliceous form (Silicalite-1) are considered to be potential adsorbents of VOCs. (994) However, the relatively small and sole micropores in conventional zeolites result in relatively slow mass transport, hindering their further use in adsorption processes. (783) Hierarchically porous materials are designed and developed to improve their diffusion performance. Coating or supporting zeolite crystals on the surface of a permanent porous support to fabricate hierarchically porous composites (supported zeolites) has been proven to be an effective method. Yu et al. (989) prepared hierarchically porous diatomite/MFI-type zeolite composites, which exhibited hierarchical porosity with micropores from the microporous zeolite and macropores from the macroporous diatomite support. The prepared composites exhibited higher benzene adsorption capacity per unit mass of zeolite and less mass transfer resistance than microporous Silicalite-1. They further improved the diffusion performance of diatomite/zeolite composites by coating desilicated zeolite crystals on the surface of diatomite. (990) The resultant materials exhibited a special trimodal porosity: macroporosity from the diatomite support, mesoporosity from desilication treatment, and microporosity from MFI-type zeolite. Benzene was used as a model pollutant to evaluate the adsorption performance of the resulting composites for VOCs. The resultant sample exhibited a higher adsorption capacity, better affinity, and faster adsorption kinetics toward benzene than the parent ones. The improved adsorption capacity was attributed to the increase in porosity and the formation of terminal silanol groups on the newly developed pore surface after the desilication treatment. Kabalan et al. (995) investigated the effect of the morphology (microcrystals, nanocrystals, nanosponges, and nanosheets) of MFI and BEA type zeolites on their adsorption capacities of n-hexane at room temperature (Figure 47AD). The adsorption capacity of n-hexane, which was very sensitive to the mesopore volume in the adsorbents, was greatly improved in zeolite nanocrystals or hierarchical nanoporous materials (nanosheets and nanosponges). The n-hexane adsorption capacities of hierarchical MFI and BEA zeolites reached about 790 and 693 mg g1, which were much higher than those of microcrystals (130 and 103 mg g1, respectively, Figure 47E,F).

4.2.4.2. Catalytic Combustion of Volatile Organic Compounds
Catalytic combustion is an efficient, economically feasible, and environmentally friendly technology for the removal of VOCs. Both noble metals (Pt, Pd, and Au) and transition metal oxides (Co3O4, FeOx, MnOx, NiO, ZnO, and CuO) are used as active sites for catalytic combustion of VOCs. Zeolite-supported noble metal nanoparticles were reported to exhibit the best catalytic performance for the combustion of VOCs. (996) However, microporous zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation caused by the poor adsorption and diffusion of reactant molecules. To accelerate the mass transfer, Chen and co-workers (991,997) synthesized mesoporous Beta and mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites and used them as catalytic supports for toluene combustion. The mesoporous zeolites displayed a much better catalytic activity than the conventional ones. Similar results were found in the case of Pt-loaded hierarchically porous MOR zeolite. (992) The materials exhibited a superior catalytic performance and extraordinary long catalyst lifetime in toluene combustion when compared with Pt-loaded microporous zeolites. Wang et al. (993) synthesized Ru/hierarchical ZSM-5 as an efficient bifunctional adsorbent/catalyst system for the removal of bulky aromatic VOCs. The value of turnover frequency of the Ru/hierarchical ZSM-5 was about 2, 3, and 4 times higher than that of Ru/conventional ZSM-5 toward toluene, o-xylene, and TMB combustion, respectively, indicating that the Ru/hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites had a much better performance in catalyzing the combustion of bulkier molecules.
4.3. Biological Applications
The capacity of zeolites as carriers for large biological active species can be improved by introducing meso- or macropores into the microporous structure. The mesopores thus serve as hosts for large biological molecules or metal complexes.
Enzymes are one of the most active and selective biocatalysts used in many chemical reactions. However, the low thermal stability and poor recycling performances severely limit their further use in industry. Many efforts have been devoted to improving the stability and catalytic performance of enzymes by supporting them on different materials. Materials with highly accessible surface areas are typically preferred to obtain high loadings of the catalytic species. Hierarchical zeolites with large external surface area and tunable surface properties have received much interest. Mitchell and Prez-Ramrez (998) studied the application of hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites as carriers for lipase enzymes. Enzymes immobilized on purely inorganic supports exhibited rapid deactivation due to the enzyme leaching. The one-dimensional mesopores of the surface-functionalized MCM-41 resulted in a limited accessibility and a decreased enzyme uptake. In contrast, the interconnected mesopores in the surface-functionalized hierarchical zeolites still remained accessible and showed a good adsorption ability. Lipase immobilized on thiol-functionalized mesoporous ZSM-5 was also an efficient biocatalyst (Figure 48). Similarly, a hierarchical Zn2+-exchanged ZSM-5/fly ash cenosphere material was also prepared for separating two different proteins. (999) Figure 48 Figure 48. (A) Schematic illustration of the immobilization of lipase enzymes on ZSM-5 zeolites with varying surface and textural properties. (B) Relationship between enzyme uptake and mesoporous surface area for the immobilization of lipase AK on unmodified and S- or N-functionalized P, H, HW zeolite-based supports estimated by direct (elemental analysis) and indirect (Bradford) methods.

Moreover, zeolites with a hierarchically porous structure (86) and magnetically separable zeolite nanocrystals (1000) have been reported for the separation or immobilization of biomolecules. The catalysts showed almost the same enzyme-immobilized capacity and biocatalytic activity when compared with the microporous zeolites. Besides, they can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by simple filtration or centrifugation.
Furthermore, the layered zeolite materials provide a large external surface area for the attachment or entrapment of enzyme. Hierarchical ITQ-6 zeolite made by the aggregated nanosheets delaminated from the lamellar precursor of the ferrierite zeolite was employed as an excellent support for immobilization of enzymes and was proven to be an efficiently recyclable enzyme support. (1001,1002) The enzymes were supported on hierarchically structured ITQ-6 zeolites by covalent bonding, resulting in extremely stable catalysts when compared with the enzyme in free form and that chemically bonded to amorphous silica. (1002)
4.4. Conclusions
Hierarchically porous zeolites have attracted continuously increasing interests. Different applications of hierarchically porous zeolites are systematically introduced. Hierarchically porous zeolites are widely used in catalysis, environmental, and biological fields due to their large surface area, shortened mass diffusion path, improved mass transport, and increased accessibility for reactants.
Hierarchically porous zeolites can be effectively used in the catalytic applications. The catalytic reactions with industrial relevance such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion have been chosen to test the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchically porous zeolites exhibited a superior catalytic activity when compared with microporous zeolites, due to the presence of meso- or macropores. Besides, the introduced mesopores also facilitate the escape of coke precursors, thus leading to an improved resistance to coking.
In addition, hierarchically porous zeolites have long been utilized for environmental applications. Their multiple pore sizes leading to reduced diffusion resistance and high surface areas can be expected to improve their performances in wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds. Besides, the diffusion improvement within the hierarchically porous zeolites can significantly increase their adsorption capacity, especially when bulky compounds are present.
Hierarchically porous zeolites are also widely used as biomaterials. Their high external surface area and large pore volume result in increasing bioactivity and offer more choices to be functionalized by different groups for novel properties and improved biocompatibility.
In conclusion, great progress has been made in the field of hierarchically porous zeolites. The integration of multilevel porosities into a single zeolite crystal can offer a large surface area and fast diffusion performance, thus improving the catalytic performances and adsorption/separation properties of the catalyst. To improve the properties of the hierarchically porous zeolite, the hierarchical pore systems should be highly interconnected, and the introduced meso- or preferably macropores should be accessible from the outer surface of the crystal. It is envisioned that many new and exciting applications of the hierarchically porous zeolites will emerge owing to the optimization of tunable meso- or macroporous zeolite structures.
5. Conclusion and Future Trends
The field of hierarchically porous zeolites in general has seen tremendous growth during the past decades. The main motivation is to reduce the diffusion limitations of molecules that are imposed by the micropores in the conventional zeolites. Many new approaches, herein classified as either the in situ approach or postsynthetic approach, have been developed. Most bottom-up strategies involve the use of meso- or macroscale templates, either direct templates, such as the hard template and soft template, or indirect templates, such as inert composite partners and active composite partners. Optimal interactions between the templates and the silicate or aluminosilicate species in the zeolite synthesis gels are essential for the success of the in situ approach. Different synthesis methods result in different meso- or macroporosity. Thus, in order to realize better catalytic performances in zeolites, efforts should be made to achieve the optimal balance between the introduced mesoporosity, the intrinsic microporosity, and the best control of the amount, location, size distribution, and interconnectivity of the additional pores. In addition, the economic and environmental costs should be considered due to the relatively expensive and irretrievable templates. Although the in situ approach without the use of templates has been reported, it is still difficult for a large-scale synthesis due to the time-consuming preparative procedure and the rigid synthesis condition.
In the postsynthetic approach, demetalation was known for about half a century. The important issue is that not all of the mesopores are open to the external surface of the zeolite crystals. Thus, they cannot fully enhance the diffusion through zeolites. Dealumination was first developed and widely used in industry. However, the number of acid sites decreased with the Al-extraction from the framework. The desilication is another demetalation method to create hierarchical porosity by dissolving Si in the zeolite framework. Other methods like the delamination approach lead to the exposure of a larger fraction of the highly acidic zeolite surface for adsorption and catalysis. Nevertheless, it can be applied only to a small range of zeolites. Besides, the high surfactant content and the alkalinity used for the delamination process result in the partial dissolution of the zeolite framework. Zeolite recrystallization through the initial desilication/depolymerization and the following reassembling process in the presence of conventional surfactants gives high yield and relatively low environmental damage when compared with the demetallization, delamination, and the in situ approach. For example, the FCC catalysts using mesoporous zeolite Y prepared by zeolite recrystallization were scaled up and successfully utilized in North American refineries. (381) Although various hierarchical zeolites can be prepared, the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites with high structural stability and the design of such multimodal porous zeolitic materials with a better understanding of the cooperation between different pore systems still remain great challenges. Based on the analysis of the function of each pore system, the hierarchical zeolites with an interconnected micro-meso-macroporous structure are supposed to be the most efficient materials. Developing new synthesis strategies to effectively construct the ideal hierarchical pore architecture with low economic cost and environmental damage and wide versatility still remains a great challenge.
Three different types of hierarchically porous zeolites are distinguished and systematically discussed according to their different levels of porosity, the micro-mesoporous structured zeolites, the micro-macroporous structured zeolites, and the micro-meso-macroporous structured zeolites. Concrete examples are given to show how to select and to combine different preparation strategies to fabricate each type of hierarchically structured zeolite.
In catalytic, environmental, and biological applications, hierarchically porous zeolites prove to be the most desirable catalysts/adsorbents/supports. This is due to the introduced meso- or macropores into the microporous zeolites which can significantly accelerate the mass transport, reduce the diffusion path of the reactants, and improve the accessibility of the active sites, thus leading to an increased performance in certain applications. Some industrially relevant reactions, such as the FriedelCrafts reaction, the Beckmann rearrangement, the FischerTropsch synthesis process, the hydroconversion process, the oxidation reaction, the transformation of methanol, the catalytic cracking reaction, and the biomass conversion, are selected to evaluate the catalytic performance of hierarchically porous zeolites. The hierarchical zeolite catalysts exhibited a superior catalytic activity, selectivity, and lifetime when compared with microporous zeolites due to the improved mass transport and the shortened diffusion path length. In addition, the multilevel pores in the hierarchically porous zeolites offer reduced diffusion resistance and high surface areas for an improved adsorption performance, especially when bulky compounds are present, in wastewater treatment, adsorptive desulfurization, CO2 capture, and removal of volatile organic compounds. Besides, hierarchically porous zeolites are also widely used in the biological domain owing to their high surface area and large pore volume which would improve their bioactive behavior for biological species and allow them to be loaded with various functional groups to obtain excellent new functionalities, new properties, and biocompatibility. The above-mentioned large variety of existing and promising industrial applications is largely due to the benefits of a larger additional pore system in the microporous zeolites. Many new and exciting applications could be found after creating hierarchically porous zeolites with optimized properties.
Although a large volume of research is found in the scientific literature, few reports focus on the establishment of the quantitative link between the performance and the amount, location, size, shape, and dimension of each porosity to find the principles and rules for the design of materials with predictable properties. The design and preparation of high-performance hierarchically porous materials still remain quite empirical. We still follow the trialtestingmodificationretesting process to reach the optimized, but not the best, target materials. Such a situation is due to the lack of principles, rules, and theories in the design of advanced materials.
Learning from nature could be an important inspiration to find the concrete examples which serve as rules to follow and to emulate. The evolution by selection gives various classes of hierarchically porous organisms, in which pore sizes decrease along different scales and end in units of constant size, such as those found in plant stems, leaf veins, and vascular and respiratory systems. These living hierarchically porous systems connected within a finite volume can minimize transport resistance and ensure accelerated transfer over the entire hierarchical system as a decisive factor for organisms. To maximize the exchange surface, the living hierarchically porous networks of organisms have to be evolved with macropores, expanded by multisized pores with increasing amounts but decreasing diameters. In 1926, Murray, an American biologist, established for the first time, on the basis of numerous examples of living hierarchically porous systems, an empirical equation referred to as Murrays law with precise diameter ratios for interconnected multiscale pores from macroscopic to microscopic levels to quantitatively describe living hierarchically porous systems of organisms. Indeed, Murrays law stipulates the optimized hierarchical design for porous materials and chemical reactions with maximized transfer properties. However, since its discovery, Murrays law has not received the merit it deserved. Only few works in the design of chemical reactors based on Murrays law can be found in the literature. (10031005) The main issue is that Murrays law is only an empiric description of hierarchically porous systems of organisms but does not consider the mass variation and constant surface substance exchange during the mass transportation. Sus group very recently revisited the Murrays law and developed a generalized Murrays law taking the mass variation and constant surface substance exchange into account during the mass transportation. (10) Such a generalized Murrays law has been used to design and synthesize a series of bioinspired hierarchically porous materials which emulate the natural vascular structure whose pore sizes decrease across macro-meso-micrometer scales and finally terminate in size-invariant, as in leaves, and blood vascular and respiratory systems. (10) The obtained biomimics enable highly enhanced mass exchange and transfer in liquidsolid, gassolid, and electrochemical reactions and exhibit outstanding properties in photocatalysis, gas sensing, and Li-ion batteries. (10) This first example of learning from nature can serve as a guideline and lead to further inspiration in the quantitative design and synthesis of high-performance hierarchically porous materials with a desirable texture and advanced properties.Recently, following such a generalized Murrays law, Sus group again successfully synthesized hierarchically mesoporous ZSM-5 single crystals, containing a micro-mesoporous structure. (674) The hierarchical ZSM-5 materials showed superior catalytic activity, twice as high as that shown by the bulky ZSM-5 in the catalytic cracking reaction of isopropyl benzene owing to its high mass transfer. Besides, this type of unique ZSM-5 also has outstanding thermal/hydrothermal stability because of its bioinspired hierarchically porous structure which leads to homogeneous heat and vapor transfer and dissipation. A smart moisture-wicking fabric based on biomimetic micro- and nanofibrous membranes with macro-, micron-, and submicron-sized pores obeying the generalized Murrays law by introducing the surface energy gradient has been prepared. Such biomimetic membranes with multibranched pores possessed an excellent moisture-wicking performance, far superior to the conventional porous membranes. (1006) Based on this, Su and co-workers further demonstrated an in situ bottom-up confined crystallization process to synthesize a zeolite ZSM-5 single-crystal reactor (OMMS-ZSM-5) (1007) and zeolite Beta single-crystal reactor (OMMS-Beta) (1008) that have a fully interconnected and highly ordered intracrystalline macro-meso-microporosity. Such a novel hierarchically porous structure offering accelerated mass transport and improved accessibility to active sites can not only increase catalytic activities and lifetime of OMMS-ZSM-5 in the bulky-molecule cracking process and methanol-to-olefins reaction (1007) but also greatly enhance catalytic performances of OMMS-Beta in gas-phase and liquid-phase acid-catalyzed reactions involving bulky molecules. (1008) Most importantly, such a strategy is quite simple and versatile and has been extended to the synthesis of other zeolitic materials, including TS-1 and SAPO-34.
Through rational and quantitative design based on this generalized Murrays law, the performance of materials can be significantly ameliorated, and in particular, the bioinspired hierarchically porous material design based on this generalized Murrays law can achieve predictable and optimized functions.
The new era of material-properties-by-quantitative and real rational design based on the generalized Murrays law that enables the predictable and controlled production of bioinspired hierarchically porous materials with a quantitative hierarchy in terms of amount, location, shape, size, and dimension at every micro-meso-macrometer length scale for optimized structural features and outstanding performance can emerge. Hierarchically porous materials with highly enhanced efficiency, minimum energy, time, and raw material consumption can also revolutionize the design of reactors for a sustainable life.
