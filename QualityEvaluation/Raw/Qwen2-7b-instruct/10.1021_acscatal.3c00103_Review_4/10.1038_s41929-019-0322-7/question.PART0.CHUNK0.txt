Transition state and product diffusion control by polymernanocrystal hybrid catalysts Effective catalysts stabilize specific transition states and control the transport of species to and from catalytically active sites. Enzymes show these traits thanks to their diverse amino acid functional groups encapsulating metal centres, but are limited in the reaction conditions in which they can operate. Realizing a catalyst with this kinetic and transport control that can be used under demanding industrial conditions is challenging. Here, we show a modular approach for the systematic synthesis of polymernanocrystal hybrids, where palladium nanocrystals are encapsulated within tunable microporous polymer layers. The polymer chemistry and morphology control the catalytic performance of the metal sites, affecting the transition state for CO oxidation and controlling the transport of CO2 away from the active site. This approach can be applied to other polymernanocrystal compositions and catalytic applications, and is therefore expected to have an impact in many areas of catalysis.
Main In designing a catalyst for any reaction, the simultaneous control of aspects like transport of species to and from the active site and the stabilization of specific transitions states plays a role in determining catalyst behaviour. Enzymes are formidable catalysts, designed by evolution, that carry out chemical reactions at room temperature with high selectivity and activity. They control transport of species to and from their Ångstrom-sized pocket active sites, with diverse functionality in their porous polymeric architectures brought about from chemically diverse amino acid monomers. The same chemical diversity within the enzyme active sites alters the energetic landscape of catalytic intermediates and products, allowing enzymes to undergo alternative catalytic pathways, drastically altering the reaction rates and product distributions1. Mimicking the chemical diversity and three-dimensional (3D) nature of the biopolymer-encapsulated metal centres in engineered heterogeneous catalysts is a pathway to higher performing and more stable catalyst systems2. Previous work has focused on using organometallic complexes3, molecularly imprinted silica4, functional tethered complexes5 and metal-exchanged zeolites6 to achieve this goal. Despite the successes, these systems are limited in functional group selection and/or stability.
Beyond enzyme-inspired catalysts, there are other materials that draw upon the useful features of enzymes to modulate the activity of catalyst surfaces through various means. Introduction of an organic surface layer onto transition metal catalysts, through either an ordered material such as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)7 or with modification with addition of a functional ligand8, has been shown to increase the selectivity of several reactions. This approach is flexible in terms of the potential functionality of surface modifiers, yet the stability of the modifying layer remains a limit because, for a majority of systems, the modifiers are attached through a single bond to the metal surface. Encapsulating nanoparticles in a modifying support material is also a promising approach documented by several researchers. Depending on the encapsulating material, increased selectivity, specific activity or catalyst stability to agglomeration or leaching have been observed. In situ nanoparticle formation from precursor reduction in dendrimers has been shown to yield interesting catalysts that are stable during liquid-phase reactions, where the chemistry of the supporting dendrimer can be changed analogously to homogeneous metal complexes, adding tools into catalyst design9,10. The necessity of in situ reduction, however, dictates that nanoparticle composition and morphology are dependent on the supporting dendrimer, limiting the scope of the approach. Ordered organic materials such as metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with relevant length scale pore morphologies have also been used to encapsulate and modify the activity of metal nanoparticles, for example, increasing the selectivity of hydrogenation due to the presence of a physical barrier in a ZIF-8/Pt hybrid system11 or through favourable interactions with the MOF metal linker site in a MIL-101/Pt hybrid system12 or creating active nitrophenol reduction catalysts from Pd particles encapsulated in a COF13. Crystalline encapsulating materials have the benefit of a precisely determined structure, but can be less accommodating to structural changes associated with including alternative functional groups in linking materials. The structural stability of MOFs in solvent environments, where metal linking sites double as both structurally important and chemically reactive centres, also puts limitations on the applicability of MOF-encapsulated nanoparticle catalysts. Encapsulating catalyst nanoparticles in metal oxides has also been shown to be beneficial. For instance, Pt and Pt alloys in SiO2 have been shown to be promising in preserving the precise surface structure required for high selectivity in furfural hydrogenation14, and colloidal Pd@CeO2 coreshell nanoparticles have demonstrated increased methane combustion activity15. Despite these efforts, the potential for introducing diverse functional groups targeting several catalytic reactions remains limited with metal oxide encapsulation. Zeolites combine the chemical aspect of metal oxide encapsulation yet contain a microporous environment, giving access to confinement effects16. They also lack the chemical diversity of amino acid residues in enzymes and independent control over the geometry, chemistry and composition of catalytic active sites, but have proven to be highly active by mimicking the confinement of enzymes around their acid active sites16. In general, previous work shows that encapsulation of active catalyst phases is a promising way to improve catalytic performance, but the potential of such approaches has not been fully explored so far.
Microporous polymers are a class of materials that have emerged recently17,18 and that have found uses in gas storage and separation19. These materials contain the micropores that are necessary for confinement-driven catalysis, like in zeolites and some MOF-encapsulated materials, and also hold the promise of a higher degree of functionalization being possible with inclusion of additional chemical functional groups in monomers with high thermo-chemical stability. By introducing functional groups that affect gas adsorption properties into microporous polymers, in principle it could be possible to affect the transport properties of reactive species through polymer pores as well as the energetic properties of catalytic intermediates that are present within microporous cavities.
In this Article, we introduce a modular approach for the systematic synthesis of 3D active sites by encapsulating colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) within microporous polymer layers (porous organic frameworks, POFs). We can tune POF morphology and chemical functionality, as well as nanocrystal size and composition. The POFs studied are demonstrated to be stable under high-temperature CO oxidation conditions for over 40h. The polymer layers provide a confined environment that drastically changes the catalytic performance of the metal surfaces. We observe an increase in catalytic rate for CO oxidation and the appearance of reaction oscillations, only when specific POF layers cover their surface. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that the increase in rate is related to the entropic stabilization of a product-like intermediate by the polymer layers surrounding the Pd surface. Reaction oscillations are also shown to depend on the polymer layer chemistry, with POF layers rich in amino groups controlling the diffusion of CO2 away from the active metal site. We demonstrate the ability to regulate these changes in reactivity by controlling the POF layer chemical composition, as suggested by CO2 adsorption measurements. This approach has the potential to be extended to several other combinations of polymerNC hybrid materials and catalytic reactions, and is therefore expected to have an impact in many areas of catalysis.
Results Synthesis and characterization of the hybrid catalysts We use Pd NCs as a prototypical metal example to demonstrate the impact of the POF layer on catalytic performance. To construct the Pd/POF composites, we followed the sequence of steps shown in Fig. 1a (and in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1be). Organic POF materials18 and inorganic NCs20 were synthesized separately and NCs were deposited onto the POF by impregnation, where both NCs and POF were suspended in a solution of hexanes and stirred. Particles adhered to the surface of the POF after this step, as shown in the representative TEM micrographs in Fig. 1c. This step allowed full tunability of the NC mass loading using uniform metal particles, given that the relative concentrations of POF and NCs and the chemistry of the POF and NC composition can be changed. Ligands on the Pd surface were removed by thermal treatment in air at 300C (ref. 21) while maintaining unreacted functional groups on the POF surface (Supplementary Fig. 1a,f). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) before and after deposition demonstrated that the Pd/POF materials are stable at least up to 300C in air (Supplementary Fig. 1b), ensuring that despite a loss in surface area and microporosity (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d), the mass is mostly conserved. To build the 3D active sites, Pd/POF materials were introduced back into a polymer growth solution at 180C, where the POF monomers were reacted with the POF surface to grow additional layers to encapsulate the Pd NCs, affording POF/Pd/POF. Nitrogen physisorption experiments demonstrated that the additional POF layers provide microporosity and increased surface area (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Because these new layers are formed immediately around the Pd NCs, the metal phase is encapsulated within the POF containing these micropores (0.51.0nm). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements demonstrated that these pore structures are stable to at least 275C given the lack of measurable glass transition temperature (Supplementary Fig. 1e).

From left to right: Pd NCs and POF are synthesized separately, according to the literature, with melamine and terephthaldehyde. The Pd NCs are attached to the POF surface via van der Waals forces, then stabilizing ligands are removed from the Pd surface using a thermal air treatment. Finally, additional polymer growth is performed in the presence of the Pd/POF material. be, Representative TEM images for each step in a during the course of the synthetic protocol: NCs (b); 3% by weight Pd/POF (c); the same sample of 3% by weight Pd/POF after thermal treatment (d); 3% by weight Pd/POF encapsulated in additional POF, resulting in 1% Pd POF/Pd/POF (e). fi, Particle size distributions calculated from TEM images of the Pd NCs at each corresponding step (be) of the synthesis (minimum number of particles counted N=150).
Full size image Pd particle size does not change until the last step (Fig. 1be), where sulfur incorporation in the Pd NCs by solvent decomposition causes it to slightly increase. Sulfur is fully removed by a mild activation treatment before catalysis (see below). The chemistry of the outer POF layers can be controlled independently of the Pd/POF chemistry by simply changing the monomers used during the last synthesis step. For example, by replacing the melamine used for POF with 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (to produce di-POF) or 2,4-diamino-6-phenyl-1,3,5-triazine (to produce ph-POF), the chemistry of the polymer layers is altered while maintaining micropores (Supplementary Fig. 2). In these specific POFs we can alter the total nitrogen content from 50% (wt/wt) with di-POF to 45% in POF and 31% with ph-POF in their hypothesized structures.
Several techniques can demonstrate the encapsulation of Pd NCs in POF. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADFSTEM) images (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3) show areas of high NC density (bright spots) several nanometres within a shell of polymer material with lower contrast. Because TEM images are 2D representations of 3D objects, HAADFSTEM electron tomography was performed on several POF/Pd/POF microparticles to derive a 3D picture of the hybrid materials (Supplementary Video). NCs were not observed on the surface of the polymer in the 3D reconstructed volumes (Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Video) in any analysed polymer particle, confirming that polymer layers surround Pd NCs. The majority of NCs reside a few nanometres from the exterior surface of the composite particles, which is consistent with TEM images. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Pd/POF sample shows an intense contribution from Pd on the surface of the POF (Fig. 2d). By contrast, XPS results from a POF/Pd/POF sample with equivalent Pd mass loading and particle size do not show a Pd signal (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). This observation indicates that Pd NCs are fully covered with POF layers. Given the surface sensitivity of XPS, we conclude that all Pd in the sample is buried in at least 45nm of POF (see Methods), which agrees with the HAADFSTEM characterization where a layer thickness of >10nm is observed in all images (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). In situ C60 sputtering, which removes the POF outer layer, yields a detectable Pd signal, thus providing further proof that Pd is subsurface in the POF/Pd/POF composites (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, CO chemisorption experiments for all samples exhibit Langmuir adsorption isotherms expected for Pd surfaces binding CO strongly (Fig. 2e). The adsorbed CO on Pd/POF is consistent with a majority of the surface exposed on 7nm Pd NCs. The adsorbed amount is much lower following encapsulation, with a decrease in adsorption dependent on the POF layer chemistry. This observation suggests that the Pd surface interacts with the microporous polymer layers, causing a decrease in the amount of CO adsorbed as the layers are grown around the NCs (Fig. 2e). A decreasing trend in the adsorbed volumes with increasing nitrogen content of the POF outer layer (from lowest to highest going from ph-POF to POF and to di-POF) also suggests tunable metalPOF interactions mapping to amine content in the additional POF layer.

Full size image Polymer effects on transition state for CO oxidation We use CO oxidation (2CO+O22CO2) as a prototypical reaction to study the influence of POF layers on Pd reactivity, given the large literature on this reaction22. CO oxidation on Pt-group metal catalysts is generally described to proceed with a LangmuirHinschelwood mechanism with adsorbed CO* and O* species reacting to form CO2, which quickly desorbs from the metal surface23. CO binds strongly to the metal surface and competes for open sites for oxygen activation, making CO desorption and oxygen activation the rate-determining step23,24. For this reason, CO oxidation below 200C has in the literature been reported to follow the following rate law: rate=kapparent[O2]1[CO]1 (refs. 23,24). We tested our materials for their catalytic effect on this reaction. Figure 3a shows Eyring plots with kinetic data on several catalysts under the same conditions and with the same Pd mass loading and NC size: a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst for comparison; a Pd/POF sample; encapsulated POF/Pd/POF, di-POF/Pd/POF and ph-POF/Pd/POF. A mild oxidative activation was used to remove a sulfur-containing phase (Supplementary Fig. 4). In all samples in which POF layers are present on the surface of the Pd NCs (POF/Pd/POF, di-POF/Pd/POF and ph-POF/Pd/POF), the turnover frequency (TOF, rate per exposed Pd atom) is consistently higher compared to the Pd/POF catalyst by as much as an order of magnitude. This observation has been repeated several times with independently synthesized samples (Supplementary Fig. 5ac).

Error bars report the standard deviation of N=3 replicates of H and S each calculated from fitting separate kinetic experiments of four data points spaced by at least 10C. d, Calculated values of transition state Gibbs free energy as a function of temperature. eg, Proposed transition state models for exposed Pd surfaces (such as in Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/POF), non-interacting POF-covered Pd surfaces (such as in ph-POF/Pd/POF) and strongly interacting POF layers (such as in POF/Pd/POF and di-POF/Pd/POF), respectively.
Full size image We use transition state theory to explain the differences in reactivity and observe clear trends in the values for change in transition state enthalpy H and entropy S for the rate-limiting step (Fig. 3b,c). Three samples with either no POF layer (Pd/Al2O3, Pd/POF) or with an apparently non-interacting POF layer (ph-POF/Pd/POF) yielded similar values of H (7612kJmol1, 784kJmol1 and 747kJmol1, respectively, Fig. 3b) and S (4530Jmol1K1, 5017Jmol1K1 and 5717Jmol1K1, respectively, Fig. 3c). We labeled ph-POF/Pd/POF as a material with a non-interacting POF layer based on CO2 adsorption experiments (see below). The similarity in these values indicates that the reaction proceeds through a similar activated complex in these materials, assuming a LangmuirHinschelwood mechanism. Given the negative values of S but the favourable H, this complex involves a bound transition state that is penalized in entropy but stabilized by strong chemisorption to the Pd surface, in agreement with previous work that proposed alternative strongly bound and weakly bound transitions states for CO oxidation under differing conditions in single-crystal studies25.
In the case of the samples with interacting POF layers (POF/Pd/POF and di-POF/Pd/POF) which show higher TOFs, the kinetic parameters drastically change. The transition state on these samples has less favourable H (1207kJmol1 and 1406kJmol1, respectively), but positive and much more favourable S (6020Jmol1K1 and 11615Jmol1K1, respectively). This fact leads to a lower free energy of activation at elevated temperatures (Fig. 3d). The desorption enthalpy of CO from a Pd(111) surface has been reported to be 135kJmol1 (ref. 26), which closely maps the H for these two latter samples. Based on these values, we hypothesize that a weaker bound or partially desorbed transition state exists for the mechanism in the polymer-encapsulated systems, where the polymer functional groups interact strongly with the Pd surface. Polymer layers stabilize the less bound, more CO2-like late transition state through Lewis acid interaction of CO2 with nitrogen lone pairs on the amino groups of the POF layers. This hypothesis is further supported with measured CO rate orders. Unencapsulated Pd/POF as well as ph-POF/Pd/POF yield CO rate orders of approximately 1, consistent with CO oxidation literature (Supplementary Fig. 5dg). On the other hand, catalysts with interacting POF overlayers, such as POF/Pd/POF and di-POF/Pd/POF, have rate orders of approximately 0.8 and 0.75, respectively. These less negative rate orders for CO indicate that the Pd surfaces in these samples are less poisoned by CO, which allows for increased activity of these samples. This result agrees with the picture of a transition state for CO oxidation in these materials that is less bound to the Pd surface, given that CO surface poisoning affects these catalysts to a lesser degree.
Because of the statistically significant difference between the two series of samples in terms of the energetics of the CO oxidation transition state as well as CO rate orders (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5), we postulate that the reaction is taking place through different, more or less bound, transition states, as reported schematically in Fig. 3eg. The di-POF/Pd/POF and ph-POF/Pd/POF catalysts differ by 20% in amine content, yet contain nearly identical morphology (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), and they appear to perform CO oxidation through two different transition states and with different CO rate orders, leading to the conclusion that amine groups in the POF overlayer are affecting the transition state. We do not expect all active sites in these materials to be exactly the same given the amorphous nature of the composites. However, when tuning the bulk properties of the encapsulating layers by changing their chemistry, the multitude of structurally distinct active sites having similar reactive properties appear to be affected by the polymer layers in a similar way, leading to a difference in the measured ensemble reactivity. Similar to enzymes, which use secondary interactions between amino acids and intermediates to influence the catalytic pathway, specifically the entropy of the transition state, we here demonstrate that POF layers can be tuned to drastically affect the nature of the transition state in the CO oxidation reaction.
Polymer effects on CO2 transport during CO oxidation The polymer layers also affect the macroscopic properties of composite catalysts. When CO conversion is monitored as a function of temperature, the sample with largely exposed Pd surfaces supported on POF shows a typical behaviour with a steep increase in CO2 yield observed over a short temperature range (light off, Fig. 4a). The activity of the encapsulated material POF/Pd/POF, however, shows a very different behaviour: when the CO conversion reaches 20% at around 180C, sustained oscillations in the reaction rate appear, with the CO conversion ranging at this point between 20% and 90% over a few seconds (Fig. 4a). Because no similar oscillations are observed in the Pd/POF sample even under drastically varied reaction conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6), the oscillations must be correlated with the introduction of the POF layer, interacting with the Pd surfaces. These oscillations are strongly dependent on temperature (Fig. 4b), with decreasing amplitude as the temperature (and CO conversion) increases, until reaching full conversion. Given that the samples are activated at high temperature for prolonged periods of time before reaction and that the oscillations are stable for more than 40h (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7), they are not due to combustion of the polymer. Furthermore, when CO is removed from the feed stream, no CO2 is formed, again demonstrating that CO2 is produced by CO oxidation (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Additionally, the same phenomenon is observed on similar POF/Pt/POF materials (Supplementary Fig. 9), highlighting that the oscillations are not limited to Pd surfaces.

Full size image Reaction oscillations during CO oxidation on Pt-group metals are known, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this behaviour, including thermal and mass transport limitations, particle reconstruction and most commonly changes in the oxidation state of the metal27,28,29,30. We study the oscillations in detail to better understand the reactivity of our hybrid materials and their potential similarities with enzyme reactivity. To test whether a change in oxidation state explains the appearance of oscillations, we carried out operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments on three timescales using 3.4nm Pd NCs encapsulated in POF: single energy adsorption coefficient measurements with >1s resolution; Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements with 30s resolution; finally Pd K-edge EXAFS measurements with 120s resolution. POF/Pd/POF with 3.4nm Pd crystals provides a more highly exposed metallic surface to increase surface sensitivity and more readily observe surface oxidation state changes; this also displayed oscillatory behaviour in the same CO oxidation conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6). The 3.4nm POF/Pd/POF sample was placed under conditions that promote oscillations (as measured in situ) and the X-ray absorption coefficient of the sample at 24,375.0eV was measured. This value was chosen as it is the energy corresponding to the largest differential in absorption between Pd metal and PdO standards. No significant changes in absorption during the course of several catalyst oscillations were observed (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Under similar oscillatory conditions we performed fast XANES measurements in operando with >15 repeated measurements entirely within the high and low conversion regimes of the catalyst activity (Fig. 4c). Throughout all scans, no discernible changes in the spectra were observed as evidenced by the >30 overlayed scans in Fig. 4c all overlapping. A change as small as 2.5% in oxidation state would be detectable with this method based on linear combination fit models (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Given the large fraction of exposed Pd surface atoms (30% for a 3.4nm NC), synchronized surface oxidation and reduction of even 10% of the Pd surface atoms contained in the catalytic bed would be discernible. As such, operando XANES provides evidence that oxidation state change of the Pd is not the reason for the oscillations observed under reaction conditions. Rapid operando EXAFS measurements (120s per scan) under the same conditions led to the same conclusion, with no statistically significant difference in PdO or PdPd coordination observed throughout 25 measurements (the period of the oscillation is nearly the duration of an EXAFS scan) (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10g). Figure 4d displays the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the EXAFS portion of Pd K-edge spectra taken in series during CO oxidation oscillations. Fitting of these spectra to models including potential PdPd and PdO neighbouring atoms allows determination of the average Pd coordination geometry within the catalytic bed. Pd coordination number does not correlate with the phase of the oscillation in activity, nor does it vary statistically throughout the duration of the operando experiment (Supplementary Fig. 10fh). Previous literature studies on the oscillatory phenomena on Pd supported on carbon using both in situ XANES and EXAFS were able to determine both periodic shifts in the Pd K-edge position and in the PdPd path peak magnitude at 2.45Å in the Fourier transformed Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra that correlated with oscillations in CO oxidation activity31. In light of this literature and given the constant electronic state of Pd in POF/Pd/POF during oscillations in activity as measured by three separate XAS techniques, we believe that Pd surface oxidation/reduction cycles are not responsible for the observed oscillations in activity.
POF layer chemistry, instead, does affect the oscillatory behaviour of the encapsulated Pd systems. In light-off experiments with equivalent space velocity based on catalyst mass, we note that ph-POF/Pd/POF shows activity typical of a Pd catalyst supported on a non-interacting material (such as Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/POF; Supplementary Fig. 7e), with a steep increase in activity at 175C. In contrast, the di-POF/Pd/POF sample shows oscillatory rates in the temperature range of 175240C, similar to the POF/Pd/POF sample. Although the oscillation intensity and period are probably affected by the specific space velocity of the experiment (see Supplementary Fig. 7f for other space velocity values under steady-state conditions where all three catalysts exhibit oscillations in activity), nonetheless it suggests that there are differences between the samples. Given the similar morphology of these two POF layers in terms of surface area and pore size (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), we conclude that the chemical changes brought by the different chemical environments of the polymer layers surrounding the Pd surface are responsible for the oscillations. The diverging CO2 adsorption affinity of the different POF layer compositions (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 11ac) provides a rationale for this conclusion. By calculating the heats of adsorption of CO2, there is a clear trend showing that the lower-nitrogen-containing layer (ph-POF) shows the lowest isosteric heat of adsorption of 25kJmol1 at 0.2mmolg1. This value decreases at increased CO2 loading, approaching the condensation heat of pure CO2 (17kJmol1), indicating a relatively weak interaction between CO2 and the polymer pore walls32. Both POF and di-POF showed more negative values for the CO2 heat of adsorption (31 and 37kJmol1 at 0.2mmolg1 loading, respectively), indicating a stronger physical adsorption of CO2 onto the POF surfaces containing a higher density of amino groups.
Surface diffusion model for oscillations in CO oxidation It has been shown that increases in amine content in such polymers can decrease the transport of CO2 through the formation of carbamate-like species33. To better quantify the relationship between the CO2 adsorption and apparent mass transport for reactant and product species in our materials, we measured the average rates of reaction at high temperature, where activities and conversions are outside the kinetic regime and more subject to mass transport effects. We find that the average rate in these conditions normalized by the expected intrinsic rate directly correlates with the CO2 adsorption energy of the POF overlayer (Fig. 4f). The sample with di-POF as an overlayer, with consequently stronger CO2 adsorption, shows the greatest divergence from completely kinetic rates, and the ph-POF coated sample shows a modest increase in apparent rate (which can be explained by the differences in reaction conditions). The correlation of mass-transport-affected rate of CO oxidation with POF layer affinity for CO2 (Fig. 4f) follows this logic, where relatively weak interactions with CO2 allow the ph-POF/Pd/POF sample to operate with effective rates higher than predicted (due to the TOF measurements being taken at below 5% conversion, where greater CO pressure poisons the Pd surfaces), whereas strong interactions with CO2 in di-POF/Pd/POF decrease the rates relative to the predicted per site rate by nearly an order of magnitude, strongly evidencing a mass-transport-controlled rate. These data strongly support the concept that the functional polymer layers can drastically affect the mass transport of species to and from the active sites.
Surface diffusion is known to govern the transport of gas molecules in microporous solids that possess surface adsorption sites, because overlapping surface forces contributed by opposite pore walls are the dominant force on diffusing molecules34,35,36,37. Because the hybrid catalysts in this study are microporous and contain potential adsorption sites (Supplementary Figs. 1c and 2d,e), surface diffusion describes transport better than classical Knudsen diffusion for diffusing gases. In surface diffusion, because of the continual influence of the wall on transport, a useful interpretation is of diffusing molecules hopping or jumping from one adsorption site to another in each wall collision38,39. Although never escaping the wall potential, such hops or jumps require molecules to partially desorb from adsorption sites37,38. The activation energy for this partial desorption depends linearly on the strength of the interaction of the molecule and the wall, with stronger interactions causing a decrease in transport rates37,38. This effect on the surface diffusion coefficient Ds can be determined from the heat of adsorption of the gas in the material with equations (1) and (2) (adapted from ref. 37):$$D_{\mathrm{s}}\left( T \right) = D_{\mathrm{so}}e{\frac{{a{\mathrm{\Delta}} H}}{{RT}}}$$ (1) $$D_{\mathrm{so}} = 0.25\,\nu _{\mathrm{o}}\lambda _{\mathrm{s}}2$$ (2) where the temperature-independent diffusion coefficient at zero coverage (Dso) is calculated as a function of the vibrational frequency of the bond holding molecules in place (νo) and the mean free path of the molecule jumping between adsorption sites (λs). The temperature dependence is captured with constant a multiplied by the isosteric heat of adsorption ΔH. We apply these equations to the different POF layers with approximations of the parameters a, νo and λs as described in the Methods to calculate values of the temperature-dependent surface diffusion coefficients. Supplementary Fig. 11d displays how the coefficients increase with temperature but with different magnitudes for the POF materials with different chemistry, given the exponential dependence on isosteric heat of adsorption. The values of Ds are in line with previous work on a similar microporous amine-containing polymer with CO2 (ref. 33, extrapolated Ds (CO2 in polymer)=1.5×106cm2s1 at 120C) and similar-molecular-weight hydrocarbons diffusing in silica gel (ref. 36, Ds (propane in silica gel)=2.8×105cm2s1 at 125C, pore size=1.1nm) (see comparison in Supplementary Fig. 11d). That the resultant calculated CO2 surface diffusion coefficients using equations (1) and (2) for the POFs in this study (1.7×106 to 1.7×105cm2s1 at 100C) are bounded by these literature values is promising given that the literature material with a lower bound surface diffusion coefficient is highly microporous (0.7nm pores) and contains a high degree of absorbing primary amines, whereas the literature material with a higher bound surface diffusion coefficient contains larger (1.1nm) pores and only weakly absorbs the diffusing molecule. As expected, the values of Ds for the di-POF material are nearly one order of magnitude smaller than the values for the ph-POF material in a wide range of temperatures of interest for the CO oxidation reaction, and the POF material shows values that are intermediate between the two. This difference is expected given the larger density of amino groups present in the di-POF material that determine a larger number of stronger interacting sites for CO2 adsorption, and is in line with the values of the heat of adsorption (Fig. 4e).
Using the calculated values of the diffusion coefficients, we investigated whether CO2 surface diffusion from the active Pd surface (where it is produced by the CO oxidation reaction) through the microporous POF to the gas phase could be responsible for the observed oscillations in reactivity. Because of the much weaker interactions between CO and O2 with the amine groups in POF compared to CO2, we only consider CO2 in the calculations because it will diffuse more slowly. In a model system under the same flow conditions as in the light-off curves shown in Fig. 5ac, we model the surface diffusion flux of CO2 through 10nm of POF material, comparable to the situation in the POFNC hybrid catalysts in CO oxidation. We calculate the CO2 surface diffusion rate as unidirectional surface diffusion of CO2 from the Pd surface out through a 10nm microporous POF layer to the hypothetical boundary of a POFNC hybrid catalyst with the gas phase, with the pressure gradient assumed to be from \(p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}\)=0.025bar on the reactive Pd side down to \(p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}\)=0bar in the bulk gas phase, allowing for calculation of the maximum possible rate. We assume equal cross-sectional areas of the POF through which CO2 may diffuse and the reactive Pd surface area, which allows for calculation of a per site maximum surface diffusion rate, which we compare with the per site average reaction rate for a given conversion. In the case in which the CO2 surface diffusion rate is lower than the CO oxidation rate, the catalytic activity will be governed by surface diffusion, thus leading to a surface diffusion-limited regime. If, instead, the maximum possible surface diffusion is faster than the CO oxidation rate, the kinetics of the reaction will govern the reactivity, thus leading to a reaction rate-limited regime that represents a more classical case of a CO oxidation catalyst. These two regimes are calculated and depicted in Fig. 5df with two different colours and a line that reports conversion values where surface diffusion and reaction kinetic rates become equal. These calculations predict that surface diffusion of CO2 through ph-POF layers with weak CO2 adsorption should not affect CO oxidation reactivity within the temperature window that we investigated, while both POF and di-POF layers should introduce regimes where CO2 surface diffusion is a limiting factor. Comparing the light-off curves (Fig. 5ac) with the calculated CO2 diffusion-limited regimes (Fig. 5df) demonstrates that oscillations in activity appear when the CO oxidation conversion crosses the line dividing the two regimes, that is, when surface diffusion becomes limiting with respect to the kinetics of the reaction. The behaviour of each of the three overlayer chemistries in light-off curves maps reasonably well to the activity of a standard CO oxidation catalyst, with steep increases in conversion above a certain temperature, with the exception of oscillations in activity at any points in the surface diffusion-limited regime. Clearly, our surface diffusion model calculation does not exactly capture the behaviour of the light-off, and determinations of surface diffusion versus reaction rate controlled regimes is subject to slight differences with variations in parameters, but the correlation of surface diffusion windows with those of oscillations in activity suggests that the appearance of oscillations in the light-offs can be described with CO2 surface diffusion.

Blue areas indicate the condition where CO2 diffusion is calculated to limit the overall rate; green areas indicate conversions for which possible CO2 diffusion rates are calculated to be higher than the required reaction rate to achieve the conversion. Diffusion models are detailed in the following text and the Methods.
Full size image It is known that in catalytic reactiondiffusion systems with different diffusivities of reactants and products, chaotic bistability resulting in concentration oscillations can develop40,41. Surface diffusion coefficients increase nonlinearly with fractional coverage of the diffusing molecule in the micropores, because of the increased likelihood of encountering occupied adsorption sites with increasing coverage, assuming that molecules bounce off occupied sites unaffected34. Expressions describing this nonlinear behaviour from the literature range from equations (3) to (4)42,43:$$\frac{{D_{\mathrm{s}}}}{{D_{\mathrm{so}}}} = \left( {1 - {{\theta }}} \right){ - 1}$$ (3) $$\frac{{D_{\mathrm{s}}}}{{D_{{\mathrm{so}}}}} = \left( {1 - {{\theta }}} \right){ - 2}$$ (4) where θ represents the fractional surface coverage of the diffusing molecule. Because we have demonstrated that the predicted surface diffusion limitations correlate with the observed oscillations, we directly attribute the oscillations to this nonlinear dependence of CO2 surface diffusion coefficient on fractional coverage. We propose two metastable states under a constant reaction rate to exist in the surface diffusion-limited regime. Initially, with low CO2 coverage in the POF overlayer, the Pd surface produces CO2 from the CO oxidation reaction, and the low fractional coverage of CO2 in the surrounding POF layer yields a relatively low Ds, causing surface diffusion limitations. However, once the fractional coverage of CO2 increases from CO2 being continually produced and slowly diffusing, the surface diffusion coefficient increases according to equations (3) and (4). Eventually, the surface diffusion rate is no longer limiting and CO2 can quickly diffuse into the bulk gas phase. Once the accumulating CO2 leaves adsorption sites, however, CO2 again becomes deficient in the POF encapsulation layer and the system returns to the initial state. We hypothesize that these two states: reaction rate limited where CO2 freely diffuses and surface diffusion limited where CO2 accumulates in the POF layer, are linked both through the nonlinear CO2 coverage effects on the surface diffusion coefficient (as described above) and thermal effects stemming from the exothermic character of the reaction and exothermic CO2 adsorption. In light of the idea that CO2 coverage or temperature increases CO2 surface diffusivity, a potential mechanism that links different hybrid catalyst microparticles activities into macroscopically observable oscillations is a wave of either CO2 or thermal fluctuations (or both) propagating through the reactor bed, effectively releasing CO2 previously accumulating along the wavefront of increased surface diffusivity.
Although the observation of, and influence over, oscillatory behaviour is interesting, what is more relevant is that a controlled change in the adsorption properties of the reactant/product transport channels (POF pores) has altered the diffusion rates of said species. In designing the chemistry of POF overlayers of a catalyst as we have demonstrated here, different reactants and products can be targeted for altered transport rates, adding a powerful tool in catalysis and reaction engineering.
Conclusions Enzymes use the chemistry of their constituent amino acids to tune both the transition state energetics and transport rates of reacting species to make effective catalysts. A large body of work in the literature has shown the tremendous promise of mimicking singular aspects of enzyme catalysts to modulate catalytic activity. In this Article, we show that in POF-encapsulated metal NC catalysts, microporous polymer layers have an influence over the energetics of catalytic CO oxidation taking place within pores at the interface with metal surfaces, as well as the diffusion rates of species through their Ångstrom-sized channels. Although enzyme actions remain far more specified for each individual reaction that they control, exporting these two aspects of enzyme catalysis, namely altering transition state energetics and reactant transport control, into manmade materials that are stable for long term high temperature reaction conditions is a large step in rationally designing industrial catalysts. Engineering control over catalytic active sites conjoined with control over transport properties encourages the possibility of many POF encapsulated nanomaterials applications across many fields where heterogeneous catalysis is employed.
Methods Synthesis of Pd nanocrystals Synthesis was performed using standard air-free Schlenk techniques according to published procedures20. A 300mg sample of palladium acetylacetonate (0.98mmol, 35% Pd, Acros Organics) was dissolved in a mixture of 19.6ml of tetradecene (94%, Alfa Aesar) and 20.4ml of octadecene (90%, technical grade, Acros Organics) with 3.32ml of oleylamine (70%, Acros Organics) and 1.6ml of oleic acid (90%, Sigma-Aldrich). The mixture was evacuated at room temperature (pressure of <2torr) for 30min, then 2.24ml of trioctylphosphine (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) was injected under vacuum, and the mixture was kept under evacuation and heated to 50C for 30min. The flask was then switched to nitrogen and the solution was quickly (25Cmin1) heated to 277C and kept for 15min under reflux. The reaction was cooled to below 50C and left open to the atmosphere for purification. Particles were precipitated with ethanol and isopropanol and separated by centrifugation (838rads1, 3min) three times, with the addition of 10μl of oleylamine after each step except after the final wash. Finally, particles were dissolved in hexane to produce a deep black solution at a concentration of 10mg Pd per ml.Synthesis of POFs POFs were prepared using standard air-free Schlenk techniques following literature procedures18. Melamine (99%, Acros Organics) and terephthaldehyde (98%, Acros Organics) were combined in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, Fisher) and stirred for 15min at 25C under vacuum. The clear mixture was then heated to 180C under a blanket of N2 and left to react for 72h. The resulting solid was washed with acetone (99.7%, Fisher) three times and dried at 80C under vacuum (150torr) for 12h, ground and sieved to a particle size below 180m.Preparation of Pd/POF materials The obtained POF powder was calcined at 300C in air for 20min before being dispersed into hexanes (30ml). An appropriate amount of Pd particleshexane solution was then added to the dispersed POF. The mixture was stirred for 2min and sonicated for 15min at room temperature until a colourless supernatant was obtained. The powder was centrifuged at 838rads1 for 3min to recover the solid, and further dried at 80C in an oven. To remove organic ligands from the Pd particle surface, the Pd/POF material was spread into a thin layer over an alumina crucible and placed in a furnace at 300C for 20min. The time and temperature of thermal annealing were optimized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to verify the removal of ligands as in previous works.Growth of polymer layers on Pd/POF to prepare POF/Pd/POF and extension to di-POF/Pd/POF and ph-POF/Pd/POF In a typical synthesis to prepare POF/Pd/POF, 200mg of calcined Pd/POF was combined with 313mg (2.48mmol) of melamine and 500mg of terephthalaldehyde (3.72mmol) in a 50ml flask. A 16.5ml volume of DMSO was added to the mixture and the solution was stirred for 15min under vacuum (<1torr) at 25C. The solution was then placed under nitrogen flow and heated at 10Cmin1 to 180C and left under N2 flow at this temperature for 24h. The resultant solid was washed with acetone and filtered three times. The solid was then dried under reduced pressure at 80C for 12h and finally ground and sieved to a particle size below 180m and stored in air.To prepare ph-POF/Pd/POF and di-POF/Pd/POF, the synthesis process was the same as above except that 50% of the melamine was replaced with 6-phenyl-2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (348.2mg, 1.86mmol) or 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (206.7mg, 1.86mmol), respectively. In these syntheses, the total moles of amino functional groups were kept constant compared to the POF/Pd/POF materials.Catalytic characterization The materials were tested in a U-shaped quartz plug flow reactor with 1cm diameter at ambient pressure. Catalyst powder (typically 20mg) was mixed with TiO2 diluent (typically 80mg, Aeroxide P25) with a mortar and pestle and loaded into the U-shaped reactor between two layers of acid-washed, calcined quartz. The catalyst bed was packed to a length of 1cm. The reactor was placed in the heated zone of a Micromeritics Eurotherm 2416 furnace with a thermocouple placed in the centre of the bed. A control bed of titania diluent and packing quartz sand was found to give no conversion for CO oxidation at the conditions used in this work. Gas reactant mixtures were prepared by passing diluted CO (5vol% in Ar, Airgas Certified), diluted O2 (5vol% in Ar, Certified Airgas) and Ar (99.999% Airgas) through mass flow controllers (Brooks SLA5850).Before each catalytic measurement, diluted catalyst beds were placed under a flow of 5vol% O2 in Ar at a rate of 50mlmin1 at 250C for 30min, then Ar at 50mlmin1 at 250C for 5min, followed by reduction with 5vol% H2 in Ar at 250C for 30min. To activate the catalyst and remove sulfur from the synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 4), each catalyst bed was placed under eight thermal ramps with a rate of 3Cmin1 from 120C to 250C with a dwell at 250C for 20min under flow of a mixture of 0.25vol% CO, 4.75vol% O2 balanced with Ar at 200,000mlgcat1h1. Catalytic rates were measured to be consistent between the seventh and eighth ramps before taking the data shown in this work. The light-off measurements shown are from the eighth thermal ramp, and kinetic data were taken after the eighth ramp.Concentrations of effluent gases in light-off experiments were measured with a residual gas analyser (RGA, Hiden HPR 20) using the QGA software package for in-stream analysis. CO2 yield (%) was calculated using equation (5):$${\mathrm{CO}}_2\,{\mathrm{yield}}\,(\% ) = \frac{{p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2({\mathrm{effluent}})}}}{{p_{\mathrm{CO}({\mathrm{feed}})}}} \times 100$$ (5) with \(p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}\) measured relative to Ar pressure in the RGA and pCO controlled with mass flow controllers calibrated to within 1% with bubble flow meters. Gas reactants and products in kinetic experiments were measured with an online gas chromatograph (GC, Buck Scientific model 910). After the eighth ramp in 0.25vol% CO and 4.75vol% O2 in Ar at 200,000mlgcat1h1 (activation procedure), catalyst beds were cooled to a lower temperature and the GHSV was varied such that CO conversion for each kinetic point measured was less than 5%, which allowed for differential reaction conditions. Each data point was taken at steady state and is the average of three GC measurements. TOFs were calculated normalized to the CO accessible metallic surface area from CO chemisorption measurements using equation (6):$${\mathrm{TOF}} = \frac{{\dot {n}_{ {\mathrm{CO}}_2} \times N_{\mathrm{A}}}}{{m_{\mathrm{cat}} \times {\mathrm{SA}}_{\mathrm{cat}} \times \sigma _{\mathrm{Pd}}}}$$ (6) where \(\dot n_{\mathrm{CO}_2}\) is the CO2 molar flow rate calculated from the mole fraction collected in the GC and the total volumetric flow rate, NA is Avogadros number, mcat is the catalyst mass, SAcat is the metallic area exposed as measured by chemisorption (see below) and σPd is the Pd surface atom density provided by chemisorption. Each kinetic experimental run consisted of measuring the steady-state CO2 production rate at four separate temperatures separated by at least 10C. To calculate H and S, the Eyring equation was fit with these kinetic points. The reported values of H and S are the averages of the fitted parameters from three replicates of kinetic experiments and the error bars represent one standard deviation. Pd/POF and POF/Pd/POF kinetic data include replicates from multiple completely separate syntheses. The shaded regions in Eyring and Arrhenius figures in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5ac represent 95% confidence intervals of rate values, calculated according to the literature44. The CO rate order measurements reported in Supplementary Fig. 5 were collected in the same manner, with CO pressure being varied from 0.0025 to 0.04bar under a constant O2 pressure of 0.005bar.The normalized CO2 production rates presented in Fig. 4f were calculated from the average CO2 produced, measured with the RGA and normalized by TOF values extrapolated from kinetic data (presented in Fig. 3) to 190C, the temperature at which the average rate was measured. Average CO2 production rates were calculated from the average \(p_{{\mathrm{CO}}_2}\) in the effluent gas averaged over 12.5h of reaction time on stream (see data in Supplementary Fig. 6). Error bars on the normalized rate represent 95% confidence intervals of the extrapolated TOF values combined with an additional 10% uncertainty in the average rate measurement. Catalytic beds for this measurement were prepared with a mass of catalyst such that an equal amount of Pd surface area was exposed as determined by CO chemisorption.Structural characterization TGA was performed on a TA Instruments TGA-500. Samples were heated at a ramp rate of 10Cmin1 under a flow of 25mlmin1 of air.DSC measurements were performed on a TA instruments DSC q2000. Samples were heated at a rate of 3Cmin1. Each sample was heated to 300C, cooled to 50C and then heated a second time. Data presented are from the second heating cycle.FTIR measurements were carried out on a Thermo-Fisher Nicolet is-50 FTIR instrument with an attenuated total reflectance attachment using a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector with 2cm1 precision.Gas adsorption measurements were carried out in a Micromeritics 3-Flex instrument, which uses high-accuracy pressure transducers to measure gas adsorption. Nitrogen physisorption measurements were performed in 12mm borosilicate tubes containing 75200mg of powder samples. Samples were degassed in the Micromeritics SmartVacPrep unit below 0.1Torr for 19h at 175C, with masses measured after degassing. Nitrogen adsorption isotherm measurements were taken in a bath of liquid nitrogen with the psat of the bath measured continuously. To calculate pore size distributions, isotherms were fitted with the NLDFT carbon-slit model.For CO chemisorption, catalyst powders were pretreated in undiluted beds under the same conditions as for the pretreatment before catalytic measurements (see Catalytic characterization section and Supplementary Fig. 7). After CO oxidation thermal ramps, catalysts were placed in a quartz U-tube and underwent oxidation at 125C for 30min in a flow of 25mlmin1 of 5vol% O2 in Ar and reduction at 125C for 30min in a flow of 25mlmin1 of 5vol% H2 in Ar. CO adsorption was measured at 35C and in the pressure range of 100450torr CO (99.99%, Praxair). The double isotherm method was employed: two isotherms were collected per experiment with a 1h, 35C vacuum treatment in between. In this method, chemisorbed CO remains on the metallic surface during vacuum, whereas CO weakly bound to the support is removed; the difference between the first and second isotherms yields the contribution from the chemisorbed CO only. A CO adsorption experiment was performed with metal-free POF and no chemisorption was detected. Measurements were performed in triplicate for each catalyst, with the average exposed metal surface area value being used in TOF calculations.CO2 adsorption measurements were performed in 12mm borosilicate tubes containing 75200mg of powder samples. Samples were degassed in the Micromeritics SmartVacPrep unit below 0.1torr for 19h at 175C, with masses measured after degassing. CO2 isotherms from 0 to 760torr were measured at 35, 50, 75 and 115C. Isosteric heats of adsorption were then calculated using the ClausiusClapeyron equation as in the literature19. Isosteric heats of adsorption of the POF material matched those reported in the literature with chemisorption at low loadings and physisorption at high loadings.Inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was performed on an XSERIES 2 Quadropole ICP-MS. Samples were prepared by digestion of catalysts with a 1:2 by volume mixture of HCl (37%, Fisher) and HNO3 (70%, Fisher) with 2min of sonication in 1h intervals for 4h followed by 12h of additional digestion time. The remaining POF powder was filtered out and the resultant solution was diluted to analyse the concentration with Milli-Q H2O. ICP data were used to normalize the CO chemisorption values shown in Fig. 2.TEM images were collected on a FEI Tecnai microscope operating at 200kV with an Orius charge-coupled device camera. Powder samples were dispersed in isopropanol (99.7%, Fisher) and deposited onto lacey-carbon-coated Cu grids and degassed for 15min before analysis. A minimum of 10 images were taken for each sample; representative examples are shown in Fig. 1. Particle size distributions were calculated with the line tool in ImageJ and included a minimum of N=150 measurements.STEM analysis was carried out using an FEI Titan 80300 TEM/STEM system operating with a primary beam energy of 300keV. Annular dark-field images were collected using a post-specimen detector (Fischione, Model 3000) with an inner collection angle of 33mrad. Due to the significant topography of the hybrid nanoparticles, a small probe forming aperture (10m diameter) was used to increase the image depth of field by virtue of the resulting low convergence angle (0.9mrad). To compensate for the small aperture, a spot number of five was chosen, producing an electron beam with 100pA of current. Using these same conditions, electron tomography was performed by collecting a tilt series of images over a range of specimen tilts from 70 to +70 and with a tilt increment of 2 between images. The resulting image stack was aligned using custom Python code. Image registration was carried out using the enhanced correlation coefficient algorithm in the Python implementation of OpenCV, and the tilt axis was aligned via an iterative process whereby the difference between the input projection data of the central slice in the stack and the reconstructed volume following reconstruction is minimized. Reconstruction was carried out using the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) as implemented in the ASTRA toolbox45,46. In the case of volume reconstruction (such as the one reported in Supplementary Fig. 3), to determine the spatial position of the outer POF layer, a two-step process was employed. First, the reconstructed data was binarized by the Otsu threshold method47. A Canny edge detection algorithm48 was then employed to determine the POF/vacuum interface.XPS measurements of the catalysts were carried out in a PHI VersaProbe I and III Scanning XPS Microprobe equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser with Al(Kα) radiation (1,486.3eV) and with an argon ion sputter gun. All samples were deposited on conductive carbon tabs on an aluminium holder and outgassed at 104mbar, then transferred to the ion-pumped analysis chamber. Pressure was kept below 5×107Pa during data acquisition. The incident X-ray spot size was 100m and an excitation of 100W at 20kV was used for the radiation source. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (284.8eV) to account for charging effects. An electron flood gun and an Ar ion gun were used to minimize charging due to the non-conductive POF. Sputtering was performed with a C60 ion gun or gas cluster ion source. Due to local charging and subsequent static-induced macro particle migration, determination of the precise sputter depth was not possible. The material shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2 was sputtered for a duration to sputter 170nm in PMMA standards. Given the Al Kα radiation energy (1,486.7eV) of the XPS source and a Pd 3d binding energy of 335eV, Pd 3d photoelectrons are emitted with kinetic energy of 1,151.7eV. This corresponds to an escape depth of 45nm (ref. 49). The high-resolution data in Supplementary Fig. 1f were fitted using a Shirley background and with 30% Gaussian70% Lorentzian peaks, and the most reduced carbon peak was fit to 284.8eV. Functional group assignment was according to previous literature references50,51.XAS measurements were collected at beam lines 7-3 and 9-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). Both beam lines are wiggler side stations, 16-pole, 2Tesla, and 20 pole, 2Tesla, respectively, with vertically collimating mirrors for harmonic rejection. The photon energies at each beam line were selected using a double-crystal, liquid-nitrogen-cooled, Si(220) phi=90 monochromator. Samples were scanned simultaneously in fluorescence mode using both Ar-filled ion chambers and a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) diode to measure the signal and reference signals. A Pd foil (EXAFS Materials, 15μm thick) was scanned simultaneously with the sample for energy calibration. Step-scanning EXAFS and XANES spectra were measured from 250eV before the Pd K-edge (24,350eV) to k=15.2 or 8Å1 in 15 or 5min, respectively. Continuous scanning EXAFS results were collected on beam line 9-3 with a comparable scan range to the step-scanning measurement, with each scan taking 2min to complete. The X-ray absorption time scans were collected at beam line 7-3. The monochromator was fixed at 24,375eV and a data point was collected every 1s. Approximately 250mg of a TiO2-diluted sample (same dilution method as for the catalytic characterization) was pressed into an in situ XAS cell52 and connected to flowing helium at the beam line. Four EXAFS scans were collected at each steady-state condition to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. While process conditions were changing due to changes in temperature or the composition of the flowing gas or under oscillatory reaction conditions, XANES (or temporally resolved EXAFS under oscillatory conditions) measurements were collected to observe changes in the chemical state of the Pd. Analysis of the XAS data was carried out using Athena and Artemis software (parts of the Demeter XAS analysis package)53. Athena was used for energy calibration, normalization, background removal and for plotting and interpreting XANES spectra. The edge position, determined by the first inflection point of the XAS spectra of the Pd foil reference, was set to 24,350.0eV and used to calibrate the sample spectra. Each spectrum was normalized to an edge step of one. EXAFS modelling was completed in Artemis software, with FEFF6.054 used to generate absorberbackscatter paths based on crystallographic information from bulk compounds, Pd metal and PdO. EXAFS results for the Pd foil were used to determine S02 (0.750.03). EXAFS data were fit over a range of k=313Å1, with a Fourier transform range of 13.1Å. Models were simultaneously fit with k-weightings of 1, 2 and 3.The Knudsen number is calculated as the ratio \({\mathrm{Kn}} = \frac{\lambda }{L}\) where λ is the mean free path of a diffusing particle and L is the pore diameter. Diffusing species were assumed to be ideal gases and kinetic diameter values were taken from the literature55.For the diffusion model calculations, surface diffusion coefficients were estimated according to literature methods from the heat of adsorption37,38 using equations (1) and (2). The value of parameter a was assumed to be 0.48, as reported for CO2 interacting with microporous carbons in ref. 38. The vibrational frequency normal to the adsorbed surface, νo, was taken to be that of the CN bond in carbamate, 1,266cm1 (ref. 56). The hopping distance was assumed to be the POF micropore width, 7Å. CO2 flux calculations assume the pressure differential of 0.0025bar CO2 at 100% conversion diffusing through a length of 10nm of POF material, a low estimate given the TEM images in Fig. 1e. The total Pd surface area calculated from CO adsorption was used as the area through which the CO2 may diffuse. The determination of whether surface diffusion or kinetic limitations dominated for a particular conversion and temperature was based on whether the reaction rate required to achieve the specific conversion or the required flux of CO2 through the POF layer was lower.
