<p>Enzymes show these traits thanks to their diverse amino acid functional groups encapsulating metal centres, but are limited in the reaction conditions in which they can operate.</p>
<p>Realizing a catalyst with this kinetic and transport control that can be used under demanding industrial conditions is challenging.</p>
<p>The polymer chemistry and morphology control the catalytic performance of the metal sites, affecting the transition state for CO oxidation and controlling the transport of CO2 away from the active site.</p>
<p>Main In designing a catalyst for any reaction, the simultaneous control of aspects like transport of species to and from the active site and the stabilization of specific transitions states plays a role in determining catalyst behaviour.</p>
<p>Enzymes are formidable catalysts, designed by evolution, that carry out chemical reactions at room temperature with high selectivity and activity.</p>
<p>Mimicking the chemical diversity and three-dimensional (3D) nature of the biopolymer-encapsulated metal centres in engineered heterogeneous catalysts is a pathway to higher performing and more stable catalyst systems.</p>
<p>Previous work has focused on using organometallic complexes, molecularly imprinted silica, functional tethered complexes, and metal-exchanged zeolites to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Despite the successes, these systems are limited in functional group selection and/or stability.</p>
<p>Beyond enzyme-inspired catalysts, there are other materials that draw upon the useful features of enzymes to modulate the activity of catalyst surfaces through various means.</p>
<p>Encapsulating nanoparticles in a modifying support material is also a promising approach documented by several researchers.</p>
<p>The necessity of in situ reduction, however, dictates that nanoparticle composition and morphology are dependent on the supporting dendrimer, limiting the scope of the approach.</p>
<p>Encapsulating catalyst nanoparticles in metal oxides has also been shown to be beneficial.</p>
<p>Zeolites combine the chemical aspect of metal oxide encapsulation yet contain a microporous environment, giving access to confinement effects.</p>
<p>In this Article, we introduce a modular approach for the systematic synthesis of 3D active sites by encapsulating colloidal nanocrystals within microporous polymer layers.</p>
<p>The POFs studied are demonstrated to be stable under high-temperature CO oxidation conditions for over 40h.</p>
<p>The polymer layers provide a confined environment that drastically changes the catalytic performance of the metal surfaces.</p>
<p>We observe an increase in catalytic rate for CO oxidation and the appearance of reaction oscillations, only when specific POF layers cover their surface.</p>
<p>Kinetic analysis demonstrates that the increase in rate is related to the entropic stabilization of a product-like intermediate by the polymer layers surrounding the Pd surface.</p>
<p>Reaction oscillations are also shown to depend on the polymer layer chemistry, with POF layers rich in amino groups controlling the diffusion of CO2 away from the active metal site.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the ability to regulate these changes in reactivity by controlling the POF layer chemical composition, as suggested by CO2 adsorption measurements.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability play crucial roles in facilitating or hindering the dehydrogenation process. Morphological characteristics, such as the shape, size, and porosity of the catalyst particles, also impact the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. For instance, the presence of specific functional groups on the catalyst surface can enhance its ability to stabilize transition states and control the transport of species to and from the active sites.

To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, several strategies can be employed. For example, the encapsulation of metal centers within diverse polymer matrices can provide tailored chemical environments that mimic the functionality found in enzymes. This approach allows for the introduction of chemical diversity and control over the three-dimensional structure of the catalyst, which can lead to improved performance. Moreover, the use of organic materials with specific pore sizes and shapes can offer confinement effects, similar to those found in zeolites, to modulate the activity of catalyst surfaces.

To further refine the catalyst properties, researchers can tailor the morphology and chemical composition of the encapsulating materials, as well as the size and composition of the embedded nanoparticles. For instance, controlling the size and shape of the nanocrystals can influence their surface area and the degree of encapsulation, impacting the catalytic activity. Additionally, incorporating functional groups into the polymer layers can affect the transport properties of reactive species and the energetic properties of catalytic intermediates, thereby optimizing the catalytic performance.

By systematically synthesizing catalysts with tailored physicochemical properties, researchers aim to achieve higher catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions. This can be achieved through the strategic design of catalyst architectures that balance chemical reactivity with transport dynamics, leading to improved performance under industrially relevant conditions.
