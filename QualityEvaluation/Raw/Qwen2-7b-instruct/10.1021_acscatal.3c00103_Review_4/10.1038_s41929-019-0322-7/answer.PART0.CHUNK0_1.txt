Answer: This modular approach allows for the creation of 3D active sites by encapsulating nanocrystals within microporous polymer layers, such as porous organic frameworks. The confined environment provided by the polymer layers significantly alters the catalytic performance of the metal surfaces. This methodology is anticipated to be applicable to various combinations of polymer-nanocrystal hybrids and catalytic reactions, potentially revolutionizing several areas of catalysis.
