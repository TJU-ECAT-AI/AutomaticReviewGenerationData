<p>These materials contain the micropores that are necessary for confinement-driven catalysis, like in zeolites and some MOF-encapsulated materials, and also hold the promise of a higher degree of functionalization being possible with inclusion of additional chemical functional groups in monomers with high thermo-chemical stability.</p>

<p>Introduction of an organic surface layer onto transition metal catalysts, through either an ordered material such as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)7 or with modification with addition of a functional ligand8, has been shown to increase the selectivity of several reactions.</p>
<p>By introducing functional groups that affect gas adsorption properties into microporous polymers, in principle it could be possible to affect the transport properties of reactive species through polymer pores as well as the energetic properties of catalytic intermediates that are present within microporous cavities.</p>
<p>To test whether a change in oxidation state explains the appearance of oscillations, we carried out operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments on three timescales using 3.4nm Pd NCs encapsulated in POF: single energy adsorption coefficient measurements with >1s resolution; Pd K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements with 30s resolution; finally Pd K-edge EXAFS measurements with 120s resolution.</p>
<p>It has been shown that increases in amine content in such polymers can decrease the transport of CO2 through the formation of carbamate-like species33.</p>
<p>Because the hybrid catalysts in this study are microporous and contain potential adsorption sites (Supplementary Figs. 1c and 2d,e), surface diffusion describes transport better than classical Knudsen diffusion for diffusing gases.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The text discusses the importance of controlling aspects like the transport of species to and from the active site, as well as stabilizing specific transition states, which are key factors in determining the behavior of catalysts. The document highlights that enzymes, which are natural catalysts, utilize the chemistry of their amino acids to fine-tune the energetics of transition states and transport rates of reacting species, thereby making them highly effective catalysts. This implies that incorporating similar chemical diversity and control over active sites in synthetic catalysts could lead to enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The text further explores how introducing organic surface layers onto transition metal catalysts, through methods such as self-assembled monolayers or functional ligand modifications, can increase the selectivity of reactions, indicating that modifying catalyst surfaces can be a strategy to optimize physicochemical properties for better catalytic performance. Moreover, the study suggests that encapsulating catalyst nanoparticles in microporous polymers, like in the Pd/POF hybrids, can affect the transport properties of reactive species through the polymer pores, potentially altering the energetic properties of catalytic intermediates and influencing reaction rates and product distributions. The text also delves into the impact of polymers on controlling the oscillatory behavior of catalysts, which could be linked to changes in the transport of species and the energetics of transition states. Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of considering and controlling various physicochemical properties of catalysts to achieve optimal performance in dehydrogenation reactions and other catalytic processes.
