        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.1c04092\], \[10.1016/j.mset.2020.02.001\], \[10.1021/acscatal.1c02676\], \[10.1021/acsami.0c22865\], \[10.1039/C5SC01227A\], \[10.1021/acscatal.1c05921\], \[10.1351/pac196510040595\], \[10.1021/jacs.8b08162\], \[10.1021/acscatal.1c03641\], and \[10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646\]. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the case of the PtGa nanoalloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15, their high activity and stability are attributed to these properties. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 facilitates efficient diffusion pathways for reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These strategies often involve altering the catalyst's surface area, modifying its acidity, enhancing its stability under reaction conditions, and incorporating functional groups that can improve its interaction with reactants.
