        The physicochemical properties of catalysts play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties include chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics like particle size and shape. Strategies for modifying these properties, such as changing the type of support material, adjusting synthesis conditions, or incorporating different metal species, can significantly enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The encapsulation of PtZn in an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier, as explored in reference [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092], can lead to improved catalytic activity, as the high-crystallized zeolite provides a stable support for the metal particles, enhancing overall catalytic activity.

Boosting propane dehydrogenation over PtZn encapsulated in an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier improves the performance of the catalyst. The presence of an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite provides a stable support for the metal particles, enhancing the overall catalytic activity. The low surface barrier facilitates easier access of reactants to the active sites, leading to improved dehydrogenation reaction rates. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, surface area, pore size distribution, and composition, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for improvement might involve altering the support material type, adjusting synthesis conditions, or incorporating various metal species to achieve better efficiency and selectivity.
