            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092], [10.1016/j.mset.2020.02.001], [10.1021/acscatal.1c02676], [10.1021/acsami.0c22865], [10.1039/C5SC01227A], [10.1021/acscatal.1c05921], [10.1351/pac196510040595], [10.1021/jacs.8b08162], [10.1021/acscatal.1c03641], [10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646].

            The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the case of the PtGa nanoalloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15, their high activity and stability are attributed to these properties. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 facilitates efficient diffusion pathways for reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Similarly, encapsulating PtZn in an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier improves the catalyst's performance by providing a stable support for the metal particles, enhancing the overall catalytic activity. 

            The ultimate aim of theoretical studies is to determine the most efficient catalysts for specific chemical processes. The strength of binding is related to the size of the cluster and the variation in coordination number. A simpler reaction network was employed by Vang et al. to assess the selectivity of ethylene dehydrogenation and cracking on Ni surfaces. Initial dehydrogenation activity on PtIr(111) is higher, with a lower D1 barrier of 53 kJ mol−1, compared to barriers on Pt(111) (Ea = 82 kJ mol−1) and Ir(111) (Ea = 90 kJ mol−1). The adsorption of carbon atoms on the surface of a NiAu alloy is thermodynamically less favored, by 23 kJ mol−1 or more, than on a pure Ni(111) surface. The primary commercial PDH catalysts are supported platinum or chromium oxide.

            The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, surface area, pore size distribution, and composition, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for improvement might involve altering the support material type, adjusting synthesis conditions, or incorporating various metal species to achieve better efficiency and selectivity. Modification strategies such as surface functionalization, particle size tuning, and support choice can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

            Diffusion phenomena in heterogeneous catalysis play a crucial role in determining the performance of catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, along with morphological characteristics, significantly affect their performance. Strategies for modifying these properties exist to improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity, including surface functionalization, adjusting particle size, and selecting appropriate supports.

            Changes in catalytic and adsorptive properties of 2 nm Pt3Mn nanoparticles by subsurface atoms can significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions.
