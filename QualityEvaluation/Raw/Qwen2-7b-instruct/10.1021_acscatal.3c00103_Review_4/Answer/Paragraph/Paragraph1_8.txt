        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092] and [10.1016/j.mset.2020.02.001]. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the case of the PtGa nanoalloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15, their high activity and stability are attributed to these properties. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 facilitates efficient diffusion pathways for reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Boosting propane dehydrogenation over PtZn encapsulated in an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier improves the performance of the catalyst. The presence of an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite provides a stable support for the metal particles, enhancing the overall catalytic activity. The low surface barrier facilitates easier access of reactants to the active sites, leading to improved dehydrogenation reaction rates. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, surface area, pore size distribution, and composition, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for improvement might involve altering the support material type, adjusting synthesis conditions, or incorporating various metal species to achieve better efficiency and selectivity.
