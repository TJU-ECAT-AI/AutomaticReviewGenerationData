        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092] and [10.1016/j.mset.2020.02.001]. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the case of the PtGa nanoalloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15, their high activity and stability are attributed to these properties. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 facilitates efficient diffusion pathways for reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Boosting propane dehydrogenation over PtZn encapsulated in an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier improves the performance of the catalyst, as the high-crystallized zeolite provides a stable support for the metal particles, enhancing the overall catalytic activity. The encapsulation allows for easier access of reactants to the active sites, leading to improved dehydrogenation reaction rates. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, encompassing acid strength, stability, surface area, pore size distribution, and composition, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for improvement might involve altering the support material type, adjusting synthesis conditions, or incorporating various metal species to achieve better efficiency and selectivity. The ultimate aim of theoretical studies is to determine the most efficient catalysts for specific chemical processes. The strength of binding is related to the size of the cluster and the variation in coordination number. A simpler reaction pathway was employed by Vang et al. to assess the selectivity of ethylene dehydrogenation and cracking on Ni surfaces. Initial dehydrogenation activity on PtIr(111) is higher, with a lower D1 barrier, compared to barriers on Pt(111) and Ir(111). The adsorption of carbon atoms on the surface of a NiAu alloy is thermodynamically less favored than on a pure Ni(111) surface. The most common commercial PDH catalysts are supported platinum or chromium oxide. The diffusion phenomena in heterogeneous catalysis play a crucial role in determining the performance of catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. Strategies for modifying these properties exist to improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity, including surface functionalization, adjusting particle size, and selecting appropriate supports. Changes in catalytic and adsorptive properties of 2 nm Pt3Mn nanoparticles by subsurface atoms influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, play crucial roles in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modifying these properties through strategies such as changing the type of support material, adjusting the synthesis conditions, or incorporating different metal species can significantly enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
