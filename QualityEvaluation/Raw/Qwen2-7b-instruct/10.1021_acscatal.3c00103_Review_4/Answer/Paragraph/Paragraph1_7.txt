        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00646]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092] and [10.1016/j.mset.2020.02.001]. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the case of the PtGa nanoalloys supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15, their high activity and stability are attributed to these properties. The mesoporous structure of SBA-15 facilitates efficient diffusion pathways for reactants and products, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance.

        The physicochemical properties of catalysts play a crucial role in determining their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties include chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, as well as morphological characteristics like particle size and shape. Strategies for modifying these properties, such as changing the type of support material, adjusting synthesis conditions, or incorporating different metal species, can significantly enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The encapsulation of PtZn in an epitaxial high-crystallized zeolite with a low surface barrier, as explored in reference [10.1021/acscatal.1c04092], can lead to improved catalytic activity, as the high-crystallized zeolite provides a stable support for the metal particles, enhancing overall catalytic activity.
