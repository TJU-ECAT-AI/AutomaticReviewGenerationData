The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as particle size, shape, and surface area, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies, such as encapsulating the catalyst within zeolites or using high-crystallized materials, can optimize these properties, thereby enhancing the catalyst's efficiency and selectivity.

1. The origins of coke formation are also examined, followed by a discussion on future research paths.
          2. The ultimate objective of theoretical investigations is to pinpoint the most effective catalysts for specific chemical processes.
          3. A low dehydrogenation barrier suggests high dehydrogenation activity for a catalyst, but excessively high activity might cause unmanaged deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, possibly leading to unintended coke formation.
          4. The intricacy of the aforementioned systems appears to surpass the capability to extensively analyze potential energy surfaces using DFT calculations, constraining the majority of present studies that concentrate on understanding a single facet of the catalyst rather than the full picture of dehydrogenation.
