The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly affect their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Adjustments, such as encapsulating the catalyst within zeolites, improving crystallinity, and minimizing surface barriers, can optimize these properties, leading to increased catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly affect their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Acid strength and stability on the catalyst surface impact activity and selectivity towards desired products. Morphological features, like particle size and shape, influence reaction kinetics and product distribution. To enhance these properties, strategies like functional group introduction, support usage, and synthesis condition adjustments can be applied.
