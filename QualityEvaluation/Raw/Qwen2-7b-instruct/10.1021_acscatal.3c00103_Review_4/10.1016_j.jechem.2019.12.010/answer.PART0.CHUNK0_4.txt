Cr species supported on HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260)) exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts display an obvious signal in the temperature range of 50–600°C, which can be deconvoluted into three Gaussian peaks centered at around 130–160°C, 190–240°C, and 400–430°C, corresponding to physically adsorbed NH3, weakly acid sites, and strongly acid sites, respectively.

Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity, high dispersion, moderate acidity, and strong metal-support interactions, which exhibit high activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for PDH reaction.

The Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH. 

HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites (Brnsted acid sites) is good for propane adsorption and propylene desorption, guaranteeing high PDH performance. 

Cr species supported on HZSM-5 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (i.e., SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, and 80) possess low propylene selectivity during the PDH, due to the high amount of acidic sites of HZSM-5 support resulting in deep dehydrogenation and cracking of propane.

The Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst system possesses strong anti-coking capability in PDH process, in good agreement with its excellent catalytic stability.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The morphological characteristics, such as large porosity and high dispersion, contribute to the high activity and stability. Chemical qualities, particularly the presence of Brnsted acid sites in the support, play a critical role in propane adsorption and activation. By optimizing these properties, one can design catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

2. Support modification strategies involve adjusting parameters such as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the zeolite. Lower ratios lead to higher acidity, which can negatively impact propylene selectivity by promoting deep dehydrogenation and cracking. Optimizing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio helps in achieving a balance that maximizes the catalytic performance while maintaining selectivity.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有很大影响。形态特性，如大孔隙率和高分散性，有助于提高活性和稳定性。化学性质，特别是支持物上的Brnsted酸性位点的存在，在丙烷吸附和激活中起着关键作用。通过优化这些性质，可以设计出具有高活性和选择性的催化剂。

2. 支撑修改策略涉及调整如沸石中的SiO2/Al2O3比例这样的参数。较低的比例导致更高的酸度，这可能会负面影响丙烯选择性，因为它促进了深度脱氢和裂解。通过优化SiO2/Al2O3比例，有助于在最大化催化性能的同时保持选择性。
