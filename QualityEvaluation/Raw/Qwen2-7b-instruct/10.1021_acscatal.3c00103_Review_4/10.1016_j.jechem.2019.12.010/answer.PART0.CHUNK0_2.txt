<p>It was reported that the low-coordinated Cr3+ species were the active sites for PDH, but they tended to aggregate, leading to low activity and regenerability.</p>
<p>The adsorption of propane in HZSM-5 zeolite was exothermic, where the adsorption of propane on Brnsted acid sites was much easier than propane adsorbed in the channels of HZSM-5 zeolite.</p>
<p>Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479).</p>
<p>It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites).</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 4 (b), the NH3 desorbed signals of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, indicating the increase acidity of Cr/Z-5 catalysts with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.</p>
<p>It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS).</p>
<p>Typically, the propane molecules would be adsorbed and activated on the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, whereas, the NaZSM-5 with almost no Brnsted acid sites processes very few propane adsorption.</p>

Physicochemical properties of catalysts significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities such as the strength and stability of acid sites determine the ability of catalysts to adsorb and activate reactants. Morphologically, the dispersion of metal species, the size of pores, and the overall structure of the support material all influence how efficiently reactants interact with the catalyst surface. For instance, in the case of Cr species supported on HZSM-5 zeolite, the dispersion of Cr3+ species is crucial for maintaining high activity and regenerability. The presence of Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 allows for easier adsorption of propane compared to the channels within the zeolite structure. The formation of Cr2O3 crystallites at higher Cr loadings indicates changes in the physical properties of the catalyst, such as the creation of additional acid sites or altered metal-support interactions. Adjusting the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the HZSM-5 support affects the acidity of the catalyst, impacting its performance in terms of adsorbing and activating propane. The dispersion of Cr species, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, contributes to the large porosity and high dispersion of the catalyst. The moderate acidity of the Cr/Z-5 catalysts, as determined by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), is essential for optimal dehydrogenation activity. The strong interactions between Cr species and the HZSM-5 support are vital for maintaining the catalyst's stability and efficiency. The presence of Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 enables effective adsorption and activation of propane, whereas, in NaZSM-5 with fewer Brnsted acid sites, propane adsorption is significantly reduced. These physicochemical properties collectively determine the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation catalysts.

催化剂的物理化学性质显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学特性，如酸基团的强度和稳定性，决定了催化剂吸附和激活反应物的能力。从形态上讲，金属物种的分散度、孔隙大小以及支撑材料的整体结构都影响着反应物与催化剂表面的交互效率。例如，在Cr物种支持在HZSM-5沸石上的情况下，Cr3+物种的分散对于保持高活性和再生性至关重要。HZSM-5中的Brnsted酸基团使得丙烷的吸附比在沸石结构中的通道更容易。Cr2O3晶粒的形成在较高Cr负载下指示了催化剂物理性质的变化，如额外酸基团的产生或金属-支撑相互作用的改变。调整HZSM-5支持物的SiO2/Al2O3比例会影响催化剂的酸性，进而影响其性能，尤其是在丙烷吸附和激活方面。通过透射电子显微镜（TEM）和X射线衍射（XRD）分析得出的Cr物种的分散度贡献于催化剂的大孔隙率和高分散度。由氨温度程序脱附（NH3-TPD）测定的中等酸性是Cr/Z-5催化剂维持高效脱氢活性的关键。Cr物种与HZSM-5支撑物之间强烈的相互作用对于保持催化剂的稳定性和效率至关重要。HZSM-5中存在的Brnsted酸基团使丙烷的有效吸附和活化成为可能，而在NaZSM-5中几乎没有Brnsted酸基团的情况下，丙烷吸附明显减少。这些物理化学性质共同决定了脱氢催化剂的催化效率和选择性。
