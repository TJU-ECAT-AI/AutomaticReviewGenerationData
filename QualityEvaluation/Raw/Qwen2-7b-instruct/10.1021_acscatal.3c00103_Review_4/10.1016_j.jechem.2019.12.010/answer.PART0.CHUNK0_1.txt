[1] "The resulting Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity, high dispersion, suitable amount of acidic sites and strong metal-support interactions, which exhibit high activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH reaction."
[2] "Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479), respectively."
[3] "This indicates that the high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction. Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process."
[4] "To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in Fig. 9."
[5] "To further understand the acidic sites of Cr/Z-5 catalysts, here we designed a series of Na+ doping experiments according to previous studies."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as porosity and dispersion, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties contribute to the high activity, selectivity, and stability of the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts.

2. The XRD patterns of the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts show the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites, which indicates the presence of strong metal-support interactions between the Cr species and the HZSM-5 zeolite support.

3. The acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolite play a crucial role in the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts. They affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, impacting the overall catalytic performance.

4. The acidity of the Cr/Z-5 catalysts is related to the amount of ammonia desorbed from the material. More acidic sites lead to higher propane conversion, but lower propylene selectivity and yield, highlighting the trade-off between these factors.

5. Na+ doping experiments were conducted to better understand the role of acidic sites in Cr/Z-5 catalysts. The results indicate that the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 support are essential for propane adsorption and activation, influencing the catalytic performance of the Cr/Z-5 system.
