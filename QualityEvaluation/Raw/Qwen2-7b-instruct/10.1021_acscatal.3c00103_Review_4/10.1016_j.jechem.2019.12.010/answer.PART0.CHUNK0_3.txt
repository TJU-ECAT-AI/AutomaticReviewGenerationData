[1] "In previous studies concerning PDH, a great challenge for Cr-based catalysts is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction."
[2] "It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS)."
[3] "Additionally, the propylene desorption property can also affect the selectivity, stability and anti-coking capability of PDH catalysts due to the fact that the strongly adsorbed propylene would be deep dehydrogenated, cracked and/or polymerized."
[4] "This illustrates that the Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system."

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, like the presence of Brnsted acid sites, enable the adsorption and activation of reactants, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Morphological characteristics, such as large porosity and high dispersion, facilitate the accessibility of reactants to active sites and prevent the formation of coke, which can cover active sites and result in catalyst deactivation. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies can be employed. For instance, adjusting the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the zeolite support can control the amount of acidic sites, affecting the adsorption and desorption of reactants and products.

2. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including large porosity, high dispersion, suitable amount of acidic sites, and strong metal-support interactions, are crucial for the performance of PDH catalysts. These properties allow for effective reactant access to active sites, minimize coke formation, and maintain high selectivity and stability. The metal-support interactions are particularly important as they contribute to the stabilization and dispersion of metal species, enhancing catalytic activity.

3. The propylene desorption property plays a significant role in determining the selectivity, stability, and anti-coking capability of PDH catalysts. Strongly adsorbed propylene, which is not easily desorbed, can undergo deep dehydrogenation, cracking, or polymerization, leading to coke formation. Coke formation can cover active sites, leading to catalyst deactivation. By controlling the amount of acidic sites in the zeolite support, one can manage the adsorption and desorption of propylene, optimizing the catalytic performance.

4. The Brnsted acid sites in the zeolite support play a critical role in determining the catalytic performance of the Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. These sites are responsible for the adsorption and activation of propane molecules, which is essential for the PDH process. However, an excessive amount of Brnsted acid sites can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as deep dehydrogenated and cracked products, negatively impacting the PDH process. Thus, finding the right balance of acidic sites is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity in PDH catalysts.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括其化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应中的性能有显著影响。化学特性，如Brnsted酸性位点的存在，使反应物的吸附和活化得以进行，从而提高催化效率。形态特性，如大的孔隙度和高分散度，可以促进反应物到达活性位点，并防止积碳的形成，积碳会覆盖活性位点并导致催化剂失效。为了优化这些性质以提高催化效率和选择性，可以通过修改支持来实施策略。例如，通过调整沸石支持的SiO2/Al2O3比例来控制酸性位点的数量，影响反应物和产物的吸附与脱附过程。

2. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括大孔隙度、高分散度、合适的酸性位点数量以及金属-支持相互作用，对于PDH催化剂的性能至关重要。这些性质允许有效访问活性位点以促进反应物，最小化积碳的形成，并维持高选择性和稳定性。金属-支持相互作用尤为重要，因为它们有助于金属物种的稳定性和分散，增强催化活性。

3. 丙烯脱附性质在确定PDH催化剂的选择性、稳定性和抗结焦能力中起着重要作用。强烈吸附的丙烯不容易脱附，可能会经历深度脱氢、裂解或聚合，导致积碳形成。积碳的形成会覆盖活性位点，导致催化剂失效。通过控制沸石支持中酸性位点的数量，可以管理丙烯的吸附与脱附，优化催化剂性能。

4. 沸石支持中的Brnsted酸性位点对Cr/Z-5催化剂系统的催化性能起着关键作用。这些位点负责丙烷分子的吸附和活化，这是PDH过程所必需的。然而，过量的Brnsted酸性位点可能导致不希望的副产品如深度脱氢、裂解等产品的生成，对PDH过程产生负面影响。因此，找到合适的酸性位点平衡是实现PDH催化剂高活性和选择性的关键。
