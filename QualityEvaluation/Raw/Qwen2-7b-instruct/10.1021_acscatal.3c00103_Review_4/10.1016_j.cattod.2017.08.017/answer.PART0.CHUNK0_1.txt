[1] "Mesoporous zeolites exhibited higher catalytic activity in various acid catalyzed reactions requiring medium to strong acidity."
[2] "Activities of mesoporous zeolites are similar to that of the conventional zeolites in the reactions involving small molecules."
[3] "Moreover, mesoporous zeolites exhibited significant retardation in the catalyst deactivation in vapor phase and liquid phase reactions when compared with conventional zeolites."
[4] "These representations clearly justify the influence of mesoporosity on the catalytic activity."
[5] "However, there are a few reactions where mesoporous Beta could play a better role than mesoporous ZSM-5."
[6] "In the case of mesoporous zeolite materials, the acid sites located at the pore-mouth or little bit farther inside the channels were the real centers of the reaction."
[7] "Inter-crystalline mesopores present in the mesoporous zeolites facilitated the diffusion of the reactant to the acid sites and diffusion of the product from the active sites, which was responsible for the high activity."
[8] "The large surface area and large number of surface Si-OH were responsible for the high electrocatalytic activity."
[9] "This increased electrocatalytic activity of mesoporous zeolite was due to their large micropore size, high surface area, large external surface area, abundantly available Si-OH groups, and inter-crystalline mesopores."
[10] "The external surface area of Ni2+-ZSM-5-PrTES was about five times higher than that of Ni2+-ZSM-5."
[11] "The large external surface enhanced the diffusion of the reactant and product molecules and also provided highly dispersed Ni2+ active centres for the electocatalytic reaction."
[12] "In the case of cerium, the energy between 4f and 5d is almost the same."
[13] "Therefore, the inter-conversion of oxidation states of cerium is facilitated by applying low potential energy."
