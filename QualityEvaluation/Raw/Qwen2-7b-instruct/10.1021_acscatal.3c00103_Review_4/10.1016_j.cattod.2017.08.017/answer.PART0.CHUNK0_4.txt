1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics, influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. High acid strength and stability can lead to better conversion and selectivity in reactions involving large organic molecules. To optimize these properties, strategies such as metal substitution, surface functionalization, and the creation of mesoporosity can be employed. Mesoporosity enhances diffusion, increases surface area, and facilitates electron transfer, thus improving catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. To develop suitable electrode materials for electrochemical applications, mesoporous zeolites need to possess tuneable physicochemical properties. These include ion-exchange capability, the ability to incorporate or substitute framework metals, surface functionalization, large external surface area, and inter-crystalline mesoporosity. These features allow for better electron transport, enhanced surface accessibility, and optimized catalytic sites.

3. Non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors based on mesoporous zeolites have been fabricated for detecting bio-molecules and water pollutants. These sensors leverage the surface functionalization ability of mesoporous zeolites to detect analytes, providing a simple, rapid, and potentially new analytical platform for various applications.

4. Nanocrystalline zeolite-based materials have been adapted for methanol oxidation, offering potential use in direct methanol fuel cells. The materials' high catalytic activity stems from their enhanced diffusion pathways, large surface area, efficient electron transfer, and dispersed active metal sites within the porous zeolite network.

5. In biomedical engineering, these materials have been utilized as bone-implant materials. The porous structure of the materials facilitates bone matrix growth and body fluid transport, making them strong enough for handling during implantation and loading while also promoting bone tissue formation on their surface.
