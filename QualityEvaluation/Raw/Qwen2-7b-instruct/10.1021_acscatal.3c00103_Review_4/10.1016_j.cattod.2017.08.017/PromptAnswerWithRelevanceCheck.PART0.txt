Zeolites are synthesized in aqueous basic medium using silica source, alumina source, inorganic and/or organic cation. Zeolites are obtained through a kinetically controlled hydrothermal crystallization process since it is a meta-stable phase [7] ,[8] ,[9] . Crystallized zeolites are removed from the synthesis mixture after certain time duration. By varying the synthesis composition and the cation (inorganic and/or organic), a wide variety of zeolites with different framework structures can be synthesized. Among all crystalline aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates, over 230 crystallographically distinct zeolite framework types have been synthesized and documented in the database of the International Zeolite Association [6] .

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics (like framework structure), significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By adjusting the synthesis composition and cation type, a wide range of zeolites with diverse framework structures can be synthesized. This variety allows for optimization of catalyst properties to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the acid strength and stability of zeolites can be tailored to suit the requirements of specific dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, the introduction of mesopores into zeolites can improve diffusion processes and electron transfer, further optimizing their performance.

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties dictate the rate of reaction, selectivity, and the extent of conversion. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, strategies such as modifying the catalyst's surface area, tuning the pore size and shape, incorporating additional metal sites, and controlling the catalyst's morphology can be employed. These modifications aim to facilitate better access of reactants to active sites, improve electron transfer rates, and reduce the risk of poisoning or deactivation.

2. Synthesizing mesoporous zeolites involves strategies like dealumination, desilication, and surfactant-assisted synthesis. These methods create additional porosity and interconnected micropores, leading to improved diffusion pathways and reduced steric hindrance for reactants and products. This results in enhanced catalytic activity and stability in reactions involving large organic molecules, where conventional zeolites might struggle due to pore diffusion limitations.

3. Mesoporous zeolites are utilized in electrochemical detection of biomolecules and water pollutants due to their large surface area, high external surface area, and abundant functional groups like Si-OH. These properties enable facile diffusion of molecules, high reactivity, and efficient electrocatalysis. Their enhanced textural properties contribute to faster response times, higher sensitivity, and lower detection limits in analytical applications.

4. In methanol fuel cell applications, mesoporous zeolites like CeO2/ZSM-5-PrTES offer superior performance compared to traditional zeolites. The synergy between the nanocrystalline CeO2 and the acidic ZSM-5-PrTES provides an active interface for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol. The large surface area and mesoporous structure of the zeolite facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, while the acidic sites aid in the adsorption of necessary species. This leads to higher current densities, lower overpotentials, and improved stability over time.

5. In biomedical applications, particularly bone-implant materials, mesoporous zeolites are valued for their high mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and ability to promote bone tissue growth. The presence of mesopores enhances the mechanical integrity of the implant, while the surface functionalization allows for better integration with surrounding tissues. Additionally, the large external surface area facilitates the attachment of osteogenic proteins and growth factors, promoting bone regeneration and healing.
