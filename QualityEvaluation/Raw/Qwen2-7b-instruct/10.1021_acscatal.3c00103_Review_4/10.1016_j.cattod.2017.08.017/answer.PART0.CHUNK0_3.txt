[1] "Mesoporous zeolites exhibited significantly higher catalytic activities in various acid-catalyzed reactions involving large organic molecules where conventional zeolites were found to be either inactive or exhibited very low activity."
[2] "High catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite based nanocomposite materials can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of reactant/product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, high surface area, facile transportation of electrons in the electrochemical process, high dispersion of metal active centres in the porous zeolite network structure, and significantly reduced electron transfer resistance."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics such as surface area and pore structure, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Enhanced diffusion of reactant and product molecules facilitated by the presence of intercrystalline mesopores, a high surface area, ease of electron transport in electrochemical processes, high dispersion of metal active centers within the porous zeolite network, and reduced electron transfer resistance contribute to the high catalytic and electrocatalytic activities of zeolites and zeolite-based nanocomposite materials. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, strategies can include modifying the catalyst's chemical composition, adjusting the pore size and morphology, and incorporating metal nanoparticles for better dispersion.
