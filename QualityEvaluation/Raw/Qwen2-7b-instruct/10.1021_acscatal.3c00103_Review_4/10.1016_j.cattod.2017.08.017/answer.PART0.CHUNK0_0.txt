Zeolites are synthesized in aqueous basic medium using silica source, alumina source, inorganic and/or organic cation. Zeolites are obtained through a kinetically controlled hydrothermal crystallization process since it is a meta-stable phase [7] ,[8] ,[9] . Crystallized zeolites are removed from the synthesis mixture after certain time duration. By varying the synthesis composition and the cation (inorganic and/or organic), a wide variety of zeolites with different framework structures can be synthesized. Among all crystalline aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates, over 230 crystallographically distinct zeolite framework types have been synthesized and documented in the database of the International Zeolite Association [6] .

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (such as acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics (like framework structure), significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. By adjusting the synthesis composition and cation type, a wide range of zeolites with diverse framework structures can be synthesized. This variety allows for optimization of catalyst properties to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For instance, the acid strength and stability of zeolites can be tailored to suit the requirements of specific dehydrogenation reactions. Additionally, the introduction of mesopores into zeolites can improve diffusion processes and electron transfer, further optimizing their performance.
