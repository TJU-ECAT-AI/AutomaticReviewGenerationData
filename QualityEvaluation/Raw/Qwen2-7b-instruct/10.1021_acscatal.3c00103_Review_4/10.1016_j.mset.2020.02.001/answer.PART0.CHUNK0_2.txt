1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as acid strength and stability, and their morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, modification strategies can be employed. These strategies may involve adjusting the surface area, porosity, and functional groups on the catalyst's surface. This optimization allows for better adsorption and desorption of reactants, leading to improved reaction rates and product selectivity.
