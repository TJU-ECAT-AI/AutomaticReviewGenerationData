          The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties determine the reaction rates and selectivity. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, modification strategies can be employed. These strategies often involve altering the catalyst's surface area, modifying its acidity, enhancing its stability under reaction conditions, and incorporating functional groups that can improve its interaction with reactants.
