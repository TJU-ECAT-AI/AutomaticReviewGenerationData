The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including acid strength and stability, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. High surface area and mechanical stability contribute to better catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Modification strategies often involve functionalization with different functional groups to optimize these properties. This process enhances the catalyst's ability to facilitate desired chemical transformations effectively.
