[1] "The majority of these examples are structures with distinctly different features to those reported here."
[2] "The preparation of finned zeolite crystals via a one-pot synthesis is arbitrary and difficult to predict owing to the largely unknown impact of synthesis parameters on zeolite crystallization."
[3] "Notably, the rough crystals reported in literature are commonly aggregates with small crystallites arranged in random orientations on the exterior surfaces of larger particles."
[4] "This is clearly evident when the conventional descriptor ethylene/2MBu is compared, which is a ratio of the signature products from the aromatic-based cycle (ethylene) and olefin-based cycle (2MBu, 2-methylbutane and 2-methyl-2-butene)."
[5] "Moreover, comparison of the product selectivities (Fig. 3c,d) reveals a subtle shift whereby finned zeolites, which seemingly behave as pseudo nanocrystallites of dimension α, promote the olefin-based cycle of the MTH hydrocarbon pool (HCP) mechanism."

To address the physicochemical properties of catalysts and their influence on dehydrogenation reactions, the literature demonstrates that the introduction of finned structures on zeolite catalysts enhances their performance. This is evidenced by improved mass transport properties, leading to reduced coke formation on external surfaces, longer catalyst lifetimes, and a shift in product selectivities towards olefin-based cycles. Specifically, the finned zeolites behave as pseudo nanocrystals of size α, promoting the olefin-based cycle of the MTH hydrocarbon pool mechanism. This behavior contrasts with conventional zeolite catalysts, where the aromatic-based cycle (characterized by the production of ethylene) is favored. The modification strategy employed here involves the synthesis of finned zeolite catalysts through either one-pot synthesis or secondary growth, which results in the enhancement of physicochemical properties, leading to optimized catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

[1] "Main The confined channels and cages of microporous materials (zeolites) are utilized in numerous applications, which span from catalysis1,2 and adsorption3 to selective separations4,5."
[2] "A common objective in the design of zeolitic materials is to overcome the inherent mass-transport limitations of micropores."
[3] "Indeed, only a relatively small number of reported zeolites have crystal sizes less than 100nm (refs. 12,13,14), which highlights the challenges associated with synthesizing nanosized microporous materials."
[4] "The synthesis of ZSM-11 by a previously reported protocol19 yields crystals with relatively smooth exterior surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[5] "We identified an alternative one-pot synthesis of ZSM-11 that produces crystals with finned surfaces (Fig. 1b,c)."
[6] "Moreover, textural analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2) shows no evidence of mesoporosity in ZSM-11 samples, although TEM tomography reveals the presence of isolated pores within the interior of these particles (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 1)."
[7] "Interestingly, the finned catalyst deviates from the trend of increasing lifetime with decreasing crystal size when comparisons are made on the basis of overall particle dimension; however, the trend is qualitatively consistent if the finned catalyst behaves as a crystal of much smaller size, commensurate with that of the average fin dimension (α35nm)."

1. The main objective in designing zeolitic materials is to address the inherent mass-transport limitations of micropores, which can hinder catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Synthesizing nanosized zeolites, particularly those below 100nm, presents significant challenges, as only a limited number of such zeolites have been successfully produced.

2. The one-pot synthesis method developed for finned ZSM-11 creates crystals with rough protrusions on their exterior surfaces, which exhibit an identical crystallographic registry with the interior crystal. This fin-like structure is analogous to fins that enhance heat transfer by increasing surface area.

3. The synthesis of finned ZSM-11 through secondary growth on the surface of seed crystals is a controllable method that avoids the unpredictability of one-pot synthesis parameters. The secondary growth process ensures that the fins grow epitaxially on the surfaces of the seeds.

4. The presence of fins on the surface of zeolite catalysts, specifically those of dimensions much smaller than the overall particle size (α << β), significantly reduces the internal diffusion limitations, leading to improved mass transport properties and enhanced performance.

5. The finned zeolite catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to conventional zeolites, particularly in terms of longer catalyst lifetimes and a shift in product selectivities towards olefin-based reactions. This behavior is consistent with the expected characteristics of pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to the average fin dimension.

6. The secondary growth technique can be applied to upgrade commercial catalysts, such as the finning of a ZSM-5 sample from Zeolyst (CBV5524G), which resulted in a catalyst with a prolonged lifetime and expected trends in product selectivity.

7. The mass-transport properties of finned zeolites are confirmed through kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which demonstrate that the introduction of protrusions with size α << β markedly reduces the internal diffusion path length for diffusing molecules, enhancing the mass transport characteristics of the zeolite.

8. Time-resolved UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides insights into the spatial and temporal progression of hydrocarbon species formation during the MTH reaction. The presence of fins leads to a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke, suggesting that olefins and small aromatics more readily diffuse through the fins, reducing the residence times of hydrogen-containing compounds near the pore mouths.

9. The ability to introduce fins through a facile secondary growth process is an alternative method to reduce diffusion limitations in zeolites, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the performance of commercial catalysts and potentially enabling the rational design of zeolites across a broad range of framework types.

1. 设计沸石材料的主要目标是克服微孔的固有传质限制，这会影响催化效率和选择性。合成纳米尺度的沸石（尤其是小于100nm的沸石）面临着巨大的挑战，因为只有为数不多的沸石被成功制备出来。

2. 对于ZSM-11的一锅法合成方法产生了具有粗糙突起的外表面晶体，这些突起与内部晶体在晶体学上保持一致的注册。这种鳍状结构类似于通过增加表面面积来提高热传递效率的鳍。

3. 通过在种子晶体表面上进行二次生长的方法，可以控制地在种子晶体表面上生成鳍状结构，这种方法避免了一锅法合成参数的不可预测性。二次生长过程确保鳍状结构以晶面相匹配的方式在种子晶体表面上生长。

4. 表面带有尺寸远小于整体颗粒大小（α << β）的鳍状结构的沸石催化剂，显著减少了内部扩散限制，从而提高了传质性能并增强了催化剂性能。

5. 与传统描述剂乙烯/2MBu相比，可以看出，带有鳍状结构的催化剂偏离了随着颗粒尺寸减小而增加寿命的趋势，但在基于总体颗粒尺寸的情况下，趋势在定性上是连续的，与平均鳍尺寸相匹配。

6. 通过二次生长技术可以升级商业催化剂，例如对Zeolyst的ZSM-5（MFI类型）样品进行鳍化，结果催化剂寿命延长，并且具有预期的产品选择性趋势。

7. 动力学蒙特卡罗（KMC）模拟证实了引入尺寸α << β的突出结构显著减少了扩散分子的内部扩散路径长度，从而提高了沸石的传质特性。

8. 时间分辨的紫外可见光散射光谱技术揭示了甲基叔丁醇脱氢反应中化合物形成的空间和时间进程。鳍状结构的存在导致外部焦炭的数量明显减少，这表明烯烃和较小的芳香族化合物更容易通过鳍状结构扩散，从而减少了靠近孔口的氢化合物的停留时间。

9. 通过简单易行的二次生长过程引入鳍状结构是减少沸石扩散限制的另一种方法，为增强商业催化剂的性能和可能地实现不同框架类型的沸石的理性设计提供了有前景的途径。

To answer the first question, the physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like the size, shape, and surface texture, play crucial roles in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine the ability of the catalyst to facilitate the desired chemical transformations efficiently. Morphological characteristics, especially in the context of the document, refer to the creation of fin-like protrusions on the surface of zeolite catalysts, which can significantly enhance mass transport properties. This enhancement is achieved by providing additional surface area for reactions and improving diffusion pathways within the catalyst. This strategy optimizes the catalyst's performance by reducing internal diffusion limitations, which is particularly beneficial for zeolites with low-dimensional pore networks.

For the second question, the finned synthesis approach allows for the modification of catalysts by creating pseudo-crystallites with sizes within an otherwise inaccessible range. This is accomplished through a secondary growth step that can be applied to commercial catalysts, leading to improved performance characteristics such as longer lifetime and altered product selectivity. As demonstrated by the work on ZSM-5 catalysts, this approach can be extended to various framework types, offering a versatile platform for the rational design of catalysts.

对于第一个问题，催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征（如大小、形状和表面纹理），在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。化学特性决定了催化剂促进所需化学转变的能力。形态特征，尤其是文档中提到的概念，指的是在分子筛催化剂表面上生成鳍状突起，这可以显著提高物质运输特性。通过提供额外的表面积来促进反应，并改善内部通道内的扩散路径，这种策略优化了催化剂的性能，减少了内部扩散限制，特别对具有低维孔网络的分子筛而言是有益的。

对于第二个问题，鳍状合成方法允许通过创建尺寸位于不可访问范围内的伪晶粒来修改催化剂。这是通过二次生长步骤实现的，可以应用于商用催化剂，从而提高性能特征，例如延长使用寿命和改变产物选择性。正如对ZSM-5催化剂的研究所显示的那样，这种方法可以扩展到各种框架类型，为催化剂的理性设计提供了灵活的平台。
