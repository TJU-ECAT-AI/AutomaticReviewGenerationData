[1] "The enhanced mass-transport properties of finned zeolites were further verified using an experimental protocol to assess internal diffusion based on time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy."
[2] "For the amine dosing process, He gas was flowed over the sample pellet to purge any remaining air. To ensure that the He was moisture-free, He gas was flowed through a liquid nitrogen trap and desiccator before reaching the cell body."
[3] "Collectively, these studies indicate that finned catalysts enhance mass-transport properties of the zeolite by suppressing the formation of external coke."

1. The enhanced mass-transport properties of finned zeolites were validated through time-resolved Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
2. Helium gas was used to purge the sample pellet and ensure that it was free of moisture before the amine dosing process.
3. Finned catalysts improve mass-transport properties of zeolites by reducing external coke formation.
