[1] "Producing zeolite crystals with sizes less than 100nm, however, is non-trivial, often requires the use of complex organics and typically results in a small product yield."
[2] "This approach could be extended to the rational synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials."
[3] "The majority of these examples are structures with distinctly different features to those reported here."
[4] "The one-pot synthesis of finned ZSM-11 improves the catalyst properties owing to a different mechanism: enhanced mass transport through fins of a much smaller dimension (that is, α<<β)."
[5] "The protocol to generate finned zeolites (Methods) was strategically selected by adjusting the supersaturation to a level that was sufficiently high to avoid layer-by-layer growth of coreshells (that is, complete overgrowth of seed crystals)."
[6] "Collectively, these studies indicate that finned catalysts enhance mass-transport properties of the zeolite by suppressing the formation of external coke."
[7] "For the amine dosing process, He gas was flowed over the sample pellet to purge any remaining air."

1. Synthesizing zeolite crystals smaller than 100nm is challenging, often necessitating the use of complex organics, and usually results in a low product yield.

2. The methodology developed for finned zeolites can potentially be applied to the synthesis of other zeolite and aluminosilicate materials.

3. Most previously reported rough zeolite crystals have distinct characteristics不同于 the ones discussed here.

4. The one-pot synthesis of finned ZSM-11 enhances catalyst performance through improved mass transport facilitated by fins of significantly smaller dimensions compared to the original crystal size.

5. The synthesis of finned zeolites involved adjusting the supersaturation level to prevent the layer-by-layer growth of core-shells, avoiding the complete overgrowth of seed crystals.

6. Finned catalysts improve mass transport properties in zeolites by reducing the formation of external coke.

7. Helium gas was used to purge any residual air from the sample pellet before dosing with the purified amines.
