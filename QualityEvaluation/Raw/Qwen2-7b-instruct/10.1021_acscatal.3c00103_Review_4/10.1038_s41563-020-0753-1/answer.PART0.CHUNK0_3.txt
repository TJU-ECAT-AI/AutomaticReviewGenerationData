[1] "One advantage of the finned synthesis approach is that it is theoretically applicable to a wide range of framework types."
[2] "Moreover, this approach can be used to upgrade commercial catalysts via the addition of a secondary growth step."
[3] "As proof of principle, we performed a seeded growth experiment using a commercial ZSM-5 sample from Zeolyst (CBV5524G, Si/Al=25)."
[4] "The preparation of finned zeolites offers a unique route to achieve pseudo-crystallites within this largely inaccessible size range."
[5] "This seemingly implies that olefins and small aromatics more readily diffuse through the fins, which leads to reduced residence times of HCP species near the pore mouths."

To answer the first question, the physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics like the size, shape, and surface texture, play crucial roles in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities determine the ability of the catalyst to facilitate the desired chemical transformations efficiently. Morphological characteristics, especially in the context of the document, refer to the creation of fin-like protrusions on the surface of zeolite catalysts, which can significantly enhance mass transport properties. This enhancement is achieved by providing additional surface area for reactions and improving diffusion pathways within the catalyst. This strategy optimizes the catalyst's performance by reducing internal diffusion limitations, which is particularly beneficial for zeolites with low-dimensional pore networks.

For the second question, the finned synthesis approach allows for the modification of catalysts by creating pseudo-crystallites with sizes within an otherwise inaccessible range. This is accomplished through a secondary growth step that can be applied to commercial catalysts, leading to improved performance characteristics such as longer lifetime and altered product selectivity. As demonstrated by the work on ZSM-5 catalysts, this approach can be extended to various framework types, offering a versatile platform for the rational design of catalysts.

对于第一个问题，催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性，以及形态特征（如大小、形状和表面纹理），在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。化学特性决定了催化剂促进所需化学转变的能力。形态特征，尤其是文档中提到的概念，指的是在分子筛催化剂表面上生成鳍状突起，这可以显著提高物质运输特性。通过提供额外的表面积来促进反应，并改善内部通道内的扩散路径，这种策略优化了催化剂的性能，减少了内部扩散限制，特别对具有低维孔网络的分子筛而言是有益的。

对于第二个问题，鳍状合成方法允许通过创建尺寸位于不可访问范围内的伪晶粒来修改催化剂。这是通过二次生长步骤实现的，可以应用于商用催化剂，从而提高性能特征，例如延长使用寿命和改变产物选择性。正如对ZSM-5催化剂的研究所显示的那样，这种方法可以扩展到各种框架类型，为催化剂的理性设计提供了灵活的平台。
