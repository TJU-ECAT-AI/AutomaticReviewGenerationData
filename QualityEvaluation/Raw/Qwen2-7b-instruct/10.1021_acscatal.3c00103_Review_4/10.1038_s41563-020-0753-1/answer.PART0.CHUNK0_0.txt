[1] "The majority of these examples are structures with distinctly different features to those reported here."
[2] "The preparation of finned zeolite crystals via a one-pot synthesis is arbitrary and difficult to predict owing to the largely unknown impact of synthesis parameters on zeolite crystallization."
[3] "Notably, the rough crystals reported in literature are commonly aggregates with small crystallites arranged in random orientations on the exterior surfaces of larger particles."
[4] "This is clearly evident when the conventional descriptor ethylene/2MBu is compared, which is a ratio of the signature products from the aromatic-based cycle (ethylene) and olefin-based cycle (2MBu, 2-methylbutane and 2-methyl-2-butene)."
[5] "Moreover, comparison of the product selectivities (Fig. 3c,d) reveals a subtle shift whereby finned zeolites, which seemingly behave as pseudo nanocrystallites of dimension α, promote the olefin-based cycle of the MTH hydrocarbon pool (HCP) mechanism."

To address the physicochemical properties of catalysts and their influence on dehydrogenation reactions, the literature demonstrates that the introduction of finned structures on zeolite catalysts enhances their performance. This is evidenced by improved mass transport properties, leading to reduced coke formation on external surfaces, longer catalyst lifetimes, and a shift in product selectivities towards olefin-based cycles. Specifically, the finned zeolites behave as pseudo nanocrystals of size α, promoting the olefin-based cycle of the MTH hydrocarbon pool mechanism. This behavior contrasts with conventional zeolite catalysts, where the aromatic-based cycle (characterized by the production of ethylene) is favored. The modification strategy employed here involves the synthesis of finned zeolite catalysts through either one-pot synthesis or secondary growth, which results in the enhancement of physicochemical properties, leading to optimized catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

为了探讨催化剂的物理化学性质及其在脱氢反应中的影响，文献表明在沸石催化剂上引入鳍状结构可以提高其性能。这通过改善质量传输特性体现出来，从而减少了外部表面的焦炭形成，延长了催化剂的寿命，并且促进了以烯烃为基础的循环的产物选择性。具体来说，鳍状沸石催化剂似乎表现出类似尺寸为α的准纳米晶行为，促进MTH烃池机制中烯烃为基础的循环的产物。这种行为与传统的沸石催化剂形成对比，在后者中芳香族循环（以乙烯为主要产物）占主导地位。这里采用的修改策略包括通过一锅法合成或二次生长合成鳍状沸石催化剂，从而提高了物理化学性质，最终优化了催化效率和选择性。
