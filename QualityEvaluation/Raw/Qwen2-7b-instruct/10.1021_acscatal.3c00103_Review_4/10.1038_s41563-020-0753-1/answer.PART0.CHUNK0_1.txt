[1] "Main The confined channels and cages of microporous materials (zeolites) are utilized in numerous applications, which span from catalysis1,2 and adsorption3 to selective separations4,5."
[2] "A common objective in the design of zeolitic materials is to overcome the inherent mass-transport limitations of micropores."
[3] "Indeed, only a relatively small number of reported zeolites have crystal sizes less than 100nm (refs. 12,13,14), which highlights the challenges associated with synthesizing nanosized microporous materials."
[4] "The synthesis of ZSM-11 by a previously reported protocol19 yields crystals with relatively smooth exterior surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 1)."
[5] "We identified an alternative one-pot synthesis of ZSM-11 that produces crystals with finned surfaces (Fig. 1b,c)."
[6] "Moreover, textural analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2) shows no evidence of mesoporosity in ZSM-11 samples, although TEM tomography reveals the presence of isolated pores within the interior of these particles (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Video 1)."
[7] "Interestingly, the finned catalyst deviates from the trend of increasing lifetime with decreasing crystal size when comparisons are made on the basis of overall particle dimension; however, the trend is qualitatively consistent if the finned catalyst behaves as a crystal of much smaller size, commensurate with that of the average fin dimension (α35nm)."
[8] "Here we demonstrate the secondary growth method for both ZSM-11 (Fig. 2ad) and ZSM-5 (Fig. 2eh)."
[9] "This is clearly evident when the conventional descriptor ethylene/2MBu is compared, which is a ratio of the signature products from the aromatic-based cycle (ethylene) and olefin-based cycle (2MBu, 2-methylbutane and 2-methyl-2-butene)."
[10] "It was previously shown30 that a UVvis spectrum obtained during MTH catalysis can be grouped into three distinct regions of wavelengths, which correspond to HCP species as well as to small and large polyaromatics."

1. The main objective in designing zeolitic materials is to address the inherent mass-transport limitations of micropores, which can hinder catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Synthesizing nanosized zeolites, particularly those below 100nm, presents significant challenges, as only a limited number of such zeolites have been successfully produced.

2. The one-pot synthesis method developed for finned ZSM-11 creates crystals with rough protrusions on their exterior surfaces, which exhibit an identical crystallographic registry with the interior crystal. This fin-like structure is analogous to fins that enhance heat transfer by increasing surface area.

3. The synthesis of finned ZSM-11 through secondary growth on the surface of seed crystals is a controllable method that avoids the unpredictability of one-pot synthesis parameters. The secondary growth process ensures that the fins grow epitaxially on the surfaces of the seeds.

4. The presence of fins on the surface of zeolite catalysts, specifically those of dimensions much smaller than the overall particle size (α << β), significantly reduces the internal diffusion limitations, leading to improved mass transport properties and enhanced performance.

5. The finned zeolite catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to conventional zeolites, particularly in terms of longer catalyst lifetimes and a shift in product selectivities towards olefin-based reactions. This behavior is consistent with the expected characteristics of pseudo-nanocrystals with sizes commensurate to the average fin dimension.

6. The secondary growth technique can be applied to upgrade commercial catalysts, such as the finning of a ZSM-5 sample from Zeolyst (CBV5524G), which resulted in a catalyst with a prolonged lifetime and expected trends in product selectivity.

7. The mass-transport properties of finned zeolites are confirmed through kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, which demonstrate that the introduction of protrusions with size α << β markedly reduces the internal diffusion path length for diffusing molecules, enhancing the mass transport characteristics of the zeolite.

8. Time-resolved UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides insights into the spatial and temporal progression of hydrocarbon species formation during the MTH reaction. The presence of fins leads to a noticeable reduction in the quantity of external coke, suggesting that olefins and small aromatics more readily diffuse through the fins, reducing the residence times of hydrogen-containing compounds near the pore mouths.

9. The ability to introduce fins through a facile secondary growth process is an alternative method to reduce diffusion limitations in zeolites, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the performance of commercial catalysts and potentially enabling the rational design of zeolites across a broad range of framework types.

1. 设计沸石材料的主要目标是克服微孔的固有传质限制，这会影响催化效率和选择性。合成纳米尺度的沸石（尤其是小于100nm的沸石）面临着巨大的挑战，因为只有为数不多的沸石被成功制备出来。
