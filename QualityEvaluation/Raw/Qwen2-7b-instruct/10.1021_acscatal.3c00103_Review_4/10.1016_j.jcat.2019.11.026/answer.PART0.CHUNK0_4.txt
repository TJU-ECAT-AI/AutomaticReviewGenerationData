<p>Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heterogeneous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the (100) facets of commercial γ-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36] ,[37] . The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in PDH reaction [38] . The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong interactions between metals and support [39] . This PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction.</p>
<p>Extensive characterization demonstrates that the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site is stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix, facilitating propylene desorption to inhibit formation of coke and other byproducts and to free the active Co sites.</p>

Physicochemical properties, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact the performance of catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. By modifying the support, such as through the use of γ-Al2O3 sheets, specific interactions can enhance the dispersion and stabilization of active sites like Co2+. This stabilization facilitates propylene desorption, inhibits coke formation, and frees active Co sites, thereby optimizing catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Strategies like tailoring the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites can further improve PDH reaction performance by controlling the active site states and enhancing the selectivity towards propylene.

物理化学性质，包括如酸强度和稳定性等化学性质以及形态特征，对脱氢反应中催化剂的性能有显著影响。通过改变支持材料，如γ-Al2O3薄片，可以增强活性位点（如Co2+）的分散性和稳定性。这种稳定化促进了丙烯的脱附，抑制了焦炭和其他副产品的形成，并释放了活性Co位点，从而优化了催化效率和选择性。通过控制Co2+和Al2O3复合物的结构策略，进一步改进PDH反应性能，控制活性位点状态并增强丙烯的选择性。
