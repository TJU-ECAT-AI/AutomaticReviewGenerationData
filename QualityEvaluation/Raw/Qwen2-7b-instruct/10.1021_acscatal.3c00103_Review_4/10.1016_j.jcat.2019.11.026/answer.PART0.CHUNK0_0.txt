1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the stability and strength of acid sites on the support can enhance catalytic activity. Tailoring the structure of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites allows for improved catalytic performance and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The morphology of catalysts plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity. The sheet-like morphology of CoAl2O3HT catalysts, compared to the presence of individual nanoparticles in Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts, influences the reactivity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。具体来说，支持上的酸性位点的稳定性和强度可以增强催化活性。通过调整Co2+和Al2O3复合材料的结构，可以提高PDH反应的催化性能和选择性。

2. 催化剂的形态在增强反应性和选择性方面起着关键作用。与Co/Al2O3-IMP催化剂中的单个纳米粒子相比，CoAl2O3HT催化剂的层状形态影响PDH反应的活性和选择性。
