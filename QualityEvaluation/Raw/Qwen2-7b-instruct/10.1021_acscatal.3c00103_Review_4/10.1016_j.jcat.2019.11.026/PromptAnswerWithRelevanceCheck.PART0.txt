1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including the chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. These properties determine the reactivity, selectivity, and longevity of the catalysts. For instance, the γ-Al2O3 matrix stabilizes the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site, which facilitates propylene desorption, inhibits coke formation, and frees the active Co sites. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 allows for the high dispersion of Ga3+ cations, enhancing activity and stability in PDH reactions. Additionally, the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet with 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites stabilizes bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters, showcasing the importance of metal-support interactions. Eliminating hydroxyl groups from Al2O3 enhances the activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as surface active sites, further illustrating the role of morphology and chemical properties in catalytic efficiency.

2. Support modification strategies can be employed to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity. For example, using γ-Al2O3 as a support stabilizes Co2+ sites, improving desorption and selectivity. The incorporation of other materials like Ga2O3 can enhance dispersion and stability, while eliminating hydroxyl groups can activate Al3+ sites for better reactivity. Tailoring the morphology, such as creating nanosheets, can improve surface area and interaction with active metals. These strategies aim to create a balance between the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst to achieve optimal performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能有着显著影响。这些属性决定了催化剂的活性、选择性和寿命。例如，γ-Al2O3矩阵稳定了四面体Co2+孤立位点，促进了丙烯的脱附，抑制了焦炭和其他副产品的形成，并释放了活性Co位点。Ga2O3与Al2O3之间的特定相互作用允许Ga3+离子在γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体中高度分散，从而提高了PDH反应的活性和稳定性。γ-Al2O3纳米片含有27%五配位Al3+位点，能够很好地分散并稳定PtSn二金属纳米簇，这展示了金属-支持相互作用的重要性。消除Al2O3上的羟基组分可以激活表面活性的Al3+位点，进一步说明了形态和化学性质在催化效率中的作用。

2. 可以采用支持修改策略来优化这些属性以提高催化效率和选择性。例如，使用γ-Al2O3作为支持可以稳定Co2+位点，改善脱附和选择性。引入其他材料如Ga2O3可以增强分散性和稳定性，而消除羟基可以激活Al3+位点以实现更好的活性。通过调整形态，如创建纳米片，可以提高表面积并与活性金属的相互作用。这些策略旨在平衡催化剂的物理和化学属性，以实现脱氢反应的最佳性能。

1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the presence of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface can serve as anchor sites for atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites, enhancing the catalyst's performance. For instance, a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst demonstrated excellent performance in PDH reactions at high space velocities. Additionally, eliminating hydroxyl groups from Al2O3 can increase the activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites, which are crucial for non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with specific coordination numbers of Al3+ sites can effectively disperse and stabilize bimetallic nanoclusters, improving the catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. The structure of the catalyst plays a pivotal role in its performance. As illustrated in Figure 1, the CoAl2O3HT catalyst exhibits a sheet-like morphology, consisting of nanosheets with a thickness of less than 6 nm, devoid of nanoparticles. In contrast, the Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst displays individual nanoparticles dispersed on the Al2O3 sheets. These morphological differences suggest that the structure of the catalyst influences its activity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

3. Detailed characterizations, including UVVisDR spectra, XRD patterns, TGA, and XPS, are essential for understanding the physicochemical properties of catalysts. These techniques provide insights into the catalyst's composition, phase structure, and surface chemistry, enabling researchers to optimize the catalyst for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction is a critical factor affecting the catalyst's performance. Understanding and optimizing this behavior can lead to improved catalytic activity and stability in PDH processes.

2. 催化剂的结构对其性能起着决定性的作用。如图1所示，CoAl2O3HT催化剂表现出层状形态，由厚度小于6nm的纳米片组成，不含纳米颗粒。相比之下，Co/Al2O3-IMP催化剂显示为分散在Al2O3片上的单个纳米颗粒。这些形态差异表明催化剂的结构影响其在PDH反应中的活性和选择性。

3. 细致的表征技术，包括UVVisDR光谱、XRD图案、TGA和XPS，对于理解催化剂的物理化学性质至关重要。这些方法提供了有关催化剂组成的洞察，相结构和表面化学的信息，使研究人员能够优化催化剂以提高脱氢反应的催化效率和选择性。
