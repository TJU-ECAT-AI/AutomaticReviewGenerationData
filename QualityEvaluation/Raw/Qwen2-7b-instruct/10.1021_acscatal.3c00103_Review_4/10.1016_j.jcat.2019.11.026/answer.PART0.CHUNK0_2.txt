[1] "In this work, a sheet-shaped CoAl2O3 catalyst comprising of isolate Co2+ sites shows a high intrinsic activity (specific reaction rate > 16 mmol g1 h1) and catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction (>97% C3H6 selectivity)."
[2] "Extensive characterization demonstrates that the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site is stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix, facilitating propylene desorption to inhibit formation of coke and other byproducts and to free the active Co sites."
[3] "The structural and catalytic stabilities as well as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst."
[4] "We further illustrate the effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction."

Physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The study highlights the importance of the structure of active sites, such as the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site, which is stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix. This stabilization facilitates propylene desorption, inhibits coke formation, and frees the active Co sites, thereby enhancing both catalytic activity and stability. The sheet-shaped CoAl2O3 catalysts demonstrate high intrinsic activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation to propylene, showcasing the effectiveness of modifying catalyst structures for optimized catalytic performance and selectivity.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性和形态特征，在脱氢反应中起着重要作用。研究强调了活性位点结构的重要性，如四面体Co2+孤立位点被γ-Al2O3骨架稳定。这种稳定促进了丙烯的脱附，抑制了焦炭和其他副产品的形成，并释放了活性Co位点，从而提高了催化活性和稳定性。这种片状CoAl2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯时表现出高内在活性和选择性，展示了通过修改催化剂结构优化催化性能和选择性的有效性。
