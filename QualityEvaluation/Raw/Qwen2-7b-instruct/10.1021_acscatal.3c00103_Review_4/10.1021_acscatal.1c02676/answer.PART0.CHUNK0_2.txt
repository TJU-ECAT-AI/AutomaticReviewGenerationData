<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The physicochemical properties of catalysts, which include acid strength, stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Optimization of these properties through modification strategies can enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. These strategies may involve altering the catalyst's surface area, modifying its acidity, or improving its stability under reaction conditions.
