[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene."
[2] "However, the Pt-based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at 600C by side reactions and coke formation."
[3] "Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles."
[4] "The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH."
[5] "The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600C) was achieved."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities (like acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. For instance, the presence of basic additives or supports can alter these properties to optimize catalytic efficiency and selectivity. In the case of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), modifying the geometric and electronic properties of intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca can enhance stability. Pb blocks the Pt3 sites, while Ca provides an electron-enriched Pt1 site, creating a synergistic effect that markedly improves catalytic stability in PDH. This leads to a catalyst that exhibits superior stability, achieving month-long stability even at high temperatures, surpassing previously reported catalysts.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括其化学性质（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有重大影响。例如，基本添加剂或支持物的存在可以改变这些属性，以优化催化效率和选择性。对于基于铂的丙烷脱氢（PDH）催化剂，通过向铂镓间金属体中添加铅和钙来修改其几何和电子特性，可以增强稳定性。铅阻塞了铂3位点，而钙提供了富电子的铂1位点，产生协同效应，显著提高了PDH的催化稳定性。这导致了一种催化剂，其稳定性远远超过之前报道的催化剂，即使在高温下也能实现长达一个月的稳定运行，这是前所未有的。
