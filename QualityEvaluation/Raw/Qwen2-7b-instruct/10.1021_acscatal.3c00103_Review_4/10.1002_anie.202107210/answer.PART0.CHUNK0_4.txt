1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, encompassing their chemical qualities (acid strength and stability) and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Various strategies for modifying the support aim to optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

2. In the study, Pb was strategically deposited on the three-fold Pt (and Ga) sites of the PtGa nanoparticles, while Ca was positioned around the nanoparticles to confer them with an electron-enriched Pt1 site, which acts as an active site for highly selective propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

3. The synergistic effects of these modifications led to a remarkable improvement in the catalytic stability of PDH.

4. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst demonstrated unprecedented stability, achieving month-long stability even at 600°C, surpassing previous reports in the field.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，包括其化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）和形态特征，在脱氢反应中的性能起着关键作用。为了优化这些属性以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用多种支持改性策略。

2. 在研究中，Pb被精确地沉积在PtGa纳米颗粒的三折Pt（和Ga）位点上，而Ca则围绕在纳米颗粒周围，赋予它们一个电子丰富的Pt1位点，该位点作为高度选择性的丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性位点。

3. 这些修改的协同效果显著提高了PDH的催化稳定性。

4. PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂展现了前所未有的稳定性，即使在600°C的高温下也能保持长达一个月的稳定，超过了以往报道的催化剂性能。
