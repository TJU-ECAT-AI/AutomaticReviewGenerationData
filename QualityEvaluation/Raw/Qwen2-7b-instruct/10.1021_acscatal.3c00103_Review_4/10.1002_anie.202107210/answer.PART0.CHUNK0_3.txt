1. The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their chemical qualities like acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies, such as adding basic additives or altering the support material, can optimize these properties to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity. In the case discussed, the addition of calcium (Ca) and lead (Pb) to the intermetallic platinum-gallium (PtGa) catalyst notably improved its stability, achieving unparalleled performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at high temperatures.

2. The PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability in PDH, maintaining high performance over months at 600°C, a level surpassing any previously reported PDH catalyst. This remarkable stability was attributed to the synergistic effects of the added calcium and lead, enhancing the catalyst's ability to withstand harsh reaction conditions without deactivation.

3. Among various additives and support materials tested, calcium was found to be uniquely effective in modifying the PtGa intermetallic structure for the double-decoration strategy. No other additives or supports matched calcium's efficacy in optimizing the catalyst's performance, underscoring its critical role in achieving the enhanced stability observed in the PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst.

1. 催化剂的物理化学性质，尤其是它们的化学特性（如酸强度和稳定性）以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。优化策略，如添加基本添加剂或改变支持材料，可以调整这些属性以提高催化效率和选择性。在讨论中，向铂-镓（PtGa）催化剂中添加钙（Ca）和铅（Pb）明显提高了其稳定性，在高温度下实现了丙烷脱氢（PDH）的卓越性能。

2. PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂在PDH中的稳定性表现出色，在600°C下保持高水平性能长达数月，这一水平超越了任何已报道的PDH催化剂。这种令人瞩目的稳定性归因于添加的钙和铅的协同效应，增强了催化剂在苛刻反应条件下的耐久性，而不会导致失效。

3. 在测试的各种添加剂和支持材料中，仅钙被发现是有效修改PtGa互金属结构的双修饰策略的关键。没有其他添加剂或支持材料能与钙相匹配，优化催化剂的性能，这强调了钙在实现PtGaCaPb/SiO2催化剂所观察到的增强稳定性的关键作用。
