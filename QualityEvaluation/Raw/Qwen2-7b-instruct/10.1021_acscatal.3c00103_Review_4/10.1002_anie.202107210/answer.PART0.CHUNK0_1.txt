[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene."
[2] "However, the Pt-based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at 600C by side reactions and coke formation."
[3] "Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively."
[4] "Thus, materials possessing isolated Pt sites with high thermal stability should be utilized for continuous working at a high temperature (600C)."
[5] "This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly chemical qualities like stability and morphology, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Chemical qualities, such as acid strength, affect the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. Morphological characteristics, including particle size, shape, and surface area, influence the accessibility of reactants to the active sites. To optimize these properties for enhanced catalytic efficiency and selectivity, support modification strategies can be employed. For example, in this study, the introduction of Pb and Ca onto PtGa intermetallics modifies the geometric and electronic properties, respectively, leading to improved stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

In this research, the double-decoration technique effectively combines the geometric and electronic promotion effects without altering the PtGa structure. This innovation results in a catalyst that demonstrates unprecedented stability and high activity in PDH, even at high temperatures (600°C). The combination of Pb and Ca leads to the creation of isolated Pt1 sites with enhanced electronic properties, which are crucial for the efficient dehydrogenation of propane without the formation of coke or other undesirable side products.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是化学特性和形态特性，显著影响其在脱氢反应中的性能。化学特性，如酸强度，影响催化剂的反应性和选择性。形态特性，包括颗粒大小、形状和表面积，影响反应物对活性位点的可达性。为了优化这些特性以提高催化效率和选择性，可以采用支持改性策略。例如，在这项研究中，将Pb和Ca引入到PtGa互金属中，分别修改几何和电子性质，从而提高了稳定性并增强了丙烷脱氢（PDH）的选择性。

在本研究中，双修饰技术有效地结合了几何和电子促进效应而不改变PtGa结构。这一创新结果产生了一种催化剂，在PDH中表现出前所未有的稳定性和高活性，即使在高温（600°C）下也是如此。Pb和Ca的组合导致了具有增强电子特性的孤立Pt1位点的创建，这对于高效地将丙烷脱氢为丙烯而不会形成焦炭或其他不良副产物至关重要。
