The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the context of this study, the use of a simple and scalable method for preparing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with superior catalytic properties was demonstrated. The key factors contributing to these improvements were:

1. Improved Pt dispersion through the introduction of a large amount of NaCl along with the platinum precursor during the impregnation process.
2. Prevention of sintering during calcination due to the role of NaCl in promoting Pt dispersion.
3. Suppression of zeolite acidity by the presence of NaCl, which helps maintain the integrity of the catalyst structure.
4. Further enhancement of catalyst activity and stability through washing steps after calcination, which redisperses water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.
5. Specific conditions such as high external surface acid site concentrations, a Na/Pt atomic ratio of 4070, calcination temperatures ranging from 400 to 500°C, washing with water, and a strategic order of component introduction when excess NaCl and the Pt precursor are calcined together, all contribute to the optimization of Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

These modifications aim to tailor the catalyst's physicochemical properties to achieve higher activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括化学特性如酸强度和稳定性以及形态特征，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。在本研究中，展示了一种简单且可扩展的方法来制备具有优越催化性能的丙烷脱氢催化剂。这些改进的关键因素包括：

1. 在浸渍过程中通过铂前体与大量NaCl的引入，显著改善了铂的分布。
2. 钠氯在煅烧过程中的作用，促进了铂的分散，防止了结块。
3. 通过钠氯抑制沸石酸性，有助于保持催化剂结构的完整性。
4. 煅烧后清洗步骤进一步提高了催化剂活性和稳定性，通过重新分散水溶性氯化铂化合物。
5. 特定条件，如高外部表面酸位浓度、钠/铂原子比为4070、煅烧温度在400至500°C之间、用水清洗、以及在煅烧时同时加入过量的钠氯和铂前体时的成分引入顺序，都对铂分散和催化剂稳定性进行了优化。

这些修改旨在根据脱氢反应的需求调整催化剂的物理化学性质，以实现更高的活性和选择性。
