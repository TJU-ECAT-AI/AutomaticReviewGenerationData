[4] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the dispersion of active components like platinum (Pt), the stability of the catalyst, and the balance of acidity and basicity contribute to its efficiency and selectivity. Modification strategies such as the use of an excess of sodium chloride (NaCl) during the impregnation process, followed by calcination and washing, can enhance these properties. The high external surface acid site concentrations, the optimal ratio of Na/Pt atoms, the specific calcination temperature range, and the order of component introduction during preparation contribute to better dispersion of Pt and increased stability of the catalyst.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性和形态特征，在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。特别是铂（Pt）的分散度、催化剂的稳定性以及酸性和碱性的平衡，都影响其效率和选择性。通过使用过量的氯化钠（NaCl）在浸渍过程中，随后进行煅烧和洗涤的修改策略可以增强这些性质。高外部表面酸性位点浓度、Na/Pt原子比例的适宜值、特定的煅烧温度范围以及准备过程中的成分引入顺序，都有助于提高Pt的分散性和催化剂的稳定性。

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including chemical qualities such as acid strength and stability, and morphological characteristics, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. In the context of this study, the use of a simple and scalable method for preparing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with superior catalytic properties was demonstrated. The key factors contributing to these improvements were:

1. Improved Pt dispersion through the introduction of a large amount of NaCl along with the platinum precursor during the impregnation process.
2. Prevention of sintering during calcination due to the role of NaCl in promoting Pt dispersion.
3. Suppression of zeolite acidity by the presence of NaCl, which helps maintain the integrity of the catalyst structure.
4. Further enhancement of catalyst activity and stability through washing steps after calcination, which redisperses water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.
5. Specific conditions such as high external surface acid site concentrations, a Na/Pt atomic ratio of 4070, calcination temperatures ranging from 400 to 500°C, washing with water, and a strategic order of component introduction when excess NaCl and the Pt precursor are calcined together, all contribute to the optimization of Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.

These modifications aim to tailor the catalyst's physicochemical properties to achieve higher activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as their dispersion, stability, and acid strength, play a crucial role in their performance during dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies aimed at optimizing these properties typically involve enhancing Pt dispersion, which can be achieved through the use of a large amount of NaCl during the impregnation process. This not only prevents sintering during calcination but also helps in suppressing zeolite acidity. Further optimization may include washing the catalyst post-calcination to redispense water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds, thereby increasing both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Additionally, parameters such as the Na/Pt atomic ratio, calcination temperature, and the sequence of component introduction when preparing the catalyst can also significantly impact the dispersion and stability of Pt, contributing to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity.
