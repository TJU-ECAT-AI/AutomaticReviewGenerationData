<p>A simple and scalable method is presented for preparing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with superior catalytic properties.</p>
<p>Pt distribution is significantly improved when the platinum precursor and a large amount of NaCl are introduced into the MFI zeolite by impregnation, and after calcining and fixing the active components in the insoluble form, the excess of inert salt is washed with water.</p>
<p>NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity.</p>
<p>Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds.</p>
<p>High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability.</p>

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as dispersion, stability, and acidity, significantly influence their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies to optimize these properties often involve adjusting the catalyst composition and processing methods. In the context of the study, the use of NaCl as a promoter during the preparation of Pt/MFI zeolite catalysts enhances dispersion, prevents sintering, and reduces acidity. Further washing after calcination redisperses water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds, increasing activity and stability. Factors like high external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, washing with water, and the sequence of component introduction also contribute to improved dispersion and stability.

催化剂的物理化学性质，如分散性、稳定性以及酸性，对脱氢反应的性能有着显著影响。优化这些性质的修改策略通常涉及调整催化剂的组成和加工方法。在研究中，使用NaCl作为促进剂在制备Pt/MFI沸石催化剂过程中的作用是提高分散性、防止结块并减少酸性。进一步的清洗后煅烧则能重新分散水溶性的氯化铂化合物，从而增加活性和稳定性。因素如较高的外部表面酸基团浓度、特定的Na/Pt原子比、煅烧温度、用水清洗以及成分引入顺序的安排也对改善分散性和稳定性有贡献。
