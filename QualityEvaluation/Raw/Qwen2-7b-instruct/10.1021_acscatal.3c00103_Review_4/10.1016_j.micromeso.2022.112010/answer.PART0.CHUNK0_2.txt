The physicochemical properties of catalysts, such as their dispersion, stability, and acid strength, play a crucial role in their performance during dehydrogenation reactions. Modification strategies aimed at optimizing these properties typically involve enhancing Pt dispersion, which can be achieved through the use of a large amount of NaCl during the impregnation process. This not only prevents sintering during calcination but also helps in suppressing zeolite acidity. Further optimization may include washing the catalyst post-calcination to redispense water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds, thereby increasing both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Additionally, parameters such as the Na/Pt atomic ratio, calcination temperature, and the sequence of component introduction when preparing the catalyst can also significantly impact the dispersion and stability of Pt, contributing to improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity.

物理化学性质，如分散性、稳定性以及酸强度，在脱氢反应中对催化剂性能至关重要。为了优化这些属性，通常采用的策略包括提高铂的分散性，这可以通过在浸渍过程中加入大量氯化钠来实现。这不仅可以在煅烧过程中防止结块，还能有效抑制沸石的酸性。进一步的优化可能包括在煅烧后清洗催化剂，以重新分散水溶性的氯化铂化合物，从而增加催化剂的活性和稳定性。此外，如钠/铂原子比、煅烧温度以及在准备催化剂时各成分的引入顺序等参数，也可能显著影响铂的分散性和稳定性，进而促进催化效率和选择性的提升。
