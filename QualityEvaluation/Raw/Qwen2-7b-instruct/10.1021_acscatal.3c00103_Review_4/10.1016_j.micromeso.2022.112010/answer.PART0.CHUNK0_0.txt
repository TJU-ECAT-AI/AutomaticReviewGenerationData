[1] "A simple and scalable method is presented for preparing propane dehydrogenation catalysts with superior catalytic properties."
[2] "NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and effectively suppresses zeolite acidity."
[3] "Washing after the calcination of Pt-containing catalysts further increases the catalyst activity and stability due to the redispersion of water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds."
[4] "High external surface acid site concentrations, Na/Pt atomic ratios of 4070, calcination temperatures of 400500 C, washing with water, and the order of component introduction when the excess NaCl and the precursor of Pt are calcined jointly contribute to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability."

The physicochemical properties of catalysts, including their chemical qualities and morphological characteristics, play a crucial role in influencing their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, the dispersion of active components like platinum (Pt), the stability of the catalyst, and the balance of acidity and basicity contribute to its efficiency and selectivity. Modification strategies such as the use of an excess of sodium chloride (NaCl) during the impregnation process, followed by calcination and washing, can enhance these properties. The high external surface acid site concentrations, the optimal ratio of Na/Pt atoms, the specific calcination temperature range, and the order of component introduction during preparation contribute to better dispersion of Pt and increased stability of the catalyst.

催化剂的物理化学性质，包括它们的化学特性和形态特征，在决定其在脱氢反应中的性能方面起着关键作用。特别是铂（Pt）的分散度、催化剂的稳定性以及酸性和碱性的平衡，都影响其效率和选择性。通过使用过量的氯化钠（NaCl）在浸渍过程中，随后进行煅烧和洗涤的修改策略可以增强这些性质。高外部表面酸性位点浓度、Na/Pt原子比例的适宜值、特定的煅烧温度范围以及准备过程中的成分引入顺序，都有助于提高Pt的分散性和催化剂的稳定性。
