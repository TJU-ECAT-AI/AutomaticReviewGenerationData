The physicochemical properties of catalysts, particularly their acid strength, stability, and morphology, significantly impact their performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The presence of NaCl promotes Pt dispersion, prevents sintering during calcination, and reduces zeolite acidity. Washing after calcination further enhances catalyst activity and stability by redispersing water-soluble chlorinated Pt compounds. Optimizing parameters such as high external surface acid site concentrations, specific Na/Pt atomic ratios, calcination temperatures, and the sequence of component introduction can lead to improved Pt dispersion and catalyst stability, thereby enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the dehydrogenation process.

催化剂的物理化学性质，特别是酸强度、稳定性以及形态，对脱氢反应的性能有显著影响。NaCl的存在促进铂分布，防止煅烧过程中的聚集，并有效抑制沸石的酸性。煅烧后清洗催化剂进一步提高了活性和稳定性，通过重新分散水溶性的氯化铂化合物。优化外部表面酸基团浓度、特定的Na/Pt原子比、煅烧温度、成分引入顺序等参数可以提高铂分布和催化剂稳定性，从而增强脱氢过程的效率和选择性。
