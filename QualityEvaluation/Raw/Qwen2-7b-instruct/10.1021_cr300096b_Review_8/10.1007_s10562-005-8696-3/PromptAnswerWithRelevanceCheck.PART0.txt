How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

The study employed the low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The researchers conducted temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments demonstrating that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a phenomenon not observed on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. Furthermore, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated higher activity towards the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This comparison provided a clear example of correlating the self-hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on both bimetallic model surfaces and supported catalysts.

研究利用环己烯在低温下的自我氢化（异构化）作为探针反应，以关联Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与负载在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt催化剂的活性。实验通过温度程序脱附（TPD）发现，在219 K时，环己烯在1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，这一现象在纯Pt(111)或厚Co层覆于Pt(111)上均未观察到。研究人员在高表面积γ-Al2O3上合成了具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂，以验证双金属效应对环己烯自我氢化的影响力。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键。此外，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯自我氢化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这种比较为在模型表面和负载催化剂上关联环己烯自我氢化活性提供了清晰的例子。

The study demonstrates that the low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene can be effectively correlated between Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces and supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. TPD experiments reveal that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a process that does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). To confirm the bimetallic effect, supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. Furthermore, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ/Al2O3 catalysts. This integrated approach combining theoretical and experimental methods provides an effective way to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-based catalytic systems.

研究显示，低温下环己烯的自我氢化（异构化）现象能够在Co/Pt(111)双金属表面和负载型Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂之间进行有效关联。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K的温度下可以在1 ML的Co/Pt(111)表面上发生自我氢化反应，这一过程在纯Pt(111)或厚Co层覆盖在Pt(111)上时并未发生。为了验证双金属效应，研究者在高比表面积的γ-Al2O3上合成了一种具有1:1原子比例的Co:Pt的负载催化剂。EXAFS实验证实了催化剂中存在CoPt键的存在。此外，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯自我氢化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。通过将理论计算与实验结果相结合的方法，可以有效地预测氢化活性，并为设计更高效的Pt基催化剂系统提供指导。
