[1] "The low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111)."

The document correlates the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through the use of low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction. TPD experiments demonstrate that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a phenomenon not observed on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. The bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher activity towards the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

文档通过使用环己烯在低温下的自氢化（异构化）作为探针反应，将Co/Pt(111)双金属表面的活性与支持的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂相关联。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219K时可以在1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自氢化，而在纯Pt(111)或Pt上的厚Co膜上则不发生这一现象。在高表面积γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的支撑催化剂，以验证双金属效应对环己烯自氢化的影响力。EXAFS实验证实了催化剂中存在CoPt键。双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自氢化表现出更高的活性，相较于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。
