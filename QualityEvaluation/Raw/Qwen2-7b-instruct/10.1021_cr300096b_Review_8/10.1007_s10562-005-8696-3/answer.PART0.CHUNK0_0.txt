The study employed the low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The researchers conducted temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments demonstrating that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a phenomenon not observed on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. Furthermore, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated higher activity towards the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This comparison provided a clear example of correlating the self-hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on both bimetallic model surfaces and supported catalysts.

研究利用环己烯在低温下的自我氢化（异构化）作为探针反应，以关联Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与负载在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt催化剂的活性。实验通过温度程序脱附（TPD）发现，在219 K时，环己烯在1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，这一现象在纯Pt(111)或厚Co层覆于Pt(111)上均未观察到。研究人员在高表面积γ-Al2O3上合成了具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂，以验证双金属效应对环己烯自我氢化的影响力。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键。此外，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯自我氢化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这种比较为在模型表面和负载催化剂上关联环己烯自我氢化活性提供了清晰的例子。
