The study employed the low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene as a probe to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The researchers observed that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a phenomenon that does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). They synthesized supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst. When tested in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

研究采用低温度下环己烯的自我氢化（异构化）作为探针，来关联Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性。研究者发现，在219K的温度下，环己烯在1ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，而在纯Pt(111)或厚的Co膜覆盖的Pt(111)上不会发生这一现象。他们通过在高表面积的γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比例的Co:Pt的催化剂来验证双金属效应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键。当在批式反应器配置下测试时，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自我氢化表现出比Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂更高的活性。
