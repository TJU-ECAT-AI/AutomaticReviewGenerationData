[1] "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111)."
[2] "Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to verify the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
[3] "EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst."
[4] "Using FTIR in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst showed a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."

The study demonstrates that the low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene can be effectively correlated between Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces and supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. TPD experiments reveal that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a process that does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). To confirm the bimetallic effect, supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds within the catalyst structure. Furthermore, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ/Al2O3 catalysts. This integrated approach combining theoretical and experimental methods provides an effective way to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-based catalytic systems.

研究显示，低温下环己烯的自我氢化（异构化）现象能够在Co/Pt(111)双金属表面和负载型Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂之间进行有效关联。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K的温度下可以在1 ML的Co/Pt(111)表面上发生自我氢化反应，这一过程在纯Pt(111)或厚Co层覆盖在Pt(111)上时并未发生。为了验证双金属效应，研究者在高比表面积的γ-Al2O3上合成了一种具有1:1原子比例的Co:Pt的负载催化剂。EXAFS实验证实了催化剂中存在CoPt键的存在。此外，双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯自我氢化的活性高于Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂。通过将理论计算与实验结果相结合的方法，可以有效地预测氢化活性，并为设计更高效的Pt基催化剂系统提供指导。
