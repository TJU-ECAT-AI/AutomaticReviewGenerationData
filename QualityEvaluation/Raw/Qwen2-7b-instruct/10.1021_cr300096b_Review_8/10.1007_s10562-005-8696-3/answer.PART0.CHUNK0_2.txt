[1] "The low-temperature self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) of cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to correlate the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments show that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, which does not occur on either pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111)."
[3] "Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to verify the bimetallic effect on the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene."
[4] "EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst."
[5] "Using FTIR in a batch reactor configuration, the bimetallic catalyst showed a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."

The study correlates the reactivity of Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces with supported Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through the use of low-temperature self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene as a probe reaction. TPD experiments revealed that cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation on the 1 ML Co/Pt(111) surface at 219 K, a process that does not occur on pure Pt(111) or a thick Co film on Pt(111). Supported catalysts with a 1:1 atomic ratio of Co:Pt were synthesized on a high surface area γ-Al2O3 to confirm the bimetallic effect. EXAFS experiments confirmed the presence of CoPt bonds in the catalyst. The bimetallic catalyst demonstrated a higher activity toward the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene at room temperature compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, showcasing the potential of integrating theoretical and experimental approaches to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

研究通过使用低温度下环己烯的自我氢化作为探针反应，来关联Co/Pt(111)双金属表面与支持在γ-Al2O3上的Co/Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的活性。TPD实验表明，环己烯在219 K时可以在1 ML Co/Pt(111)表面上进行自我氢化，这一过程在纯Pt(111)或在Pt(111)上的厚Co薄膜上不发生。在高表面积γ-Al2O3上合成具有1:1原子比的Co:Pt的催化剂，以验证双金属效应。EXAFS实验确认了催化剂中存在CoPt键。双金属催化剂在室温下对环己烯的自我氢化表现出更高的活性，与Pt/γ-Al2O3或Co/γ-Al2O3催化剂相比，这展示了将理论和实验方法结合预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的潜力。
