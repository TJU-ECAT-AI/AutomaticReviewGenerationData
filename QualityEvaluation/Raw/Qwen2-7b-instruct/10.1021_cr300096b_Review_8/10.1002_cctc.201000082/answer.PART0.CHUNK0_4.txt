[1] "To ensure that PtM3d bimetallic bonds were formed on the supported catalysts, EXAFS measurements were performed to elucidate the intermetallic bond lengths and coordination numbers and thus characterize the extent of bimetallic bond formation."
[2] "The volumetric static CO chemisorption technique was used to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts (Table2)."
[3] "The catalytic activity toward 1,4-CHD hydrogenation over these catalysts was evaluated with a FTIR batch reactor. The concentrations of the four main species, 1,4-CHD, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were determined by using the intensities of the characteristic vibrational features, similar to the analysis in our previous work."
[4] "Although the consumption rate of 1,4-CHD over the PtCu catalyst was much slower than that over the other three catalysts, it exhibited a unique hydrogenation behavior, as illustrated by the absence of the cyclohexane product and the continuous increase in the concentration of the partial hydrogenation product, cyclohexene."
[5] "In general, for hydrogenation reactions bimetallic surfaces with weaker alkene binding energies show higher hydrogenation activity."
[6] "However, the only hydrogenation product was cyclohexene, suggesting that PtCu is a promising bimetallic catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. By integrating theoretical predictions with experimental data, researchers can predict hydrogenation activity and optimize the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The study demonstrated that bimetallic surfaces with weaker alkene binding energies exhibit higher hydrogenation activity, supporting this theoretical correlation. Notably, the PtCu catalyst showed low hydrogenation activity but high selectivity for partial hydrogenation, producing only cyclohexene. This finding highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts for specific hydrogenation reactions, suggesting that their activity and selectivity can be tailored through careful design and characterization.

对于包含C═C键的分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关。通过将理论预测与实验数据相结合，研究人员可以预测氢化活性并优化设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。研究表明，具有较弱烯烃结合能的双金属表面表现出更高的氢化活性，支持这种理论关联。值得注意的是，PtCu催化剂显示出较低的氢化活性但高度选择性地进行部分氢化，仅产生环己烯。这一发现表明双金属催化剂有可能用于特定的氢化反应，提示可以通过仔细设计和表征来调整它们的活性和选择性。
