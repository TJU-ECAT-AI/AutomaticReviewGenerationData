[1] "The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, with the trend being consistent with previously reported correlations that higher hydrogenation activity is related to more weakly bonded alkenes."
[2] "However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."
[3] "The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies of cycloalkenes generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach can predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For complete hydrogenation reactions, the correlation between weaker binding energies and higher hydrogenation rates holds true. However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers are necessary to predict hydrogenation activities accurately.

对于各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果之间存在相关性。将理论和实验方法相结合，可以预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。对于完全氢化反应，结合能较弱与更高氢化率之间的关系成立。然而，对于部分氢化反应，需要进行更详细的计算，涉及反应网络和活化能垒，以准确预测氢化活性。
