[1] "To ensure that PtM3d bimetallic bonds were formed on the supported catalysts, EXAFS measurements were performed to elucidate the intermetallic bond lengths and coordination numbers and thus characterize the extent of bimetallic bond formation (Table1)."
[2] "The correlation confirmed that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies of cycloalkenes generally showed higher hydrogenation activity."
[3] "For the bimetallic slabs, both the subsurface PtM3dPt and surface M3dPtPt configurations were considered."
[4] "As predicted by DFT calculations11 and verified experimentally,12 the subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures are preferred thermodynamically in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen."
[5] "However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The calculations predict that the preferred thermodynamically subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures enhance hydrogenation activity, especially for complete hydrogenation pathways. However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, the correlation may not hold, requiring more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers.

对于Pt-3d催化剂上的各种C═C键含分子，通过第一性原理计算（DFT）对表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的预测与TPD测量等实验观察结果相吻合。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以预测氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。计算预测显示，在存在吸附氢的情况下，首选的亚表面PtNiPt和PtCoPt结构能够增强氢化活性，特别是对于完全氢化路径。然而，对于部分氢化反应，如在PtCu上产生环己烯，这种简单的相关性可能不成立，需要进行更详细的计算，涉及反应网络和活化势垒，以预测氢化活性。
