[1] "It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show different physical, chemical, and electronic properties from the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[2] "The PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher complete hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt, whereas PtCu is a promising catalyst for selective partial hydrogenation."
[3] "As predicted by DFT calculations11 and verified experimentally,12 the subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures are preferred thermodynamically in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen."
[4] "However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers would be required to predict the hydrogenation activities."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. These correlations enable an integrated theoretical and experimental approach to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher complete hydrogenation rates compared to monometallic Pt. On the contrary, PtCu shows unexpected low hydrogenation activity despite having a relatively low binding energy for the adsorbates. More detailed calculations involving reaction networks and activation barriers are required for predicting the hydrogenation activities in cases of partial hydrogenation reactions.

DFT计算中的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果之间对于各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的相关性，可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。例如，PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂的完全氢化速率高于单金属Pt。相反，PtCu表现出意外的低氢化活性，尽管其吸附剂的结合能相对较低。对于部分氢化反应（如在PtCu上产生环己烯）而言，需要进行更详细的计算，涉及反应网络和活化势垒，以预测氢化活性。
