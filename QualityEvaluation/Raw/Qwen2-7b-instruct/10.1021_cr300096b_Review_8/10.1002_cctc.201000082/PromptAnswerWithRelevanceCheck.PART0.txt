[3] "For the bimetallic slabs, both the subsurface PtM3dPt and surface M3dPtPt configurations were considered."
[4] "As predicted by DFT calculations11 and verified experimentally,12 the subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures are preferred thermodynamically in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The calculations predict that the preferred thermodynamically subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures enhance hydrogenation activity, especially for complete hydrogenation pathways. However, for partial hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of cyclohexene over PtCu, the correlation may not hold, requiring more detailed calculations involving the reaction network and activation barriers.

对于Pt-3d催化剂上的各种C═C键含分子，通过第一性原理计算（DFT）对表面d带中心和吸附物结合能的预测与TPD测量等实验观察结果相吻合。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以预测氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。计算预测显示，在存在吸附氢的情况下，首选的亚表面PtNiPt和PtCoPt结构能够增强氢化活性，特别是对于完全氢化路径。然而，对于部分氢化反应，如在PtCu上产生环己烯，这种简单的相关性可能不成立，需要进行更详细的计算，涉及反应网络和活化势垒，以预测氢化活性。

[1] "To ensure that PtM3d bimetallic bonds were formed on the supported catalysts, EXAFS measurements were performed to elucidate the intermetallic bond lengths and coordination numbers and thus characterize the extent of bimetallic bond formation (Table1)."
[2] "The volumetric static CO chemisorption technique was used to measure the number of active sites on the surfaces of the reduced catalysts (Table2)."
[3] "The catalytic activity toward 1,4-CHD hydrogenation over these catalysts was evaluated with a FTIR batch reactor."
[4] "Although the consumption rate of 1,4-CHD over the PtCu catalyst was much slower than that over the other three catalysts, it exhibited a unique hydrogenation behavior, as illustrated by the absence of the cyclohexane product and the continuous increase in the concentration of the partial hydrogenation product, cyclohexene."
[5] "The dehydrogenation product, benzene, was also produced during the reaction of 1,4-CHD over the four catalysts (Figure1)."
[6] "In general, for hydrogenation reactions bimetallic surfaces with weaker alkene binding energies show higher hydrogenation activity."
[7] "To determine whether such a correlation also exists for the hydrogenation of 1,4-CHD, DFT was used to calculate its binding energy on different surfaces using the Vienna abinitio simulations package (VASP)."
[8] "As predicted by DFT calculations11 and verified experimentally,12 the subsurface PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures are preferred thermodynamically in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen."
[9] "The binding energy of 1,4-CHD on these surfaces follows the trend PtCoPt<PtNiPt<Pt(111), which is consistent with the experimental results that weaker binding of 1,4-CHD on PtNi and PtCo leads to higher hydrogenation rates than the monometallic Pt catalyst."

The document explains how DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and the informed design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, the document shows that for the hydrogenation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene, the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrated higher hydrogenation rates compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst, with the PtCu catalyst showing unexpectedly low hydrogenation activity. The experimental results were supported by DFT calculations that indicated weaker binding energies of 1,4-cyclohexadiene on PtNi and PtCo surfaces, leading to higher hydrogenation rates. This approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and optimize catalyst design by correlating the calculated binding energies with the observed hydrogenation rates.

文档解释了如何使用第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）计算各种含C═C键的分子，如线性烯烃、环烷烃和芳烃，在Pt-3d催化剂表面的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能，与TPD测量等实验观察结果的相关性。这种理论与实验相结合的方法允许预测氢化活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化体系的设计。例如，文档显示，在1,4-环己二烯的氢化中，PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂相对于单金属Pt催化剂表现出更高的氢化速率，而PtCu催化剂显示出意外低的氢化速率。实验结果得到了DFT计算的支持，该计算表明1,4-环己二烯在PtNi和PtCo表面的结合能较弱，导致更高的氢化速率。这种方法可以通过将计算出的结合能与观察到的氢化速率相关联来预测氢化活性并优化催化剂设计。

These correlations enable an integrated theoretical and experimental approach to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher complete hydrogenation rates compared to monometallic Pt.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. By integrating theoretical predictions with experimental data, researchers can predict hydrogenation activity and optimize the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The study demonstrated that bimetallic surfaces with weaker alkene binding energies exhibit higher hydrogenation activity, supporting this theoretical correlation. Notably, the PtCu catalyst showed low hydrogenation activity but high selectivity for partial hydrogenation, producing only cyclohexene. This finding highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts for specific hydrogenation reactions, suggesting that their activity and selectivity can be tailored through careful design and characterization.
