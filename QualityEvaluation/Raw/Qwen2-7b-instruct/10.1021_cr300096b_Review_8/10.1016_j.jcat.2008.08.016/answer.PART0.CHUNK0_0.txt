[1] "Results from batch reactor studies with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and flow reactor studies both showed that PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity than PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts for benzene hydrogenation, while PtNi catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation."
[2] "The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts appears to promote the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Co, therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Co3O4 and support, resulting in Co being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "As compared in previous surface science and DFT studies [47], the PtNi bimetallic surface exhibits higher hydrogenation activity than PtCo due to a difference in the binding energy of cyclohexene."
[4] "For both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts studied here, Co-based catalysts show higher benzene hydrogenation activity than the corresponding Ni-based counterparts, suggesting that Co is an important metal component for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures."
[5] "Overall, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts and exhibited distinct hydrogenation activities for benzene and cyclohexene, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that these bimetallic catalysts would have unique catalytic properties."

1. The study revealed that PtCo bimetallic catalysts were significantly more active than PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts for benzene hydrogenation. Conversely, PtNi catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation.

2. The addition of Pt in the PtCo catalysts facilitated the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover, allowing Co to be reduced at lower temperatures, thus enhancing the activity of the PtCo bimetallic catalysts.

3. Previous surface science and DFT studies showed that the PtNi bimetallic surface had higher hydrogenation activity for cyclohexene compared to the PtCo surface due to differences in the binding energy of cyclohexene.

4. The study found that Co-based catalysts showed higher activity in benzene hydrogenation than Ni-based catalysts, indicating that Co plays an essential role as a catalyst for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures.

5. The PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts demonstrated higher hydrogenation activities than their monometallic counterparts, exhibiting distinct activities for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation. This supports the notion that these bimetallic catalysts possess unique catalytic properties.

1. 实验表明，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯加氢反应中的活性显著高于PtNi和单金属Co、Ni、Pt催化剂。相反，PtNi催化剂在环己烯加氢反应中表现出较高的活性。

2. PtCo催化剂中添加的Pt通过氢扩散促进了钴氧化物的还原，使Co在较低温度下被还原，从而增强了PtCo双金属催化剂的活性。

3. 前期的表面科学和DFT研究显示，PtNi双金属表面对于环己烯加氢的活性高于PtCo表面，这是由于环己烯在两者的吸附能不同。

4. 研究发现，基于Co的催化剂在低温下的苯加氢活性高于基于Ni的催化剂，这表明Co在低温下作为苯加氢催化剂起着关键作用。

5. PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂的活性均高于其单金属对应物，并且对苯和环己烯加氢显示出不同的活性。这支持了这些双金属催化剂具有独特催化性质的说法。
