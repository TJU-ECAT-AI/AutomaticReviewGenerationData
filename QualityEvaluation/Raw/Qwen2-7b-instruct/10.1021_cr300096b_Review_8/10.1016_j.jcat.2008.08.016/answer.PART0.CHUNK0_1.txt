[1] "Results from batch reactor studies with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and flow reactor studies both showed that PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity than PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts for benzene hydrogenation, while PtNi catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation."
[2] "In comparison, for supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts the effect of Pt addition was not as effective as that of PtCo bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts appears to promote the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Co, therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Co3O4 and support, resulting in Co being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "For both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts studied here, Co-based catalysts show higher benzene hydrogenation activity than the corresponding Ni-based counterparts, suggesting that Co is an important metal component for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures."
[5] "Although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are needed to understand the origins, it is clear that γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit high activities for benzene hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures."

The document discusses the comparative study of γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The results indicate that PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity for benzene hydrogenation compared to PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts. Conversely, PtNi catalysts show higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts promotes the reduction of cobalt oxides, facilitating the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds, which results in enhanced hydrogenation activity. Moreover, Co-based catalysts display higher benzene hydrogenation activity than Ni-based counterparts, highlighting the importance of Co in these reactions at low temperatures. The study further suggests that γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit high activities for benzene hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures, although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.

文档讨论了γ-Al2O3支持的PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂在低温和大气压下对苯和环己烯氢化作用的比较研究。结果表明，与PtNi以及单金属Co、Ni和Pt催化剂相比，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化作用中表现出显著更高的活性。相反，PtNi催化剂在环己烯氢化作用中表现出更高的活性。Pt在PtCo催化剂中的存在促进了钴氧化物的还原，通过氢扩散效应，使得Co在双金属催化剂中以更低的温度被还原，从而导致增强的氢化活性。此外，Co基催化剂在低温下显示出比Ni基催化剂更高的苯氢化活性，这强调了Co在这些反应中的重要性。研究进一步表明，γ-Al2O3支持的PtCo双金属催化剂在相对较低温度下对苯氢化作用具有高活性，尽管需要更详细的实验和理论研究来全面理解其背后的机制。
