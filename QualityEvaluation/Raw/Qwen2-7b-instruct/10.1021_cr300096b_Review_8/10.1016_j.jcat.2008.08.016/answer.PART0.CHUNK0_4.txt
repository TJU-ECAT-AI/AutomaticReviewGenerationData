<p>It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [34] ,[35] ,[36] ,[37] ,[38] , including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities. Many investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces with catalytic properties [36] ,[37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] ,[42] ,[43] ,[44] ,[45] ,[46] ,[47] . More recently, it has been demonstrated that Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces [32] ,[43] ,[47] , with Ni or Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(111), designated as PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures [47] . In these surface science experiments the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures were prepared by depositing Ni and Co on Pt(111) at 600 K, with the subsurface structures being stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen [47] .</p>
<p>The main objective of the present work is to extend the surface science results to γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo, PtNi bimetallic catalysts and Co, Ni, Pt monometallic catalysts prepared by the impregnation method. In order to maximize the formation of the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic bonds, the atomic ratios of Ni/Pt and Co/Pt in the current work are chosen to be significantly higher than previous studies [48] . The hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the supported catalysts was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, as predicted from the surface science studies [47] . The hydrogenation of benzene was then investigated on the bimetallic catalysts at a relatively low temperature (343 K) and atmospheric pressure. The supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited much better performance than the others for benzene hydrogenation in both batch and flow reactor studies. On the other hand, for cyclohexene hydrogenation PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity than PtCo catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies [47] . Furthermore, H2 chemisorption, H2-TPR and EXAFS were used to characterize the bimetallic catalysts and to determine the possible origin of the enhanced hydrogenation activities of the bimetallic catalysts.</p>

The document does not provide a direct correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies and experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it discusses how DFT calculations and surface science studies have been used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, it states that the enhanced hydrogenation activities of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts can be attributed to the formation of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic bonds, which leads to modifications in the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces. This, in turn, correlates with the enhanced catalytic properties observed in experimental studies. Therefore, the integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient catalytic systems.

To summarize, the document indirectly supports the use of DFT calculations and surface science studies in predicting hydrogenation activity and designing Pt-3d catalytic systems. The enhanced catalytic properties of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts are explained by the formation of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic bonds, which modifies the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces and correlates with enhanced hydrogenation activity in experimental studies.

文档并未直接提供表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察之间的相关性。然而，它讨论了如何利用DFT计算和表面科学研究来预测氢化活性并指导Pt-3d催化系统的优化设计。例如，文中提到，PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂相对于单金属催化剂的增强氢化活性可以归因于形成PtCo和PtNi双金属键，这导致催化剂表面电子性质的改变。这进而与实验研究中观察到的增强催化性能相吻合。因此，理论和实验的综合方法可以用于预测氢化活性并设计更高效的催化系统。

简而言之，文档间接支持使用DFT计算和表面科学研究在预测氢化活性和设计Pt-3d催化系统方面的应用。PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂相对于单金属催化剂的增强催化性能是通过形成PtCo和PtNi双金属键并改变催化剂表面的电子性质而解释的，这与实验研究中观察到的增强氢化活性相吻合。
