[1] "Results from batch reactor studies with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and flow reactor studies both showed that PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity than PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts for benzene hydrogenation, while PtNi catalysts showed higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation."
[2] "The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts appears to promote the reduction of cobalt oxides through hydrogen spillover. Pt can be reduced at lower temperatures than Co, therefore hydrogen that dissociates on the surface of Pt could migrate to the surface of Co3O4 and support, resulting in Co being reduced at much lower temperatures in the bimetallic catalysts."
[3] "As compared in previous surface science and DFT studies [47], the PtNi bimetallic surface exhibits higher hydrogenation activity than PtCo due to a difference in the binding energy of cyclohexene."
[4] "For both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts studied here, Co-based catalysts show higher benzene hydrogenation activity than the corresponding Ni-based counterparts, suggesting that Co is an important metal component for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures."
[5] "Overall, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts and exhibited distinct hydrogenation activities for benzene and cyclohexene, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that these bimetallic catalysts would have unique catalytic properties."

The document discusses the comparative study of γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The results indicate that PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity for benzene hydrogenation compared to PtNi and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts. Conversely, PtNi catalysts show higher activity for cyclohexene hydrogenation. The presence of Pt in the PtCo catalysts promotes the reduction of cobalt oxides, facilitating the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds, which results in enhanced hydrogenation activity. Moreover, Co-based catalysts display higher benzene hydrogenation activity than Ni-based counterparts, highlighting the importance of Co in these reactions at low temperatures. The study further suggests that γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit high activities for benzene hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures, although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.

文档讨论了γ-Al2O3支持的PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂在低温和大气压下对苯和环己烯氢化作用的比较研究。结果表明，与PtNi以及单金属Co、Ni和Pt催化剂相比，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化作用中表现出显著更高的活性。相反，PtNi催化剂在环己烯氢化作用中表现出更高的活性。Pt在PtCo催化剂中的存在促进了钴氧化物的还原，通过氢扩散效应，使得Co在双金属催化剂中以更低的温度被还原，从而导致增强的氢化活性。此外，Co基催化剂在低温下显示出比Ni基催化剂更高的苯氢化活性，这强调了Co在这些反应中的重要性。研究进一步表明，γ-Al2O3支持的PtCo双金属催化剂在相对较低温度下对苯氢化作用具有高活性，尽管需要更详细的实验和理论研究来全面理解其背后的机制。

<p>For both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts studied here, Co-based catalysts show higher benzene hydrogenation activity than the corresponding Ni-based counterparts, suggesting that Co is an important metal component for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures.</p>
<p>However, the supported monometallic Co catalyst alone is not a good catalyst for benzene hydrogenation because Co metals do not adsorb and dissociate hydrogen effectively, as supported by the H2 chemisorption results that Co-based catalysts have smaller hydrogen adsorption capacity than Ni-based catalysts ( Table 1 ).</p>
<p>Although the exact origins are unknown regarding the synergistic effect on benzene hydrogenation by alloying Pt and Co, one could argue that some of the following factors are contributing to the high benzene hydrogenation activities over the PtCo bimetallic catalysts: (1) The presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and leads to an increase in the number of metal sites. (2) Because Pt is an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, it could provide atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites for hydrogenation through the spillover effect. (3) A closer inspection of the results in Fig. 5 suggests that Co is an active hydrogenation catalyst. For example, the apparent activation barriers over the 10%Co/Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Co/Al2O3 are essentially identical, at 33.7 and 33.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the role of Pt appears to be to keep Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2. Although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are needed to understand the origins, it is clear that γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit high activities for benzene hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures.</p>

The document discusses the use of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3 for the hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. The results show that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts have higher activity in benzene hydrogenation compared to the PtNi catalysts, which have higher activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation. This difference in activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of alloying Pt and Co, which facilitates the reduction of Co3O4, increases the number of metal sites, and enables efficient hydrogen adsorption and dissociation by Pt. The Co component in the PtCo catalysts is identified as an important metal for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures. Theoretical and experimental approaches are combined to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

本文讨论了在γ-Al2O3上使用PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂对苯和环己烯进行氢化。结果显示，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化中的活性高于PtNi催化剂，而PtNi催化剂在环己烯氢化中的活性更高。这种活性差异归因于Pt和Co合金的协同效应，它促进了Co3O4的还原，增加了金属位点的数量，并通过Pt有效地实现了氢吸附和离解。在PtCo催化剂中，Co成分被确认为低温度下苯氢化的关键金属。理论与实验方法结合用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。

<p>It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [34] ,[35] ,[36] ,[37] ,[38] , including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities. Many investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces with catalytic properties [36] ,[37] ,[38] ,[39] ,[40] ,[41] ,[42] ,[43] ,[44] ,[45] ,[46] ,[47] . More recently, it has been demonstrated that Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces [32] ,[43] ,[47] , with Ni or Co atoms residing in the subsurface region in Pt(111), designated as PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111), showed much higher activity for the hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the corresponding monometallic surfaces. The novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on the bimetallic surfaces has been correlated to the modification of the electronic properties due to the formation of the subsurface bimetallic structures [47] . In these surface science experiments the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures were prepared by depositing Ni and Co on Pt(111) at 600 K, with the subsurface structures being stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen [47] .</p>
<p>The main objective of the present work is to extend the surface science results to γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo, PtNi bimetallic catalysts and Co, Ni, Pt monometallic catalysts prepared by the impregnation method. In order to maximize the formation of the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic bonds, the atomic ratios of Ni/Pt and Co/Pt in the current work are chosen to be significantly higher than previous studies [48] . The hydrogenation of cyclohexene on the supported catalysts was used as a probe reaction to demonstrate the enhanced hydrogenation activity toward the CC bond on the bimetallic catalysts, as predicted from the surface science studies [47] . The hydrogenation of benzene was then investigated on the bimetallic catalysts at a relatively low temperature (343 K) and atmospheric pressure. The supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited much better performance than the others for benzene hydrogenation in both batch and flow reactor studies. On the other hand, for cyclohexene hydrogenation PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher activity than PtCo catalysts, consistent with predictions from surface science studies [47] . Furthermore, H2 chemisorption, H2-TPR and EXAFS were used to characterize the bimetallic catalysts and to determine the possible origin of the enhanced hydrogenation activities of the bimetallic catalysts.</p>

The document does not provide a direct correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies and experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. However, it discusses how DFT calculations and surface science studies have been used to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, it states that the enhanced hydrogenation activities of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts can be attributed to the formation of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic bonds, which leads to modifications in the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces. This, in turn, correlates with the enhanced catalytic properties observed in experimental studies. Therefore, the integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and design more efficient catalytic systems.

To summarize, the document indirectly supports the use of DFT calculations and surface science studies in predicting hydrogenation activity and designing Pt-3d catalytic systems. The enhanced catalytic properties of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts are explained by the formation of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic bonds, which modifies the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces and correlates with enhanced hydrogenation activity in experimental studies.

文档并未直接提供表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察之间的相关性。然而，它讨论了如何利用DFT计算和表面科学研究来预测氢化活性并指导Pt-3d催化系统的优化设计。例如，文中提到，PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂相对于单金属催化剂的增强氢化活性可以归因于形成PtCo和PtNi双金属键，这导致催化剂表面电子性质的改变。这进而与实验研究中观察到的增强催化性能相吻合。因此，理论和实验的综合方法可以用于预测氢化活性并设计更高效的催化系统。

简而言之，文档间接支持使用DFT计算和表面科学研究在预测氢化活性和设计Pt-3d催化系统方面的应用。PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂相对于单金属催化剂的增强催化性能是通过形成PtCo和PtNi双金属键并改变催化剂表面的电子性质而解释的，这与实验研究中观察到的增强氢化活性相吻合。
