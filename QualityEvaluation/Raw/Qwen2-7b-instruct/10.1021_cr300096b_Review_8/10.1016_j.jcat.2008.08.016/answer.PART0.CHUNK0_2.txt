<p>For both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts studied here, Co-based catalysts show higher benzene hydrogenation activity than the corresponding Ni-based counterparts, suggesting that Co is an important metal component for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures.</p>
<p>However, the supported monometallic Co catalyst alone is not a good catalyst for benzene hydrogenation because Co metals do not adsorb and dissociate hydrogen effectively, as supported by the H2 chemisorption results that Co-based catalysts have smaller hydrogen adsorption capacity than Ni-based catalysts ( Table 1 ).</p>
<p>Although the exact origins are unknown regarding the synergistic effect on benzene hydrogenation by alloying Pt and Co, one could argue that some of the following factors are contributing to the high benzene hydrogenation activities over the PtCo bimetallic catalysts: (1) The presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Co3O4 and leads to an increase in the number of metal sites. (2) Because Pt is an efficient catalyst for hydrogen adsorption and dissociation, it could provide atomic hydrogen to the Co metal sites for hydrogenation through the spillover effect. (3) A closer inspection of the results in Fig. 5 suggests that Co is an active hydrogenation catalyst. For example, the apparent activation barriers over the 10%Co/Al2O3 and 1.2%Pt10%Co/Al2O3 are essentially identical, at 33.7 and 33.8 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, the role of Pt appears to be to keep Co in its reduced state and may also provide sites for the dissociation of H2. Although more detailed experimental and theoretical studies are needed to understand the origins, it is clear that γ-Al2O3 supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit high activities for benzene hydrogenation at relatively low temperatures.</p>

The document discusses the use of PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3 for the hydrogenation of benzene and cyclohexene. The results show that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts have higher activity in benzene hydrogenation compared to the PtNi catalysts, which have higher activity in cyclohexene hydrogenation. This difference in activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of alloying Pt and Co, which facilitates the reduction of Co3O4, increases the number of metal sites, and enables efficient hydrogen adsorption and dissociation by Pt. The Co component in the PtCo catalysts is identified as an important metal for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures. Theoretical and experimental approaches are combined to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

本文讨论了在γ-Al2O3上使用PtCo和PtNi双金属催化剂对苯和环己烯进行氢化。结果显示，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯氢化中的活性高于PtNi催化剂，而PtNi催化剂在环己烯氢化中的活性更高。这种活性差异归因于Pt和Co合金的协同效应，它促进了Co3O4的还原，增加了金属位点的数量，并通过Pt有效地实现了氢吸附和离解。在PtCo催化剂中，Co成分被确认为低温度下苯氢化的关键金属。理论与实验方法结合用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。
