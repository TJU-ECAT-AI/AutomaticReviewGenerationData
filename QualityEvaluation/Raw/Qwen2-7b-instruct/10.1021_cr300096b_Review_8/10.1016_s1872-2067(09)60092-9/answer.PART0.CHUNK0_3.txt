<p>The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell).</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).</p>
<p>Another interesting observation in Table 2 is that the binding energies of 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are higher on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) suggesting that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure should be more thermodynamically favored than the parent metals for the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>

This study demonstrates that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. Specifically, it shows that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. By contrast, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene and atomic hydrogen, which promotes the dehydrogenation pathway. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach enables the prediction of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

本研究证明，对于含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算结果与TPD测量等实验观察结果相吻合。具体而言，研究表明，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt双金属结构对1,3-环己二烯的结合能最低，导致Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂具有最高的氢化速率。相比之下，Ni-Pt-Pt表面结构上1,3-环己二烯和原子氢的结合能最高，这促进了脱氢路径。这种理论和实验相结合的方法能够预测氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。
