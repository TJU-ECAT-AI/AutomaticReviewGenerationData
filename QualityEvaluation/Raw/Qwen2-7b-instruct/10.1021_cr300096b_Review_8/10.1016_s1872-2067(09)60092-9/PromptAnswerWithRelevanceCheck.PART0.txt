[1] "The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst shows promise and has been identified as an active catalyst for the low-temperature hydrogenation of cycloalkenes including cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexeadiene, and benzene [3-5]."
[2] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [5-11]."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that for the Pt-Ni bimetallic system, the formation of a subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure with an atomic layer of Ni underneath the surface Pt atoms is responsible for the higher hydrogenation activity of the C=C bond than the corresponding monometallic surfaces [8]."
[4] "A novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on Pt-Ni-Pt has been correlated to the weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes, which resulted from the modification of the electronic properties because of the formation of subsurface bimetallic structures [8,10]."
[5] "In addition to the novel hydrogenation chemistry, surface science studies on the Pt-Ni bimetallic system have also identified a surface bimetallic structure, Ni-Pt-Pt, with a layer of Ni residing on top of the Pt substrate [8]."
[6] "Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni surfaces alone."
[7] "The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."
[8] "The preparation of the supported catalysts and CO chemisorption measurements are similar to that previously described in detail [3]."
[9] "The values of the rate constant k with and without normalization to the number of surface sites based on CO chemisorption are listed in Table 1."
[10] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."
[11] "The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]."
[12] "Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."
[13] "The presence of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure is responsible for the higher dehydrogenation rate on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts."
[14] "This supports the argument from previous studies that bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate catalytic advantages over monometallic catalysts."
[15] "Combined experimental and DFT results indicate that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst."
[16] "Results from this study identify the critical requirements to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures and to control the low temperature hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes."

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements by revealing the relationship between the energy levels of the surface states and the stability of the adsorbed species. This correlation allows researchers to predict the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts and optimize their performance. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach provides insights into the electronic structure of the catalyst surface and guides the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

2. The DFT calculations suggest that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD), leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. This finding is consistent with previous studies that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity.

3. The surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, promoting the dehydrogenation pathway. This observation indicates that the Ni-Pt-Pt configuration enhances the dehydrogenation process, contributing to the distinct hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities observed on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts.

4. The experimental and DFT results collectively highlight the importance of the Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures in controlling the low-temperature hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes. These findings guide the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable structures, enabling the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The integrated approach combining experimental observations and DFT calculations reveals that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher reaction rates than the Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts, supporting the argument that bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate catalytic advantages over monometallic catalysts due to the unique electronic properties and surface configurations they possess.

3. Ni-Pt-Pt表面结构的表面显示了1,3-CHD和原子氢的最高结合能，促进脱氢途径。这一观察结果表明，Ni-Pt-Pt配置增强了脱氢过程，解释了与单金属催化剂相比，在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂上观察到的独特氢化和脱氢活性。

4. 实验和DFT结果共同强调了Pt-Ni-Pt或Ni-Pt-Pt结构在控制环烷烃的低温氢化或脱氢中的重要性。这些发现指导了支持型双金属催化剂的合成，确保了均匀稳定的结构，从而为氢化和脱氢反应提供更高效的催化系统设计指引。

5. 集成方法结合了实验观察和DFT计算的结果，揭示了Pt-Ni双金属催化剂比Pt和Ni单金属催化剂具有更高的反应速率，支持了双金属催化剂往往在与单金属催化剂相比时展现出催化优势的观点，由于它们独特的电子特性和表面构型。

<p>Two hydrogenation products, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclohexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohexane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydrogenation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is relatively slow.</p>
<p>By comparison, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 are different from those of the monometallic catalysts. Both cyclohexane and benzene are produced at a much faster initial rate.</p>
<p>The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell).</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).</p>

1. The Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst showed higher activity than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3 in hydrogenating and dehydrogenating 1,3-cyclohexadiene at 308 K. Both cyclohexane and benzene were produced at a faster initial rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts.

2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene and atomic hydrogen were lower on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface structure than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). This correlates with the higher activity observed on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 在308 K时，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂在氢化和脱氢1,3-环己二烯方面比Pt/γ-Al2O3或Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂活性更高。与单金属催化剂相比，在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上快速生成了更多的环己烷和苯。

2. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算显示，1,3-环己二烯和原子氢在Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面结构上的结合能低于Pt(111)或Ni(111)。这与在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上观察到的高活性相吻合。
