[1] "The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst shows promise and has been identified as an active catalyst for the low-temperature hydrogenation of cycloalkenes including cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexeadiene, and benzene [3-5]."
[2] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [5-11]."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that for the Pt-Ni bimetallic system, the formation of a subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure with an atomic layer of Ni underneath the surface Pt atoms is responsible for the higher hydrogenation activity of the C=C bond than the corresponding monometallic surfaces [8]."
[4] "A novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway on Pt-Ni-Pt has been correlated to the weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and alkenes, which resulted from the modification of the electronic properties because of the formation of subsurface bimetallic structures [8,10]."
[5] "In addition to the novel hydrogenation chemistry, surface science studies on the Pt-Ni bimetallic system have also identified a surface bimetallic structure, Ni-Pt-Pt, with a layer of Ni residing on top of the Pt substrate [8]."
[6] "Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni surfaces alone."
[7] "The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."
[8] "The preparation of the supported catalysts and CO chemisorption measurements are similar to that previously described in detail [3]."
[9] "The values of the rate constant k with and without normalization to the number of surface sites based on CO chemisorption are listed in Table 1."
[10] "As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."
[11] "The subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure has been identified experimentally as the preferred structure after hydrogen reduction of both the Pt/Ni polycrystalline films [15] and the supported Pt/Ni catalysts [16]."
[12] "Therefore, the lower binding energy (Table 2) and higher hydrogenation rate of 1,3-CHD on Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (Table 1) are consistent with previous studies, which found that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity [5,8]."
[13] "The presence of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure is responsible for the higher dehydrogenation rate on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts."
[14] "This supports the argument from previous studies that bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate catalytic advantages over monometallic catalysts."
[15] "Combined experimental and DFT results indicate that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst."
[16] "Results from this study identify the critical requirements to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures and to control the low temperature hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. These integrated theoretical and experimental approaches can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. By comparison, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene and atomic hydrogen, promoting the dehydrogenation pathway. The results of this study identify the critical requirements to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures and to control the low temperature hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes.

对于包含C═C键的分子在Pt-3d催化剂表面的DFT计算的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果之间存在相关性。这些理论和实验相结合的方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。具体而言，位于表面下方的Pt-Ni-Pt双金属结构具有最低的1,3-环己二烯结合能，导致Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂上最高的氢化速率。相比之下，Ni-Pt-Pt结构的表面具有最高1,3-环己二烯和原子氢的结合能，促进脱氢途径。本研究的结果确定了合成支持型双金属催化剂以获得均匀稳定的Pt-Ni-Pt或Ni-Pt-Pt结构以及控制环烷烃的低温氢化或脱氢的关键要求。
