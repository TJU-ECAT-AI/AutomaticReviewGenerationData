<p>Two hydrogenation products, cyclohexene and cyclohexane, were detected over the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. With an increase in reaction time, cyclohexene is further hydrogenated and converted into cyclohexane. The Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst promotes both the partial hydrogenation of 1,3-CHD to cyclohexene and dehydrogenation to benzene although the consumption rate of 1,3-CHD is relatively slow.</p>
<p>By comparison, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-CHD over Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 are different from those of the monometallic catalysts. Both cyclohexane and benzene are produced at a much faster initial rate.</p>
<p>The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell).</p>
<p>As summarized in Table 2, the binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are lower on Pt-Ni-Pt(111) than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111).</p>

1. The Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst showed higher activity than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3 in hydrogenating and dehydrogenating 1,3-cyclohexadiene at 308 K. Both cyclohexane and benzene were produced at a faster initial rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts.

2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the binding energies for 1,3-cyclohexadiene and atomic hydrogen were lower on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface structure than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). This correlates with the higher activity observed on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 在308 K时，Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3双金属催化剂在氢化和脱氢1,3-环己二烯方面比Pt/γ-Al2O3或Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂活性更高。与单金属催化剂相比，在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上快速生成了更多的环己烷和苯。

2. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算显示，1,3-环己二烯和原子氢在Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表面结构上的结合能低于Pt(111)或Ni(111)。这与在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上观察到的高活性相吻合。
