[1] "Combined experimental and DFT results indicate that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-CHD, leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst."
[2] "By comparison, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen,which promotes the dehydrogenation pathway."
[3] "This supports the argument from previous studies that bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate catalytic advantages over monometallic catalysts."

The DFT calculations reveal that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure exhibits the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD), resulting in the highest hydrogenation rate on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Conversely, the surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure has the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, favoring the dehydrogenation pathway. These findings align with previous research suggesting that bimetallic catalysts typically offer superior catalytic performance compared to monometallic catalysts.

DFT计算表明，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt双金属结构对1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）的结合能最低，导致在Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂上氢化速率最高。相比之下，Ni-Pt-Pt表面的1,3-CHD和原子氢的结合能最高，促进脱氢途径。这些结果与以往的研究一致，表明双金属催化剂通常比单金属催化剂展现出更优异的催化性能。
