1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements by revealing the relationship between the energy levels of the surface states and the stability of the adsorbed species. This correlation allows researchers to predict the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts and optimize their performance. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach provides insights into the electronic structure of the catalyst surface and guides the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

2. The DFT calculations suggest that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt bimetallic structure has the lowest binding energy for 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD), leading to the highest hydrogenation rate over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst. This finding is consistent with previous studies that bimetallic surfaces with weaker binding energies for cycloalkenes generally show higher hydrogenation activity.

3. The surface of the Ni-Pt-Pt structure shows the highest binding energies for 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, promoting the dehydrogenation pathway. This observation indicates that the Ni-Pt-Pt configuration enhances the dehydrogenation process, contributing to the distinct hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities observed on the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst compared to the monometallic catalysts.

4. The experimental and DFT results collectively highlight the importance of the Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures in controlling the low-temperature hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes. These findings guide the synthesis of supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable structures, enabling the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The integrated approach combining experimental observations and DFT calculations reveals that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher reaction rates than the Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts, supporting the argument that bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate catalytic advantages over monometallic catalysts due to the unique electronic properties and surface configurations they possess.
