[1] "In the presence of promoters, Y = Yc + Ya. Therefore, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation would increase."
[2] "Considering that cracking occurs onto Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, the apparent manifestation of the phenomenon may be interpreted as proceeding of dehydrogenation and cracking in parallel on independent sites."
[3] "In accord with the suggested reaction scheme, we postulate that coke precursors are likely to arise because of interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates located predominantly on X-type sites (steps 3033 of the scheme)."
[4] "Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation:"
[5] "Under quasi-stationary conditions, while the main and cracking reactions do not feel the influence of coke, it can be assumed that λ, ψ and θH keep quasi-constant values."
[6] "Eq. (3) and (4) may be helpful in interpreting the fact that the dehydrogenation rate is affected upon attaining higher threshold values of coke depositions in the presence of promoters."

The introduction of promoters modifies the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation, leading to an increase in these sites. Cracking occurs on Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, suggesting that dehydrogenation and cracking might happen in parallel on independent sites. Coke precursors arise due to interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates primarily located on X-type sites. Assuming fast migration of precursors, Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, indicating that their surface concentrations maintain quasi-constant values. The dehydrogenation rate is influenced by the presence of promoters, particularly affecting the threshold values of coke depositions.

引入促进剂修改了负责脱氢的Y型位点的数量，导致这些位点数量增加。裂解发生在嵌入Pt岛内的Pt原子上，暗示脱氢和裂解可能在独立的位点上并行发生。焦油前体由于异丁烯与主要位于X型位点上的不饱和表面中间体的相互作用而产生。假设前体快速迁移，Prec1和Prec2处于平衡状态，表明它们的表面积浓度保持近似恒定值。在促进剂的存在下，脱氢速率受到焦油沉积阈值变化的影响。
