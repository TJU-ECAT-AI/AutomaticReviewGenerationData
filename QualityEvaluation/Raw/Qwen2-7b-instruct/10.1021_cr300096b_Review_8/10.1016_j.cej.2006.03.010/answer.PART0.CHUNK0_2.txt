[1] "Detailed knowledge on the behavior of catalytic systems in which more than one type of active sites participate in the reaction mechanism is a subject of both academic and manufacture interest."
[2] "Promoting of the active phase with catalytically inactive metals such as Re, In, Ir and Sn is applied in view of increasing the catalyst activity, improving the selectivity and prolonging the catalyst lifetime."
[3] "It has been widely recognized that more than one type of active sites can be distinguished regarding the performance of supported platinum catalysts used for dehydrogenation and refining reactions."
[4] "It is essential to accentuate that in the presence of promoters, the coefficients participating in the denominators of the equations describing the dehydrogenation and cracking are of different value, k2 ≠ k5, what points to distinct sites responsible for the realization of these processes."
[5] "The necessity to consider the key elementary steps proceeding on these types of active sites brings to the following reaction scheme..."

The literature discusses the influence of Sn and In promoters on the deactivation of Pt catalysts during isobutane dehydrogenation. It introduces a model that proposes three types of active sites: Z-type, X-type, and Y-type. Z-type sites are single Pt centers that facilitate dehydrogenation, characterized by strong adsorption affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons. X-type sites are catalytic clusters involving multiple Pt surface atoms, with Sn or In potentially reducing the adsorption strength, and they are responsible for cracking reactions. Y-type sites are interfaces between Pt and carrier or Pt and promoter, with weaker adsorption strength, facilitating dehydrogenation. The model also considers two types of coke precursors: those arising from intermediates tightly adsorbed onto X-type sites and those migrating from the former to Y-type sites. The model explains the stepwise deactivation kinetics and the promoter-induced effects. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach aims to predict hydrogenation activity and optimize Pt catalyst design.

文献讨论了Sn和In促进剂对铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢过程中失活的影响。它提出了一种模型，提出了三种活性位点：Z型、X型和Y型。Z型位点是单个铂中心，促进脱氢，具有强吸附能力，用于不饱和烃。X型位点是包含多个铂表面原子的簇，Sn或In可能会降低吸附强度，并且它们负责裂解反应。Y型位点是Pt与载体或Pt与促进剂之间的界面，吸附能力较弱，促进脱氢。该模型还考虑了两种焦炭前体：源自紧密吸附在X型位点的中间体和从前者的迁移至Y型位点的前体。该模型解释了失活过程的阶梯性以及促进剂诱导的效果。集成理论和实验方法旨在预测氢化活性并优化铂催化剂设计。
