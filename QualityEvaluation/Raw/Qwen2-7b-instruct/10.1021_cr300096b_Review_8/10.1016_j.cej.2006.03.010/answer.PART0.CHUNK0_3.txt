[1] "Detailed knowledge on the behavior of catalytic systems in which more than one type of active sites participate in the reaction mechanism is a subject of both academic and manufacture interest."
[2] "It has been widely recognized that more than one type of active sites can be distinguished regarding the performance of supported platinum catalysts used for dehydrogenation and refining reactions."
[3] "Promoting of the active phase with catalytically inactive metals such as Re, In, Ir and Sn is applied in view of increasing the catalyst activity, improving the selectivity and prolonging the catalyst lifetime."
[4] "The introduction of promoters in the catalyst systems enhances the effects provoked by the diversities in the behavior of the sites facilitating different routes of the processes."
[5] "On the one hand, it is believed that diluting the entities of Pt surface atoms by Sn makes for weaker adsorption affinity, due to modifications in the electron density of Pt."
[6] "It should be not skipped from consideration, however, that the effect of tin on Pt electron density depends as well on the particle size of the catalytic clusters."
[7] "At the same time, it gains support the viewpoint noted first by Sinfelt that the geometric factors play a crucial role in cases when the reaction requires active sites consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms in a proper configuration."
[8] "Various aspects of the related phenomena are focusing the interest of researchers."
[9] "The authors of ref. attach considerable significance as well to the role of adsorbed hydrogen for maintaining the catalyst activity, most probably by impeding coking."
[10] "It has been reported in ref. for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst that, because of the lower strength of adsorption, coke precursors can migrate easily to the support, and this results in reduced coke accumulation over the active sites."
[11] "The capability of the promoting metal to weaken the adsorption of unsaturated species is considered to make for changing the location of coke through spill over the support also by the authors of refs. [18], [21], [33], [34], [35], [40]."
[12] "In accord with the suggested reaction scheme, we postulate that coke precursors are likely to arise because of interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates located predominantly on X-type sites (steps 30-33 of the scheme)."
[13] "C8H16X, C7H13X and C6H11X (denoted as CnHmX, for m ≥ 2n) species are supposed either to give rise to coke precursors of Prec1 type, involving neighboring Pt atoms, or to migrate to the interface sites, where CnHmY species gives rise to coke precursors of Prec2 type."
[14] "Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation μ1 = μ2."
[15] "Eq. (10) may be helpful in interpreting the fact that the dehydrogenation rate is affected upon attaining higher threshold values of coke depositions in the presence of promoters."
[16] "This is one of the probable reasons that in the presence of promoters the threshold amount of coke c** governing the coke tolerance effect markedly increased."

The document discusses the behavior of catalytic systems that have multiple types of active sites. Promoters such as Sn and In are used to enhance catalyst activity, selectivity, and lifetime. The introduction of these promoters modifies the behavior of active sites, facilitating different reaction routes. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies can correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The presence of promoters like Sn can weaken the adsorption affinity of active sites, leading to easier migration of coke precursors to the support, which can reduce coke accumulation over the active sites. The equilibrium between coke precursors of Prec1 and Prec2 types, which arise from interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates, plays a significant role in coke formation. The dehydrogenation rate is affected by the presence of promoters, leading to an increase in the threshold amount of coke that governs the coke tolerance effect.

本文讨论了包含多种活性位点的催化体系的行为。Sn和In等惰性金属作为促进剂被用于提高催化剂活性、选择性和寿命。这些促进剂的引入改变了活性位点的行为，促进了不同反应途径的形成。第一性原理计算（DFT）表面d能级中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果的相关性可以预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。Sn等促进剂的存在可以减弱活性位点的吸附作用，导致焦炭前体更容易迁移到载体上，从而减少活性位点上的焦炭沉积。焦炭前体Prec1和Prec2类型的平衡在焦炭形成过程中起着重要作用，这些前体来源于异丁烯与不饱和表面中间体的相互作用。促进剂的存在影响脱氢速率，导致决定焦炭耐受性的焦炭沉积量显著增加。
