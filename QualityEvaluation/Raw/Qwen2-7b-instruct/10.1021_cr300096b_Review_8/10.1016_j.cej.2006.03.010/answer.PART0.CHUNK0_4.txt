[1] "The introduction of In or Sn promoters to Pt has resulted in acceleration of the dehydrogenation rate and in increase of the selectivity."
[2] "At the same time, the selectivity-conversion curves exhibited on cat_2 and cat_3 give evidence of parallel proceeding of the dehydrogenation and cracking reactions."
[3] "In view of these results, we want to bring the attention to the contribution of In and Sn presence for increasing the catalyst capacity for maintaining stability of action despite the deposited coke."
[4] "The necessity to consider the key elementary steps proceeding on these types of active sites brings to the following reaction scheme:"
[5] "The coke generated on the support is also of special concern."
[6] "For the sake of completeness, coke precursors created on these sites may be specified as a distinct type (Prec3)."
[7] "It is essential to note that in case the active phase is pure Pt (cat_1), the values of the coefficients in the denominators of the equations for r and rcr are identical, k2 = k5, which is an indication that the dehydrogenation and cracking steps occur on the same active sites."

1. The addition of In or Sn promoters to Pt catalysts accelerates the dehydrogenation rate and increases selectivity.
2. The dehydrogenation and cracking reactions occur in parallel on catalysts containing In or Sn promoters.
3. In and Sn presence enhance the catalyst's capacity to maintain stability despite coke deposition.
4. The reaction scheme outlines the key steps involving Z-, X-, and Y-type active sites.
5. Coke formation on the support is a significant concern.
6. Coke precursors created on the support are considered a distinct type (Prec3).
