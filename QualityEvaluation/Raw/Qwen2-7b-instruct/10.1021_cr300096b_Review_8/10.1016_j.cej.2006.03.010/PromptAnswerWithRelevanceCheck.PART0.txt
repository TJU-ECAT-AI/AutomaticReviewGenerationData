[1] "In view of this, it is a proper approximation to postulate the existence of three types of active sites, which we shall further denote as Z-, X- and Y-type."
[2] "These types of sites can be specified as follows: Z-type: Single Pt centers, facilitating dehydrogenation. These sites possess strong adsorption affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon fragments and weaker for hydrogen."
[3] "X-type: Catalytic clusters (ensembles) involving a number of Pt surface atoms in a proper configuration. These sites are characterised by very strong adsorption affinity. They may involve In or Sn surface atoms, the latter supposed to reduce the adsorption strength of the cluster."
[4] "Y-type: Centers on the interfaces Pt/carrier (Yc) or Pt/promoter (Ya); Y = Yc + Ya. The Y-type centers are supposed to facilitate dehydrogenation. Evidences are that these sites are of weaker adsorption strength for hydrocarbons."
[5] "Two types of coke precursors (further noted as Prec1 and Prec2) are suggested to be of significance for the coke formation."
[6] "Prec1 are the precursors arising inside the active-phase islands, predominantly on X-type sites."
[7] "The proximity of adsorbed hydrogen forms creates conditions for surface collisions resulting in breaking the chain of coke generation from these precursors."
[8] "The precursors located onto Y-type sites are noted as Prec2. Their origin is to a considerable extent conditioned by the migration of Prec1 from the interior of the active-phase entities."
[9] "Since the content of promoters is of the range of 2%, it is reasonable to suppose that their influence on the performance of the support sites can be neglected."
[10] "Therefore, we can assume that the rate of generation of Prec3, and correspondingly, the rate of independent coke formation on the support, is not influenced by the presence of promoters."
[11] "Concerning the increase of coke accumulated on the support at the expense of promoter-enhanced migration of precursors from the active phase, the rate of formation of this portion of support-located coke should be related to the rate of formation of Prec1 and Prec2 precursors."
[12] "Regarding the deactivation pattern caused by the coke located on the support, special tests performed in refs. [44],[46] gave evidence that the basic dehydrogenation reaction does not proceed on those alumina sites which are not interfacial with the active phase."

The study postulates the existence of three types of active sites: Z-, X-, and Y-type. Z-type sites consist of single Pt centers that facilitate dehydrogenation and have a strong adsorption affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons. X-type sites are catalytic clusters involving multiple Pt atoms in a proper configuration, characterized by very strong adsorption affinity, and may involve In or Sn surface atoms, reducing the adsorption strength. Y-type sites are centers on the interfaces between Pt and carrier or promoter, facilitating dehydrogenation with weaker adsorption strength for hydrocarbons. Two types of coke precursors, Prec1 and Prec2, are significant for coke formation. Prec1 arises predominantly on X-type sites and their origin is conditioned by the migration of Prec1 from the interior of the active phase. Prec2 originates on Y-type sites, largely due to the migration of Prec1. The presence of promoters in the catalyst does not significantly influence the performance of the support sites, and thus, the rate of independent coke formation on the support is not affected. The deactivation pattern caused by coke located on the support is limited to sites that are not interfacial with the active phase.

研究假设存在三种类型的活性位点：Z-、X-和Y型。Z型位点由单个Pt中心组成，促进脱氢反应，对不饱和烃具有很强的吸附亲和力。X型位点是包含多个Pt原子的催化簇，在适当配置下，它们的特点是极强的吸附亲和力，可能包含In或Sn表面原子，降低簇的吸附强度。Y型位点位于Pt与载体或促进剂之间的界面，促进脱氢反应，对烃类有较弱的吸附能力。两种焦炭前体，Prec1和Prec2，对于焦炭形成至关重要。Prec1主要在X型位点上产生，并且其来源受到从活性相内部迁移的Prec1的影响。Prec2源自Y型位点，很大程度上由于Prec1的迁移。催化剂中的促进剂对支持位点的性能影响不大，因此支持上独立焦炭形成的速率不受促进剂的影响。位于活性相与支持物非界面位置上的位点导致的脱活模式仅限于活性相与支持物之间未接触的位点。

[1] "In the presence of promoters, Y = Yc + Ya. Therefore, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation would increase."
[2] "Considering that cracking occurs onto Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, the apparent manifestation of the phenomenon may be interpreted as proceeding of dehydrogenation and cracking in parallel on independent sites."
[3] "In accord with the suggested reaction scheme, we postulate that coke precursors are likely to arise because of interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates located predominantly on X-type sites (steps 3033 of the scheme)."
[4] "Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation:"
[5] "Under quasi-stationary conditions, while the main and cracking reactions do not feel the influence of coke, it can be assumed that λ, ψ and θH keep quasi-constant values."
[6] "Eq. (3) and (4) may be helpful in interpreting the fact that the dehydrogenation rate is affected upon attaining higher threshold values of coke depositions in the presence of promoters."

The introduction of promoters modifies the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation, leading to an increase in these sites. Cracking occurs on Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, suggesting that dehydrogenation and cracking might happen in parallel on independent sites. Coke precursors arise due to interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates primarily located on X-type sites. Assuming fast migration of precursors, Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, indicating that their surface concentrations maintain quasi-constant values. The dehydrogenation rate is influenced by the presence of promoters, particularly affecting the threshold values of coke depositions.

引入促进剂修改了负责脱氢的Y型位点的数量，导致这些位点数量增加。裂解发生在嵌入Pt岛内的Pt原子上，暗示脱氢和裂解可能在独立的位点上并行发生。焦油前体由于异丁烯与主要位于X型位点上的不饱和表面中间体的相互作用而产生。假设前体快速迁移，Prec1和Prec2处于平衡状态，表明它们的表面积浓度保持近似恒定值。在促进剂的存在下，脱氢速率受到焦油沉积阈值变化的影响。

The literature discusses the influence of Sn and In promoters on the deactivation of Pt catalysts during isobutane dehydrogenation. It introduces a model that proposes three types of active sites: Z-type, X-type, and Y-type. Z-type sites are single Pt centers that facilitate dehydrogenation, characterized by strong adsorption affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons. X-type sites are catalytic clusters involving multiple Pt surface atoms, with Sn or In potentially reducing the adsorption strength, and they are responsible for cracking reactions. Y-type sites are interfaces between Pt and carrier or Pt and promoter, with weaker adsorption strength, facilitating dehydrogenation. The model also considers two types of coke precursors: those arising from intermediates tightly adsorbed onto X-type sites and those migrating from the former to Y-type sites. The model explains the stepwise deactivation kinetics and the promoter-induced effects. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach aims to predict hydrogenation activity and optimize Pt catalyst design.

[4] "The introduction of promoters in the catalyst systems enhances the effects provoked by the diversities in the behavior of the sites facilitating different routes of the processes."
[5] "On the one hand, it is believed that diluting the entities of Pt surface atoms by Sn makes for weaker adsorption affinity, due to modifications in the electron density of Pt."
[6] "It should be not skipped from consideration, however, that the effect of tin on Pt electron density depends as well on the particle size of the catalytic clusters."
[7] "At the same time, it gains support the viewpoint noted first by Sinfelt that the geometric factors play a crucial role in cases when the reaction requires active sites consisting of a number of adjacent active metal atoms in a proper configuration."
[8] "Various aspects of the related phenomena are focusing the interest of researchers."
[9] "The authors of ref. attach considerable significance as well to the role of adsorbed hydrogen for maintaining the catalyst activity, most probably by impeding coking."
[10] "It has been reported in ref. for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst that, because of the lower strength of adsorption, coke precursors can migrate easily to the support, and this results in reduced coke accumulation over the active sites."
[11] "The capability of the promoting metal to weaken the adsorption of unsaturated species is considered to make for changing the location of coke through spill over the support also by the authors of refs. [18], [21], [33], [34], [35], [40]."

The document discusses the behavior of catalytic systems that have multiple types of active sites. Promoters such as Sn and In are used to enhance catalyst activity, selectivity, and lifetime. The introduction of these promoters modifies the behavior of active sites, facilitating different reaction routes. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies can correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The presence of promoters like Sn can weaken the adsorption affinity of active sites, leading to easier migration of coke precursors to the support, which can reduce coke accumulation over the active sites. The equilibrium between coke precursors of Prec1 and Prec2 types, which arise from interactions of isobutene with unsaturated surface intermediates, plays a significant role in coke formation. The dehydrogenation rate is affected by the presence of promoters, leading to an increase in the threshold amount of coke that governs the coke tolerance effect.

[1] "The introduction of In or Sn promoters to Pt has resulted in acceleration of the dehydrogenation rate and in increase of the selectivity."
