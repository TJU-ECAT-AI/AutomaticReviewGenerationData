[1] "In view of this, it is a proper approximation to postulate the existence of three types of active sites, which we shall further denote as Z-, X- and Y-type."
[2] "These types of sites can be specified as follows: Z-type: Single Pt centers, facilitating dehydrogenation. These sites possess strong adsorption affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon fragments and weaker for hydrogen."
[3] "X-type: Catalytic clusters (ensembles) involving a number of Pt surface atoms in a proper configuration. These sites are characterised by very strong adsorption affinity. They may involve In or Sn surface atoms, the latter supposed to reduce the adsorption strength of the cluster."
[4] "Y-type: Centers on the interfaces Pt/carrier (Yc) or Pt/promoter (Ya); Y = Yc + Ya. The Y-type centers are supposed to facilitate dehydrogenation. Evidences are that these sites are of weaker adsorption strength for hydrocarbons."
[5] "Two types of coke precursors (further noted as Prec1 and Prec2) are suggested to be of significance for the coke formation."
[6] "Prec1 are the precursors arising inside the active-phase islands, predominantly on X-type sites."
[7] "The proximity of adsorbed hydrogen forms creates conditions for surface collisions resulting in breaking the chain of coke generation from these precursors."
[8] "The precursors located onto Y-type sites are noted as Prec2. Their origin is to a considerable extent conditioned by the migration of Prec1 from the interior of the active-phase entities."
[9] "Since the content of promoters is of the range of 2%, it is reasonable to suppose that their influence on the performance of the support sites can be neglected."
[10] "Therefore, we can assume that the rate of generation of Prec3, and correspondingly, the rate of independent coke formation on the support, is not influenced by the presence of promoters."
[11] "Concerning the increase of coke accumulated on the support at the expense of promoter-enhanced migration of precursors from the active phase, the rate of formation of this portion of support-located coke should be related to the rate of formation of Prec1 and Prec2 precursors."
[12] "Regarding the deactivation pattern caused by the coke located on the support, special tests performed in refs. [44],[46] gave evidence that the basic dehydrogenation reaction does not proceed on those alumina sites which are not interfacial with the active phase."

The study postulates the existence of three types of active sites: Z-, X-, and Y-type. Z-type sites consist of single Pt centers that facilitate dehydrogenation and have a strong adsorption affinity for unsaturated hydrocarbons. X-type sites are catalytic clusters involving multiple Pt atoms in a proper configuration, characterized by very strong adsorption affinity, and may involve In or Sn surface atoms, reducing the adsorption strength. Y-type sites are centers on the interfaces between Pt and carrier or promoter, facilitating dehydrogenation with weaker adsorption strength for hydrocarbons. Two types of coke precursors, Prec1 and Prec2, are significant for coke formation. Prec1 arises predominantly on X-type sites and their origin is conditioned by the migration of Prec1 from the interior of the active phase. Prec2 originates on Y-type sites, largely due to the migration of Prec1. The presence of promoters in the catalyst does not significantly influence the performance of the support sites, and thus, the rate of independent coke formation on the support is not affected. The deactivation pattern caused by coke located on the support is limited to sites that are not interfacial with the active phase.

研究假设存在三种类型的活性位点：Z-、X-和Y型。Z型位点由单个Pt中心组成，促进脱氢反应，对不饱和烃具有很强的吸附亲和力。X型位点是包含多个Pt原子的催化簇，在适当配置下，它们的特点是极强的吸附亲和力，可能包含In或Sn表面原子，降低簇的吸附强度。Y型位点位于Pt与载体或促进剂之间的界面，促进脱氢反应，对烃类有较弱的吸附能力。两种焦炭前体，Prec1和Prec2，对于焦炭形成至关重要。Prec1主要在X型位点上产生，并且其来源受到从活性相内部迁移的Prec1的影响。Prec2源自Y型位点，很大程度上由于Prec1的迁移。催化剂中的促进剂对支持位点的性能影响不大，因此支持上独立焦炭形成的速率不受促进剂的影响。位于活性相与支持物非界面位置上的位点导致的脱活模式仅限于活性相与支持物之间未接触的位点。
