[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the binding of these molecules on the 3d-Pt(1 1 1) surface (over-layer structure) and Pt3d-Pt (subsurface) structure."
[2] "Overall, the trends in the figures show that the binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (PtNiPt, PtCuPt, PtCoPt, PtFePt) are uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."
[3] "Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level."
[4] "The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined. Noting contributions in the m/e = 78 data from cyclohexene fragmentation, Fig. 5 demonstrates that these surfaces are largely inactive for any cyclohexene reaction pathways with the exception of PtCuPt(1 1 1), which produces a moderate amount of benzene."
[5] "The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared in order to study the effect of cyclic structure and the results showed that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predictions of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, the results demonstrate that the binding energy of linear alkenes decreases as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with separate trends observed for 3d and 5d surfaces. The binding energies on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surface structures. The adsorption of cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces correlates with the calculated d-band center, with the binding energy being lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces. The adsorption of benzene on the bridge(30) site is higher than on the hollow(0) site. The binding of benzene on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than on 1-hexene and cyclohexene. The effect of hydrocarbon chain length is studied by comparing the adsorption of the linear alkenes on metal surfaces, showing that the binding energy decreases as the chain length increases. The comparison between 1-hexene and cyclohexene reveals that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on most bimetallic surfaces.

The DFT calculations and TPD measurements are integrated to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, the correlation between the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies provides insights into the electronic structure of the metal surface and its influence on the adsorption properties of various hydrocarbon intermediates. This understanding helps in predicting the reactivity of these molecules on different Pt-3d catalysts, thereby guiding the rational design of catalysts with optimized activity for specific reactions.

1. The correlation between the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity of hydrocarbon intermediates and their adsorption strength on supported metal catalysts has been suggested by both experiments and theories. DFT calculations show that the binding energy of linear alkenes decreases as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level on Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces.

2. Experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that the electronic structure of the metal surface influences the adsorption properties of hydrocarbon molecules. DFT calculations predict that cyclohexene binds more weakly than 1-hexene on Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces, which aligns with experimental observations.

3. DFT and TPD measurements indicate that the activity of cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces is lower compared to linear alkenes like 1-hexene, suggesting that the cyclic structure affects the reactivity.

4. The adsorption strength of benzene on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than on other surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the cyclic structure of the molecule impacts its interaction with the metal surface.

5. DFT calculations show that the binding energy of linear alkenes decreases as the chain length increases, and this trend is consistent across both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. This indicates that the electronic properties of the metal play a crucial role in determining the adsorption strength of hydrocarbons.

To predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies can be employed. This method correlates with experimental observations from techniques such as thermogravimetric phase detection (TPD). The theoretical predictions can guide the rational design of bimetallic surfaces tailored for specific reactions, enhancing catalytic performance. For instance, the binding energy of cyclohexene on Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces is largely inactive, while PtCuPt(1 1 1) surfaces demonstrate moderate activity for benzene formation, consistent with the observed chemical interactions and electronic properties.
