[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the binding of these molecules on the 3d-Pt(1 1 1) surface (over-layer structure) and Pt3d-Pt (subsurface) structure."
[2] "Overall, the trends in the figures show that the binding energies of the linear alkenes on the subsurface bimetallics (PtNiPt, PtCuPt, PtCoPt, PtFePt) are uniformly lower than those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."
[3] "Similar to linear alkenes, it is clearly seen that the cyclohexene binding energy decreases as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level."
[4] "The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined. Noting contributions in the m/e = 78 data from cyclohexene fragmentation, Fig. 5 demonstrates that these surfaces are largely inactive for any cyclohexene reaction pathways with the exception of PtCuPt(1 1 1), which produces a moderate amount of benzene."
[5] "The binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene was compared in order to study the effect of cyclic structure and the results showed that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces."

1. DFT calculations were conducted to analyze the binding of molecules containing C═C bonds to 3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces and the subsurface Pt3d-Pt structure. These calculations correlate with experimental observations, such as those from TPD measurements, to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalysts.

2. The binding energies of linear alkenes on subsurface bimetallic structures are uniformly lower compared to those on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. 

3. The DFT results demonstrate that cyclohexene binds with a lower energy as the surface d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, similar to the behavior of linear alkenes.

4. Among Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, only PtCuPt(1 1 1) exhibits moderate cyclohexene reactivity, producing a moderate amount of benzene.

5. Comparing the binding of 1-hexene and cyclohexene reveals that cyclohexene binds with a lower energy across almost all bimetallic surfaces, reflecting its cyclic structure's influence on adsorption characteristics.

1. 对于包含C═C键的分子在3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面和子表面Pt3d-Pt结构上的吸附，进行了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。这些计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关联，用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂系统。

2. 在子表面双金属结构上，线性烯烃的结合能普遍低于Pt(1 1 1)表面。

3. DFT结果表明，随着表面d带中心远离费米能级，环己烯的结合能呈下降趋势，类似于线性烯烃的行为。

4. 在Cu/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面中，仅PtCuPt(1 1 1)表现出适度的环己烯反应性，产生一定量的苯。

5. 比较1-己烯和环己烯的结合，发现环己烯在几乎所有双金属表面的结合能更低，反映了其环状结构对吸附性质的影响。
