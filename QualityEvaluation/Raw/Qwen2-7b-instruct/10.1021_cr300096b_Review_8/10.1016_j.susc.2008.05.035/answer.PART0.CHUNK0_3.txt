<p>The adsorption of benzene has been studied for both bridge(30) and hollow(0) sites. The binding energy on the bridge(30) site is higher than the hollow(0) site. The binding of benzene on the subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than that of either 1-hexene and cyclohexene.</p>
<p>The effect of hydrocarbon chain length has been studied by comparing the adsorption of the linear alkenes on the metal surfaces.

1. The correlation between the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity of hydrocarbon intermediates and their adsorption strength on supported metal catalysts has been suggested by both experiments and theories. DFT calculations show that the binding energy of linear alkenes decreases as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level on Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces.

2. Experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that the electronic structure of the metal surface influences the adsorption properties of hydrocarbon molecules. DFT calculations predict that cyclohexene binds more weakly than 1-hexene on Pt-3d bimetallic surfaces, which aligns with experimental observations.

3. DFT and TPD measurements indicate that the activity of cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces is lower compared to linear alkenes like 1-hexene, suggesting that the cyclic structure affects the reactivity.

4. The adsorption strength of benzene on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than on other surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the cyclic structure of the molecule impacts its interaction with the metal surface.

5. DFT calculations show that the binding energy of linear alkenes decreases as the chain length increases, and this trend is consistent across both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. This indicates that the electronic properties of the metal play a crucial role in determining the adsorption strength of hydrocarbons.
