[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of linear, branched and cyclic olefins over supported metals and alloys are critical elementary steps in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversion."
[2] "Both experiment and theory have suggested that the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity can be correlated with relative strength of adsorption of these hydrocarbon intermediates."
[3] "There are no systematic analyses carried out to determine the influence of the hydrocarbon structure or the electronic structure of the metal on adsorption properties that occur over bimetallic surfaces."
[4] "In the current work, we examine the adsorption of several linear and cyclic hydrocarbons on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces to help elucidate the effects of adsorbate structure and the electronic properties of the metal on the adsorption behavior of these substrates."
[5] "The results show a general correlation between alkene binding energies and the calculated d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, which should ultimately aid in the rational design of bimetallic surfaces to carry out specific reactions."
[6] "The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined. Noting contributions in the m/e = 78 data from cyclohexene fragmentation, Fig. 5 demonstrates that these surfaces are largely inactive for any cyclohexene reaction pathways with the exception of PtCuPt(1 1 1), which produces a moderate amount of benzene."
[7] "This can be attributed to the interaction of the π-electrons in the benzene ring with the metal surface. As the benzene molecule adsorbs on the surface, there is a slight distortion of the molecule. The CC bond distance in benzene increases because of the interaction with the metal surface."

To predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems, an integrated theoretical and experimental approach utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies can be employed. This method correlates with experimental observations from techniques such as thermogravimetric phase detection (TPD). The theoretical predictions can guide the rational design of bimetallic surfaces tailored for specific reactions, enhancing catalytic performance. For instance, the binding energy of cyclohexene on Cu/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces is largely inactive, while PtCuPt(1 1 1) surfaces demonstrate moderate activity for benzene formation, consistent with the observed chemical interactions and electronic properties.

为了预测氢化反应活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂体系，可以采用理论和实验相结合的方法，利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能。这种方法与热重分析（TPD）等技术的实验观察结果相吻合。理论预测可以指导对特定反应进行合理设计的双金属表面的开发，从而提高催化性能。例如，Cu/Pt(1 1 1)表面对于环己烯的活性较低，而PtCuPt(1 1 1)表面在形成苯方面表现出适度的活性，这与观察到的化学相互作用和电子性质一致。
