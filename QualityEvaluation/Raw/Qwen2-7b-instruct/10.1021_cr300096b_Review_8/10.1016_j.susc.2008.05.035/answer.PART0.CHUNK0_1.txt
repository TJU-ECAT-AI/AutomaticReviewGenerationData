<p>The catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of linear, branched and cyclic olefins over supported metals and alloys are critical elementary steps in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversion [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] .</p>
<p>A number of both theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out to elucidate the trends in the adsorption of linear and cyclic alkenes on monometallic surfaces.</p>
<p>In contrast to the significant body of work on the chemisorption of these unsaturated hydrocarbons on single metal surfaces, very few studies have focused on adsorption on bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>The results show a general correlation between alkene binding energies and the calculated d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, which should ultimately aid in the rational design of bimetallic surfaces to carry out specific reactions.</p>
<p>The interaction of cyclohexene with Cu/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was also examined. Noting contributions in the m/e = 78 data from cyclohexene fragmentation, Fig. 5 demonstrates that these surfaces are largely inactive for any cyclohexene reaction pathways with the exception of PtCuPt(1 1 1), which produces a moderate amount of benzene.</p>
<p>It is also apparent from Fig. 6 c that the binding on all the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures is very weak as compared to Pt(1 1 1).</p>
<p>Fig. 7 shows the calculated binding energy for linear alkenes on Pt(1 1 1) as the number of CH2 substituents increases.</p>
<p>Fig. 8 shows the binding energies of 1-butene, 1-pentene and 1-hexene vs the binding energy of ethylene on the Pt/Ni surfaces.</p>

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predictions of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, the results demonstrate that the binding energy of linear alkenes decreases as the d-band center moves away from the Fermi level, with separate trends observed for 3d and 5d surfaces. The binding energies on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) structures are lower than on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, whereas the binding is stronger on the 3d-PtPt(1 1 1) surface structures. The adsorption of cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces correlates with the calculated d-band center, with the binding energy being lower for the cyclic structure on almost all the bimetallic surfaces. The adsorption of benzene on the bridge(30) site is higher than on the hollow(0) site. The binding of benzene on subsurface Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces is weaker than on 1-hexene and cyclohexene. The effect of hydrocarbon chain length is studied by comparing the adsorption of the linear alkenes on metal surfaces, showing that the binding energy decreases as the chain length increases. The comparison between 1-hexene and cyclohexene reveals that the binding energy is lower for the cyclic structure on most bimetallic surfaces.

对Pt-3d催化剂上各种C═C键含分子（包括线性烯烃、环烷烃和芳烃）的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果之间存在相关性。这种理论和实验的综合方法允许预测氢化反应活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。具体而言，线性烯烃的结合能随着表面d带中心远离费米能级而减少，不同类型的表面显示分离的趋势。在亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)结构上的结合能低于Pt(1 1 1)表面，而在3d-PtPt(1 1 1)表面结构上的结合能更强。环己烷在Pt基双金属表面上的吸附与计算得到的d带中心相关，环状结构的结合能低于几乎所有双金属表面的线性烷烃。苯在桥(30)位点上的吸附能高于空心(0)位点。在亚表面Pt3d-Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面上，苯的结合能弱于1-己烯和环己烷。通过比较金属表面的线性烷烃吸附，发现随着链长增加，结合能降低。将1-己烯与环己烷的比较显示，在大多数双金属表面上，环状结构的结合能更低。
