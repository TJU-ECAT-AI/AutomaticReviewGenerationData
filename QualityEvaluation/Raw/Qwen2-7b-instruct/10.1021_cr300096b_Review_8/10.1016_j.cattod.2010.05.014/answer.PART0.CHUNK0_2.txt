[1] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]."
[2] "The normalized rate constants obtained from batch reactor studies and the conversion obtained from flow reactor studies both show PtCo/-Al2O3 to be the most active bimetallic catalyst, with PtNi/-Al2O3 being the second most active, for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."
[3] "Previous studies on supported bimetallic catalysts have shown that after reduction, the surface of Pt/Ni catalysts are composed of primarily Pt atoms [28,29], suggesting that the nanoparticle structure may more closely resemble the PtNiPt subsurface configuration than NiPtPt."
[4] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."
[5] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."
[6] "Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst displays a preference toward partial hydrogenation to produce butenes."

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

2. The experimental results show that PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts display greater hydrogenation activity compared to Pt/-Al2O3 in both batch and flow reactor studies.

3. Previous studies indicate that after reduction, the surface of Pt/Ni catalysts are primarily composed of Pt atoms, suggesting that the nanoparticle structure may resemble the PtNiPt subsurface configuration more closely than NiPtPt.

4. According to the correlation between d-band center and binding energy, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the highest hydrogenation activity, followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure. This prediction is supported by both the batch and flow reactor results.

5. Based on the binding energies, PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1). However, this prediction conflicts with the experimental results.

6. Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst shows a preference for partial hydrogenation to produce butenes.

1. 在Pt-3d催化剂上，各种C═C键含分子的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关联。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以用来预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。

2. 实验结果显示，PtCo/-Al2O3和PtNi/-Al2O3催化剂在1,3-丁二烯氢化反应中比Pt/-Al2O3具有更高的活性，在批式和流体反应器研究中均表现出色。

3. 以往的研究表明，经还原后，Pt/Ni催化剂的表面主要由Pt原子组成，暗示其纳米颗粒结构可能更接近于PtNiPt亚表面配置而非NiPtPt。

4. 根据d带中心和吸附剂结合能之间的相关性，PtCoPt(1 1 1)结构应该显示出最高的氢化活性，其次是PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构。这一预测得到了批式和流体反应器结果的支持。

5. 基于结合能，PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)应该比Pt(1 1 1)具有更高的氢化活性。然而，这一预测与实验结果相矛盾。

6. 尽管活性较低，但PtCu/-Al2O3催化剂显示出偏好部分氢化以产生丁烯。
