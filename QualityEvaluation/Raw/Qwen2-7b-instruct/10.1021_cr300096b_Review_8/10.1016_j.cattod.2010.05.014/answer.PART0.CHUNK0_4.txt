[1] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]."
[2] "The binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."
[3] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."
[4] "Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst displays a preference toward partial hydrogenation to produce butenes."

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
2. The binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, indicating that weaker binding energies on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures result in greater hydrogenation activity.
3. According to the correlation between d-band center and binding energy, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should exhibit the highest activity, followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, which is consistent with the results from both batch and flow reactor studies.
4. The PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst, despite having low activity, shows a preference for partial hydrogenation, producing butenes, rather than complete hydrogenation to form butanes.

1. DFT计算中表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果对各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的氢化活性有很好的相关性。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。
2. 1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能与d带中心的相关性表明，PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构上较弱的结合能导致更高的氢化活性。
3. 根据d带中心和结合能之间的相关性，PtCoPt(1 1 1)结构应该具有最高的活性，然后是PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构，这与批处理和流动反应器研究的结果是一致的。
4.PtCu/-Al2O3催化剂尽管活性较低，但显示出偏好部分氢化，产生但烯，而不是完全氢化形成但烷。
