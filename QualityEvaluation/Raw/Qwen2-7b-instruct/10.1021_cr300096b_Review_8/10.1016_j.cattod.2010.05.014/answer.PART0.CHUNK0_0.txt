[1] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]."
[2] "The binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."
[3] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."
[4] "Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst displays a preference toward partial hydrogenation to produce butenes."

1. DFT calculations have shown that surfaces which bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes weakly tend to exhibit greater hydrogenation activity. 
2. The binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, indicating that the weakest binding occurs on subsurface Pt-Co and Pt-Ni structures.
3. Contrary to predictions based solely on d-band center, Pt-Cu and Cu-Pt structures should display greater hydrogenation activity compared to pure Pt surfaces.
4. While the Pt-Cu catalyst shows lower overall hydrogenation activity, it demonstrates a preference for partial hydrogenation, producing butenes.

1. 动力学计算表明，吸附氢原子和烯烃能力较弱的表面具有较高的氢化活性。
2. 1,3-丁二烯和氢的结合能与d带中心有良好的相关性，显示在Pt-Co和Pt-Ni亚表面结构上的结合能最弱。
3. 与基于d带中心的预测相反，Pt-Cu和Cu-Pt结构应比纯Pt表面显示更高的氢化活性。
4. 尽管Pt-Cu催化剂的总氢化活性较低，但它表现出部分氢化的偏好，产生丁烯。
