How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]."
[2] "The binding energies of both 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen appear to correlate well to the d-band center, with binding energies being the weakest on the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structures."
[3] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."
[4] "Despite its low activity, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst displays a preference toward partial hydrogenation to produce butenes."

1. DFT calculations have shown that surfaces which bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes weakly tend to exhibit greater hydrogenation activity. 
2. The binding energies of 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen correlate well with the d-band center, indicating that the weakest binding occurs on subsurface Pt-Co and Pt-Ni structures.
3. Contrary to predictions based solely on d-band center, Pt-Cu and Cu-Pt structures should display greater hydrogenation activity compared to pure Pt surfaces.
4. While the Pt-Cu catalyst shows lower overall hydrogenation activity, it demonstrates a preference for partial hydrogenation, producing butenes.

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The weak binding energies of hydrogen and alkenes on the surface indicate enhanced hydrogenation activity. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

2. The activity over the PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts correlates well with DFT predictions, suggesting that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 1 1) structures are good hydrogenation catalysts. These structures bind hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene more weakly than Pt(1 1 1), which is in line with the observed experimental activity.

3. Among the studied catalysts, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst shows a lower hydrogenation activity in the batch reactor, and an even lower activity in the flow reactor studies. Despite this, it exhibits a preference for partial hydrogenation to produce butenes in both batch and flow reactor studies.

2. 研究发现，PtCo/-Al2O3和PtNi/-Al2O3催化剂的活性与DFT预测相吻合，证明了PtCoPt(1 1 1)和PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构是良好的氢化催化剂。这些结构对氢气和1,3-丁二烯的结合能力较弱，这与观察到的实验活性一致。

3. 在所有研究的催化剂中，PtCu/-Al2O3催化剂在批处理反应器中的活性较低，在流反应器研究中甚至更低。尽管如此，在批处理和流反应器研究中，它都表现出偏好部分氢化以生成但烯的倾向。
