[1] "Previous work in correlating hydrogenation activity to d-band center has shown that surfaces that weakly bind atomic hydrogen and alkenes display greater hydrogenation activity [17,18]."
[2] "This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbate allows for the novel low-temperature hydrogenation to occur."
[3] "Normalized rate constants obtained from batch reactor studies and the conversion obtained from flow reactor studies both show PtCo/-Al2O3 to be the most active bimetallic catalyst, with PtNi/-Al2O3 being the second most active, for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation."
[4] "Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy shown in Fig. 7 to predict hydrogenation activity, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results."
[5] "However, based on the binding energies Fig. 7 also predicts that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1)."
[6] "In the batch reactor studies the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst indeed shows higher activity than Pt/-Al2O3, but in the flow reactor studies it displays lower activity than Pt/-Al2O3."

1. DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

2. This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbate allows for the novel low-temperature hydrogenation to occur. 

3. The PtCo/-Al2O3 and PtNi/-Al2O3 catalysts were found to display higher hydrogenation activity than the monometallic Pt/-Al2O3 catalysts in both batch and flow reactor studies.

4. Using the correlation between d-band center and binding energy, the PtCoPt(1 1 1) structure should show the greatest activity followed by the PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure, as verified by both the batch and flow reactor results.

5. However, the binding energies also predict that PtCuPt(1 1 1) and CuPtPt(1 1 1) should display greater hydrogenation activity than Pt(1 1 1).

6. In the batch reactor studies, the PtCu/-Al2O3 catalyst showed higher activity than Pt/-Al2O3, but in the flow reactor studies, it displayed lower activity than Pt/-Al2O3.

1. DFT计算中，Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等技术的实验观察结果相吻合。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。

2. 这种表面和吸附剂之间的弱相互作用允许在较低温度下进行新型氢化。

3. PtCo/-Al2O3和PtNi/-Al2O3催化剂在批处理和固定床反应器研究中显示了比单金属Pt/-Al2O3催化剂更高的氢化活性。

4. 使用d带中心和吸附剂结合能之间的相关性，PtCoPt(1 1 1)结构应表现出最大的活性，其次是PtNiPt(1 1 1)结构，这在批处理和固定床反应器结果中得到了验证。

5. 然而，结合能也预测PtCuPt(1 1 1)和CuPtPt(1 1 1)结构的氢化活性大于Pt(1 1 1)。

6. 在批处理反应器研究中，PtCu/-Al2O3催化剂的活性高于Pt/-Al2O3，但在固定床反应器研究中，它低于Pt/-Al2O3的活性。
