[1] "In our reaction, the final product observed was cyclopentane rather than cyclopentadiene reported previously, suggesting that total hydrogenation had occurred although this might be subsequent to the deposition of the iron."
[2] "A comparison of the nominal loading of the iron with that determined experimentally (given in Table 1 ) indicates that almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited."
[3] "Evolution of the cyclopentane species suggests that hydrogenolysis of the FeC5H5 bond occurs, followed by hydrogenation of the product."
[4] "Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal."
[5] "The chemisorption results are however consistent with the iron being closely associated with the platinum."

1. The final product observed was cyclopentane, indicating total hydrogenation, which happened after the deposition of iron.
2. Almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited.
3. Hydrogenolysis of the FeC5H5 bond followed by hydrogenation of the product led to the evolution of cyclopentane.
4. The hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal under the experimental conditions.
5. The chemisorption results showed that the iron was closely associated with the platinum.
