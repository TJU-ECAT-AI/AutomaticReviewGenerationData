[1] "Addition of iron suppresses the chemisorption of hydrogen for both the palladium and platinum catalysts."
[2] "The catalysts were believed to consist mainly of palladium or platinum in close association with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with an overlayer of FeOx."
[3] "Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Iron addition affects the hydrogenation process by suppressing the chemisorption of hydrogen on both palladium and platinum catalysts. The modified catalysts are thought to contain palladium or platinum closely associated with iron, forming structures like MFe0 and possibly having an iron oxide overlay. Iron doping enhances the catalyst's activity and selectivity for n-butenes, notably 1-butene, by inhibiting total hydrogenation.

铁的添加通过抑制钯和铂催化剂上的氢吸附，影响了氢化过程。修改后的催化剂被认为主要由与铁紧密关联的钯或铂构成，形成如MFe0这样的结构，并可能有铁氧化物覆盖层。铁掺杂提高了催化剂的活性和n-丁烯选择性，特别是1-丁烯，通过抑制完全氢化来实现这一点。
