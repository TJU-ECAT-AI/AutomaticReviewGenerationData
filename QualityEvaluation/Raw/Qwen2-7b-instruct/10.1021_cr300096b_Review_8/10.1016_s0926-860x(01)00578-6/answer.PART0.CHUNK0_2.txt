[1] "The present work shows that ferrocene can successfully be used to deposit iron on to platinum group metal catalysts using SOMC. The ferrocene appears to react selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface depositing the iron, at least initially, on to the noble metal surface"
[2] "Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal."
[3] "The chemisorption results for the bimetallic catalysts are also shown in Table 1 . Inspection of the results indicates a decrease in the volume of hydrogen adsorbed by the bimetallic catalysts compared to the parent monometallic catalysts."
[4] "A number of authors have reported modification of the electronic properties of platinum by iron in PtFe alloys with an electron transfer from iron to platinum."
[5] "Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene."
[6] "This enhancement may be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements by showing how electronic properties of the metal change upon doping with iron. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows predicting hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The addition of iron leads to suppression of total hydrogenation, enhancing selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene, through both geometric and electronic effects.

DFT计算中，各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂表面的d带中心和吸附剂结合能与使用TPD测量技术得到的实验观察结果相关联，揭示了掺杂铁后金属电子性质的变化。这种理论和实验相结合的方法能够预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。添加铁导致总氢化作用的抑制，提高了n-丁烯，特别是1-丁烯的选择性，通过几何和电子效应实现这一目标。
