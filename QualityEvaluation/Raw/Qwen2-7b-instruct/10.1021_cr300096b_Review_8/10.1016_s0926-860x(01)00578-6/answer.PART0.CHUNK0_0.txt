<p>The present work shows that ferrocene can successfully be used to deposit iron on to platinum group metal catalysts using SOMC. The ferrocene appears to react selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface depositing the iron, at least initially, on to the noble metal surface After the reaction the platinum group metal (M) is believed to be closely associated with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with possibly an overlayer of FeOx. The extent of oxidation of the sample depends on the environment of the catalyst although Fe3+ is always present, even under reducing conditions and is particularly significant for the Pt-Fe/Al2O3 sample. Addition of iron to Pt/Al2O3 produced a significant enhancement in both the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene. This enhancement may be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.</p>

The addition of iron to the platinum group metal catalysts using SOMC leads to a selective deposition of iron on the metal surface. This results in the formation of complexes like MFe0 or a metal with an overlayer of FeOx. The iron addition enhances the activity and selectivity of the catalyst for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation, by suppressing total hydrogenation and increasing the selectivity for n-butenes, especially 1-butene. This improvement can be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.

向铂族金属催化剂使用SOMC添加铁导致铁在金属表面选择性沉积。这会导致形成如MFe0或金属与FeOx覆盖层的复合物。铁的添加提高了催化剂的活性和选择性，特别是对于1,3-丁二烯氢化反应的选择性提高，通过抑制总氢化作用并增加1-丁烯的选择性，尤其是1-丁烯。这种改进可以归因于几何和电子效应的共同作用。
