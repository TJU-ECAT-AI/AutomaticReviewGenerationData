[1] "The catalysts were believed to consist mainly of palladium or platinum in close association with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with an overlayer of FeOx."
[2] "Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene."
[3] "The increase in the initial activity of this catalyst suggests that although the number of sites available to chemisorb hydrogen has decreased, the activity of these sites appears to have increased."
[4] "It would thus appear that the significant improvement seen in both the activity and the selectivity to n-butenes on addition of iron to Pt/Al2O3 can be attributed to both a geometric effect and an electronic effect."

1. The catalysts were thought to primarily contain palladium or platinum closely bound with iron, possibly forming MFe0 structures or having an overlay of FeOx.
2. There was a noticeable decrease in total hydrogenation, accompanied by an increased selectivity for n-butenes, especially 1-butene.
3. The rise in the catalyst's initial activity indicates that despite a reduction in the number of sites capable of hydrogen adsorption, the efficiency of these sites actually increased.
4. The notable enhancement in both activity and selectivity towards n-butenes when iron was added to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts seems to be a result of both geometric and electronic effects.

1. 这些催化剂主要由钯或铂与铁紧密结合形成，可能以MFe0的形式存在或者带有FeOx覆盖层。
2. 观察到总氢化作用的降低，同时n-丁烯特别是1-丁烯的选择性显著提高。
3. 催化剂初始活性的提升表明，尽管可吸附氢的位点数量减少，但这些位点的活性实际上有所增加。
4. 当铁添加到Pt/Al2O3催化剂中时，观察到的活性和n-丁烯选择性的显著提高似乎是几何效应和电子效应共同作用的结果。
