How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<p>The present work shows that ferrocene can successfully be used to deposit iron on to platinum group metal catalysts using SOMC. The ferrocene appears to react selectively with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface depositing the iron, at least initially, on to the noble metal surface After the reaction the platinum group metal (M) is believed to be closely associated with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with possibly an overlayer of FeOx. The extent of oxidation of the sample depends on the environment of the catalyst although Fe3+ is always present, even under reducing conditions and is particularly significant for the Pt-Fe/Al2O3 sample. Addition of iron to Pt/Al2O3 produced a significant enhancement in both the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene. This enhancement may be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.</p>

The addition of iron to the platinum group metal catalysts using SOMC leads to a selective deposition of iron on the metal surface. This results in the formation of complexes like MFe0 or a metal with an overlayer of FeOx. The iron addition enhances the activity and selectivity of the catalyst for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation, by suppressing total hydrogenation and increasing the selectivity for n-butenes, especially 1-butene. This improvement can be attributed to both geometric and electronic effects.

向铂族金属催化剂使用SOMC添加铁导致铁在金属表面选择性沉积。这会导致形成如MFe0或金属与FeOx覆盖层的复合物。铁的添加提高了催化剂的活性和选择性，特别是对于1,3-丁二烯氢化反应的选择性提高，通过抑制总氢化作用并增加1-丁烯的选择性，尤其是1-丁烯。这种改进可以归因于几何和电子效应的共同作用。

[1] "In our reaction, the final product observed was cyclopentane rather than cyclopentadiene reported previously, suggesting that total hydrogenation had occurred although this might be subsequent to the deposition of the iron."
[2] "A comparison of the nominal loading of the iron with that determined experimentally (given in Table 1 ) indicates that almost all of the iron introduced to the monometallic catalysts was successfully deposited."
[3] "Evolution of the cyclopentane species suggests that hydrogenolysis of the FeC5H5 bond occurs, followed by hydrogenation of the product."
[4] "Under our experimental conditions no hydrogen chemisorption was observed for iron supported on alumina, and assuming that each component retains its bulk properties, the hydrogen uptake by the bimetallic catalysts was attributed solely to the noble metal."
[5] "The chemisorption results are however consistent with the iron being closely associated with the platinum."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements by showing how electronic properties of the metal change upon doping with iron. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows predicting hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The addition of iron leads to suppression of total hydrogenation, enhancing selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene, through both geometric and electronic effects.

[1] "The catalysts were believed to consist mainly of palladium or platinum in close association with the iron, as MFe0 and/or the metal with an overlayer of FeOx."
[2] "Suppression of total hydrogenation was observed with a corresponding increase in selectivity to n-butenes, particularly 1-butene."
[3] "The increase in the initial activity of this catalyst suggests that although the number of sites available to chemisorb hydrogen has decreased, the activity of these sites appears to have increased."
[4] "It would thus appear that the significant improvement seen in both the activity and the selectivity to n-butenes on addition of iron to Pt/Al2O3 can be attributed to both a geometric effect and an electronic effect."

1. The catalysts were thought to primarily contain palladium or platinum closely bound with iron, possibly forming MFe0 structures or having an overlay of FeOx.
2. There was a noticeable decrease in total hydrogenation, accompanied by an increased selectivity for n-butenes, especially 1-butene.
3. The rise in the catalyst's initial activity indicates that despite a reduction in the number of sites capable of hydrogen adsorption, the efficiency of these sites actually increased.
4. The notable enhancement in both activity and selectivity towards n-butenes when iron was added to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts seems to be a result of both geometric and electronic effects.

Iron addition affects the hydrogenation process by suppressing the chemisorption of hydrogen on both palladium and platinum catalysts. The modified catalysts are thought to contain palladium or platinum closely associated with iron, forming structures like MFe0 and possibly having an iron oxide overlay. Iron doping enhances the catalyst's activity and selectivity for n-butenes, notably 1-butene, by inhibiting total hydrogenation.

铁的添加通过抑制钯和铂催化剂上的氢吸附，影响了氢化过程。修改后的催化剂被认为主要由与铁紧密关联的钯或铂构成，形成如MFe0这样的结构，并可能有铁氧化物覆盖层。铁掺杂提高了催化剂的活性和n-丁烯选择性，特别是1-丁烯，通过抑制完全氢化来实现这一点。
