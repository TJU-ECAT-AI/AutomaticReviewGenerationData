<p>Because of the large amount of metal loadings and the uncertainty of stoichiometry in the catalysts, the dispersion values on these catalysts are not very meaningful and are listed in Table 2 to only provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion.</p>
<p>The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies [49] ,[50] and density functional theory (DFT) modeling [47] ,[54] of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>For example, the CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst is 395 μmol/g catalyst, which is much higher than the sum of uptake from the two monometallic catalysts, 96.7 and 9.9 μmol/g catalyst for 10%Co/AC and 1.2%Pt/AC, respectively.</p>
<p>The extent of bimetallic formation appears to be different on the different supports. As shown in the EXAFS results in Table 3 , on Al2O3 and SiO2 most of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co atoms to form the PtCo bimetallic bonds, but there are less PtCo bonds for the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>The detection of the PtCo CN value of 4.9 in the EXAFS measurements qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on AC. However, due to the presence of both small and large metallic particles in the TEM measurements, it is difficult to directly correlate the extent of PtCo bond formation from the EXAFS analysis.</p>

The dispersion values on the catalysts are not very meaningful due to the large metal loadings and uncertainty of stoichiometry. The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts aligns with previous surface science studies and DFT modeling. The CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC catalyst is notably higher than the sum of uptake from its monometallic counterparts. The extent of bimetallic formation varies across different supports, with Al2O3 and SiO2 supporting the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds, whereas TiO2 has less. The PtCo CN value of 4.9 from EXAFS measurements indicates the presence of a PtCo bond on AC, though direct correlation with the extent of bond formation from the EXAFS analysis is challenging due to the presence of both small and large metallic particles in TEM measurements.

由于催化剂中金属负载量大且难以确定化学计量比，这些催化剂上的分散度值并不具有很大的意义，并仅用于提供金属分散度的相对排名。铂钴双金属催化剂的增强氢化活性与先前的表面科学研究和密度泛函理论（DFT）建模相一致。1.2%Pt10%Co/AC双金属催化剂的CO吸附量远高于其两种单金属催化剂的总和。在不同的支持材料上，铂钴双金属形成的程度有所不同，在氧化铝和二氧化硅上，铂原子主要被钴原子包围形成PtCo双金属键，而铂钴/TiO2催化剂中的PtCo键形成较少。从EXAFS测量得到的PtCo CN值为4.9，这定性地证实了AC上的PtCo键的存在。然而，由于透射电子显微镜（TEM）测量中存在大小不一的金属颗粒，直接从EXAFS分析中推断PtCo键形成的程度较为困难。
