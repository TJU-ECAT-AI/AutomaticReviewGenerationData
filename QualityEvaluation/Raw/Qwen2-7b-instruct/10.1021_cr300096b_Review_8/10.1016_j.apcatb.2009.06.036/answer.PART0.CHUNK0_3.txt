[1] "The observation of enhanced hydrogenation activity over PtCo is consistent with the fact that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[2] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies and density functional theory (DFT) modeling of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "The extent of bimetallic formation appears to be different on the different supports. As shown in the EXAFS results in Table 3, on Al2O3 and SiO2 most of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co atoms to form the PtCo bimetallic bonds, but there are less PtCo bonds for the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst."
[4] "For example, the CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst is 395 μmol/g catalyst, which is much higher than the sum of uptake from the two monometallic catalysts, 96.7 and 9.9 μmol/g catalyst for 10%Co/AC and 1.2%Pt/AC, respectively."
[5] "This trend of normalized activities is consistent with the estimation of the apparent activation energy, where the values follow the trend: SiO2 < Al2O3 < TiO2  AC."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is consistent with previous surface science studies and DFT modeling of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces. The extent of bimetallic formation varies across different supports, with Al2O3 and SiO2 supporting the formation of more PtCo bimetallic bonds compared to TiO2. The CO uptake capacity of the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst is notably higher than that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts, indicating more active sites for hydrogenation. This pattern of normalized activities aligns with the estimated apparent activation energy, showing that AC supports yield higher catalytic efficiency than Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2.

DFT计算中，Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关联。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。在PtCo双金属催化剂中观察到的增强氢化活性与Co/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面低温氢化环己烯的表面科学研究和DFT模型一致。双金属形成在不同支撑材料上的程度有所不同，Al2O3和SiO2支持下形成的PtCo双金属键比TiO2更多。1.2%Pt10%Co/AC双金属催化剂的CO吸附容量明显高于对应的单金属催化剂，表明更多的活性位点用于氢化。这种标准化活动的趋势与估计的显式活化能相吻合，显示AC支撑下的催化效率高于Al2O3、SiO2和TiO2。
