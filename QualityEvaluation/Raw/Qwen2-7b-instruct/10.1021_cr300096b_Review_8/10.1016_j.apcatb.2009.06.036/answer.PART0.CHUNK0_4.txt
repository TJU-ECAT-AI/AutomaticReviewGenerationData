[1] "The enhanced activity in PtCo could be attributed to the increased reducibility of Co oxides by the addition of Pt, and more importantly, to the formation of the PtCo bimetallic bonds."
[2] "For example, the CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst is 395 μmol/g catalyst, which is much higher than the sum of uptake from the two monometallic catalysts, 96.7 and 9.9 μmol/g catalyst for 10%Co/AC and 1.2%Pt/AC, respectively."
[3] "Similar increases in CO uptake are also observed for the other supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts listed in Table 2."
[4] "The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies [49] ,[50] and density functional theory (DFT) modeling [47] ,[54] of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements through the prediction of hydrogenation activity. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, the CO uptake values from the CO chemisorption measurements show a direct relationship with the hydrogenation activity, indicating that the enhanced activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the increased reducibility of Co oxides by the addition of Pt, and the formation of the PtCo bimetallic bonds. These findings are consistent with previous surface science studies and DFT modeling, which suggest that the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds results in higher hydrogenation activity than that of either Pt or Co.

DFT计算对各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂表面的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的分析与TPD测量等实验观察结果相吻合，通过这种理论与实验相结合的方法，可以预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。例如，从CO化学吸附测量得到的CO吸收值直接反映了氢化活性，这表明铂钴双金属催化剂中钴氧化物的可还原性增强是由铂的加入引起的，并且形成了铂钴双金属键。这些发现与之前的表面科学研究和DFT建模一致，后者表明形成铂钴双金属键导致的氢化活性高于纯铂或钴的活性。
