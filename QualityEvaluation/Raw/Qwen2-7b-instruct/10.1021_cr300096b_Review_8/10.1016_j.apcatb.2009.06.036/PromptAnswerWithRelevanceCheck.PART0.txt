How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "The observation of enhanced hydrogenation activity over PtCo is consistent with the fact that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [41] ,[42] ,[43] ,[44] ,[45] ."
[2] "Many previous investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces with catalytic properties [43] ,[44] ,[45] ,[46] ,[47] ,[48] ,[49] ,[50] ,[51] ,[52] ,[53] ,[54] ."
[3] "The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene and benzene, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds [40] ,[47] ,[54] ."
[4] "Furthermore, for all the supports, PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of either Pt or Co."
[5] "The detection of the PtCo CN value of 4.9 in the EXAFS measurements qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on AC."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, when comparing the properties of bimetallic catalysts to those of monometallic catalysts, it was found that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed enhanced hydrogenation activity, which was attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds. This trend was consistent across all supports, with PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrating higher hydrogenation activities than their monometallic counterparts. The EXAFS measurements confirmed the formation of the PtCo bond on activated carbon, indicating that the PtCo bimetallic formation on AC led to the observed high hydrogenation activity.

DFT计算中的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与PTD测量等实验观察结果之间存在关联，这种理论和实验的整合方法可用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。例如，通过比较双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂的性质，发现PtCo双金属催化剂具有增强的氢化活性，这是由于双金属表面上原子氢和不饱和烃（如环己烯和芳香烃）的较弱结合能导致了CC键的容易氢化。这一趋势在所有支撑材料上都是一致的，PtCo双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于其对应的单金属催化剂。EXAFS测量证实了在AC上的PtCo键形成，这表明在AC上形成的PtCo键导致了观察到的高氢化活性。

<p>Because of the large amount of metal loadings and the uncertainty of stoichiometry in the catalysts, the dispersion values on these catalysts are not very meaningful and are listed in Table 2 to only provide a relative ranking of metal dispersion.</p>
<p>The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is also consistent with previous surface science studies [49] ,[50] and density functional theory (DFT) modeling [47] ,[54] of low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Co/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>For example, the CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC bimetallic catalyst is 395 μmol/g catalyst, which is much higher than the sum of uptake from the two monometallic catalysts, 96.7 and 9.9 μmol/g catalyst for 10%Co/AC and 1.2%Pt/AC, respectively.</p>
<p>The extent of bimetallic formation appears to be different on the different supports. As shown in the EXAFS results in Table 3 , on Al2O3 and SiO2 most of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co atoms to form the PtCo bimetallic bonds, but there are less PtCo bonds for the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>The detection of the PtCo CN value of 4.9 in the EXAFS measurements qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on AC.

The dispersion values on the catalysts are not very meaningful due to the large metal loadings and uncertainty of stoichiometry. The enhanced hydrogenation activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts aligns with previous surface science studies and DFT modeling. The CO uptake value for the 1.2%Pt10%Co/AC catalyst is notably higher than the sum of uptake from its monometallic counterparts. The extent of bimetallic formation varies across different supports, with Al2O3 and SiO2 supporting the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds, whereas TiO2 has less. The PtCo CN value of 4.9 from EXAFS measurements indicates the presence of a PtCo bond on AC, though direct correlation with the extent of bond formation from the EXAFS analysis is challenging due to the presence of both small and large metallic particles in TEM measurements.

由于催化剂中金属负载量大且难以确定化学计量比，这些催化剂上的分散度值并不具有很大的意义，并仅用于提供金属分散度的相对排名。铂钴双金属催化剂的增强氢化活性与先前的表面科学研究和密度泛函理论（DFT）建模相一致。1.2%Pt10%Co/AC双金属催化剂的CO吸附量远高于其两种单金属催化剂的总和。在不同的支持材料上，铂钴双金属形成的程度有所不同，在氧化铝和二氧化硅上，铂原子主要被钴原子包围形成PtCo双金属键，而铂钴/TiO2催化剂中的PtCo键形成较少。从EXAFS测量得到的PtCo CN值为4.9，这定性地证实了AC上的PtCo键的存在。然而，由于透射电子显微镜（TEM）测量中存在大小不一的金属颗粒，直接从EXAFS分析中推断PtCo键形成的程度较为困难。

The document highlights that the use of activated carbon as a support for PtCo bimetallic catalysts leads to the best performance in terms of benzene hydrogenation activity. This improvement is attributed to the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds and a high CO chemisorption capacity. Across different supports, PtCo bimetallic catalysts consistently outperform their monometallic counterparts, reinforcing the notion that the creation of PtCo bimetallic bonds enhances hydrogenation activity compared to individual Pt or Co metals.

文献表明，使用活性炭作为PtCo双金属催化剂的支持物，可以获得最佳的苯氢化活性。这种改进主要归因于PtCo双金属键的形成和高CO吸附能力。在不同支持剂下，PtCo双金属催化剂的性能始终优于其单金属对应物，进一步证实了与单独的Pt或Co金属相比，形成PtCo双金属键可以提高氢化活性。

DFT计算中，Pt-3d催化剂上各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关联。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。在PtCo双金属催化剂中观察到的增强氢化活性与Co/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面低温氢化环己烯的表面科学研究和DFT模型一致。双金属形成在不同支撑材料上的程度有所不同，Al2O3和SiO2支持下形成的PtCo双金属键比TiO2更多。1.2%Pt10%Co/AC双金属催化剂的CO吸附容量明显高于对应的单金属催化剂，表明更多的活性位点用于氢化。这种标准化活动的趋势与估计的显式活化能相吻合，显示AC支撑下的催化效率高于Al2O3、SiO2和TiO2。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements through the prediction of hydrogenation activity. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and informs the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, the CO uptake values from the CO chemisorption measurements show a direct relationship with the hydrogenation activity, indicating that the enhanced activity in PtCo bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the increased reducibility of Co oxides by the addition of Pt, and the formation of the PtCo bimetallic bonds. These findings are consistent with previous surface science studies and DFT modeling, which suggest that the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds results in higher hydrogenation activity than that of either Pt or Co.
