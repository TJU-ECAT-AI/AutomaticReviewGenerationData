<p>Among the various supported catalysts, the activated carbon supported PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibited the best performance, mostly attributed to the PtCo bimetallic formation and the very high CO chemisorption capacity.</p>
<p>The results show that for all the supports, PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, supporting the argument that the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of either Pt or Co.</p>
<p>As shown in the EXAFS results in Table 3, on Al2O3 and SiO2 most of the Pt atoms in the bimetallic catalysts are surrounded by Co atoms to form the PtCo bimetallic bonds, but there are less PtCo bonds for the PtCo/TiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>The detection of the PtCo CN value of 4.9 in the EXAFS measurements qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on AC.</p>

The document highlights that the use of activated carbon as a support for PtCo bimetallic catalysts leads to the best performance in terms of benzene hydrogenation activity. This improvement is attributed to the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds and a high CO chemisorption capacity. Across different supports, PtCo bimetallic catalysts consistently outperform their monometallic counterparts, reinforcing the notion that the creation of PtCo bimetallic bonds enhances hydrogenation activity compared to individual Pt or Co metals.

文献表明，使用活性炭作为PtCo双金属催化剂的支持物，可以获得最佳的苯氢化活性。这种改进主要归因于PtCo双金属键的形成和高CO吸附能力。在不同支持剂下，PtCo双金属催化剂的性能始终优于其单金属对应物，进一步证实了与单独的Pt或Co金属相比，形成PtCo双金属键可以提高氢化活性。
