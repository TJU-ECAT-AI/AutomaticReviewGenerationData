[1] "The observation of enhanced hydrogenation activity over PtCo is consistent with the fact that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [41] ,[42] ,[43] ,[44] ,[45] ."
[2] "Many previous investigations combining fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations have been performed with the goal of correlating electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces with catalytic properties [43] ,[44] ,[45] ,[46] ,[47] ,[48] ,[49] ,[50] ,[51] ,[52] ,[53] ,[54] ."
[3] "The higher hydrogenation activity has been attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene and benzene, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds [40] ,[47] ,[54] ."
[4] "Furthermore, for all the supports, PtCo bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that the formation of PtCo bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of either Pt or Co."
[5] "The detection of the PtCo CN value of 4.9 in the EXAFS measurements qualitatively confirms the formation of the PtCo bond on AC."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. For instance, when comparing the properties of bimetallic catalysts to those of monometallic catalysts, it was found that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed enhanced hydrogenation activity, which was attributed to the relatively weak binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces for both atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons, leading to a facile hydrogenation of the CC bonds. This trend was consistent across all supports, with PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrating higher hydrogenation activities than their monometallic counterparts. The EXAFS measurements confirmed the formation of the PtCo bond on activated carbon, indicating that the PtCo bimetallic formation on AC led to the observed high hydrogenation activity.

DFT计算中的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与PTD测量等实验观察结果之间存在关联，这种理论和实验的整合方法可用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化体系。例如，通过比较双金属催化剂与单金属催化剂的性质，发现PtCo双金属催化剂具有增强的氢化活性，这是由于双金属表面上原子氢和不饱和烃（如环己烯和芳香烃）的较弱结合能导致了CC键的容易氢化。这一趋势在所有支撑材料上都是一致的，PtCo双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于其对应的单金属催化剂。EXAFS测量证实了在AC上的PtCo键形成，这表明在AC上形成的PtCo键导致了观察到的高氢化活性。
