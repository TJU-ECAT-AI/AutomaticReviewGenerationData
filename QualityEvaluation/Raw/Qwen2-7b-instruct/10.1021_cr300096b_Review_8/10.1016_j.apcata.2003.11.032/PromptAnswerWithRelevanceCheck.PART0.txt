The DFT calculations and experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements can be correlated through an integrated theoretical and experimental approach. This approach allows researchers to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, when analyzing the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, correlations with experimental outcomes provide insights into the reactivity of these catalysts. For instance, the presence of sulfur compounds can lead to changes in the d-band center and binding energies, affecting the activity of Pt-3d catalysts. Promoting Pt-Pd catalysts with fluorine (F) can enhance their activity in the presence of sulfur, as evidenced by higher activity compared to unpromoted catalysts. Moreover, EXAFS analysis reveals that the addition of F helps maintain the PtPd alloy structure, preventing the formation of PtS bonds upon exposure to sulfur compounds. This information can guide the development of more robust and selective Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

通过将第一原理计算和诸如TPD测量等实验技术的观察结果相结合，可以建立理论和实验方法的整合途径。这种整合方法能够预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂系统。具体而言，在分析包含C═C键的各种分子在Pt-3d催化剂表面的d带中心和吸附剂结合能时，与实验结果的相关性提供了这些催化剂反应性的见解。例如，硫化合物的存在可能会导致d带中心和结合能的变化，影响Pt-3d催化剂的活性。促进Pt-Pd催化剂中的氟（F）可以提高其在硫化合物存在的条件下的活性，因为与未促进的催化剂相比，促进的催化剂具有更高的活性。此外，EXAFS分析表明，添加F有助于保持PtPd合金结构，防止暴露于硫化合物时形成PtS键。这些信息可以指导开发更强大且选择性更高的Pt-3d催化剂用于氢化反应。

[1] "Site competition is one of the most determinant phenomena that govern the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used. For example, the conversion of tetralin to decalin can only occur when most of the higher aromatics (phenanthrene or naphthalene) have been removed. Similarly, the conversion of cis- to trans-decalin is also affected by site competition with tetralin. Likewise, the sequential hydrogenation of the hydrophenanthrenes also shows the effects of site competition, with preferential reaction of the higher aromatic compounds."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document highlights that site competition plays a crucial role in controlling the hydrogenation rates of noble metal catalysts when dealing with a combined feed of polynuclear aromatic compounds. This competition is evident in several aspects, such as the conversion of tetralin to decalin, the transformation of cis-decalin to trans-decalin, and the sequential hydrogenation of hydrophenanthrenes. Specifically, the higher aromatic compounds have a preference for reacting over the hydrogenated compounds, influencing the selectivity and activity of the catalysts.

文档指出，在使用多种多核芳香族化合物混合物作为催化剂时，位点竞争是决定氢化速率的关键现象。这种竞争在多个方面体现，例如四氢化萘转化为十氢化萘、顺式十氢化萘转化为反式十氢化萘以及氢化酚烷衍生物的顺序氢化过程。具体而言，更高芳香族化合物更倾向于与已氢化的化合物反应，影响催化剂的选择性和活性。

[1] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts. The inhibition by sulfur strongly depended on the conversion of the sulfur compound. At low conversions, the inhibition by sulfur was reversible, but at high conversions, the poisoning was irreversible."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document states that when sulfur compounds are present, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with fluorine (F) exhibit higher activity compared to their unpromoted counterparts. The impact of sulfur poisoning on these catalysts is highly dependent on the conversion of the sulfur compound. At lower conversion levels, sulfur poisoning is reversible, whereas at higher conversion levels, the poisoning becomes irreversible.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

文档表明，在存在硫化合物的情况下，添加氟（F）促进的铂-钯催化剂表现出比未促进的铂-钯催化剂更高的活性。硫对这些催化剂的影响强烈依赖于硫化合物的转化率。在较低的转化率下，硫中毒是可逆的，但在较高的转化率下，中毒变得不可逆。

[1] "The Fourier transforms for the different fresh and spent catalysts show very little change after reaction under sulfur, while the other two were greatly affected. The fitting of the data clearly demonstrates that on the spent monometallic Pt/Al2O3 and unfluorinated Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts PtS bonds are formed, while no significant contribution of PtS bonds is apparent for the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Fourier transforms of the fresh and spent catalysts reveal minimal alterations following reaction in the presence of sulfur. In contrast, the other catalyst types show significant impacts. The analysis clearly indicates that on the spent monometallic Pt/Al2O3 and unfluorinated Pt-Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, PtS bonds are formed, whereas there is no notable presence of PtS bonds on the F-containing Pd-Pt catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
Fourier变换显示，在硫存在的条件下，新鲜和使用过的催化剂的差异很小。相比之下，其他催化剂类型显示出显著的影响。分析清楚地表明，在使用过的单金属Pt/Al2O3和未氟化的Pt-Pd/Al2O3催化剂上形成了PtS键，而在含氟的Pd-Pt催化剂上没有明显出现PtS键。

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document emphasizes that site competition is a pivotal factor that influences the hydrogenation rates of noble metal catalysts when processing a combined feed of polynuclear aromatic compounds. For instance, the conversion of tetralin to decalin is feasible only after the majority of the higher aromatic compounds (phenanthrene or naphthalene) have been processed. Analogously, the transformation of cis-decalin to trans-decalin is also impacted by competition for active sites with tetralin. Furthermore, the sequential hydrogenation of hydrophenanthrenes demonstrates the effects of site competition, with a preference for higher aromatic compounds in the reaction sequence.

The document underscores that site competition is a key factor that shapes the hydrogenation rates of noble metal catalysts when processing a combined feed of polynuclear aromatic compounds. Specifically, the conversion of tetralin to decalin is contingent upon the removal of most of the higher aromatic compounds (such as phenanthrene or naphthalene). Similarly, the transformation of cis-decalin to trans-decalin is influenced by competition for active sites with tetralin. Moreover, the sequential hydrogenation of hydrophenanthrenes illustrates the impact of site competition, with a preference for higher aromatic compounds in the reaction sequence.
