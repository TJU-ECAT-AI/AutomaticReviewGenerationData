[1] "Site competition is one of the most determinant phenomena that govern the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[3] "EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions. By contrast, when F was present on the catalyst, the PdPt alloy was not disrupted and PtS bonds were not formed."

The DFT calculations and experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements can be correlated through an integrated theoretical and experimental approach. This approach allows researchers to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, when analyzing the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts, correlations with experimental outcomes provide insights into the reactivity of these catalysts. For instance, the presence of sulfur compounds can lead to changes in the d-band center and binding energies, affecting the activity of Pt-3d catalysts. Promoting Pt-Pd catalysts with fluorine (F) can enhance their activity in the presence of sulfur, as evidenced by higher activity compared to unpromoted catalysts. Moreover, EXAFS analysis reveals that the addition of F helps maintain the PtPd alloy structure, preventing the formation of PtS bonds upon exposure to sulfur compounds. This information can guide the development of more robust and selective Pt-3d catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

通过将第一原理计算和诸如TPD测量等实验技术的观察结果相结合，可以建立理论和实验方法的整合途径。这种整合方法能够预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化剂系统。具体而言，在分析包含C═C键的各种分子在Pt-3d催化剂表面的d带中心和吸附剂结合能时，与实验结果的相关性提供了这些催化剂反应性的见解。例如，硫化合物的存在可能会导致d带中心和结合能的变化，影响Pt-3d催化剂的活性。促进Pt-Pd催化剂中的氟（F）可以提高其在硫化合物存在的条件下的活性，因为与未促进的催化剂相比，促进的催化剂具有更高的活性。此外，EXAFS分析表明，添加F有助于保持PtPd合金结构，防止暴露于硫化合物时形成PtS键。这些信息可以指导开发更强大且选择性更高的Pt-3d催化剂用于氢化反应。
