1. When the feed contained 1000 ppm sulfur, the F-promoted catalyst showed significantly higher activity compared to the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst.
2. Under conditions of low space velocity and high conversion of dibenzothiophene, the poisoning by sulfur was reversible, but it became irreversible under conditions of low space velocity and high dibenzothiophene conversion.
3. On the F-containing catalyst, no PtS bonds were formed, unlike on the unpromoted catalysts where clear PtS bonds were observed.

1. 当饲料中硫含量为1000 ppm时，含氟催化剂的活性显著高于未促进的铂钯催化剂。
2. 在低空间速度和高二苯并噻吩转化率下，硫的抑制是可逆的。但在低空间速度和高二苯并噻吩转化率下，中毒变得不可逆。
3. 在含氟催化剂上，没有形成PtS键，而未处理的催化剂上清楚地观察到了PtS键。
