[1] "Site competition is one of the most determinant phenomena that govern the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[3] "EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions."

1. Site competition significantly influences the hydrogenation rates of noble metal catalysts when using a combined polynuclear aromatic feed. 

2. In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts enhanced with F display greater activity compared to their unpromoted counterparts.

3. The analysis through EXAFS revealed that when the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst is exposed to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversion levels, the PtPd alloy is disrupted and PtS bonds form.

1. 竞争位点是决定性现象，影响了使用多核芳香族混合物作为进料时贵金属催化剂的氢化速率。

2. 在硫化合物存在的情况下，添加F增强的Pt-Pd催化剂表现出比未增强的Pt-Pd催化剂更高的活性。

3. EXAFS分析显示，当未增强的Pt-Pd催化剂暴露于1000 ppm DBT并在高转化率下反应时，PtPd合金被破坏，并形成PtS键。
