[1] "Site competition is one of the most determinant phenomena that govern the hydrogenation rates on noble metal catalysts when a combined polynuclear aromatic feed is used."
[2] "In the presence of sulfur compounds, Pt-Pd catalysts promoted with F showed higher activity than unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst."
[3] "EXAFS analysis showed that the PtPd alloy was disrupted and PtS bonds were formed when exposing the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversions."

1. Site competition plays a crucial role in determining the hydrogenation rates of noble metal catalysts when a mixed polynuclear aromatic feed is used.
2. Promoting Pt-Pd catalysts with F leads to higher activity in the presence of sulfur compounds compared to unpromoted Pt-Pd catalysts.
3. Exposure of the unpromoted Pt-Pd catalyst to 1000 ppm DBT at high conversion levels results in disruption of the PtPd alloy and formation of PtS bonds.

1. 竞争位点在使用混合多核芳香族进料时对贵金属催化剂的氢化速率起着决定性作用。
2. 掺杂F的Pt-Pd催化剂在硫化合物的存在下表现出更高的活性，与未掺杂的Pt-Pd催化剂相比。
3. 将未掺杂的Pt-Pd催化剂暴露于1000 ppm DBT和高转化率条件下会导致Pt-Pd合金的破坏以及形成PtS键。
