[1] "EC NMR has emerged as an excellent technique to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of catalytic nanoparticles."
[2] "The interaction of Pd with Pt leads to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites, which reduces the strength of CO and, most likely, OH adsorption."
[3] "We also propose that the decrease in the Ef-LDOS of surface Pd atoms is responsible for preventing the deactivation of Pd atoms in Pt/Pd catalysts by chemisorbed OH groups."

The document discusses how the interaction between palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) leads to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites. This reduction weakens the adsorption of CO and possibly OH molecules, which in turn prevents the deactivation of Pd atoms in Pt/Pd catalysts. The decrease in Ef-LDOS is believed to be responsible for the improved catalytic performance of Pt/Pd in formic acid oxidation.

文献讨论了钯(Pd)与铂(Pt)之间的相互作用导致Pd位点处费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS）的降低。这种降低削弱了CO和可能的OH分子的吸附，从而防止了Pd原子在Pt/Pd催化剂中的失活。认为Ef-LDOS的减少是Pd位点上化学吸附的OH组分导致Pd催化剂失活的减轻的原因，这提高了Pt/Pd在甲醛氧化中的催化性能。
