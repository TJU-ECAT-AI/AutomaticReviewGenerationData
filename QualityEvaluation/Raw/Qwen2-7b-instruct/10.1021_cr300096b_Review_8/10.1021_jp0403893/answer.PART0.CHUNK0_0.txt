[1] "EC NMR has emerged as an excellent technique to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of catalytic nanoparticles."
[2] "We also propose that the decrease in the Ef-LDOS of surface Pd atoms is responsible for preventing the deactivation of Pd atoms in Pt/Pd catalysts by chemisorbed OH groups."
[3] "When the current results are compared with those of previous 13CO NMR studies of the Pt/Ru system,18 we conclude that the effect of Pd on Pt is opposite to that seen with Ru, therefore a direct electronic mechanism (either a charge transfer or a hybridization effect) is responsible for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms."

These findings indicate that the interaction between Pd and Pt modifies the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, leading to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites. This reduction in Ef-LDOS decreases the strength of CO and OH adsorption, enhancing the catalytic performance of Pt/Pd in formic acid oxidation. Additionally, the electronic alteration caused by the addition of Pd to Pt appears to be the opposite effect compared to that observed with Ru, suggesting a direct electronic mechanism, either involving charge transfer or hybridization, as the cause for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms.

这些结果表明，Pd与Pt之间的相互作用修改了Pt原子的电子结构，导致Pd位点的费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS）减少。Ef-LDOS的降低减弱了CO和OH吸附，从而提高了Pt/Pd在甲醛氧化中的催化性能。此外，与Ru相比，Pd对Pt的影响效果相反，这表明直接的电子机制，可能涉及电荷转移或杂化效应，是导致Pt原子Ef-LDOS变化的原因。
