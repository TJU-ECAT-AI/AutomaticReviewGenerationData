[1] "We report the results of electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (EC NMR) and electrochemical measurements of CO chemisorbed onto these Pt/Pd catalysts, to probe the nature of the CO chemisorption bond, as well as the motional behavior of adsorbed CO."
[2] "The 13C NMR spectra are broad and can be deconvoluted into two peaks, assigned to CO adsorbed on Pt and Pd sites."
[3] "From the temperature dependence of the spinlattice relaxation rates, we conclude that CO chemisorbed on Pd undergoes fast diffusion."
[4] "A two-band model analysis of the NMR data shows that the 5σ orbital of CO makes a significant contribution to the chemisorption bond of CO on Pd."
[5] "The interaction of Pd with Pt leads to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites, which reduces the strength of CO and, most likely, OH adsorption."
[6] "The present EC NMR results show that the interaction of Pd with Pt substrate atoms reduces the Ef-LDOS on Pd, and this could lead to a weakening of OH adsorption on Pd, making Pt/Pd a better catalyst for formic acid oxidation than pure Pd."
[7] "When the current results are compared with those of previous 13CO NMR studies of the Pt/Ru system,18 we conclude that the effect of Pd on Pt is opposite to that seen with Ru, therefore a direct electronic mechanism (either a charge transfer or a hybridization effect) is responsible for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms."

The study investigated the bonding and dynamics of CO molecules adsorbed onto Pt/Pd catalysts. EC NMR and electrochemical measurements revealed that CO chemisorbs strongly onto Pt sites, whereas the adsorption strength on Pd sites is much lower compared to pure Pd. This indicates that CO does not deactivate the Pd part of the Pt/Pd catalyst for formic acid oxidation. The interaction of Pd with Pt substrate atoms reduces the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) on Pd, which weakens OH adsorption on Pd, making Pt/Pd a better catalyst for formic acid oxidation than pure Pd. The effect of Pd on Pt is opposite to that seen with Ru, suggesting a direct electronic mechanism, possibly involving charge transfer or hybridization, for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms.

本研究探讨了吸附在Pt/Pd催化剂上的CO分子的键合和动力学特性。电化学核磁共振（EC NMR）和电化学测量显示，CO在Pt位点的吸附强度很大，而在Pd位点的吸附强度远低于纯Pd。这表明CO不会使Pd部分的Pt/Pd催化剂在对甲酸氧化反应中失活。Pd与Pt基体原子的相互作用降低了Pd表面的费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS），从而减弱了OH在Pd上的吸附，使得Pt/Pd催化剂比纯Pd更适合作为甲酸氧化催化剂。Pd对Pt的影响与Ru不同，这表明Pd对Pt的作用涉及直接的电子机制，可能是电荷转移或杂化效应，导致Pt原子的Ef-LDOS发生变化。
