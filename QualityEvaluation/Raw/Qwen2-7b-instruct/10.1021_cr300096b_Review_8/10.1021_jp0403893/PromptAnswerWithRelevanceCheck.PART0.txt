How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "EC NMR has emerged as an excellent technique to elucidate the structural and electronic properties of catalytic nanoparticles."
[2] "We also propose that the decrease in the Ef-LDOS of surface Pd atoms is responsible for preventing the deactivation of Pd atoms in Pt/Pd catalysts by chemisorbed OH groups."
[3] "When the current results are compared with those of previous 13CO NMR studies of the Pt/Ru system,18 we conclude that the effect of Pd on Pt is opposite to that seen with Ru, therefore a direct electronic mechanism (either a charge transfer or a hybridization effect) is responsible for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
These findings indicate that the interaction between Pd and Pt modifies the electronic structure of the Pt atoms, leading to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites. This reduction in Ef-LDOS decreases the strength of CO and OH adsorption, enhancing the catalytic performance of Pt/Pd in formic acid oxidation. Additionally, the electronic alteration caused by the addition of Pd to Pt appears to be the opposite effect compared to that observed with Ru, suggesting a direct electronic mechanism, either involving charge transfer or hybridization, as the cause for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms.

这些结果表明，Pd与Pt之间的相互作用修改了Pt原子的电子结构，导致Pd位点的费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS）减少。Ef-LDOS的降低减弱了CO和OH吸附，从而提高了Pt/Pd在甲醛氧化中的催化性能。此外，与Ru相比，Pd对Pt的影响效果相反，这表明直接的电子机制，可能涉及电荷转移或杂化效应，是导致Pt原子Ef-LDOS变化的原因。

The document discusses how the interaction between palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) leads to a reduction in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites. This reduction weakens the adsorption of CO and possibly OH molecules, which in turn prevents the deactivation of Pd atoms in Pt/Pd catalysts. The decrease in Ef-LDOS is believed to be responsible for the improved catalytic performance of Pt/Pd in formic acid oxidation.

文献讨论了钯(Pd)与铂(Pt)之间的相互作用导致Pd位点处费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS）的降低。这种降低削弱了CO和可能的OH分子的吸附，从而防止了Pd原子在Pt/Pd催化剂中的失活。认为Ef-LDOS的减少是Pd位点上化学吸附的OH组分导致Pd催化剂失活的减轻的原因，这提高了Pt/Pd在甲醛氧化中的催化性能。

The study investigated the bonding and dynamics of CO molecules adsorbed onto Pt/Pd catalysts. EC NMR and electrochemical measurements revealed that CO chemisorbs strongly onto Pt sites, whereas the adsorption strength on Pd sites is much lower compared to pure Pd. This indicates that CO does not deactivate the Pd part of the Pt/Pd catalyst for formic acid oxidation. The interaction of Pd with Pt substrate atoms reduces the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) on Pd, which weakens OH adsorption on Pd, making Pt/Pd a better catalyst for formic acid oxidation than pure Pd. The effect of Pd on Pt is opposite to that seen with Ru, suggesting a direct electronic mechanism, possibly involving charge transfer or hybridization, for the changes in Ef-LDOS of Pt atoms.

本研究探讨了吸附在Pt/Pd催化剂上的CO分子的键合和动力学特性。电化学核磁共振（EC NMR）和电化学测量显示，CO在Pt位点的吸附强度很大，而在Pd位点的吸附强度远低于纯Pd。这表明CO不会使Pd部分的Pt/Pd催化剂在对甲酸氧化反应中失活。Pd与Pt基体原子的相互作用降低了Pd表面的费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS），从而减弱了OH在Pd上的吸附，使得Pt/Pd催化剂比纯Pd更适合作为甲酸氧化催化剂。Pd对Pt的影响与Ru不同，这表明Pd对Pt的作用涉及直接的电子机制，可能是电荷转移或杂化效应，导致Pt原子的Ef-LDOS发生变化。

The research conducted in the literature focuses on the bonding and motional aspects of CO adsorbed on the surface of Pt/Pd catalysts. The electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (EC NMR) and electrochemical measurements were employed to investigate the nature of the CO chemisorption bond and the movement of adsorbed CO. The 13C NMR spectra demonstrated broad patterns that could be divided into two peaks, indicating CO adsorption on Pt and Pd sites. The study revealed that CO chemisorbed on Pd undergoes rapid diffusion. The interaction between Pd and Pt resulted in a decrease in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites, leading to a reduction in the strength of CO and OH adsorption. The EC NMR technique was recognized as an effective tool for understanding the structural and electronic properties of catalytic nanoparticles. The findings suggested that the modification of Pt surfaces through the spontaneous deposition of Pd improves the catalytic performance of Pt/Pd towards formic acid oxidation by reducing the strength of CO and OH adsorption.

文献中的研究重点在于探究CO吸附在Pt/Pd催化剂表面的键合和动力学特性。通过电化学核磁共振（EC NMR）和电化学测量，研究了CO化学吸附键的性质以及吸附CO的运动情况。13C NMR谱显示为宽泛模式，并可分解为两个峰，分别对应于Pt和Pd位点上的CO吸附。研究发现，Pd位点上的CO快速扩散。Pd与Pt之间的相互作用导致Pd位点的费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS）减少，进而减弱了CO和OH吸附。电化学核磁共振技术被证明是理解催化纳米颗粒结构和电子特性的有效工具。研究结果表明，通过自发沉积Pd修改Pt表面，Pt/Pd复合催化剂对甲酸氧化表现出更优秀的催化性能，这主要是由于减弱了CO和OH吸附。
