The research conducted in the literature focuses on the bonding and motional aspects of CO adsorbed on the surface of Pt/Pd catalysts. The electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (EC NMR) and electrochemical measurements were employed to investigate the nature of the CO chemisorption bond and the movement of adsorbed CO. The 13C NMR spectra demonstrated broad patterns that could be divided into two peaks, indicating CO adsorption on Pt and Pd sites. The study revealed that CO chemisorbed on Pd undergoes rapid diffusion. The interaction between Pd and Pt resulted in a decrease in the Fermi level local density of states (Ef-LDOS) at the Pd sites, leading to a reduction in the strength of CO and OH adsorption. The EC NMR technique was recognized as an effective tool for understanding the structural and electronic properties of catalytic nanoparticles. The findings suggested that the modification of Pt surfaces through the spontaneous deposition of Pd improves the catalytic performance of Pt/Pd towards formic acid oxidation by reducing the strength of CO and OH adsorption.

文献中的研究重点在于探究CO吸附在Pt/Pd催化剂表面的键合和动力学特性。通过电化学核磁共振（EC NMR）和电化学测量，研究了CO化学吸附键的性质以及吸附CO的运动情况。13C NMR谱显示为宽泛模式，并可分解为两个峰，分别对应于Pt和Pd位点上的CO吸附。研究发现，Pd位点上的CO快速扩散。Pd与Pt之间的相互作用导致Pd位点的费米能级局部密度态（Ef-LDOS）减少，进而减弱了CO和OH吸附。电化学核磁共振技术被证明是理解催化纳米颗粒结构和电子特性的有效工具。研究结果表明，通过自发沉积Pd修改Pt表面，Pt/Pd复合催化剂对甲酸氧化表现出更优秀的催化性能，这主要是由于减弱了CO和OH吸附。
