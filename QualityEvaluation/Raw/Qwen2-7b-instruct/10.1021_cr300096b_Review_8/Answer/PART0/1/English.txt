This study focuses on the investigation of supported PtCu and PdAu bimetallic nanoparticles utilizing in-situ X-ray tools. The research involves DFT calculations of the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. The goal is to correlate these theoretical findings with experimental observations obtained through techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated approach aims to predict the hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
