The focus has been on the utilization of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for C═C bond-containing molecules, including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics, when they interact with Pt-3d catalysts. This theoretical framework is then correlated with experimental observations, particularly those obtained through techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), to predict the hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

        The integration of theoretical and experimental approaches allows for a predictive model that enhances our understanding of catalyst performance and guides the development of advanced materials. By correlating DFT calculations with TPD measurements, researchers can gain insights into the electronic properties of the catalysts and the energetics of the adsorption process, which are crucial for optimizing the hydrogenation efficiency.

        The detailed analysis reveals that the structure of the catalyst plays a significant role in determining its activity. Specifically, the interaction between the adsorbate molecule and the catalyst surface is influenced by factors such as the nature of the molecule, the presence of metal atoms, and the coordination geometry.
