        A comprehensive analysis of the theoretical and experimental correlation between DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts has been conducted. This study, referenced from \[10.1021/jp103675n\], integrates insights from the Journal of Physical Chemistry C, focusing on the utilization of in-situ X-ray tools for the examination of supported PtCu and PdAu bimetallic nanoparticles. DFT calculations, specifically targeting the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies, were performed on a range of molecules including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics on Pt-3d catalysts. The aim was to establish correlations between these theoretical predictions and experimental observations, notably through TPD measurements, to forecast hydrogenation activity and thereby inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

        This integrated theoretical and experimental approach provides a robust foundation for understanding the structure-activity relationships in Pt-3d catalysts, enabling precise predictions of hydrogenation efficiency. By correlating the calculated surface properties with experimental outcomes, researchers can tailor catalysts to optimize hydrogenation processes, which is crucial for the advancement of sustainable chemical synthesis methods.
