        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements discussed in this study, the field of catalysis stands poised to embrace new horizons. The successful coupling of DFT calculations with experimental techniques like TPD measurements opens avenues for predicting catalyst activity and stability under operational conditions. Future research might delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms underlying the reactivity of C═C bonds, focusing on the role of surface defects and atomic arrangements. Moreover, there is potential to expand the scope of DFT calculations to include a broader range of metal-support interactions and to incorporate machine learning algorithms for more accurate prediction models. The exploration of novel bimetallic and multimetallic systems could also offer enhanced selectivity and activity towards desired products in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, thus contributing to the development of more sustainable and efficient industrial processes.
