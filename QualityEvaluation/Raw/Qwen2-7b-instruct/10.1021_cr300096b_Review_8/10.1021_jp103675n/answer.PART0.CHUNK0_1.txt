The study focused on the impact of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. In-situ X-ray tools were employed to examine supported PtCu and PdAu bimetallic nanoparticles. The experimental observations encompassed techniques like Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) measurements. The objective was to establish a correlation between the DFT calculations and experimental findings. This combined theoretical and experimental methodology sought to forecast hydrogenation activity and guide the development of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
