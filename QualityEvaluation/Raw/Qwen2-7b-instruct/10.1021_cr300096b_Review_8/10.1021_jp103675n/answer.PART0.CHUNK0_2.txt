The study investigates supported PtCu and PdAu bimetallic nanoparticles using in-situ X-ray tools. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were conducted for the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies of different C═C bond-containing molecules, such as linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics. These calculations were correlated with experimental observations from techniques such as Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and guides the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
