"The catalytic activity of benzene hydrogenation over these catalysts in a flow reactor is compared in Figure 1."
"The apparent activation barriers for benzene hydrogenation are estimated by performing catalytic studies at different temperatures, as shown in the Arrhenius plots for several catalysts in Figure S3."
"In our previous studies of the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the hydrogenation activity has been correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on several Pt-based bimetallic systems."

The document correlates the hydrogenation activity of benzene with the binding energies of hydrogen and benzene on Co-based bimetallic catalysts through experimental and theoretical methods. It demonstrates that the hydrogenation activity follows the trend of PtCo > PdCo > RuCo. This correlation is established by comparing the activity, apparent activation barriers, and rate constants of various catalysts. The document also mentions previous studies where the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene was correlated with the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt-based bimetallic systems.

文献通过实验和理论方法将苯氢化活性与钴基双金属催化剂上的氢和苯的结合能相关联。它表明氢化活性遵循PtCo > PdCo > RuCo的趋势。这种相关性通过比较各种催化剂的活性、表观活化能垒和速率常数来建立。文献还提到以前的研究，其中将环己烯的氢化活性与Pt基双金属系统上的原子氢和环己烯的结合能相关联。
