[1] "The hydrogenation of benzene is of significant importance in the petroleum industry and for environmental protection."
[2] "In our previous work, PtCo and PtNi bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts supported on g-Al2O3 were compared and the results suggested that Co-based bimetallic catalysts possessed higher activity than Ni-based catalysts for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures."
[3] "The catalytic activities for the seven catalysts show the following trend: PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPt>CoRuPd."
[4] "The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits much higher activity than the other Co-based catalysts."
[5] "The different catalytic activities are illustrated in the rate of benzene consumption (Figure 2) and the production of cyclohexane (Figure S4)."

The document highlights the importance of benzene hydrogenation in the petroleum industry and environmental protection. It shows that Co-based bimetallic catalysts, specifically PtCo@PdCo, exhibit significantly higher activity for benzene hydrogenation compared to other catalysts, including CoRuPd, at low temperatures. This is evidenced by the rate of benzene consumption and the production of cyclohexane, with PtCo bimetallic catalysts demonstrating notably higher activity than other Co-based catalysts.

文献强调了苯氢化在石油工业和环境保护中的重要性。它表明，钴基双金属催化剂，特别是PtCo@PdCo，在低温下对苯氢化表现出显著更高的活性，与包括CoRuPd在内的其他催化剂相比。这通过苯消耗速率和环己烷产量的图例得到了证实，显示PtCo双金属催化剂的活性明显高于其他钴基催化剂。
