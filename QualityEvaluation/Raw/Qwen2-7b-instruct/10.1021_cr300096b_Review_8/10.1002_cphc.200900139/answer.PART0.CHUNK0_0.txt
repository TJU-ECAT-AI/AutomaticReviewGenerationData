The hydrogenation of benzene is compared over silica-supported PtCo, PdCo, RuCo bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts using both flow and batch reactors.
The catalytic activities for the seven catalysts show the following trend: PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPt>CoRuPd.
The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits the lowest activation barrier of 21.2 kJmol−1, with the apparent activation barriers following the trend of PtCo!PdCo<RuCoPt<Co.
The different catalytic activities are illustrated in the rate of benzene consumption (Figure 2) and the production of cyclohexane (Figure S4). The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits much higher activity than the other Co-based catalysts.
In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP).

The study found that the PtCo bimetallic catalyst had higher activity than the PdCo and RuCo catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene. This was also reflected in lower activation barriers for the PtCo catalyst, indicating its efficiency in this reaction. The rate of benzene consumption and the production of cyclohexane further confirmed the superior performance of the PtCo bimetallic catalyst. DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces provided insights into the correlation between binding energies and hydrogenation activity, suggesting potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations.

研究发现，PtCo双金属催化剂在苯加氢反应中的活性高于PdCo和RuCo催化剂。这也在活化能壁垒较低的PtCo催化剂中得到了反映，表明其在该反应中的高效性。苯消耗速率和环己烷生成量进一步证实了PtCo双金属催化剂的优越性能。通过计算双金属表面的氢和苯结合能，使用Vienna ab initio模拟包（VASP）进行的DFT计算提供了结合能与加氢活性之间相关性的见解，暗示基于DFT计算预测和选择双金属催化剂的可能性。
