How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

The hydrogenation of benzene is compared over silica-supported PtCo, PdCo, RuCo bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts using both flow and batch reactors.
The catalytic activities for the seven catalysts show the following trend: PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPt>CoRuPd.
The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits the lowest activation barrier of 21.2 kJmol−1, with the apparent activation barriers following the trend of PtCo!PdCo<RuCoPt<Co.
The different catalytic activities are illustrated in the rate of benzene consumption (Figure 2) and the production of cyclohexane (Figure S4). The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits much higher activity than the other Co-based catalysts.
In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP).

The study found that the PtCo bimetallic catalyst had higher activity than the PdCo and RuCo catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzene. This was also reflected in lower activation barriers for the PtCo catalyst, indicating its efficiency in this reaction. The rate of benzene consumption and the production of cyclohexane further confirmed the superior performance of the PtCo bimetallic catalyst. DFT calculations of hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the bimetallic surfaces provided insights into the correlation between binding energies and hydrogenation activity, suggesting potential opportunities to predict and select bimetallic catalysts based on DFT calculations.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements through comparing the catalytic activities of different catalysts. Specifically, the study found that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit the highest activity for benzene hydrogenation, followed by PdCo and RuCo bimetallic catalysts, respectively. This trend is consistent with the correlation between the binding energies of hydrogen and benzene on the bimetallic surfaces, which suggests that the hydrogenation activity can be predicted based on DFT calculations.
