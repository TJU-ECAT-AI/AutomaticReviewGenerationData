The document explores the correlation between the hydrogenation activity of benzene and the binding energies of hydrogen and benzene on Co-based bimetallic catalysts. It demonstrates that the PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits the lowest activation barrier for benzene hydrogenation, indicating higher activity compared to other Co-based catalysts. The study employs both experimental and theoretical methods, including density functional (DFT) modeling, to correlate the binding energies with the hydrogenation activity. This integrated approach allows for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and the selection of more efficient catalysts based on DFT calculations.
