[1] "In our previous work, PtCo and PtNi bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts supported on g-Al2O3 were compared and the results suggested that Co-based bimetallic catalysts possessed higher activity than Ni-based catalysts for benzene hydrogenation at low temperatures."
[2] "The hydrogenation of benzene is compared over silica-supported PtCo, PdCo, RuCo bimetallic and the corresponding monometallic catalysts using both flow and batch reactors."
[3] "The catalytic activities for the seven catalysts show the following trend: PtCo@PdCo>RuCoPt>CoRuPd."
[4] "The PtCo bimetallic catalyst exhibits much higher activity than the other Co-based catalysts."
[5] "In order to determine whether such correlation exists for the hydrogenation of benzene, DFT was used to calculate the hydrogen and benzene binding energies on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces using Vienna ab initio simulations package (VASP)."
[6] "The values are compared in Table 1."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements through comparing the catalytic activities of different catalysts. Specifically, the study found that the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit the highest activity for benzene hydrogenation, followed by PdCo and RuCo bimetallic catalysts, respectively. This trend is consistent with the correlation between the binding energies of hydrogen and benzene on the bimetallic surfaces, which suggests that the hydrogenation activity can be predicted based on DFT calculations.

对Pt-3d催化剂上的各种含C═C键分子的表面d带中心和吸附物结合能进行的DFT计算与通过TPD测量等技术得到的实验观察结果相关联，通过比较不同催化剂的催化活性。具体来说，研究发现PtCo双金属催化剂在苯加氢反应中的活性最高，其次是PdCo和RuCo双金属催化剂，分别遵循这种趋势。这一趋势与双金属表面氢和苯的结合能之间的相关性一致，表明可以根据DFT计算预测氢化活性。
