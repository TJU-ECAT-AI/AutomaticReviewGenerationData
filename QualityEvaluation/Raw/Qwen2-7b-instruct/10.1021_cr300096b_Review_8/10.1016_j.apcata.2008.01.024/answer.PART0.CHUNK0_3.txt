The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence.
The bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts showed significantly higher activity toward the disproportionation of cyclohexene than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3.
For catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the Pt-first catalyst, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, showed higher activity than the Ni-first catalyst, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3.
The effect of impregnation sequence was not as significant for catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1.
In addition, kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 as compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Pt LIII edge indicated that PtNi bimetallic bonds were formed in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3.
The PtNi bonds were formed for the 1/1 ratio catalysts with both impregnation sequences.

Answer: The impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the γ-Al2O3 support for a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1 (5 wt.% Pt, 0.5 wt.% Ni). When Pt is impregnated first, a significantly higher activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and a higher selectivity for the acetylene hydrogenation were found when compared with the one where Ni is impregnated first, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. EXAFS measurements and data analysis show the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the former but not on the latter catalyst. One possible explanation of the effect of impregnation sequence is the diffusion of Ni into the cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support when the Ni2+ ion is deposited first.

对于3/1（5wt.%Pt，0.5wt.%Ni）的Pt/Ni原子比，浸渍顺序对γ-Al2O3支持上的PtNi双金属键的形成有显著影响。当首先浸渍Pt时，在与首先浸渍Ni相比的情况下，1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂显示出更高程度的环己烯歧化反应活性和乙炔加氢选择性。EXAFS测量和数据分析表明前者形成了PtNi双金属键，而后者则没有。可能的解释是当首先沉积Ni2+离子时，Ni离子扩散到γ-Al2O3的空腔中。
