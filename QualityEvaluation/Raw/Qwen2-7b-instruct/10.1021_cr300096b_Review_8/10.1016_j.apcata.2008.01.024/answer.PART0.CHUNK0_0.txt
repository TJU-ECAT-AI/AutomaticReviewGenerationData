<p>More recently, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic surfaces also plays a significant role in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties [6] ,[8] ,[11] ,[12] ,[17] ,[21] .</p>
<p>For example, our group has shown that for a Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface with a Ni coverage at one monolayer (ML), Ni atoms can reside either on the surface to produce a Ni-terminated NiPt(1 1 1) surface or in the subsurface region to form a Pt-terminated PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure [12] .</p>
<p>The ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is characterized by unique chemical properties that are distinctively different from Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1), or the surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structure [12] ,[18] ,[21] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] .</p>
<p>In particular, the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure bonds more weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes as compared to NiPtPt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.</p>
<p>Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center).</p>
<p>Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds [18] ,[19] ,[21] .</p>
<p>Furthermore, this bimetallic structure is thermodynamically stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen [26] , while the subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface in the presence of adsorbed oxygen [16] .</p>
<p>The activation barrier for the transformation of the subsurface to surface structures is relatively low, 15 kcal/mol, indicating that the segregation and diffusion of Ni atoms can potentially occur during calcination and reduction procedures and under reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts.</p>
<p>A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) [21] and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1) [18] , with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath.</p>
<p>In contrast, the disproportionation pathway did not occur on Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1), or the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface structure under the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions.</p>
<p>Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence.</p>
<p>The second probe reaction is the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene, which is an important industrial process and has been the subject of many studies [27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ,[32] ,[33] ,[34] ,[35] .</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that the formation of bimetallic alloys often modifies the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene, as demonstrated in the systematic investigations over Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu, and Pd-Au supported catalysts [36] ,[37] ,[38] .</p>
<p>Therefore, the hydrogenation of acetylene should be a useful probe reaction to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the hydrogenation selectivity of supported Pt/Ni catalysts.</p>

The document discusses the impact of the impregnation sequence on the formation of Pt/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3, specifically focusing on the effect on the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene. The study demonstrates that the impregnation sequence significantly affects the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, leading to different catalytic behavior for both reactions. At low Ni loadings, the sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which correlates with changes in catalytic activity and selectivity. The results highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between impregnation sequence, bimetallic bonding, and catalytic performance in designing more efficient Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.

文献讨论了浸渍顺序对γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属纳米颗粒形成的影响，特别是对环己烯的自氢化和乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化。研究表明，浸渍顺序显著影响PtNi双金属键的形成，导致两种反应的催化行为不同。在较低的Ni负载下，序列显著影响PtNi双金属键的形成，这与活性和选择性的变化相关。结果强调了理解浸渍顺序、双金属键合与催化性能之间关系的重要性，在设计更高效的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂时，这一点至关重要。
