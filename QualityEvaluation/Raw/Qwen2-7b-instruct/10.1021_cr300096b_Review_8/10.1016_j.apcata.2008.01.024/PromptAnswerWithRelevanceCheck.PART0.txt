<p>More recently, it has been demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic surfaces also plays a significant role in controlling their electronic and catalytic properties [6] ,[8] ,[11] ,[12] ,[17] ,[21] .</p>
<p>For example, our group has shown that for a Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface with a Ni coverage at one monolayer (ML), Ni atoms can reside either on the surface to produce a Ni-terminated NiPt(1 1 1) surface or in the subsurface region to form a Pt-terminated PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure [12] .</p>
<p>The ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is characterized by unique chemical properties that are distinctively different from Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1), or the surface NiPtPt(1 1 1) structure [12] ,[18] ,[21] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] .</p>
<p>In particular, the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure bonds more weakly to atomic hydrogen and alkenes as compared to NiPtPt(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.</p>
<p>Density function theory (DFT) modeling of these surfaces reveals that the modification of Pt(1 1 1) with subsurface Ni and other 3d transition metals at a monolayer coverage significantly alters the average energy of the surface Pt d-band (d-band center).</p>
<p>Subsequent theoretical and experimental studies show that the ML PtNiPt(1 1 1) structure is very active toward the hydrogenation of the CC bonds [18] ,[19] ,[21] .</p>
<p>Furthermore, this bimetallic structure is thermodynamically stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen [26] , while the subsurface Ni atoms segregate to the surface in the presence of adsorbed oxygen [16] .</p>
<p>The activation barrier for the transformation of the subsurface to surface structures is relatively low, 15 kcal/mol, indicating that the segregation and diffusion of Ni atoms can potentially occur during calcination and reduction procedures and under reaction conditions.</p>
<p>Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts.</p>
<p>A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) [21] and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1) [18] , with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath.</p>
<p>In contrast, the disproportionation pathway did not occur on Pt(1 1 1), Ni(1 1 1), or the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface structure under the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions.</p>
<p>Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence.</p>
<p>The second probe reaction is the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene, which is an important industrial process and has been the subject of many studies [27] ,[28] ,[29] ,[30] ,[31] ,[32] ,[33] ,[34] ,[35] .</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that the formation of bimetallic alloys often modifies the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene, as demonstrated in the systematic investigations over Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu, and Pd-Au supported catalysts [36] ,[37] ,[38] .</p>
<p>Therefore, the hydrogenation of acetylene should be a useful probe reaction to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the hydrogenation selectivity of supported Pt/Ni catalysts.</p>

The document discusses the impact of the impregnation sequence on the formation of Pt/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3, specifically focusing on the effect on the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene. The study demonstrates that the impregnation sequence significantly affects the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, leading to different catalytic behavior for both reactions. At low Ni loadings, the sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which correlates with changes in catalytic activity and selectivity. The results highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between impregnation sequence, bimetallic bonding, and catalytic performance in designing more efficient Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.

文献讨论了浸渍顺序对γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属纳米颗粒形成的影响，特别是对环己烯的自氢化和乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化。研究表明，浸渍顺序显著影响PtNi双金属键的形成，导致两种反应的催化行为不同。在较低的Ni负载下，序列显著影响PtNi双金属键的形成，这与活性和选择性的变化相关。结果强调了理解浸渍顺序、双金属键合与催化性能之间关系的重要性，在设计更高效的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂时，这一点至关重要。

1. Our group has utilized the disproportionation of cyclohexene as a method to assess the unique low-temperature hydrogenation capabilities of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. As an additional probe, the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene has been studied due to its industrial significance.

2. The catalysts in this study are denoted by specific combinations of Ni and Pt with γ-Al2O3, such as 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3, representing different ratios and impregnation sequences of the metals.

3. Over catalysts including 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3, the concentration of acetylene decreases during the reaction while ethane concentration increases, indicating the complete consumption of both acetylene and ethylene.

4. For 1/1 ratio catalysts, there's no significant difference in overall activity for cyclohexene disproportionation or estimated rate constants, regardless of the impregnation sequence.

5. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates a higher conversion rate for cyclohexene compared to 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.

6. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of ethylene than 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.

7. The formation of Ni aluminate (NiAl2O4) species might hinder the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds when Ni is impregnated first on the alumina support, due to the strong interaction between Ni and γ-Al2O3.

8. When Pt is impregnated first, the strong interaction of Ni with the support is reduced, facilitating the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, as observed in the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 我们小组通过研究环己烯的自我氢化反应，来比较铂/镍双金属表面和催化剂的独特低温氢化活性。作为另一个探针，我们研究了乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化，由于其工业重要性，这是许多研究的主题。

2. 在此研究中，催化剂被标记为特定的镍和铂与γ-Al2O3的组合，如1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3、1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3、1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3，代表不同的比例和金属的浸渍顺序。

3. 在包括1Pt/γ-Al2O3、1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3在内的催化剂上，乙炔浓度在反应期间降低，而乙烷浓度增加，表明乙炔和乙烯已被完全消耗。

4. 对于1/1比例的催化剂，无论浸渍顺序如何，对于环己烯的自分解或估计的速率常数，没有显著差异。

5. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的环己烯转化率比1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3或1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂高。

6. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂对乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化比1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3或1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂更高。

7. 当Ni首先浸渍到氧化铝支撑上时，可能形成NiAl2O4物种，这可能是由于Ni与γ-Al2O3之间的强烈相互作用。

8. 当首先浸渍Pt时，Ni与支撑的强烈相互作用被Pt前体或煅烧过程中形成的Pt氧化物所降低，从而促进了1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂中PtNi双金属键的形成。

The availability of both Ni and Pt outside the cavities would in turn facilitate the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds, consistent with the results in the current study.</p>

The disproportionation of cyclohexene serves as a probe reaction to evaluate the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. This activity is influenced by the impregnation sequence, particularly for catalysts with a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1. For catalysts with a Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1, the impregnation sequence affects the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, leading to differences in the catalytic performance. The presence of PtNi bonds is confirmed through EXAFS measurements, and their formation is linked to the diffusion of Ni ions into the γ-Al2O3 support when Ni is deposited first.

The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence.
The bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts showed significantly higher activity toward the disproportionation of cyclohexene than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3.
For catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the Pt-first catalyst, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, showed higher activity than the Ni-first catalyst, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3.
The effect of impregnation sequence was not as significant for catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1.
In addition, kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 as compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Pt LIII edge indicated that PtNi bimetallic bonds were formed in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3.
The PtNi bonds were formed for the 1/1 ratio catalysts with both impregnation sequences.

Answer: The impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the γ-Al2O3 support for a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1 (5 wt.% Pt, 0.5 wt.% Ni). When Pt is impregnated first, a significantly higher activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and a higher selectivity for the acetylene hydrogenation were found when compared with the one where Ni is impregnated first, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. EXAFS measurements and data analysis show the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the former but not on the latter catalyst. One possible explanation of the effect of impregnation sequence is the diffusion of Ni into the cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support when the Ni2+ ion is deposited first.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于3/1（5wt.%Pt，0.5wt.%Ni）的Pt/Ni原子比，浸渍顺序对γ-Al2O3支持上的PtNi双金属键的形成有显著影响。当首先浸渍Pt时，在与首先浸渍Ni相比的情况下，1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂显示出更高程度的环己烯歧化反应活性和乙炔加氢选择性。EXAFS测量和数据分析表明前者形成了PtNi双金属键，而后者则没有。可能的解释是当首先沉积Ni2+离子时，Ni离子扩散到γ-Al2O3的空腔中。
