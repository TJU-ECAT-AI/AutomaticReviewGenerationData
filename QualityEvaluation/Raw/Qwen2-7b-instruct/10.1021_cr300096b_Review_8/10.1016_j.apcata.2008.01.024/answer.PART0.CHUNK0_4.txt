[1] "For a higher Ni loading at the same Pt loading (1.5 wt.% Ni) in the bimetallic catalysts, the sequence of the impregnation does not seem to play a significant role in the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene."
[2] "When Pt is impregnated first, a significantly higher activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and a higher selectivity for the acetylene hydrogenation were found when compared with the one where Ni is impregnated first, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3."
[3] "One possible explanation of the effect of impregnation sequence is the diffusion of Ni into the cavities of the γ-Al2O3 support when the Ni2+ ion is deposited first."

1. 对于相同Pt负载下较高Ni负载（1.5 wt.% Ni）的双金属催化剂，浸渍顺序对环己烯自氢化催化活性的影响似乎不显著。
2. 当首先浸渍Pt时，与首先浸渍Ni的催化剂相比，环己烯自氢化活性和乙炔加氢选择性均显著提高。
3. 影响浸渍顺序的一个可能解释是，当首先沉积Ni2+离子时，Ni离子扩散进入γ-Al2O3支持的空腔。
