<p>Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts.</p>
<p>The second probe reaction is the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene, which is an important industrial process and has been the subject of many studies.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this paper, the bimetallic samples are denoted as 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>On the 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the acetylene concentration decreased during the reaction while ethane concentration increased until all the acetylene and ethylene were consumed.</p>
<p>In the case of the two 1/1 ratio catalysts, there is no significant difference between them in the overall activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the estimated rate constants.</p>
<p>For a higher Ni loading at the same Pt loading (1.5 wt.% Ni) in the bimetallic catalysts, the sequence of the impregnation does not seem to play a significant role in the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene.</p>
<p>The disproportionation of cyclohexene on 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 shows a higher conversion rate than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst also shows a higher selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.</p>
<p>This could be due to the formation of Ni aluminate (NiAl2O4) species when Ni is impregnated first on the alumina support, due to the strong interaction of Ni with γ-Al2O3 as reported previously.</p>
<p>When Pt is impregnated first, the strong interaction of Ni with the support seems to be reduced by the Pt precursor or the actual Pt oxide formed during the calcination step.</p>

1. Our group has utilized the disproportionation of cyclohexene as a method to assess the unique low-temperature hydrogenation capabilities of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. As an additional probe, the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene has been studied due to its industrial significance.

2. The catalysts in this study are denoted by specific combinations of Ni and Pt with γ-Al2O3, such as 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3, representing different ratios and impregnation sequences of the metals.

3. Over catalysts including 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, and 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3, the concentration of acetylene decreases during the reaction while ethane concentration increases, indicating the complete consumption of both acetylene and ethylene.

4. For 1/1 ratio catalysts, there's no significant difference in overall activity for cyclohexene disproportionation or estimated rate constants, regardless of the impregnation sequence.

5. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrates a higher conversion rate for cyclohexene compared to 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.

6. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation in the presence of ethylene than 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3.

7. The formation of Ni aluminate (NiAl2O4) species might hinder the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds when Ni is impregnated first on the alumina support, due to the strong interaction between Ni and γ-Al2O3.

8. When Pt is impregnated first, the strong interaction of Ni with the support is reduced, facilitating the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, as observed in the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 我们小组通过研究环己烯的自我氢化反应，来比较铂/镍双金属表面和催化剂的独特低温氢化活性。作为另一个探针，我们研究了乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化，由于其工业重要性，这是许多研究的主题。

2. 在此研究中，催化剂被标记为特定的镍和铂与γ-Al2O3的组合，如1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3、1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3、1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3，代表不同的比例和金属的浸渍顺序。

3. 在包括1Pt/γ-Al2O3、1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3在内的催化剂上，乙炔浓度在反应期间降低，而乙烷浓度增加，表明乙炔和乙烯已被完全消耗。

4. 对于1/1比例的催化剂，无论浸渍顺序如何，对于环己烯的自分解或估计的速率常数，没有显著差异。

5. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的环己烯转化率比1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3或1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂高。

6. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂对乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化比1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3或1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂更高。

7. 当Ni首先浸渍到氧化铝支撑上时，可能形成NiAl2O4物种，这可能是由于Ni与γ-Al2O3之间的强烈相互作用。

8. 当首先浸渍Pt时，Ni与支撑的强烈相互作用被Pt前体或煅烧过程中形成的Pt氧化物所降低，从而促进了1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂中PtNi双金属键的形成。
