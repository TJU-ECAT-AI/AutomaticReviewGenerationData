<p>Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) [21] and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1) [18] , with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath.</p>
<p>Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence.</p>
<p>In the case of the two 1/1 ratio catalysts, there is no significant difference between them in the overall activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the estimated rate constants. Although the EXAFS analysis shows differences in the coordination number of the PtNi bonds, the fact that PtPt and PtNi distances are very similar within the error bars implies that bimetallic bonds are formed on both catalysts.</p>
<p>When the Ni2+ ion is deposited first, all or a large fraction would enter the γ-Al2O3 cavities. On the contrary, if the Pt2+ is deposited first, it would remain outside the matrix and likely prevent subsequently deposited Ni2+ ion from entering the γ-Al2O3 cavities. The availability of both Ni and Pt outside the cavities would in turn facilitate the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds, consistent with the results in the current study.</p>

The disproportionation of cyclohexene serves as a probe reaction to evaluate the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. This activity is influenced by the impregnation sequence, particularly for catalysts with a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1. For catalysts with a Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1, the impregnation sequence affects the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, leading to differences in the catalytic performance. The presence of PtNi bonds is confirmed through EXAFS measurements, and their formation is linked to the diffusion of Ni ions into the γ-Al2O3 support when Ni is deposited first.

在Pt/Ni双金属表面和催化剂中，环己烷的自氢化反应作为评估独特低温氢化活性的探针反应。此活性受浸渍顺序的影响，特别是对于Pt/Ni原子比为3/1的催化剂。对于Pt/Ni比例为1/1的催化剂，浸渍顺序影响PtNi双金属键的形成，导致催化性能的差异。通过EXAFS测量确认了PtNi键的存在，并且其形成与当Ni首先沉积时Ni离子进入γ-Al2O3晶胞的能力有关。
