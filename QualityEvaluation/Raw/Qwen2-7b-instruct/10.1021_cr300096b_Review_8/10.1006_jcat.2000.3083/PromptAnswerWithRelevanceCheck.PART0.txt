[1] "The activation energies corresponding to pure Pd and Pt are consistent with those measured on samples prepared by chemical methods (15, 16)."
[2] "The reaction order with respect to H2 is almost independent of the catalyst, with a mean value of 0.6 ± 0.1."

The laser vaporization technique provides a method to create bimetallic clusters with a uniform composition. This technique allows for the generation of particles that have a composition identical to the vaporized alloyed target. Toluene hydrogenation is used as a test for these catalysts because it has been widely studied over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the incipient wetness technique.

[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."
[2] "The purpose of this paper is to show that all these criteria are fulfilled by using the laser vaporization technique."
[3] "We have demonstrated that no synergy between the two elements can be evidenced, the rates being perfectly explained by an additivity of the properties of the two metals."
[4] "The nonlinear dependence of the rate as a function of the Pt surface concentration is interpreted by the presence of an adsorption site for the aromatic molecule composed of a pair of atoms."
[5] "This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems."

1. The document discusses difficulties in controlling the size, structure, or composition of supported bimetallic catalysts when they are synthesized using chemical methods, which makes comparing their catalytic properties to those of monometallic catalysts challenging. 

2. The authors aim to demonstrate that using the laser vaporization technique fulfills the criteria for obtaining bimetallic clusters with a uniform composition, enabling a better comparison between bimetallic and monometallic catalysts.

3. No evidence of synergy between the two elements in bimetallic catalysts is found, with the observed rates being explained by the additive properties of the two metals.

4. The nonlinear relationship between the rate of the reaction and the Pt surface concentration is attributed to the presence of an adsorption site for the aromatic molecule made up of a pair of atoms.

5. An integrated theoretical and experimental approach, combining DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies with techniques like TPD measurements, can be used to predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
