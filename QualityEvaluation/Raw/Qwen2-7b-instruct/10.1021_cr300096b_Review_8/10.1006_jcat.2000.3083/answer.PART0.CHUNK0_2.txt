[1] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition."
[2] "In the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."
[3] "The vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene has been used to test our catalysts since this reaction has been extensively studied by the group of Vannice over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the incipient wetness technique."

The laser vaporization technique provides a method to create bimetallic clusters with a uniform composition. This technique allows for the generation of particles that have a composition identical to the vaporized alloyed target. Toluene hydrogenation is used as a test for these catalysts because it has been widely studied over monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the incipient wetness technique.

激光蒸发技术提供了一种制备具有均匀组成的双金属簇的方法。该技术允许生成与蒸发合金目标相匹配的组成颗粒。由于这种技术产生的粒子具有与蒸发合金相匹配的组成，因此可以使用它来制备具有均匀组成的双金属簇。通过将二金属氢化苯作为测试方法，因为它广泛研究过单金属Pd/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3催化剂的制备过程，这些过程使用的是浸渍湿法制备。
