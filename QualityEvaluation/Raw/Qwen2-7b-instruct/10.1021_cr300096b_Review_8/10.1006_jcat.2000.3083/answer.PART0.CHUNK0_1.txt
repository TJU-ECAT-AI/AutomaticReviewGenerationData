[1] "The activation energies corresponding to pure Pd and Pt are consistent with those measured on samples prepared by chemical methods (15, 16)."
[2] "The reaction order with respect to H2 is almost independent of the catalyst, with a mean value of 0.6 ± 0.1."
[3] "The reaction order with respect to toluene is close to zero at low temperature and increases only slightly up to values ranging between 0.2 and 0.7 at higher temperature."
[4] "The maximum of activity occurs at Tmax equal to 450, 456, 472, and 473 K on Pt, Pd17Pt83, Pd65Pt35, and Pd, respectively."
[5] "For the Pd65Pt35 system, the Pd surface atoms are surrounded by Pt atoms located in the underlying layer."
[6] "The behavior of the Pd17Pt83 bimetallic system at high temperature, which shows a cooperative effect between Pd and Pt, is interpreted by the ability of Pd to supply hydrogen in sufficient amount, whereas the aromatics remain more strongly bonded on platinum."

1. The activation energies for pure Pd and Pt align with those obtained from chemical synthesis methods.
2. The hydrogen reaction order is largely unaffected by the catalyst, averaging around 0.6 ± 0.1.
3. The toluene reaction order is minimal at low temperatures, rising slightly to between 0.2 and 0.7 at higher temperatures.
4. The maximum activity peaks at 450, 456, 472, and 473 K for Pt, Pd17Pt83, Pd65Pt35, and Pd, respectively.
5. In the Pd65Pt35 system, Pd surface atoms are enclosed by Pt atoms in the lower layer.
6. The cooperative effect between Pd and Pt at high temperature for the Pd17Pt83 system is attributed to Pd's capability to provide sufficient hydrogen, while aromatics are more strongly bound to platinum.

1. 纯Pd和Pt的活化能与化学方法制备的样品测量结果一致。
2. 氢气反应级数在催化剂之间几乎不受影响，平均值约为0.6±0.1。
3. 甲苯反应级数在低温下接近零，随温度升高略微增加至0.2到0.7之间。
4. 最大活性分别发生在450、456、472和473 K的温度上，对于Pt、Pd17Pt83、Pd65Pt35和Pd。
5. 在Pd65Pt35系统中，Pd表面原子被底层的Pt原子包围。
6. Pd17Pt83系统在高温下的协同效应由Pd提供足够的氢来解释，而芳香族化合物则更牢固地绑定在铂上。
