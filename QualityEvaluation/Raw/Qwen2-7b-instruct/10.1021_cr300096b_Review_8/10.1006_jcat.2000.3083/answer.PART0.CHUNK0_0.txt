[1] "In the case of benzene hydrogenation, a maximum of activity occurring at 473 K on Pt compared to 495 K on Pd (21) has been reported."
[2] "In the case of the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene, Carturan et al. (4) found that the specific activity of PdPt catalysts is smaller than the sum of individual Pd and Pt in the 10100% Pt range."
[3] "For the Pd17Pt83 system, the Pd surface atoms are surrounded by Pt atoms located in the underlying layer."
[4] "In the course of the reaction at high temperature, the hydrogen could be supplied by the Pd on the alloy, the hydrogenation taking place to a large extent on Pt."

1. A maximum of activity for benzene hydrogenation was observed at 473 K on Pt, while for Pd, it was at 495 K.
2. The specific activity of PdPt catalysts for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene was found to be less than the sum of individual Pd and Pt activities.
3. In the Pd17Pt83 system, Pd surface atoms are enveloped by Pt atoms in the lower layer.
4. At high temperatures, hydrogen supply occurs primarily from the Pd component of the alloy, with hydrogenation happening predominantly on Pt.
