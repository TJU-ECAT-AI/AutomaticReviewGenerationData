[1] "The activation energies corresponding to pure Pd and Pt are consistent with those measured on samples prepared by chemical methods (15, 16)."
[2] "As the temperature is increased, the activity of these catalysts passes through a reversible maximum (Fig. 7)."
[3] "The nonlinear dependence of the rate as a function of the Pt surface concentration is interpreted by the presence of an adsorption site for the aromatic molecule composed of a pair of atoms."
[4] "Moreover, we have shown, with the study of the Pd65Pt35 sample, which contains nearly 100% Pd in the first layer,that the neighboring Pt atoms have no influence on the reactivity of Pd."

1. The activation energies for pure Pd and Pt are comparable to those found in samples made using chemical methods.

2. As the temperature rises, the activity of the catalysts exhibits a reversible peak.

3. The non-linear relationship between the rate and the Pt surface concentration is explained by the presence of an adsorption site for aromatic molecules consisting of two atoms.

4. Our investigation of the Pd65Pt35 sample, which has almost 100% Pd in its outer layer, revealed that the adjacent Pt atoms do not affect the reactivity of Pd.

1. 纯Pd和Pt的活化能与通过化学方法制备的样品测量的结果一致。

2. 随着温度的升高，催化剂的活性表现出可逆的峰值。

3. 率与Pt表面浓度之间的非线性关系是由芳香分子吸附位点的存在解释的，该位点由两个原子组成。

4. 我们对含有几乎100%外层Pd的Pd65Pt35样本的研究表明，相邻的Pt原子不会影响Pd的反应性。
