<questions>

How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is observed at 247 K in the reaction of 1-hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[2] "In addition, 1-hexene also undergoes dehydrogenation to produce trace amount of hexadiene, dehydro-cyclization to produce benzene, and complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen."
[3] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways."
[4] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[5] "The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1.A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is detected at 247 K for 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111). This pathway involves hydrogenation and decomposition, producing hexadiene, benzene, and atomic carbon and hydrogen. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen boosts hexane production by 5.5 times without affecting other pathways.

2.Both 1-hexene and cyclohexene show comparable self-hydrogenation activity on ML Ni/Pt(111). However, cyclohexene exhibits higher dehydrogenation activity to form benzene.

3.1-butene lacks a self-hydrogenation pathway due to its lower desorption temperature compared to 1-hexene. Despite this, 1-butene hydrogenates readily with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, forming butane with a lower desorption temperature than hexane and cyclohexane.

1.在247 K温度下，1-己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上观察到一个低温自我氢化途径。该途径包括氢化和分解，产生己二烯、苯和原子碳和氢。表面预吸附的氢可以将己烷的产量提升5.5倍，而对其他路径影响较小。

2.1-己烯和环己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上显示出相似的自我氢化活性。然而，环己烯的脱氢活性更高，能够形成苯。

3.1-丁烯缺乏自我氢化途径，这是由于其比1-己烯更低的脱吸附温度所致。尽管如此，在预吸附氢的存在下，1-丁烯仍然容易进行氢化，形成丁烷，其脱吸附温度低于己烷和环己烷。
