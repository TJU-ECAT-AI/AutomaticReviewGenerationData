[1] "A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is observed at 247 K in the reaction of 1-hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[2] "In addition, 1-hexene also undergoes dehydrogenation to produce trace amount of hexadiene, dehydro-cyclization to produce benzene, and complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen."
[3] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways."
[4] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[5] "The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity."

1.A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is detected at 247 K for 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111). This pathway involves hydrogenation and decomposition, producing hexadiene, benzene, and atomic carbon and hydrogen. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen boosts hexane production by 5.5 times without affecting other pathways.

2.Both 1-hexene and cyclohexene show comparable self-hydrogenation activity on ML Ni/Pt(111). However, cyclohexene exhibits higher dehydrogenation activity to form benzene.

3.1-butene lacks a self-hydrogenation pathway due to its lower desorption temperature compared to 1-hexene. Despite this, 1-butene hydrogenates readily with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, forming butane with a lower desorption temperature than hexane and cyclohexane.

1.在247 K温度下，1-己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上观察到一个低温自我氢化途径。该途径包括氢化和分解，产生己二烯、苯和原子碳和氢。表面预吸附的氢可以将己烷的产量提升5.5倍，而对其他路径影响较小。

2.1-己烯和环己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上显示出相似的自我氢化活性。然而，环己烯的脱氢活性更高，能够形成苯。

3.1-丁烯缺乏自我氢化途径，这是由于其比1-己烯更低的脱吸附温度所致。尽管如此，在预吸附氢的存在下，1-丁烯仍然容易进行氢化，形成丁烷，其脱吸附温度低于己烷和环己烷。
