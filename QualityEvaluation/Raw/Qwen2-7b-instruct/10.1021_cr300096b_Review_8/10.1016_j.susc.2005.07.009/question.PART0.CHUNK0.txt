The effect of hydrocarbon structure and chain length on the low-temperature hydrogenation activity on Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces Luis E. Murillo a, Neetha A. Khan a, Jingguang G. Chen b,* a Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA b Department of Chemical Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, USA Received 17 December 2004; accepted for publication 8 July 2005 Available online 28 July 2005 Abstract The reaction pathways of 1-hexene have been investigated on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces at different Ni coverages using Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). A low-temperature self-hydro- genation pathway to produce hexane is detected at the monolayer Ni coverage at 247 K. In addition to self-hydroge- nation, 1-hexene also undergoes dehydrogenation to produce trace amount of hexadiene, dehydro-cyclization to produce benzene, and complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways. Furthermore, the reaction pathways of 1-butene, cyclohexene, and benzene were compared on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface to determine the effect of chain length and molecular structure on the low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. The comparison indicates that the two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene and cyclohexene, show similar self-hydrogenation activity; in contrast, self-hydrogenation does not occur for 1-butene. The hydrogenation of all three alkenes occurs readily in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, while the hydro- genation of benzene does not occur even in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Surface Science 594 (2005) 2742 www.elsevier.com/locate/susc properties than those of either single metallic sys- tem [15]. Our group has recently performed theo- retical calculations [68] and experimental studies [912] of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. In these studies we have dem- onstrated that at approximately one monolayer (ML) coverage Ni atoms reside below the top- most layer of the Pt(111) surface. Due to the inter- action with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorp- tion energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The coexistence of weakly ad- sorbed hydrogen and olefin can potentially result in low-temperature hydrogenation pathways. For example, using cyclohexene as a probe molecule on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface [911], we observed a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway to pro- duce cyclohexane that was not present on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) [13,14] under ultrahigh vac- uum (UHV) conditions.
The objective of the current paper is to compare the effects of hydrocarbon structure and chain length on the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces using several probe molecules, 1-hexene, benzene, and 1-butene. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) has been utilized to investigate the hydroge- nation pathways both with and without the pres- ence of pre-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. We will compare the self-hydrogenation and hydrogena- tion of 1-hexene to those of cyclohexene to deter- mine the effect of the hydrocarbon structure on the activity and selectivity of the hydrogenation pathways. We will also report the absence of hydrogenation activity toward benzene under similar UHV conditions to further highlight the importance of hydrocarbon structure. In addition,we will compare the hydrogenation of 1-butene with 1-hexene to determine the effect of hydrocar- bon chain length on the hydrogenation activity.
The reactions of linear and cyclic olefin mole- cules on single crystal surfaces of Pt and Ni have been the subject of many previous studies [15 18]. Here we will only mention several studies that are relevant to the current work. Ilharco et al. studied the thermal decomposition of 1-hexene by reflectionabsorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) on Pt(111) where the formation of metallocycles occurs during the decomposition of 1-hexene at relatively high exposures. Two inter- mediate metallocycles were identified by vibra- tional spectroscopy, Pt3@C(CH2)5Pt at 270 K and Pt3@C(CH2)4C@Pt3 at 370 K [19]. These intermediate metallocycles could be the precursors of cyclic hydrocarbons as it was shown by Tjandra and Zaera on the studies of cyclization reactions on Ni (100) [20].
The desorption of 1-butene and its isomers was previously studied on Pt(111) and on ordered Sn/ Pt(111) surface alloys by Tsai and Koel. They found that the chemisorption strength is related to the number of Pt threefold sites, which de- creases with increasing concentrations of Sn on the surface. The hydrogenation of 1-butene to bu- tane was not observed on the Sn/Pt(111) surfaces.
The main effect of Sn modification is the reduction of the decomposition of molecular 1-butene, which practically does not occur on the (p3 · p3)R30 Sn/Pt(111) surface [21].
2. Experimental
The TPD experiments were carried out in a two-level stainless steel ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure less than 2 · 1010 Torr [9]. The UHV chamber is equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES), low- energy electron diffraction optics (LEED), and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UTi). A tempera- ture programmer was used to heat Pt(111) single crystal at a linear rate of 3 K/s during the TPD experiments. The crystal surface was placed at a distance of 5 mm from the opening of a random flux shield of the mass spectrometer. Up to 10 masses were monitored simultaneously.The Pt(111) single crystal (Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge), 1.5-mm-thick disk and 12 mm in diameter, was spot welded directly to two tantalum spots that served as both electrical connections for resistive heating and thermal con- tacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen. Using this configuration the temperature of the crystal could be cooled to 90 K and heated up to 1100 K. The Pt(111) single crystal was cleaned by cycles of 28

sputtering with Ne+ at 600 K, oxygen dosing (1 · 108 Torr) at 890 K, and annealing at 1100 K.Cyclohexene (c-C6H10), 1-hexene (C6H12) (Al- drich, 99+%), n-hexane (C6H14) (Alfa Aesar,97+%) and benzene (C6H6) were purified by con- secutive freezepumpthaw cycles prior their use.
Hydrogen, 1-butene, neon, and oxygen were all of research grade purity (99.999%) and were intro- duced into the UHV chamber without further purification. The purity of all chemicals was veri- fied in-situ by mass spectrometry prior to use.Doses are reported in Langmuir (1 Langmuir (L) = 1 · 106 Torr s) and are not corrected for ion gauge sensitivities.
Cyclohexene, benzene, n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1-butene were dosed by backfilling the chamber through a leak valve with a crystal temperature below 120 K. Hydrogen and oxygen dosing was carried out through directional dosing tubes, with a diameter of 8 mm. For hydrogen dosing, a small exposure (0.5 L) results in 4050% saturation coverage of hydrogen.
Ni was deposited from an evaporative doser on the Pt(111) surface with a crystal temperature of 600 K to prevent CO adsorption from the UHV background. The evaporative doser consists of a Ni wire (99.999%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire, which is contained in a stain- less steel enclosure with an opening of 1 cm in diameter. During deposition, the UHV pressure was maintained below 5 · 1010 Torr. The purity of the Ni layer was verified using AES, which did not show detectable amount of carbon, oxygen or other impurities. The coverage of Ni on Pt(111) was estimated by monitoring the Ni(LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio after deposition,as described previously [9].
3. Results
3.1. Reaction pathways of 1-hexene on the
Ni/Pt(111) surfaces On Pt(111), 1-hexene undergoes dehydrogena- tion, self-hydrogenation, dehydro-cyclization, and decomposition. Fig. 1 shows the desorption of 1-hexene
(C6H12,
84 amu),benzene
(C6H6,
78 amu), hexane (C6H14, 86 amu), and hydrogen (H2, 2 amu), as a function of 1-hexene exposure on Pt(111). At an exposure of 0.5 L, the decompo- sition of 1-hexene to produce hydrogen is the dom- inant pathway. The main desorption product is hydrogen with a broad peak at 325 K. At a higher coverage of 1-hexene (3 L), self-hydrogenation to produce hexane occurs at 275 K. At the same exposure, molecular desorption of 1-hexene starts to occur at 259 K (low intensity broad peak).
The raising tail at higher temperatures is from the desorption of molecularly adsorbed 1-hexene on the crystal support. Dehydro-cyclization to produce benzene also occurs, as indicated by the two benzene desorption peaks at 390 and 435 K.
The TPD spectrum of H2 at this exposure shows two peaks, centered at approximately 280 and 397 K. Further exposure to 5 L shows the onset of a multilayer desorption peak of 1-hexene at 120 K with the monolayer peak centered at 259 K. A significantly higher amount of hexane is produced at 275 K. The desorption of benzene occurs at 435 K with a lower intensity peak cen- tered at 373 K. Finally, the H2 TPD spectrum shows an additional higher temperature desorp- tion peak at 624 K, possibly from further decom- position of hydrocarbon fragments on the surface.The desorption of 1-hexene, hexadiene (67 amu), benzene, and hexane after the exposure of 3 L of 1-hexene on different Ni/Pt(111) surfaces is shown in Fig. 2. The reaction pathways on Ni/ Pt(111) surfaces, with a Ni coverage of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 ML, are compared to those of clean Pt(111) and a Ni film which is designated as >3 ML Ni/Pt(111). The latter surface shows very weak AES Pt peaks due to the screening by the Ni overlayer, and the Ni film is epitaxially grown as indicated by a sharp (111) LEED pattern [9].
On the 0.5 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, the desorption of 1-hexene starts as a broad peak centered at 254 K, which shifts to a slightly lower temperature sharp peak on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, and finally broadens on the surfaces with higher Ni coverages. Fig. 2 also shows the desorption of mass 67 amu, which is the main cracking pattern of hexadiene. Mass 67 amu is also a minor crack- ing pattern of 1-hexene. As compared in Fig. 2,the peak shape and desorption temperatures of
L.E. Murillo et al. / Surface Science 594 (2005) 2742
29 the mass 67 amu peaks are nearly identical to those of mass 84 amu from the corresponding sur- faces, suggesting that the origin of mass 67 amu peak is from the cracking pattern of molecularly desorbed 1-hexene. To further confirm this we have compared the intensity ratios of the mass 84 amu and mass 67 amu for the desorption peak at 254 K. The intensity ratios are approximately
3.8 from all surfaces, which is identical to the ratio
from the mass spectrometry analysis of pure 1-hex- ene in our UHV system. Thus the TPD results in Fig. 2 indicate that the amount of hexadiene prod- uct is negligible from the Pt(111), ML Ni/Pt(111) and thick Ni surfaces. The only noticeable differ- ence is the presence of a relatively weak mass 67 amu peak at 374 K, which is from the desorp- tion of hexadiene due to the lack of mass 84 amu at the same temperature. The production of ben- zene from Pt(111) leads to two desorption peaks at 390 and 435 K. A single desorption peak at 401 K appears on the 0.5 ML Ni surface. The ben- zene desorption peak broadens at the 1 ML Ni coverage, where the maximum benzene production occurs on the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. At higher Ni coverages the benzene desorption peak decreases in intensity, appearing as a broad peak centered 8x10 6 6 4 2 0 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100

at a slightly higher temperature. Lastly, the pro- duction of hexane shifts from 275 K on clean Pt(111) surface to 247 K on the Ni/Pt surfaces with 0.5 and 1 ML Ni. On Ni/Pt(111) surfaces with Ni coverage above 1 ML, the hexane desorp- tion shows a broader, less intense feature centered at 247 K.
The unique chemistry of the 0.5 and 1.0 ML Ni/ Pt(111) surfaces is further confirmed by the desorption of the H2 product from the reaction of 1-hexene. Fig. 3 shows the TPD spectra of H2 after exposure of 3 L of 1-hexene on different Ni/ Pt(111) surfaces. By increasing the Ni coverage,the 280 K peak on the clean Pt(111) surface shifts to a lower temperature at 251 K. The two peaks broaden at a coverage of 1 ML Ni. At cov- erages above 2 ML Ni, the hydrogen desorbs as one sharp peak at 316 K on 2.5 ML Ni/Pt(111) and at 330 K on the Ni film.
In order to quantify the peak areas of the hex- ane product, we have performed TPD measure- ments following the adsorption of n-hexane on the Pt(111) and 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces, as shown in Fig. 4. After exposing the surfaces to

31 3 L of n-hexane, the desorption of molecular hex- ane occurs from both surfaces as a relatively sharp peak at 247 K. The 247 K peaks at 84 and 78 amu are from the cracking patterns of molecularly des- orbed n-hexane. The decomposition of n-hexane occurs on both surfaces, as indicated by the detec- tion of the H2 product. As will be described in Sec- tion 4, the peak areas of n-hexane, together with AES measurements at 100 and 800 K, allow us to quantify the hexane yield from the reaction of 1-hexene.
3.2. Coadsorption of H2 and 1-hexene on the
monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface The effect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the 1- hexene surface reaction pathways was studied.
For these TPD experiments, the same masses dis- cussed in the previous section were monitored.
Fig. 5 shows the TPD spectra of 1-hexene, ben- zene, hexane, and hydrogen, obtained after the adsorption of 3 L of 1-hexene on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111), with and without the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. The 0.5 L H2 exposure on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface corresponds to approximately 4050% of saturation coverage based on TPD measurements as a function of H2 exposure (spectra not shown). The results in Fig. 5 show that molecular desorption of 1-hexene occurs at approximately 194, 247, and 303 K from the pre-adsorbed hydrogen experiment on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. Although the presence of the 0.5 L pre-adsorbed hydrogen does not change the peak shape and intensity of the main benzene desorption peak at 401 K, it appears to cause a slight increase in the low-temperature ben- zene desorption peak at 322 K. The most signifi- cant change in the TPD spectra is observed in the production of hexane. The hexane production is enhanced by a factor of 5.5, based on the TPD peak areas with and without the presence of coad- sorbed H2. The presence of 0.5 L pre-adsorbed hydrogen not only enhances the production of hexane at 242 K, but also induces a lower temper- ature desorption peak at 200 K. More about the quantification of the activity and selectivity on these surfaces will be provided in Section 4.
3.3. Effect of hydrocarbon chain length
In order to determine the effect of the hydrocar- bon chain length on the hydrogenation of linear alkenes, the reaction of 1-butene was also studied on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. The desorption of 1-butene (C4H8, 56 amu), 1,3-butadiene (C4H6,54 amu), butane (C4H10, 58 amu), and hydrogen (H2, 2 amu), after the adsorption of 3 L of 1-butene both with and without the pre-adsorption of hydrogen on the
1 ML
Ni/Pt(111) surface,is shown in Fig. 6. The desorption of 1-butene is characterized by a broad peak centered at 206 K. When hydrogen is pre-adsorbed, the desorption of 1-butene occurs from both mono- layer (206 K) and multilayer (135 K). The desorp- tion of 1,3-butadiene (54 amu) occurs in the same pattern shown by the desorption of 1-butene, sug- gesting that the main contribution to the mass 54 amu peak is due to 1-butene cracking. The production of butane is negligible on the Pt(111) surface with a very weak peak at 269 K, which is consistent with earlier studies of 1-butene on Pt(111) by Tsai and Koel [21] (not shown). In the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, only negligible amount of butane desorbs from the ML Ni/ Pt(111) surface at 177 K. This observation

indicates that, unlike the reaction of 1-hexene, 1- butene does not undergo the self-hydrogenation pathway on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. When hydrogen is pre-dosed on the Ni/Pt(111) surface,the production of butane is increased significantly based on peak area. The comparison in Fig. 6 indi- cates that the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface does not hydrogenate 1-butene until pre-adsorbed hydrogen is present on the surface. Lastly, hydrogen desorbs at 300 and 345 K from the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface from decomposition of 1-butene on ML Ni/ Pt(111). In the presence of pre-adsorbed H2, one additional desorption peak is observed at 243 K.
3.4. Effect of hydrocarbon structure
The effect of molecular structure in the hydroge- nation activity is addressed by comparing with the hydrogenation pathways of two other C6 mole- cules, cyclohexene and benzene. The self-hydroge- nation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/ Pt(111) have been investigated in detail using TPD and other surface spectroscopies [7,11]. For the purpose of comparison Fig. 7 summarizes the TPD spectra obtained following the reaction of

33 surface. In these experiments, cyclohexene (c-C6H10,82 amu), benzene (C6H6, 78 amu), cyclohexane (c-C6H12, 84 amu), and hydrogen (H2, 2 amu) were monitored under identical conditions as those de- scribed for 1-hexene. The hydrogenation product,cyclohexane, is observed both with and without pre-adsorbed hydrogen at temperatures ranging from 200 to 240 K. Pre-adsorption of hydrogen with cyclohexene increases the yield of cyclohex- ane approximately threefold on the 1 ML Ni/ Pt(111) surface. Additionally, the onset of cyclo- hexane desorption occurs at a temperature lower than without the pre-adsorption of hydrogen, with a shoulder in the cyclohexane spectra occurring at
200 K.
For completeness, we have also investigated the potential hydrogenation of benzene on Ni/ Pt(111). Fig. 8 compares the TPD spectra ob- tained following the coadsorption of benzene and hydrogen on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface at 100 K. Several possible hydrogenation products were monitored, including cyclohexene (c-C6H10,82 amu) and cyclohexane (c-C6H12,84 amu).
The only desorption products are benzene and H2 from the Ni/Pt(111) surface pre-adsorbed with hydrogen, indicating that benzene hydroge-

nation to produce either cyclohexene of cyclohex- ane does not occur. The benzene desorption peak shifts to a slightly lower temperature with increas- ing coverage of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. For exam- ple, the benzene desorption feature at 181 K without pre-adsorbed hydrogen is shifted to 173 K with 5 L pre-adsorbed hydrogen. The H2 desorption peaks shift to 198 K from 231 K as the hydrogen exposure is increased from 0.5 L H2 to 5 L H2. These results show that the presence of surface hydrogen decreases the desorption tem- perature of benzene but does not promote any hydrogenation reaction. The absence of desorp- tion of any hydrogenation products in the TPD measurements indicate that,as expected, the hydrogenation of benzene is much more difficult

Quantification of the selectivity toward decom- position (Eqs. (1) and (4)), dehydro-cyclization (Eqs. (2) and (5)), and self-hydrogenation (Eqs.
(3) and (6)) were estimated on the different sur- faces based on TPD peak area ratios for the products and AES measurements. The partial dehydrogenation pathway toward hexadiene was considered negligible for the method used in this paper due to the very small peak areas (Fig. 2). The activity toward complete decomposi- tion on the clean Pt(111) surface was determined using
AES
after the
TPD
measurements at 800 K. The surface coverage of atomic C was esti- mated based on the C (275 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES ratio. As described below, the calculations took into consideration of the following two effects:(1) the screening of the Pt AES signal by the sur- face carbon atoms and (2) the contribution of the Pt (241 eV) signal from Pt layers in the bulk.
The following parameters were defined in the calculation:
I
C: intensity of C (275 eV) feature for 1 ML C,
I
Pt: intensity of Pt (241 eV) feature for 1 ML Pt,
IC: AES intensity of C (275 eV) for C/Pt(111),
IPt: AES intensity of Pt (241 eV) for C/Pt(111).

37 The AES intensities of C (275 eV) for 1 ML car- bon and Pt (241 eV) for 1 ML Pt are related by the Auger sensitivity factors as follows:
I
C=SC  I
Pt=SPt 7 where SC and SPt are the sensitivity factors, which are 0.6143 and 0.1575 [22], respectively, at an inci- dence energy of 3 keV [23]. The experimentally measured AES intensity of the C(KLL) feature at 275 eV, IC, can be expressed as IC  xI
C
8 where x is the fraction of monolayer of carbon residing on top of the Pt(111) surface. The exper- imentally measured AES intensity of the Pt (241 eV) feature is contributed from many layers of Pt. The intensity from the first layer of Pt can be expressed as First layer Pt :
I1
Pt  1  xI Pt  xI Pt exp dC=kPt
9 The first term represents the region without sur- face carbon, and the second term is from the sur- face region where Pt atoms are screened by the surface carbon layer with a thickness of dC. The term kPt is the mean free path of the Pt (241 eV) electrons, which can be estimated to be 6.4 A from the universal curve [22]. Similarly the Pt AES sig- nal from the subsequent layers of Pt can be de- scribed by the following general equation:nth layer Pt : In Pt  1  x exp n  1dPt=kPt
f exp dC  n  1dPt=kPt
gI Pt 10 IPt
X
n In Pt 11 Finally, the experimentally measured AES ratio of the C(KLL)/Pt (241 eV) features can be related to the surface carbon coverage, x, using the following relationship:
IC
IPt xI
C
X
n 1  x exp n  1dPt=kPt
f ( ,xexp dC  n  1dPt=kPt

I
C=I
Pt  SC=SPt 13 In the current study we used the diameter of a carbon atom (DC = 1.84 A [24]) for the thickness of the surface carbon layer. The thickness of each Pt layer was determined to be dPt = (p3/2)DPt based on the geometric arrangement of the face centered cubic (FCC) structure, with DPt being the diameter of a Pt atom of 2.78 A [24]. Our cal- culation also revealed that contributions to the Pt AES signal from Pt atoms 20 layers or deeper were negligible. For this reason the sum of the AES Pt (241 eV) signal, IPt, was calculated from the first 20 Pt layers. Using the experimental AES ratio (IC/IPt) of 0.846 after the TPD measurement, cal- culations using the above equations resulted in a value of 0.575 carbon atom per surface Pt atom following the decomposition of 1-hexene on clean Pt(111), which corresponded to a value of 0.096 1-hexene molecule per surface Pt atom, as shown in Eq.

14 In order to calculate the activity toward the production of hexane, AES measurements were performed at 100 K and after TPD of the 3 L hex- ane-dosed Pt(111) surfaces (Fig. 4). The AES measurement at 100 K (before TPD) was mea- sured on an identical 3 L hexane-dosed Pt(111) surface to avoid electron beam induced chemistry.
The AES C/Pt ratio before and after TPD was
0.363 and 0.105, respectively. Using the equa-
tions described above, these ratios corresponded to a surface atomic C/Pt ratio of 0.247 and
0.072, respectively. The atomic C/Pt ratios before
and after TPD were used to correlate the TPD peak area of molecularly desorbed hexane as follows: C=Pt ratio3 L hexane at 100 K  C=Pt ratioAfter TPD 6

The activity toward self-hydrogenation, value c,was calculated using Eq. (16) to be 0.0016 mole- cule/Pt atom. To calculate the activity toward dehydro-cyclization on the clean Pt(111) surface,a ratio of the TPD peak area of benzene with the TPD peak area of hexane was used as shown below Benzene Area from 1  Hexene TPD  0.061 Hexane Area from 1  Hexene TPD b c 17 where 0.061 was the mass spectrometer intensity ratio between mass 84 amu of hexane and mass 78 amu of benzene. This ratio was obtained by exposing the chamber to equal pressures of hexane (6.6 · 108 Torr) and benzene (5.9 · 108 Torr) based on their ion gauge sensitivities. Hence, the value of b from Eq. (17) was 0.0004 molecule/Pt atom. The error bars for values of a, b, and c were typically within 10% based on multiple sets of AES and TPD measurements. These values are summa- rized in Table 1.
The activity calculations of 1-hexene on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface were similar to those carried out for the clean Pt(111) surface. The activ- ity toward decomposition was calculated using the C/Pt AES ratio after the TPD measurement of 3 L 1-hexene on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The only difference was that the second layer was Ni instead of Pt, and the thickness of the Ni layer was dNi = (p3/2)DNi, with DNi being the diameter of a Ni atom of 2.50 A [24]. Using the experimental AES ratio (IC/IPt) of 0.374 after the TPD measure- ment, the decomposition of 1-hexene on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface was calculated to be
0.256 surface carbon atoms per surface Pt atom,
which corresponded to a value of 0.043 1-hexene per surface Pt atom (Eq. (18)) d  C=Pt atomic ratio 6

18 To calculate the self-hydrogenation activity, the peak areas of hexane desorption from Fig. 2 were compared (clean Pt(111) versus

(20), leading to a value of e as 0.0005 molecule/Pt atom Benzene area from 1-hexene TPD=1ML Ni=Pt1110.061 Hexane area from 1-hexene TPD=1ML Ni=Pt111 e f 20 Finally, the activities for the decomposition,dehydro-cyclization, and hydrogenation pathways were estimated when hydrogen is pre-adsorbed on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, using identical ap- proaches described above. These activities are re- ported in Table 1 along with the values in the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. The estimated selectivities for decomposition, dehydro-cycliza- tion, and hydrogenation are also reported in Table
1.
One of the most important observations from Table 1 and Fig. 5 is that the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen significantly enhances the hydrogenation pathway on the
1 ML
Ni/ Pt(111) surface, leading to a factor of 5.5 increase in the hexane yield, as well as a reduction in the desorption temperature of hexane to approxi- mately 200 K.

39 In addition, as compared in Fig. 2, the maxi- mum production of hexane due to self-hydrogena- tion of 1-hexene is obtained on the 1 ML Ni/Pt surface. This is consistent with our previous stud- ies of the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/Pt(111) surfaces with different Ni coverages [6,10,11]. As described from previous experimental measurements and DFT modeling for the self- hydrogenation of cyclohexene, the surface sites responsible for the low-temperature self-hydroge- nation are most likely surface Pt atoms that are modified by subsurface Ni atoms. The number of such surface sites would reach a maximum at a monolayer Ni coverage. At coverages greater than 1 ML, Ni atoms start to occupy the surface sites instead of diffusing into the subsurface region,gradually converting the surface chemistry of Ni/ Pt(111) to that of Ni at higher Ni coverages.
The low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclo- hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has been attributed to the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and weakly p-bonded cyclohexene [6,10,11]. In addition, the adsorption of ethylene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface has also been deter- mined to occur by the weakly p-bonded configura- tion [11],which is different from the di-r chemisorption of ethylene on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Using a similar argument, the observa- tion of the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1- hexene suggests that, similar to cyclohexene and ethylene, 1-hexene is most likely adsorbed via the p-bonded configuration, which reacts with weakly adsorbed hydrogen to produce hexane. Additional studies using high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) would be necessary to confirm this.
It is also interesting to notice that the desorp- tion of hexane, from the self-hydrogenation of 1-hexene on ML Ni/Pt(111), occurs at 247 K (Fig. 2), which is identical to the desorption of molecularly adsorbed hexane from the same sur- face (Fig. 4). The identical desorption temperature suggests that the production of gas-phase hexane from 1-hexene might be a desorption-limited pro- cess. However, HREELS studies are necessary to determine whether hexane was produced on the surface before desorption.
4.2. Effect of molecular structure
In order to determine the effect of hydrocarbon structure on the hydrogenation, Table 2 compares the selectivity of the hydrogenation products from the reactions of 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface, both with and without the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
The desorption temperatures of the two products are very similar, at 247 K for hexane (Fig. 2) and at 230 K for cyclohexane (Fig. 7). In addition, the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the yields of both hexane and cyclohexane, although the degree of enhancement is higher for hexene (a factor of 5.5) than for cyclohexane (a factor of 3).
As shown in Table 2, the main difference in the reaction pathways of 1-hexene and cyclohexene on the 1 ML Ni/Pt(111) is that the selectivity to dehydrogenation is much higher for cyclohexene than for 1-hexene, both in the presence and ab- sence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, most likely due to the presence of the C6 ring structure in cyclo- hexene. Furthermore, as expected, the dehydroge- nation to benzene is an irreversible reaction under UHV conditions, as confirmed by the absence of any hydrogenation activity toward benzene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface (Fig. 8).

4.3. Effect of hydrocarbon chain length
The chain length of alkene appears to have a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation pathways, as indicated by the TPD results of 1-butene as compared to those of 1-hexene or cyclohexene. The most significant dif- ference is the near absence of the self-hydrogena- tion pathway in 1-butene (Fig. 5). One possible explanation is that the desorption of 1-butene oc- curs at a lower temperature, 206 K (Fig. 6) than that of either 1-hexene (247 K) or cyclohexene (227 K) from the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. It is well established that the desorption temperature of alkenes depends on the chain length (or molec- ular weight) and molecular structure [1214]. The reduction in the desorption temperature from 247 K for 1-hexene to 206 K for 1-butene is consistent with the reduction of two CH2 groups in molecular weight [25].
In order to correlate the self-hydrogenation activity with the desorption temperature of alkene,we assume that molecularly adsorbed alkene can either undergo reversible molecular desorption or produce strongly chemisorbed surface species,with the latter not participating in the hydrogena- tion reaction. This assumption is consistent with previous observations that the hydrogenation oc- curs only for weakly p-bonded alkenes [26]. In the self-hydrogenation reaction the first step in- volves the dehydrogenation of alkene to produce atomic hydrogen. This in turn requires that the dehydrogenation temperature should be the same or lower than the desorption temperature of weakly bonded alkenes that undergo reversible molecular desorption. This requirement appears to be met in the case of 1-hexene and cyclohexene,as confirmed by the observation that the desorp- tion temperature of the self-hydrogenation prod- uct is similar to that of the corresponding molecularly desorbed alkene, at 247 K for 1-hex- ene and hexane (Fig. 5) and at 227230 K for cyclohexene and cyclohexane (Fig. 7).
In comparison, the absence of the self-hydroge- nation pathway in 1-butene suggests that the dehy- drogenation temperature to produce atomic hydrogen is most likely higher than the desorption temperature of 1-butene at 206 K. Although 1,3- butadiene is detected in the TPD measurements (Fig. 6), the identical peak shape and desorption temperature to that of 1-butene suggest that these peaks are due to the cracking of 1-butene instead of the dehydrogenation product. Because the ini- tial dehydrogenation of 1-alkenes would most likely occur at the CH bonds of the C@C moiety,one would expect the dehydrogenation tempera- ture to be similar for 1-alkenes such as 1-butene and 1-hexene. It would be very informative to investigate whether and/or at what temperature the self-hydrogenation of 1-pentene occurs on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface.
It is important to point out that despite the ab- sence of the self-hydrogenation pathway, the hydrogenation of 1-butene occurs readily on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface in the presence of pre-ad- sorbed hydrogen. As shown in Fig. 6, the desorp- tion of the hydrogenation product, butane, occurs as a sharp peak at 177 K. This is lower than the desorption temperatures of hexane at 200 K and 242 K (Fig. 5) and of cyclohexane at 225 K (Fig. 7). The lower desorption temperature of the C4 product as compared to the C6 products is again most likely due to the difference in the hydrocarbon chain length.
5. Conclusions
Based on the results described above, the follow- ing conclusions can be made regarding the hydro- genation pathways of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces:(1) A low-temperature self-hydrogenation path- way is observed at 247 K in the reaction of 1-hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. In addition, 1-hexene also undergoes dehydro- genation to produce trace amount of hexadi- ene, dehydro-cyclization to produce benzene,and complete decomposition to produce atomic carbon and hydrogen. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a fac- tor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways.
(2) The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1- hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar
L.E. Murillo et al. / Surface Science 594 (2005) 2742
41 self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/ Pt(111) surface. The main difference is the much higher dehydrogenation activity in cyclohexene to produce benzene. In addition,the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur on Ni/Pt(111) under UHV conditions.
(3) The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity. The self- hydrogenation is nearly absent for 1-butene on ML Ni/Pt(111), most likely due to the relatively low desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed 1-butene. On the other hand, the hydrogenation of 1-butene occurs readily in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, although the desorption tempera- ture of the butane product is significantly lower than that of hexane and cyclohexane.
