[1] "A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is observed at 247 K in the reaction of 1-hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[2] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways."
[3] "The comparison of two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene with cyclohexene, reveals similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface."
[4] "The comparison of 1-butene with the two C6 alkenes indicates that the chain length (or molecular weight) has a significant effect on the self-hydrogenation activity."

1.A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is observed at 247 K for 1-hexene on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen increases the production of hexane by 5.5 times.
2.Two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene and cyclohexene, exhibit similar self-hydrogenation activity on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface. 
3.In contrast to 1-hexene and cyclohexene, 1-butene lacks a self-hydrogenation pathway on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface due to its lower desorption temperature.

1.在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上，1-己烯在247 K的低温下发生自氢化路径。表面预吸附的氢气使己烷的产量增加了5.5倍。
2.1-己烯和环己烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上具有相似的自氢化活性。
3.与1-己烯和环己烯不同，1-丁烯在ML Ni/Pt(111)表面上缺乏自氢化路径，这是由于其较低的脱附温度。
