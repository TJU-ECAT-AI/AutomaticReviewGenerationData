[1] "A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is detected at the monolayer Ni coverage at 247 K."
[2] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the surface increases the production of hexane by a factor of 5.5, while causing little change in the other reaction pathways."
[3] "The comparison indicates that the two C6 alkenes, 1-hexene and cyclohexene, show similar self-hydrogenation activity; in contrast, self-hydrogenation does not occur for 1-butene."
[4] "The hydrogenation of all three alkenes occurs readily in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface, while the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur even in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen."

1. A low-temperature self-hydrogenation pathway is observed at 247 K when 1-hexene reacts on the monolayer Ni coverage.
2. Pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances hexane production by 5.5 times without much impact on other reaction pathways.
3. Both 1-hexene and cyclohexene exhibit similar self-hydrogenation activity, contrasting with 1-butene which lacks this pathway.
4. Hydrogenation of alkenes happens easily with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, except for benzene which remains unaffected even with hydrogen pre-adsorption.

1. 在单层Ni覆盖下，247 K时检测到低温度自氢化途径。
2. 预吸附的氢气使六烷产量增加了5.5倍，对其他反应路径影响不大。
3. 1-己烯和环己烯在单层Ni表面显示出相似的自氢化活性，与1-丁烯不同，后者没有这个途径。
4. 在单层Ni/Pt(111)表面上，烯烃在预吸附氢存在下容易发生氢化，而苯即使在预吸附氢存在下也未见氢化现象。
