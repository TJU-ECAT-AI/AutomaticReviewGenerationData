3.1. TPD
Fig. 1 shows NO2 desorption traces obtained by monitoring the 46-amu signal. A single desorption peak appears below 150 K which increased in temperature with increasing coverage. This peak corresponds to desorption of NO2 from multilayer, physisorbed species and occurs at the same temperature as that for Pt(1 1 1) [5] . However, unlike the case on Pt(1 1 1), no NO2 desorbs from the chemisorbed monolayer. The NO2 monolayer reacts completely and irreversibly on a 3 alloy surface.

Fig. 2 traces the evolution of one of the reaction products, NO, after increasing NO2 exposures. The lowest exposure investigated yields three desorption peaks at 240, 280, and 360 K. After increasing NO2 exposures, these NO desorption peaks saturate in size and shift to higher temperature. Desorption of NO under most of these conditions is reaction rate-limited, because NO desorption following NO adsorption on a 3 alloy occurs in a single peak which shifts with coverage from 240 to 190 K [36] .

Fig. 3 shows corresponding O2 TPD spectra obtained during the same experiments. After a small initial NO2 dose, O2 desorption occurred at 1070 K in a peak that shifts to 1077 K at saturation. Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures. Based on previous studies of O2 desorption following O3 decomposition on PtSn alloys [37] , we can assign these two peaks to decomposition of Sn-oxide species.

Fig. 4 utilizes the TPD areas from Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 to construct an uptake plot characterizing the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions during TPD. The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1), assuming that 20% of the 0.5-ML NO2 coverage desorbs as NO2 and the rest decomposes cleanly to NO and O2 during TPD as reported by Bartram et al. [5]. The NO and O2 TPD areas in our experiments can be placed on this NO2 coverage scale by assuming the sticking coefficient is constant, independent of coverage on the 3 alloy at 120 K, and noting that no other gas phase products were detected.

Fig. 5 demonstrates that the oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures. The surface oxygen coverage obtained following exposures at 120 K is limited by coadsorbed NO. The bottom curve in Fig. 5 reproduces the top curve from Fig. 3. The top curve in Fig. 5 is after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption. This curve corresponds to θO=1.1 ML. This is a higher coverage than θO=0.25 ML obtained by O2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 150300 K [38] and θO=0.75 ML obtained by NO2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 400 K [39]. This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al. [37] of θO=0.87 ML after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K.

Fig. 6 shows the shift in the Sn(MNN) AES peaks after exposures of 0.1-L NO2 on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the surface to gradually desorb O2. On the 3 alloy, the lower KE Sn(MNN) peak is located at 426.6 eV, identical to the value for Sn metal [41]. After NO2 exposure and annealing to 700 K, the peak shifts 1.5 to 425.1 eV KE. This indicates oxidation of Sn. However, this shift is much lower than that observed for bulk tin oxides surfaces, where SnO (3 to 423 eV) and SnO2 (7 to 419 eV) are characterized by large shifts when compared to metallic tin [41].

3.4. HREELS
Fig. 7 shows HREELS spectra following deposition of a multilayer film of NO2 (6 layers, θNO2=2.4 ML) on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the sample to increasing temperatures. The sample was heated to the indicated temperature for 30 s in each case and then re-cooled to 120 K and the spectra taken. Assignments of the energy loss peaks to specific vibrations are given in Table 1.

This research focuses on the adsorption and reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy, investigating its interactions using techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). At 120 K, NO2 adsorbs molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300-400 K. The maximum oxygen atom coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML, but this can be increased to θO=1.1 ML by NO2 dosing on the alloy surface at 600 K to remove inhibition by coadsorbed NO. Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx.

这项研究专注于氮氧化物（NO2）在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附和反应，使用技术如温度程序脱附（TPD）、Auger电子能谱（AES）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和低能电子衍射（LEED）来调查其相互作用。在120 K时，NO2以N,N键合的二聚体形式吸附，即N2O4，通过单个氧原子与表面形成倾斜的立式互动。然而，没有N2O4或NO2以分子形式从单层状态脱附。该二聚体在300 K时完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O在300-400 K。加热N2O4单层的最大氧原子覆盖率为θO=0.4 ML，但在600 K时通过在合金表面施加NO2去除抑制共吸附NO后，此值可增加到θO=1.1 ML。在这些后续条件下，吸附的氧气以三种清晰的脱附状态释放为O2，最低状态与Pt位点相关的O2脱附相关，其他两个状态则与还原锡氧化物相的分解有关，SnOx。
