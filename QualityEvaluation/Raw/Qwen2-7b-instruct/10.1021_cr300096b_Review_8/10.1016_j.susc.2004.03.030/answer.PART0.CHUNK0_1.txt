3.1. TPD
TPD spectra were obtained after exposures of NO2 on the 3 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K.
Fig. 1 shows NO2 desorption traces obtained by monitoring the 46-amu signal. A single desorption peak appears below 150 K which increased in temperature with increasing coverage. This peak corresponds to desorption of NO2 from multilayer, physisorbed species and occurs at the same temperature as that for Pt(1 1 1) [5] . However, unlike the case on Pt(1 1 1), no NO2 desorbs from the chemisorbed monolayer. The NO2 monolayer reacts completely and irreversibly on a 3 alloy surface. This can be compared to the decomposition of about 80% of the monolayer on Pt(1 1 1) [5] .

Fig. 2 traces the evolution of one of the reaction products, NO, after increasing NO2 exposures. The lowest exposure investigated yields three desorption peaks at 240, 280, and 360 K. After increasing NO2 exposures, these NO desorption peaks saturate in size and shift to higher temperature. Desorption of NO under most of these conditions is reaction rate-limited, because NO desorption following NO adsorption on a 3 alloy occurs in a single peak which shifts with coverage from 240 to 190 K [36] .

Fig. 3 shows corresponding O2 TPD spectra obtained during the same experiments. After a small initial NO2 dose, O2 desorption occurred at 1070 K in a peak that shifts to 1077 K at saturation. Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures. Based on previous studies of O2 desorption following O3 decomposition on PtSn alloys [37] , we can assign these two peaks to decomposition of Sn-oxide species. Our explanation of these two peaks is that the 1077-K peak is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOSn species and the peak at 910 K is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOPt species.

Fig. 4 utilizes the TPD areas from Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 to construct an uptake plot characterizing the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions during TPD. The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1), assuming that 20% of the 0.5-ML NO2 coverage desorbs as NO2 and the rest decomposes cleanly to NO and O2 during TPD as reported by Bartram et al.

Fig. 5 demonstrates that the oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures. The surface oxygen coverage obtained following exposures at 120 K is limited by coadsorbed NO. The bottom curve in Fig. 5 reproduces the top curve from Fig. 3. The top curve in Fig. 5 is after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption. This curve corresponds to θO=1.1 ML. This is a higher coverage than θO=0.25 ML obtained by O2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 150300 K [38] and θO=0.75 ML obtained by NO2 exposure on Pt(1 1 1) at 400 K [39] . This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al. of θO=0.87 ML after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K. In that work, oxygen desorption below 850 K was associated with reduction of oxidic Pt species rather than SnOx species. According to our results from Fig. 5, oxygen associated with Sn sites gives an O:Sn ratio of 0.5:0.33. This situation probably corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species.

Fig. 6 shows the shift in the Sn(MNN) AES peaks after exposures of 0.1-L NO2 on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the surface to gradually desorb O2. On the 3 alloy, the lower KE Sn(MNN) peak is located at 426.6 eV, identical to the value for Sn metal [41]. After NO2 exposure and annealing to 700 K, the peak shifts 1.5 to 425.1 eV KE. This indicates oxidation of Sn. However, this shift is much lower than that observed for bulk tin oxides surfaces, where SnO (3 to 423 eV) and SnO2 (7 to 419 eV) are characterized by large shifts when compared to metallic tin [41]. No such shift occurs at 120 or 200 K (not shown), demonstrating that Sn is not yet oxidized at those temperatures. The Sn(MNN) peak shifted to 425.4 eV KE following a 900 K anneal which caused some desorption of O2. This shift can be explained by reduction of some oxidized Sn back to a metallic state in the alloy. The Sn peak returned to its original location at 426.6 eV KE after annealing to 1200 K, which removes all oxygen from the surface. Thus, Sn was completely reduced and the alloy reformed under these conditions. The 1200 K anneal also caused the intensity of the Sn peak to decrease and the LEED pattern to change to a superposition of (2 × 2) and 3 spots. Either desorption of Sn or diffusion of Sn into the bulk could account for this Sn reduction, which has been seen before [42].

The 3 alloy was probed by LEED following a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K. This caused no change in the alloy LEED pattern other than to decrease the spot intensity, and no significant changes were observed after annealing to 200 K which desorbs some NO2. After annealing to 280 K, which desorbs some NO, the spots from the (3×3)R30 pattern disappeared and only the (1 × 1) spots of Pt(1 1 1) remained with a diffuse background. On some areas of the crystal, a faint (2 × 2) structure was observed, similar to that seen by Parker et al. for θO=0.25 ML generated after NO2 exposures on Pt(1 1 1). After a subsequent anneal to 700 K, (2 × 2) spots could no longer be seen and only a blurry (1 × 1) pattern remained. Annealing to 900 K desorbed all oxygen except that in the highest temperature O2 TPD peak at 1020 K. This resulted in the appearance of a (4 × 4) LEED pattern, which is consistent with the observations of Batzill et al.

Fig. 7 shows HREELS spectra following deposition of a multilayer film of NO2 (6 layers, θNO2=2.4 ML) on the 3 alloy at 120 K and then subsequently heating the sample to increasing temperatures. The sample was heated to the indicated temperature for 30 s in each case and then re-cooled to 120 K and the spectra taken. Assignments of the energy loss peaks to specific vibrations are given in Table 1.

For the multilayer film at 120 K, loss peaks corresponding to the ONO symmetric (νs,NO2) and asymmetric (νas,NO2) stretching modes of the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, appear at 1275 and 1795 cm1, respectively. The NN stretching mode (νNN) of N2O4 occurs at 280 cm1 and the ONO bending mode (δNO2) of N2O4 appears at 782 cm1. A peak near the one at 1591 cm1 has been assigned in the past to a 2δNO2 combination band, or more likely a double loss, in N2O4.

When the surface is annealed to 175 or 220 K, which desorbs any physisorbed multilayer species as shown in Fig. 1, surprisingly little change occurred in the HREELS spectra other than decreases in peak intensities consistent with some NO2 desorption. This is a very different spectrum than that obtained for the μ-N,O-nitrito surface species, a chemisorbed NO2 species bonded to the surface through both of the N and O atoms, formed on Pt(1 1 1) [5], the N-bonded chemisorbed NO2 species formed on oxygen-precovered Pt(1 1 1) [45], and the O,O-chelating surface species, a chemisorbed NO2 species bonded to the surface through both of O atoms, formed on Au(1 1 1) [17]. Small peak shifts do occur upon desorption of the multilayer for the energy loss peaks at 782, 1275, and 1591 cm1. The close resemblance of the spectrum after heating to 220 K to that for the condensed film, especially the continued presence of the NN stretch at 280 cm1 identifies that the chemisorbed monolayer is comprised of N,N-bonded dimers of N2O4, characterized by vibrational modes at 280, 821, 1258, and 1795 cm1.

Table 1 provides results for other N2O4 monolayers identified on graphite [44] and oxygen-precovered Au(1 1 1) [45] surfaces. The close agreement between these spectra and ours support our assignment. The only small discrepancy has to do with the assignment of the loss peak at 1557 cm1 for the monolayer; it would seem that this is better assigned to the (νs,NO2+νNN) combination band or double loss in N2O4. Furthermore, observation of an intense νNN mode indicates that the NN bond in N2O4 is oriented nearly along the surface normal, and certainly not near parallel with the surface plane, and observation of νs,NO2 and νas,NO2 modes in N2O4 with nearly the same intensity rules out both a flat-lying N2O4 with the molecular plane oriented parallel to the surface plane and an upright, chelating N2O4 species with C2v symmetry oriented along the surface normal. We propose that the chemisorbed layer formed on the 3 alloy surface is an N,N-bonded dimer of N2O4 interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry.

Heating this chemisorbed layer to 300 K breaks the NN bond and vibrations assigned to coadsorbed NO2, NO and O are observed. The TPD spectra in Fig. 2 show that a large amount of NO desorption occurs by heating to 300 K, and consistently, only weak loss peaks due to the NO stretching mode in adsorbed NO was observed in the expected range of 14451718 cm1 [36]. Vibrational losses observed at 1275 and near 869 cm1 indicate that some molecularly adsorbed NO2 remains on the surface. We assign this species to the N-bonded, chemisorbed NO2 species with C2v symmetry that is formed on oxygen-precovered Pt(1 1 1) [6]. However, in contrast to that case, the NO2 adsorbed on the 3 SnPt alloy surface fully decomposes at higher temperature with no evolution of gaseous NO2. Other features of the spectrum include those due to a small amount of coadsorbed CO and H2O contamination, and two large peaks at 358 and 588 cm1. We do not have a satisfactory explanation for the intensities of these latter two peaks, but metal-molecule stretching modes for NO2 and NO, along with an NO bending mode for tilted NO species, can contribute losses in this region.

Annealing to 500 K removes all chemisorbed molecular species and only a broad feature centered at 536 cm1 was observed. This feature is due to SnO vibrations that can occur over a wide range of energies depending on the structure and composition of the tin oxide film [46]. After heating to 900 K, which desorbs some oxygen from the surface, some small loss features due to SnO modes still remain, but these are eliminated by heating to 1100 K.

This document describes the investigation of the adsorption and reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy using various spectroscopic techniques. The key findings are summarized as follows:

1. **Adsorption and Bonding of NO2**: NO2 adsorbs in the monolayer on the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K as an upright NN bonded, N2O4 dimer. This was determined by analysis of the specular vibrational spectrum obtained by high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS).

2. **Surface Oxidation**: Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures, producing an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species exhibiting a (4 × 4) LEED pattern.

3. **Maximum Oxygen Coverage**: The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was θO=0.4 ML. Heating to 900 K leaves θO = 0.2 ML at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species.

4. **Increased Oxygen Coverage**: Oxygen coverage can be increased by NO2 exposures on the alloy at higher temperatures, reaching θO=1.1 ML after a higher NO2 exposure on the alloy at 600 K, which is above the desorption temperature of NO but below that required for O2 desorption.

5. **Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Approach**: The integrated use of theoretical calculations and experimental techniques such as temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) helps predict the adsorption kinetics and decomposition reactions, thereby informing the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

本文描述了在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上氮氧化物（NO2）吸附和反应的调查，使用了各种光谱技术。主要发现总结如下：

1. **NO2的吸附与结合**：在120 K时，NO2在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金的单层上以垂直的NN键合、N2O4二聚体形式吸附。通过高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）分析确定了这一结果。

2. **表面氧化**：在220至300 K之间，NO2在3合金上的分解释放出表面氧和共吸附的NO。表面氧在较高温度下氧化Sn，在3合金上产生一个有序的Sn1.5O层，表现为（4×4）LEED模式。

3. **最大氧覆盖率**：加热N2O4单层的最大氧覆盖率为θO=0.4 ML。加热到900 K后，表面剩余的氧覆盖率为0.2 ML，对应于有序的Sn1.5O层。

4. **增加氧覆盖率**：通过在较高温度下对合金进行NO2暴露，可以获得更高的氧覆盖率，达到θO=1.1 ML。这是在600 K时对合金进行更高剂量NO2暴露的结果，此时NO的脱附温度高于O2但低于O2脱附所需的温度。

5. **理论与实验方法的综合应用**：理论计算和实验技术（如温度程序脱附（TPD）、Auger电子能谱（AES）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和低能电子衍射（LEED））的综合使用有助于预测吸附动力学和分解反应，从而指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。
