[1] "The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML."
[2] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[3] "The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was θO=0.4 ML."
[4] "Heating this chemisorbed layer to 300 K breaks the NN bond and vibrations assigned to coadsorbed NO2, NO and O are observed."
[5] "After heating to 900 K, which desorbs some oxygen from the surface, some small loss features due to SnO modes still remain, but these are eliminated by heating to 1100 K."

1. The maximum oxygen coverage reached by heating the N2O4 monolayer was 0.4 ML.
2. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs in three distinct stages, including from Pt sites and decomposition of SnOx.
3. The maximum oxygen coverage achieved by heating the N2O4 monolayer was 0.4 ML.
4. Heating the chemisorbed layer to 300 K causes the breaking of the NN bond and reveals the presence of NO2, NO, and O vibrations.
5. Heating the surface to 1100 K eliminates residual SnO vibrations after some oxygen has been desorbed.

1. 加热N2O4单层后，最大氧覆盖度为0.4 ML。
2. 吸附氧在三个清晰的脱附状态下脱附，其中最低的是从Pt位点脱附，其他两个是还原锡氧化物相的分解。
3. 加热N2O4单层后达到的最大氧覆盖度为0.4 ML。
4. 将此化学吸附层加热至300 K会导致NN键断裂，并观察到NO2、NO和O振动。
5. 将表面加热至1100 K可以消除部分氧气被脱附后剩余的SnO振动。
