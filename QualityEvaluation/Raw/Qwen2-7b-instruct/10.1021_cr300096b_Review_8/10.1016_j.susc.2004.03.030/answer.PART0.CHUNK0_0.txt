<p>At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry.</p>
<p>The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface.</p>
<p>Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K.</p>
<p>Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx.</p>
<p>Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation.</p>
<p>After a small initial NO2 dose, O2 desorption occurred at 1070 K in a peak that shifts to 1077 K at saturation.</p>
<p>Following saturation of the high temperature peak, a second feature appeared at lower temperature with a broad peak at 910 K after large exposures.</p>
<p>Our explanation of these two peaks is that the 1077-K peak is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOSn species and the peak at 910 K is due to O2 desorption from reduction of SnOPt species.</p>
<p>The NO2 coverage scale was determined by calibration using the chemisorbed NO2, NO, and O2 TPD peak areas after NO2 adsorption on clean Pt(1 1 1).</p>
<p>No shift in the Pt(NOO) AES peak at 237 eV was ever observed during NO2 adsorption at 120 K or after annealing.</p>
<p>The 3 alloy was probed by LEED following a 0.1 L (2 ML) dose of NO2 on the sample at 120 K.</p>
<p>The sample was heated to the indicated temperature for 30 s in each case and then re-cooled to 120 K and the spectra taken.</p>
<p>For the multilayer film at 120 K, loss peaks corresponding to the ONO symmetric (νs,NO2) and asymmetric (νas,NO2) stretching modes of the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, appear at 1275 and 1795 cm1, respectively.</p>
<p>When the surface is annealed to 175 or 220 K, which desorbs any physisorbed multilayer species as shown in Fig. 1 , surprisingly little change occurred in the HREELS spectra other than decreases in peak intensities consistent with some NO2 desorption.</p>
<p>Vibrational losses observed at 1275 and near 869 cm1 indicate that some molecularly adsorbed NO2 remains on the surface.</p>
<p>After heating to 900 K, which desorbs some oxygen from the surface, some small loss features due to SnO modes still remain, but these are eliminated by heating to 1100 K.</p>

The document describes the adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at various temperatures. At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed as a molecular dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom. The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at higher temperatures. The document also discusses the desorption of NO2 and O2, with the latter occurring in three distinct desorption states, one of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites, and the other two from the decomposition of reduced tin oxide phases, SnOx. The Sn oxidation is followed by shifts in the Sn AES peaks. Oxygen is liberated from the surface at higher temperatures, with the maximum coverage obtained being 0.4 ML by heating the N2O4 monolayer. Further heating increases the oxygen coverage to 1.1 ML by removing inhibition from coadsorbed NO. The document also covers the vibrational analysis of NO2 adsorption on the surface using HREELS, the desorption of NO2 and O2, and the oxidation of the surface, particularly the Sn component.

文档描述了在120 K温度下氮氧化物（NO2）在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附。在120 K时，NO2以分子二聚体N2O4的形式吸附到表面，并通过单个氧原子与表面相互作用。该二聚体在300 K时完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O在较高温度下。文档还讨论了NO2和O2的脱附，后者在三种不同的脱附状态下发生，其中一种与Pt位点相关的O2脱附相关，其他两种则来自于氧化锡相的分解。通过改变AES峰值，跟踪了Sn的氧化。在较高温度下，从表面释放出了氧气，最大覆盖度达到0.4 ML通过加热N2O4单层获得。进一步加热通过移除抑制因素CO2，将氧气覆盖度增加到1.1 ML。文档还涵盖了使用HREELS对表面NO2吸附的振动分析，NO2和O2的脱附，以及表面，特别是Sn成分的氧化。
