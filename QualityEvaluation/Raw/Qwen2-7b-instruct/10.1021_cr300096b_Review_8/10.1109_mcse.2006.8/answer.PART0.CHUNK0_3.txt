<p>Although most of the ideas behind networking are relatively straightforward, several interesting technical and business decisions must be made as an ongoing part of the process.</p>
<p>In this first installment of what I hope turns into a discussion about more advanced applications, the focus is on revealing the secrets in a typical home router/switch. (Here, a router has both switching and routing functions).</p>
<p>Published in: Computing in Science & Engineering ( Volume: 8, Issue: 1, Jan.-Feb. 2006) Page(s): 84 - 91 Date of Publication: 27 December 2005</p>
<p>Most routers are smart enough to accommodate any of the private IP ranges in Table 1, but some older routers will limit you to a class C style 192.168.X subnet with the ability to set X (this still works well for most purposes).</p>
<p>After talking to him, though, I realized that, for most people in the US today, the home computer setup is basically a small office/home office environment. Even those of us without small businesses have small-business-like interests. We work from home, bring work home, play from home, and occasionally sleep at home, too.</p>

<p>My piano tuner is still mulling over the possibilities. After talking to him, though, I realized that, for most people in the US today, the home computer setup is basically a small office/home office environment.</p>
<p>For the record, you don't really get to use the complete address space in a network anyway; you can't use.255 to address individual hosts within the intranet, for example, because it's part of the Internet masking strategy.</p>
<p>Home network routers provide support for network address translation (NAT; http://computer.howstuffworks.com/nat2.htm), which rewrites the source address from any originating IP packet to appear to originate from the router's public address.</p>
<p>Most routers feature an embedded Web server to enable configuration from any computer plugged into one of the router's external Ethernet ports.</p>
<p>When you realize that a project of this scale could be organized and performed entirely in cyberspace, it shows you how profoundly the world has changed.</p>
<p>I've used the Linux box as a DHCP server, and it works quite well.</p>
<p>Once you've established that you have connectivity, it's time to think about how you want to organize your LAN.</p>
<p>The DHCP configuration file is called dhcpd.conf and is usually found in /etc/dhcpd.conf.</p>
<p>You can set any address family you want and use netmasking to subnet within the address family.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, I want to address approximately 216 hosts using a 10. addressor 10.1.* addresses. To do this, I would use 10.1.0.1 as the IP address and 255.255.0.0 as the netmask.</p>
<p>To reveal the Ethernet (or MAC) address for all attached Ethernet adapters on Linux and Windows, you can use the ifconfig-a and ipconfig /all commands, respectively.</p>
<p>What have we accomplished at this point? I can now access ports 22 and 80 through the public IP address (24.14.197.59) assigned by my ISP, and voila! I can now SSH into this box.</p>
<p>Dynamic DNS I rarely do product placements in CiSE, but I can't help myself when the company is truly providing a community service with no apparent strings attached. That company is DynDNS (www.technopagan.org/dynamic/), and it provides a free dynamic DNS (DDNS) hosting solution service to home users who need a way to reach their home setup, even when the IP address changes.</p>
<p>Your router might not provide support for DDNS for the same reasons it might not provide full support for DHCP.</p>
<p>At this point, you can repeat the same SSH and Web exercises using SSH for gkt@gkt.is-a-geek.org and http://gkt.is-a-geek.org; I won't recapture the proof screens here.</p>
