<p>Although most of the ideas behind networking are relatively straightforward, several interesting technical and business decisions must be made as an ongoing part of the process.</p>
<p>In this first installment of what I hope turns into a discussion about more advanced applications, the focus is on revealing the secrets in a typical home router/switch. (Here, a router has both switching and routing functions).</p>
<p>Even those of us without small businesses have small-business-like interests. We work from home, bring work home, play from home, and occasionally sleep at home, too.</p>
<p>Home Network Essentially, a home network is a private Internet or intranet.</p>
<p>The first step is to connect to the router. Most routers feature an embedded Web server to enable configuration from any computer plugged into one of the router's external Ethernet ports.</p>
<p>Once you're connected to the router, you'll want to check your network settings.</p>
<p>For the most part, the act of plugging an Ethernet cable (CAT 5, 5e, or 6) into a WAN port and connecting it to a DSL router/cable modem will result in a correctly populated basic network settings form.</p>
<p>At the risk of being obvious, let's start from the beginning, even though many of you might have already set up a router at home.</p>
<p>For the most part, the act of plugging an Ethernet cable (CAT 5, 5e, or 6) into a WAN port and connecting it to a DSL router/cable modem will result in a correctly populated basic network settings form (available on every router I've ever seen).</p>
<p>To configure a router, you must point to its IP address, which is likely to be http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>Most routers are smart enough to accommodate any of the private IP ranges in Table 1, but some older routers will limit you to a class C style 192.168.X subnet with the ability to set X (this still works well for most purposes).</p>
<p>IP Address Management Once you've decided how to allocate IP addresses on your network, you must complete a bit of unfinished business: How will you actually know what addresses are being used?</p>
<p>Dynamic DNS I rarely do product placements in CiSE, but I can't help myself when the company is truly providing a community service with no apparent strings attached. That company is DynDNS (www.technopagan.org/dynamic/), and it provides a free dynamic DNS (DDNS) hosting solution service to home users who need a way to reach their home setup, even when the IP address changes.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this service, you first establish a free account and then add the DynDNS service.</p>
<p>Your router might not provide support for DDNS for the same reasons it might not provide full support for DHCP.</p>

The document provides insights into the process of setting up and configuring a home network, including steps like connecting to the router, checking network settings, and allocating IP addresses. It also discusses the importance of understanding DNS settings and offers a recommendation for DynDNS as a free service to manage IP address changes, particularly useful for dynamic IP setups.
