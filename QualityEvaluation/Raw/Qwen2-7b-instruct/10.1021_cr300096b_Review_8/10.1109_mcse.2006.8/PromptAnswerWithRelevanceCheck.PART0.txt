How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<p>Although most of the ideas behind networking are relatively straightforward, several interesting technical and business decisions must be made as an ongoing part of the process.</p>
<p>In this first installment of what I hope turns into a discussion about more advanced applications, the focus is on revealing the secrets in a typical home router/switch. (Here, a router has both switching and routing functions).</p>
<p>Even those of us without small businesses have small-business-like interests. We work from home, bring work home, play from home, and occasionally sleep at home, too.</p>
<p>Home Network Essentially, a home network is a private Internet or intranet.</p>
<p>The first step is to connect to the router. Most routers feature an embedded Web server to enable configuration from any computer plugged into one of the router's external Ethernet ports.</p>
<p>Once you're connected to the router, you'll want to check your network settings.</p>
<p>For the most part, the act of plugging an Ethernet cable (CAT 5, 5e, or 6) into a WAN port and connecting it to a DSL router/cable modem will result in a correctly populated basic network settings form.</p>
<p>At the risk of being obvious, let's start from the beginning, even though many of you might have already set up a router at home.</p>
<p>For the most part, the act of plugging an Ethernet cable (CAT 5, 5e, or 6) into a WAN port and connecting it to a DSL router/cable modem will result in a correctly populated basic network settings form (available on every router I've ever seen).</p>
<p>To configure a router, you must point to its IP address, which is likely to be http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>Most routers are smart enough to accommodate any of the private IP ranges in Table 1, but some older routers will limit you to a class C style 192.168.X subnet with the ability to set X (this still works well for most purposes).</p>
<p>IP Address Management Once you've decided how to allocate IP addresses on your network, you must complete a bit of unfinished business: How will you actually know what addresses are being used?</p>
<p>Dynamic DNS I rarely do product placements in CiSE, but I can't help myself when the company is truly providing a community service with no apparent strings attached. That company is DynDNS (www.technopagan.org/dynamic/), and it provides a free dynamic DNS (DDNS) hosting solution service to home users who need a way to reach their home setup, even when the IP address changes.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this service, you first establish a free account and then add the DynDNS service.</p>
<p>Your router might not provide support for DDNS for the same reasons it might not provide full support for DHCP.</p>
</quotes>

The document provides insights into the process of setting up and configuring a home network, including steps like connecting to the router, checking network settings, and allocating IP addresses. It also discusses the importance of understanding DNS settings and offers a recommendation for DynDNS as a free service to manage IP address changes, particularly useful for dynamic IP setups.

<p>For the record, you don't really get to use the complete address space in a network anyway; you can't use.255 to address individual hosts within the intranet, for example, because it's part of the Internet masking strategy.</p>

How do you configure a router to manage the IP address space of a typical home network, and what are the steps involved in setting up dynamic IP addresses and dynamic DNS?

To configure a router for a typical home network, you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect to the router using its embedded web server, usually accessible via the IP address `http://192.168.0.1` or `http://192.168.1.1`.
2. Check and possibly update the network settings, such as the public IP address provided by your internet service provider.
3. Set up the local-area network (LAN) IP address space management to define the private addressing scheme.
4. Allocate IP addresses for devices connected to the network. For static allocation, manually assign IP addresses to devices. For dynamic allocation, utilize DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to assign IP addresses automatically to devices.
5. Enable address reservation to ensure permanent IP addresses for specific devices, especially those without manual configuration options, such as network printers.
6. Configure port forwarding to allow inbound access to selected services, such as SSH or HTTP, through the router. This enables remote access to devices within the network.
7. Implement dynamic DNS (DDNS) to maintain a consistent hostname that can resolve to the changing public IP address provided by your ISP, ensuring easy and stable access to your home network from the internet.

These steps help in managing the IP address space efficiently, providing network connectivity, and maintaining a stable online presence for home networks.

如何配置路由器管理家庭网络的IP地址空间，以及设置动态IP地址和动态DNS的步骤是什么？

为了配置典型的家庭网络路由器，需要遵循以下步骤：

1. 使用嵌入式Web服务器连接到路由器，通常可以通过IP地址`http://192.168.0.1`或`http://192.168.1.1`进行访问。
2. 检查并可能更新网络设置，例如互联网服务提供商提供的公共IP地址。
3. 设置本地网络（LAN）IP地址空间管理以定义私有地址方案。
4. 为连接到网络的设备分配IP地址。对于静态分配，手动为设备分配IP地址。对于动态分配，使用DHCP（动态主机配置协议）自动为设备分配IP地址。
5. 启用地址保留确保特定设备具有永久的IP地址，特别是那些没有手动配置选项的设备，如网络打印机。
6. 配置端口转发允许通过路由器的内部设备进行入站访问，如SSH或HTTP，这使得远程访问网络中的设备成为可能。
7. 实施动态DNS（DDNS），以保持一致的主机名，即使ISP提供的公共IP地址发生变化也能继续解析，从而确保从互联网稳定地访问家庭网络。

这些步骤有助于高效管理IP地址空间、提供网络连接，并维持家庭网络的稳定在线存在。
