[1] "Several parallels between model surfaces and supported catalysts can be drawn based on the results presented above. First, in the study of model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions."
[2] "Inspecting the spectra for the three bimetallic catalysts with increasing amounts of Ni, it is seen that at lower Ni loadings (Pt:Ni = 1:1, 1:3), the peaks associated with bridge-bound CO appear at frequencies similar to the CO bridge binding sites on 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, suggesting that CO is adsorbed on Pt atoms. However, on 1Pt10Ni/γ-Al2O3, the bridge-bound CO frequency is similar to that on 10Ni/γ-Al2O3, suggesting that CO is most likely adsorbed on Ni atoms."
[3] "This work does not include an analysis of the selectivity of the catalysts, but the production and consumption of 1-butene and the production of n-butane are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 8, Fig. 9, respectively."
[4] "Similar to benzene hydrogenation, the following trend in rate constants is observed in the effect of Pt:Ni ratio: 10Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt1Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt10Ni/γ-Al2O3. In the study of impregnation sequence, the rate constants follow the trend of 3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 3Ni1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt3Ni(co-imp)/γ-Al2O3, which is also similar to the trend observed for benzene hydrogenation."
[5] "The correlations between the model surfaces and supported catalysts provide a useful example of how better hydrogenation catalysts can potentially be designed based on information from DFT modeling and surface science studies."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The study found that the hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading, and that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity compared to sequentially impregnated catalysts. The activity was also seen to correlate with PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements.

对于Pt-3d催化剂上各种C═C键含分子的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果之间存在关联。这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以预测氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。研究发现，随着Ni负载量的增加，氢化活性也随之提高。同时，通过共浸渍合成的催化剂表现出最高活性，相较于顺序浸渍的催化剂。活性也与从EXAFS测量得到的PtNi配位数成正比。
