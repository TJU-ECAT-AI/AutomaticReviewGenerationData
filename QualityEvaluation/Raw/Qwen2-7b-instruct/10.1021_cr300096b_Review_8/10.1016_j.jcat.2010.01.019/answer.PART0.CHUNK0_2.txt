[1] "The results presented in this paper clearly show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds."
[2] "It is very interesting to note that the increasing activity in each series of catalysts also corresponds to an increasing number of PtNi nearest neighbors from EXAFS, confirming conclusively that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of the PtNi bimetallic bond formation."

The document elucidates that bimetallic catalysts demonstrate superior hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts when dealing with the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds. The observed enhancement in activity is directly proportional to the increase in the number of PtNi nearest neighbors, as determined through EXAFS analysis, thus affirmatively linking the hydrogenation activity to the degree of PtNi bimetallic bond formation.

文档说明，双金属催化剂在进行共轭CC键氢化时表现出高于单金属催化剂的活性。观察到的活性增加与EXAFS分析中PtNi最近邻数量的增加成正比，这肯定地证明了氢化活性直接与PtNi双金属键形成程度相关。
