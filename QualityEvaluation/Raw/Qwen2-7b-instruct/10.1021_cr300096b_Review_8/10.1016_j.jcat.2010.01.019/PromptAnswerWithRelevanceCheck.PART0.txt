[1] "The results presented in this paper clearly show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds."
[2] "It is very interesting to note that the increasing activity in each series of catalysts also corresponds to an increasing number of PtNi nearest neighbors from EXAFS, confirming conclusively that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of the PtNi bimetallic bond formation."

This research demonstrates that bimetallic catalysts, specifically those containing a combination of platinum (Pt) and nickel (Ni), exhibit higher hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts when hydrogenating conjugated C=C bonds. The enhancement in activity is directly linked to the degree of bimetallic bond formation between Pt and Ni atoms, as evidenced by the number of PtNi nearest neighbors as determined by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) measurements. The increasing activity across different catalyst formulations correlates with an increase in the number of PtNi bonds, affirming that the extent of bimetallic interaction significantly influences catalytic performance.

本文研究表明，双金属催化剂，特别是铂（Pt）和镍（Ni）的组合，对于共轭C=C键的氢化反应，其活性高于相应的单金属催化剂。活性的提升直接与Pt和Ni原子之间的双金属键形成程度相关，通过扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）测量可以得到PtNi最近邻的数量。在不同催化剂配方中观察到的活性增加与PtNi键数量的增加成正比，这证实了双金属相互作用的程度显著影响催化性能。

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predicting hydrogenation activity and informing the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The structure of bimetallic surfaces influences electronic and catalytic properties, which can impact the activity of catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The migration of Ni monolayers and the effect of impregnation sequence on catalyst activity are key factors. The EXAFS and TEM analyses provide insights into the extent of bimetallic formation and particle size, which are crucial for understanding catalyst performance. The rate constants obtained from fitting the experimental data with first-order kinetics are essential for quantitatively evaluating the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts.

The document elucidates that bimetallic catalysts demonstrate superior hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts when dealing with the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds. The observed enhancement in activity is directly proportional to the increase in the number of PtNi nearest neighbors, as determined through EXAFS analysis, thus affirmatively linking the hydrogenation activity to the degree of PtNi bimetallic bond formation.

<p>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. For instance, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure is found to be stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen; however, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni atoms will segregate to the surface to create the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>The results found here for CO adsorption on the supported Pt/Ni catalysts are also in agreement with several other findings in literature. In our previous work studying the disproportionation of cyclohexene on monolayer bimetallic surfaces, it was found that disproportionation only took place on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to note that the increasing activity in each series of catalysts also corresponds to an increasing number of PtNi nearest neighbors from EXAFS, confirming conclusively that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of the PtNi bimetallic bond formation.</p>

The document discusses how the migration of Ni atoms under certain conditions and the presence of PtNi bimetallic bonds influence the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni catalysts. It explains that Ni atoms can segregate to the surface when exposed to specific adsorbates, such as oxygen. Furthermore, the study finds that the hydrogenation activity increases with the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which is confirmed by the number of PtNi nearest neighbors detected through EXAFS analysis.

This integrated approach combining experimental observations and theoretical predictions can help predict the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts and inform the design of more efficient catalyst systems. The results highlight the importance of considering both the surface properties and the bonding nature of bimetallic catalysts in designing materials with optimized catalytic performance.

文献讨论了Ni原子在特定条件下迁移以及PtNi双金属键的存在如何影响Pt/Ni催化剂的氢化活性。它解释说，当暴露于特定吸附剂（如氧气）时，Ni原子可以迁移到表面。此外，研究发现氢化活性随着PtNi双金属键的形成而增加，这一点通过EXAFS分析检测到的PtNi最近邻的数量得到了证实。

这种结合实验观察和理论预测的方法有助于预测Pt-3d催化剂的氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的催化剂系统。结果强调了在设计具有优化催化性能的材料时考虑催化剂表面特性和键合性质的重要性。

[1] "Several parallels between model surfaces and supported catalysts can be drawn based on the results presented above. First, in the study of model Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, it was found that Pt atoms would segregate to the surface under reduction conditions."
[2] "Inspecting the spectra for the three bimetallic catalysts with increasing amounts of Ni, it is seen that at lower Ni loadings (Pt:Ni = 1:1, 1:3), the peaks associated with bridge-bound CO appear at frequencies similar to the CO bridge binding sites on 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, suggesting that CO is adsorbed on Pt atoms. However, on 1Pt10Ni/γ-Al2O3, the bridge-bound CO frequency is similar to that on 10Ni/γ-Al2O3, suggesting that CO is most likely adsorbed on Ni atoms."
[3] "This work does not include an analysis of the selectivity of the catalysts, but the production and consumption of 1-butene and the production of n-butane are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 8, Fig. 9, respectively."
[4] "Similar to benzene hydrogenation, the following trend in rate constants is observed in the effect of Pt:Ni ratio: 10Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt1Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt10Ni/γ-Al2O3. In the study of impregnation sequence, the rate constants follow the trend of 3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 3Ni1Pt/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt3Ni/γ-Al2O3 < 1Pt3Ni(co-imp)/γ-Al2O3, which is also similar to the trend observed for benzene hydrogenation."
[5] "The correlations between the model surfaces and supported catalysts provide a useful example of how better hydrogenation catalysts can potentially be designed based on information from DFT modeling and surface science studies."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The study found that the hydrogenation activity increased with increasing Ni loading, and that the catalyst synthesized by co-impregnation exhibited the highest activity compared to sequentially impregnated catalysts. The activity was also seen to correlate with PtNi coordination numbers calculated from EXAFS measurements.
