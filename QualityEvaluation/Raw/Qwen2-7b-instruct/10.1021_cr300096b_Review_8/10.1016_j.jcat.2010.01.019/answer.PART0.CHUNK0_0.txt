[1] "The results presented in this paper clearly show that bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of conjugated CC bonds."
[2] "It is very interesting to note that the increasing activity in each series of catalysts also corresponds to an increasing number of PtNi nearest neighbors from EXAFS, confirming conclusively that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of the PtNi bimetallic bond formation."

This research demonstrates that bimetallic catalysts, specifically those containing a combination of platinum (Pt) and nickel (Ni), exhibit higher hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts when hydrogenating conjugated C=C bonds. The enhancement in activity is directly linked to the degree of bimetallic bond formation between Pt and Ni atoms, as evidenced by the number of PtNi nearest neighbors as determined by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) measurements. The increasing activity across different catalyst formulations correlates with an increase in the number of PtNi bonds, affirming that the extent of bimetallic interaction significantly influences catalytic performance.

本文研究表明，双金属催化剂，特别是铂（Pt）和镍（Ni）的组合，对于共轭C=C键的氢化反应，其活性高于相应的单金属催化剂。活性的提升直接与Pt和Ni原子之间的双金属键形成程度相关，通过扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）测量可以得到PtNi最近邻的数量。在不同催化剂配方中观察到的活性增加与PtNi键数量的增加成正比，这证实了双金属相互作用的程度显著影响催化性能。
