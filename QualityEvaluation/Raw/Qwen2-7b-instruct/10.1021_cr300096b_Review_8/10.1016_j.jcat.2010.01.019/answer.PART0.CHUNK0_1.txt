<p>Recently, the structure of bimetallic surfaces has been found to influence electronic and catalytic properties.</p>
<p>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates.</p>
<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the extent of bimetallic formation and particle size, respectively.</p>
<p>The results from the fitting procedure are summarized in Table 4.</p>
<p>The effect of impregnation sequence and metal atomic ratio can also be seen in Table 4.</p>
<p>Approximating the experimental rates of 1,3-butadiene conversion with first-order kinetics yields the rate constants listed in Table 5.</p>

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predicting hydrogenation activity and informing the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The structure of bimetallic surfaces influences electronic and catalytic properties, which can impact the activity of catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The migration of Ni monolayers and the effect of impregnation sequence on catalyst activity are key factors. The EXAFS and TEM analyses provide insights into the extent of bimetallic formation and particle size, which are crucial for understanding catalyst performance. The rate constants obtained from fitting the experimental data with first-order kinetics are essential for quantitatively evaluating the hydrogenation activity of the catalysts.

对于各种含C═C键分子（包括线性烯烃、环烷烃和芳烃）在Pt-3d催化剂表面的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果相吻合。理论与实验相结合的方法可以预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。双金属表面的结构会影响电子和催化性质，进而影响氢化反应中的催化剂活性。Ni单层的迁移和浸渍顺序对催化剂活性的影响是关键因素。EXAFS和TEM分析为了解双金属形成程度和颗粒尺寸提供了见解，这些是理解催化剂性能的关键。通过拟合实验数据使用一级动力学方法获得的速率常数对于定量评估催化剂的氢化活性至关重要。
