<p>Combined experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic stability of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer bimetallic surfaces reveal that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates. For instance, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure is found to be stable either in vacuum or with adsorbed atomic hydrogen; however, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, Ni atoms will segregate to the surface to create the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>In a previous study on Pt/Ni catalysts, it was reported that the activities for the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene could be affected by whether Ni or Pt was impregnated first.</p>
<p>The results found here for CO adsorption on the supported Pt/Ni catalysts are also in agreement with several other findings in literature. In our previous work studying the disproportionation of cyclohexene on monolayer bimetallic surfaces, it was found that disproportionation only took place on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to note that the increasing activity in each series of catalysts also corresponds to an increasing number of PtNi nearest neighbors from EXAFS, confirming conclusively that the hydrogenation activity is directly related to the extent of the PtNi bimetallic bond formation.</p>

The document discusses how the migration of Ni atoms under certain conditions and the presence of PtNi bimetallic bonds influence the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni catalysts. It explains that Ni atoms can segregate to the surface when exposed to specific adsorbates, such as oxygen. Furthermore, the study finds that the hydrogenation activity increases with the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which is confirmed by the number of PtNi nearest neighbors detected through EXAFS analysis.

This integrated approach combining experimental observations and theoretical predictions can help predict the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts and inform the design of more efficient catalyst systems. The results highlight the importance of considering both the surface properties and the bonding nature of bimetallic catalysts in designing materials with optimized catalytic performance.

文献讨论了Ni原子在特定条件下迁移以及PtNi双金属键的存在如何影响Pt/Ni催化剂的氢化活性。它解释说，当暴露于特定吸附剂（如氧气）时，Ni原子可以迁移到表面。此外，研究发现氢化活性随着PtNi双金属键的形成而增加，这一点通过EXAFS分析检测到的PtNi最近邻的数量得到了证实。

这种结合实验观察和理论预测的方法有助于预测Pt-3d催化剂的氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的催化剂系统。结果强调了在设计具有优化催化性能的材料时考虑催化剂表面特性和键合性质的重要性。
