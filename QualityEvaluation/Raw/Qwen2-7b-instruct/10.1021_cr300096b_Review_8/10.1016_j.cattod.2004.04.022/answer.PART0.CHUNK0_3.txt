[1] "In recent years, the development of cleaner burning fuels has been of very high priority."
[2] "World Wide Fuel Charter and European automobile manufactures association (ACEA) [2] have proposed slightly different requirements from those expected by Auto Oil [3] and Comitee European de Normalisation (CEN) [4] , but the direction is the same."
[3] "However, because noble metal catalysts are easily poisoned by small amounts of sulphur, the hydrodesulfurisation catalyst in the first stage reactor reduces the level of sulphur upto a few ppm."
[4] "The results obtained for benzene and toluene hydrogenation showed that hydrogenation activity was highly improved in the presence of F and Cl [12]."
[5] "The aim of this work was to characterise the nature of the oxide precursors of some Ni, Pt and Ni-Pt catalysts supported on SiO2 and TiO2-SiO2, to investigate their susceptibility to reduction and activity in the reaction of toluene hydrogenation to methylcyclohexane."

The document does not contain information on how DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, nor does it provide a detailed explanation on how this integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The focus of the document is on the characterization and catalytic performance of Ni, Pt, and Ni-Pt catalysts supported on SiO2 and TiO2-SiO2 in the hydrogenation of toluene and diesel oil fractions.

文档没有提供关于DFT计算的表面d能带中心和吸附剂结合能如何与TPD测量等技术的实验观察相关联的信息，也没有详细解释如何将这种理论和实验集成方法用于预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。该文档的重点是研究在SiO2和支持在SiO2-TiO2上的Ni、Pt和Ni-Pt催化剂对甲苯氢化性能的表征和催化性能。
