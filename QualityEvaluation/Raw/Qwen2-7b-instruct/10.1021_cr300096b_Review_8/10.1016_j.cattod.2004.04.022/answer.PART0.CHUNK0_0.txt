The document discusses the use of platinum to improve the hydrogenation activity of nickel catalysts. Platinum promotes the reducibility of nickel oxide, leading to higher dispersion and thus higher catalytic activity when supported on binary supports like TiO2-SiO2. Bimetallic Ni-Pt catalysts with around 0.5 wt.% platinum exhibit greater hydrogenation activity than comparable monometallic platinum catalysts.

文档讨论了铂在提高镍催化剂氢化活性中的应用。铂促进了镍氧化物的还原性，导致在二元支持如TiO2-SiO2上具有更高的分散性和催化活性。含有约0.5 wt.%铂的双金属Ni-Pt催化剂比等量铂的单一金属铂催化剂具有更高的氢化活性。
