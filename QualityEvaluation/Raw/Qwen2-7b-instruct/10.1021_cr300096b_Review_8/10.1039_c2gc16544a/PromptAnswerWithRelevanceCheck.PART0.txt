How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

<p>The additions of Co and Ni into Pt not only improve the overall HDO conversion, but also modify the product distribution. The enhancement in the overall HDO activity is related to the better hydrogenation activity of bimetallic PtCo and PtNi catalysts and the generation of additional sites for alcohol dehydration. Consequently, more saturated cyclic hydrocarbon product, methylcyclohexane, is observed on bimetallic catalysts with respect to the monometallic Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The bimetallic PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts not only increase the overall HDO conversion, but also modify the product distribution. The rate of formation of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon, methylcyclohexane, is enhanced with respect to toluene. The total deoxygenation selectivity is also higher on the bimetallic catalysts due to the generation of additional sites suggested to be surface aluminate species between 3d metals and alumina support for alcohol dehydration.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst. In particular, the conversion rate of 1,4-cyclohexadiene normalized to the number of active sites is highest on bimetallic PtCo/Al2O3 than either PtNi/Al2O3 or Pt/Al2O3.</p>

This document provides evidence that the addition of Co and Ni to Pt catalysts enhances the hydrogenation activity and modifies product distributions. Specifically, it explains that the bimetallic PtCo and PtNi catalysts lead to higher overall HDO conversion and altered product selectivity. Methylcyclohexane is favored over toluene, and the total deoxygenation selectivity is improved due to the creation of additional sites for alcohol dehydration. These findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating increased hydrogenation rates on bimetallic Pt catalysts for specific hydrocarbon reactions.

[1] "The bimetallic effects in the hydrodeoxygenation of meta-cresol on γ-Al2O3 supported PtNi and PtCo catalysts...lead to the high selectivity to toluene over the hydrogenated cyclic hydrocarbon, methylcyclohexane, because toluene formation requires fewer hydrogenation steps than its counterpart."
[2] "DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation."
[3] "The additions of Co and Ni into Pt not only improve the overall HDO conversion, but also modify the product distribution."
[4] "The rate of formation of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon, methylcyclohexane, is enhanced with respect to toluene."
[5] "This study has successfully demonstrated that efficient catalysts for upgrading of phenolic compounds can be designed by tuning different catalyst active functions based on the knowledge of reaction mechanisms."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The DFT calculations indicate that the binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the PtCo and PtNi surfaces are optimized, correlating with their higher hydrogenation activity compared to the monometallic Pt surface. The bimetallic catalysts improve the overall HDO conversion and shift the product distribution towards saturated hydrocarbons, specifically enhancing the formation of methylcyclohexane relative to toluene. The research underscores the importance of tuning catalyst active functions, such as adjusting the metal composition, to efficiently upgrade phenolic compounds into more valuable hydrocarbon products based on a deep understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms.

<p>Noble metal catalysts generally exhibit higher rates of hydrogenation than hydrotreating catalysts; therefore, the phenolic compounds are suggested to undergo some degree of ring hydrogenation first, followed by oxygen elimination.</p>
<p>In this investigation, the γ-Al2O3 support acts as an excellent source of acid sites. The acidity of the alumina support has been proven by experimental and theoretical methods.</p>
<p>The γ-Al2O3 support contains mostly Lewis and a few Brnsted acid sites.</p>
<p>According to Iglesia et al., both sites can catalyze dehydration reactions of alcohols.</p>
<p>Kwak et al. have also shown that particular (100) facets on alumina are responsible for dehydration of alcohols.</p>
<p>When the acidity of the alumina support is suppressed via the incorporation of K into Pt/Al2O3, the dehydration reaction is impaired, leading to considerable accumulation of the alcohol intermediate.</p>
<p>The alloying of Co with Pt promotes not only methylcyclohexane formation but also the disappearance of the alcohol intermediate.</p>
<p>It is very likely that introduction of Co modified the γ-Al2O3 support such that more sites for alcohol dehydration are generated.</p>
<p>Previous reports have shown that Co and Ni interact strongly with alumina support.</p>
<p>Cobalt aluminate and similar species like zinc aluminate have been used as effective alcohol dehydration catalysts.</p>
<p>After the reduction process, there is still a fraction of the Co and Ni atoms strongly coordinated to alumina that remain unreduced. They could be the source of the additional sites for the alcohol dehydration reactions.</p>

The document discusses the hydrodeoxygenation of phenolic compounds using bimetallic catalysts on γ-Al2O3 supports. The key points are:

1. Noble metals like Pt show higher hydrogenation rates than hydrotreating catalysts, implying a sequence of ring hydrogenation followed by oxygen elimination.
2. The γ-Al2O3 support provides acid sites for dehydration reactions of alcohols, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical methods.
3. The support contains predominantly Lewis and some Brnsted acid sites.
4. Both types of sites can catalyze alcohol dehydration according to Iglesia et al.'s research.
5. Altering the acidity of the support through potassium incorporation impedes dehydration, accumulating the alcohol intermediate.
6. Cobalt in the bimetallic catalyst modifies the support, generating additional alcohol dehydration sites.
7. Co and Ni interact strongly with the alumina support, creating aluminate-like species.
8. Unreduced Co and Ni atoms on the support act as additional alcohol dehydration sites after reduction.

These insights suggest that modifying catalyst active functions based on reaction mechanisms can lead to more efficient catalyst design.

文档讨论了使用γ-Al2O3支持的双金属催化剂对酚类化合物的脱氧氢化。关键点如下：

1. 如铂这样的贵金属表现出比加氢处理催化剂更高的氢化速率，暗示了一个环氢化步骤随后是去氧的顺序。
2. γ-Al2O3支持提供了酸性位点用于醇的脱水反应，实验和理论方法均证实了这一点。
3. 支持体主要包含Lewis酸性和少量Brnsted酸性位点。
4. Iglesia等人的研究指出，两种类型的位点都能催化醇的脱水反应。
5. 支持体酸性的改变通过钾的引入阻碍了脱水反应，导致酒精中间体积累。
6. 在双金属催化剂中添加钴能够修改支持体，产生额外的醇脱水位点。
7. 钴和镍与氧化铝支持之间存在强烈的相互作用，形成了氧化铝类似物。
8. 未还原的钴和镍原子在还原后作为支持体上的额外醇脱水位点发挥作用。

这些见解表明，根据反应机理调整催化剂活性功能可以导致更高效的催化剂设计。
