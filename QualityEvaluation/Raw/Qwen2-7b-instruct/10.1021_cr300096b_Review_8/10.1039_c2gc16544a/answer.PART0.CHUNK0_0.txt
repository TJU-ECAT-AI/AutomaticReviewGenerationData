<p>The additions of Co and Ni into Pt not only improve the overall HDO conversion, but also modify the product distribution. The enhancement in the overall HDO activity is related to the better hydrogenation activity of bimetallic PtCo and PtNi catalysts and the generation of additional sites for alcohol dehydration. Consequently, more saturated cyclic hydrocarbon product, methylcyclohexane, is observed on bimetallic catalysts with respect to the monometallic Pt catalyst.</p>
<p>The bimetallic PtNi/Al2O3 and PtCo/Al2O3 catalysts not only increase the overall HDO conversion, but also modify the product distribution. The rate of formation of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon, methylcyclohexane, is enhanced with respect to toluene. The total deoxygenation selectivity is also higher on the bimetallic catalysts due to the generation of additional sites suggested to be surface aluminate species between 3d metals and alumina support for alcohol dehydration.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst. In particular, the conversion rate of 1,4-cyclohexadiene normalized to the number of active sites is highest on bimetallic PtCo/Al2O3 than either PtNi/Al2O3 or Pt/Al2O3.</p>

This document provides evidence that the addition of Co and Ni to Pt catalysts enhances the hydrogenation activity and modifies product distributions. Specifically, it explains that the bimetallic PtCo and PtNi catalysts lead to higher overall HDO conversion and altered product selectivity. Methylcyclohexane is favored over toluene, and the total deoxygenation selectivity is improved due to the creation of additional sites for alcohol dehydration. These findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating increased hydrogenation rates on bimetallic Pt catalysts for specific hydrocarbon reactions.

本文提供了证据，证明在铂催化剂中添加钴和镍可以增强氢化活性并改变产品分布。具体而言，它解释了双金属铂钴和铂镍催化剂导致更高的整体HDO转化率和产品选择性的变化。甲基环己烷被优先于对二甲苯，总脱氧选择性也因酒精脱水反应产生的额外位点而得到改善。这些发现与先前的研究一致，这些研究表明特定烃类反应中双金属铂催化剂的氢化速率增加。
