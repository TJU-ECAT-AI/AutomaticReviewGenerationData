[1] "Previous studies have shown that bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts facilitate the hydrogenation activity in 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, and benzene reactions compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst."
[2] "These results are consistent with surface science studies and DFT calculations that correlate binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons with hydrogenation activity."
[3] "For example, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic surfaces are found to have optimal alkene binding energies, leading to higher hydrogenation activities than the monometallic Pt surface."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predictions of hydrogenation activity and guides the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. Specifically, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic surfaces demonstrate optimal alkene binding energies, leading to higher hydrogenation activities compared to the monometallic Pt surface.

DFT计算中，表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能与Pt-3d催化剂上各种C═C键含分子的实验观察结果一致，这些结果可以通过技术如TPD测量来验证。这种理论和实验相结合的方法能够预测氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。具体来说，PtCo和PtNi双金属表面显示出最优的烯烃结合能，导致与单一金属Pt表面相比具有更高的氢化活性。
