[1] "The bimetallic effects in the hydrodeoxygenation of meta-cresol on γ-Al2O3 supported PtNi and PtCo catalysts...lead to the high selectivity to toluene over the hydrogenated cyclic hydrocarbon, methylcyclohexane, because toluene formation requires fewer hydrogenation steps than its counterpart."
[2] "DFT calculations, these Pt-terminated surfaces bond hydrogen and hydrocarbon adsorbates more weakly than monometallic Pt surfaces, leading to optimized binding energies that are responsible for higher rates of hydrogenation."
[3] "The additions of Co and Ni into Pt not only improve the overall HDO conversion, but also modify the product distribution."
[4] "The rate of formation of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon, methylcyclohexane, is enhanced with respect to toluene."
[5] "This study has successfully demonstrated that efficient catalysts for upgrading of phenolic compounds can be designed by tuning different catalyst active functions based on the knowledge of reaction mechanisms."

The DFT calculations indicate that the binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the PtCo and PtNi surfaces are optimized, correlating with their higher hydrogenation activity compared to the monometallic Pt surface. The bimetallic catalysts improve the overall HDO conversion and shift the product distribution towards saturated hydrocarbons, specifically enhancing the formation of methylcyclohexane relative to toluene. The research underscores the importance of tuning catalyst active functions, such as adjusting the metal composition, to efficiently upgrade phenolic compounds into more valuable hydrocarbon products based on a deep understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms.

DFT计算表明，PtCo和PtNi表面的不饱和烃吸附物的结合能优化，与它们相对于单金属Pt表面的更高氢化活性相吻合。双金属催化剂不仅提高了整体HDO转化率，还改变了产物分布，特别促进了甲基环己烷的形成，相对降低了对苯的形成。研究强调了根据反应机理调整催化剂活性功能的重要性，通过调整金属组成设计出高效地将酚类化合物升级为更有价值的烃类产品。
