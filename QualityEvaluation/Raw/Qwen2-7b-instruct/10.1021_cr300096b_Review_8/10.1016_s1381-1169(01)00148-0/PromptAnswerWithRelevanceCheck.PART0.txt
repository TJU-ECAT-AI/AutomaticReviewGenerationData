How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

The first clear realization that chemical reaction between two gaseous reactants can occur at a metal surface, without the latter being chemically unchanged,is due to Humphrey Davy in 1817.

At the beginning, the behavior of alloys catalysts was interpreted by both the electronic theory of catalysis and the Rigid Band Theory (RBT) of alloys.

It was shown that a large number of reactions exists for which the rate per unit of catalyst area depends on the superficial structure of a catalyst with a given chemical composition.

It is worth noting that industrially a large majority of deposition methods involve aqueous solutions and liquidsolid interface.

In PdFe/Al2O3 prepared from NSD of inorganic salts,fully reduced PdFe alloys and Fe3+ coexist.

The following equilibria exist in aqueous solution: Surf-OH2+ + OH= Surf-OH + H2O = Surf-O+ H3O+ (2)

The resulting surface charge, which arises from an excess of one type of charged site over the other, is a function of the solution pH.

The support surface acts as a supramolecular counter-anion.

The grafting of organometallic complexes on a sup-port can be achieved generally through the chemical reaction with surface hydroxyl groups, with the re-moval of one or more organic ligands from the inner coordination sphere of the metal complex.

The sequence of deposition of both TMCs is of no importance; however, co-exchange is generally preferred.

In the ion exchange, an electrostatic interaction occurs between transition metal ion (TMI) and the support after ex-change of TMC with H3O+ in the case of a positively charged surface: Pd(NH3)42+ + 2[Surf-OH3O+] = [Surf-O]2Pd(NH3)42+ + 2H3O+

The resulting ISI is generally strong and leads to nano-sized (12 nm) particles after acti-vation.

The homogeneous distribution of both TMIs of Pd and M through the grain of the support will be a key factor for their further interaction in the same aggregates.

A similar strength of interaction between both TMIs and support will promote this homogeneous distribution.

Providing the ion exchange capacity of the surface has not been exceeded, the sequence of deposition of both TMCs is of no importance.

Early interpretations of alloy catalyst behavior relied on the electronic theory of catalysis and the Rigid Band Theory (RBT) of alloys. Many reactions exhibit a rate dependent on the surface structure of the catalyst. Deposition methods typically involve aqueous solutions and liquid-solid interfaces, and ion exchange can lead to nano-sized particles after activation, promoting interaction between components in the same aggregates. The sequence of depositing both transition metal complexes (TMCs) is not crucial, but co-exchange is usually preferred.

清楚地认识到，当两种气体反应物在金属表面发生化学反应时，金属本身未发生化学变化的第一实例是由赫普里·戴维于1817年提出的。早期对合金催化剂行为的解释依赖于催化电子理论和合金的刚性带理论（RBT）。许多反应表现出与催化剂表面结构有关的速率。沉积方法通常涉及水溶液和液固界面。离子交换可以导致激活后纳米级的颗粒，促进组件在相同聚合体中的相互作用。两种过渡金属复合物（TMC）的沉积顺序并不重要，但共交换通常是首选。

The literature discusses the impact of a co-metal on palladium catalysts' performance in bimetallic systems. It explains that the enhancement of monometallic catalysts through the addition of a second metal can be understood through four aspects: electronic effects, geometric effects, the appearance of mixed sites, and the disappearance of the -PdH phase. The text highlights how preparation methods affect the chemical state and spatial distribution of both components in the catalyst. Furthermore, it provides a concise overview of how co-metal addition influences various crucial reactions, including selective hydrogenation of highly unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, hydrogenation of aromatics, hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing compounds, reactions involving carbon monoxide, and hydrodechlorination.

The influence of co-metal on the performance of Pd in bimetallic catalysts can be interpreted in terms of electronic, geometric effects, the occurrence of mixed sites, and the disappearance of the β-PdH phase. The type of co-metal's effect on Pd properties depends on the specific reaction being considered. For example, the sequence of depositing H2PdCl4 and FeCl3 can alter the proportion of Fe3+ in the catalyst.
