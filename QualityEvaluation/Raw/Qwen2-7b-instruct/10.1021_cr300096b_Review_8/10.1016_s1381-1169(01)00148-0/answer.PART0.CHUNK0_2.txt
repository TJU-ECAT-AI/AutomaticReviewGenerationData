[1] "An overview about the effect of co-metal on the performance of Pd in bimetallic catalysts is presented."
[2] "The promotion of monometallic catalysts by addition of a second metal is described from a general point of view in terms of: (i) electronic effects; (ii) geometric effects; (iii) the occurrence of mixed sites; and (iv) the disappearance of the -PdH phase."
[3] "The influence of preparation methods on the chemical state and the spatial distribution of both components are highlighted."
[4] "In the last part, a short overview is given about the influence of co-metal addition on some important reactions in which Pd is the reference active phase: (i) selective hydrogenation of highly unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons; (ii) hydrogenation of aromatics or hydrodearomatisation; (iii) hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing compounds; (iv) reactions involving CO; and (v) hydrodechlorination."

The literature discusses the impact of a co-metal on palladium catalysts' performance in bimetallic systems. It explains that the enhancement of monometallic catalysts through the addition of a second metal can be understood through four aspects: electronic effects, geometric effects, the appearance of mixed sites, and the disappearance of the -PdH phase. The text highlights how preparation methods affect the chemical state and spatial distribution of both components in the catalyst. Furthermore, it provides a concise overview of how co-metal addition influences various crucial reactions, including selective hydrogenation of highly unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, hydrogenation of aromatics, hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing compounds, reactions involving carbon monoxide, and hydrodechlorination.

文献讨论了共金属对钯基催化剂性能的影响。它解释了通过添加第二种金属增强单金属催化剂可以从四个方面理解：电子效应、几何效应、混合位点的出现和-PdH相的消失。文本强调了制备方法如何影响两种成分在催化剂中的化学状态和空间分布。此外，它提供了关于如何通过共金属添加影响各种关键反应的简要概述，包括高度不饱和脂肪烃的选择性氢化、芳烃的氢化或脱芳化、含氮化合物的氢化、涉及一氧化碳的反应以及氢氯化。
