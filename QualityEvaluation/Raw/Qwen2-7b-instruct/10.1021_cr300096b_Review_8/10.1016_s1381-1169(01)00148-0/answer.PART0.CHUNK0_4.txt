[1] "An overview about the effect of co-metal on the performance of Pd in bimetallic catalysts is presented."
[2] "In the first part, the promotion of monometallic catalysts by addition of a second metal is described from a general point of view in terms of: (i) electronic effects; (ii) geometric effects; (iii) the occurrence of mixed sites; and (iv) the disappearance of the -PdH phase."
[3] "The second part presents the main methods to prepare bimetallic catalysts through the unselective and selective depositions of the co-metal precursor and the use of heterobinuclear complexes."
[4] "The influence of preparation methods on the chemical state and the spatial distribution of both components are highlighted."
[5] "In the last part, a short overview is given about the influence of co-metal addition on some important reactions in which Pd is the reference active phase: (i) selective hydrogenation of highly unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons; (ii) hydrogenation of aromatics or hydrodearomatisation; (iii) hydrogenation of nitrogen-containing compounds; (iv) reactions involving CO; and (v) hydrodechlorination."

How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?
