[1] "An overview about the effect of co-metal on the performance of Pd in bimetallic catalysts is presented."
[2] "The promotion of monometallic catalysts by addition of a second metal is described from a general point of view in terms of: (i) electronic effects; (ii) geometric effects; (iii) the occurrence of mixed sites; and (iv) the disappearance of the -PdH phase."
[3] "In the case of Pd-based catalysts, interpretation of the Sn influence on Pd properties depends directly on the reaction considered."
[4] "It has been claimed that the dipping sequence affects the Fe3+ proportion which increases when H2PdCl4 is deposited first, then FeCl3."

The influence of co-metal on the performance of Pd in bimetallic catalysts can be interpreted in terms of electronic, geometric effects, the occurrence of mixed sites, and the disappearance of the β-PdH phase. The type of co-metal's effect on Pd properties depends on the specific reaction being considered. For example, the sequence of depositing H2PdCl4 and FeCl3 can alter the proportion of Fe3+ in the catalyst.

合金对Pd在双金属催化剂性能的影响可以解释为电子效应、几何效应、混合位点的存在以及β-PdH相的消失。共金属对Pd性质的影响直接取决于所考虑的反应类型。例如，首先沉积H2PdCl4然后沉积FeCl3的顺序可以改变Fe3+的比例。
