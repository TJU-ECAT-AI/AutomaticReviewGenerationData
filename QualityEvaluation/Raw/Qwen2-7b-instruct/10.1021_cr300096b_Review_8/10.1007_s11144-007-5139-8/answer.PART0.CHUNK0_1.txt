[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigated the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percent) to the Ni catalyst resulted in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction of NiO, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.

研究了铂/镍比对双金属铂镍催化剂表面性质和催化性能的影响，用于甲烷与二氧化碳重整。向镍催化剂中加入少量铂（0.3至0.5重量百分比）导致NiO颗粒尺寸减小、更易还原以及镍金属粒子分布更加均匀。
