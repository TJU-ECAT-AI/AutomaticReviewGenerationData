[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigates how the ratio of platinum (Pt) to nickel (Ni) affects the surface properties and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with carbon dioxide. By adding a minor amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percent), the size of NiO decreases, making it easier to reduce and promoting a uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.

研究探讨了铂(Pt)与镍(Ni)的比例如何影响双金属PtNi催化剂的表面特性和催化行为，用于甲烷与二氧化碳的重整。通过加入少量的Pt（0.3到0.5质量百分比），NiO的尺寸减小，使其更容易还原，并且促进了镍金属颗粒的均匀分布。
