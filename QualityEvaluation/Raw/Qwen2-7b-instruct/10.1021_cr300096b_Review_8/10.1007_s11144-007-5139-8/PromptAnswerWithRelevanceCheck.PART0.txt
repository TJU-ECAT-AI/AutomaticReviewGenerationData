How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

1. The literature does not contain specific details on how DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, nor does it provide guidance on how to utilize this integrated theoretical and experimental approach to predict hydrogenation activity or inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3 – 0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigated the impact of the Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with CO2. Adding a small amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percent) to the Ni catalyst resulted in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction of NiO, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.

The study investigated how the ratio of Pt to Ni influences the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used in the reforming of methane with CO2. Adding a slight amount of Pt (between 0.3% and 0.5% by weight) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.

The study investigates how the ratio of platinum (Pt) to nickel (Ni) affects the surface properties and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used for methane reforming with carbon dioxide. By adding a minor amount of Pt (0.3 to 0.5 weight percent), the size of NiO decreases, making it easier to reduce and promoting a uniform distribution of nickel metal particles.
