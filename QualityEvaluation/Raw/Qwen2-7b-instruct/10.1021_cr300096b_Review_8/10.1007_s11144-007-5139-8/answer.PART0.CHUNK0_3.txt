[1] "The effect of Pt/Ni ratio on the surface properties and catalytic behavior of bimetallic PtNi catalysts for reforming of methane with CO2 was studied."
[2] "Introduction of a small amount of Pt (0.3  0.5 wt.%) into the Ni catalyst leads to a decrease of the NiO size, its easy reduction and a uniform distribution of the nickel metal particles."

The study investigated how the ratio of Pt to Ni influences the surface characteristics and catalytic performance of bimetallic PtNi catalysts used in the reforming of methane with CO2. Adding a slight amount of Pt (between 0.3% and 0.5% by weight) to the Ni catalyst results in a reduction of NiO particle size, easier reduction, and a more even distribution of nickel metal particles.

研究了铂镍比率对双金属铂镍催化剂在甲烷二氧化碳重整中的表面特性和催化性能的影响。向镍催化剂中添加少量铂（介于0.3%至0.5%的质量百分比）导致NiO颗粒尺寸减小，更易于还原，并且镍金属粒子分布更加均匀。
