4.1.1.2 Low-Temperature Hydrogenation of Olefins, Dienes, and Aromatics
Similar theoretical and experimental studies have been extended to the hydrogenation of CC bonds in a variety of molecules over Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures and supported Pt3d catalysts. Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111). These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below.

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. The theoretical predictions of weak binding energy and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure indicate good hydrogenation activity. These findings are supported by experimental evidence from reactor studies, suggesting that DFT calculations can serve as descriptors for predicting hydrogenation activity and informing the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

对各种含C═C键分子在Pt-3d催化剂表面的DFT计算，表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的理论预测与TPD测量等实验观察结果相吻合。理论预测弱的结合能和亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构表明具有良好的氢化活性。这些发现得到了反应器研究实验证据的支持，表明DFT计算可以作为预测氢化活性并指导设计更高效Pt-3d催化体系的描述符。
