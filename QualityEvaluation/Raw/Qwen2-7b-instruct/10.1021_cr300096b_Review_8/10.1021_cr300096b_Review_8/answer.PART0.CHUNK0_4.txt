4.1.1.2 Low-Temperature Hydrogenation of Olefins, Dienes, and Aromatics
Similar theoretical and experimental studies have been extended to the hydrogenation of CC bonds in a variety of molecules over Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures and supported Pt3d catalysts. Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111).
These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity.
Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below.
Hydrogenation of 1,3-Butadiene, 1,3-Cyclohexadiene, And 1,4-Cyclohexadiene Bimetallic PtM (M = Co, Ni, Cu) are active toward the low-temperature hydrogenation of all three molecules when supported on γ-Al2O3. (238, 243)
PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts both show higher hydrogenation rates than monometallic Pt. The PtCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst shows lower activity than Pt/γ-Al2O3 in batch and flow reactor studies; however, PtCu/γ-Al2O3 shows higher selectivity toward cyclohexene and butenes than the other catalysts, indicating that it is a promising catalyst for partial hydrogenation reactions.

Answer: DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy on Pt3d catalysts correlate well with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. These calculations can predict hydrogenation activity and guide the design of more efficient Pt3d catalytic systems.
