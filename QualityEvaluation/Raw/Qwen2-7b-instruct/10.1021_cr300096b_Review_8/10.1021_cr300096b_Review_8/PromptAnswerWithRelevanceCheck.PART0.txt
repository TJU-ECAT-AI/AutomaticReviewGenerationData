4.1.1.2 Low-Temperature Hydrogenation of Olefins, Dienes, and Aromatics
Similar theoretical and experimental studies have been extended to the hydrogenation of CC bonds in a variety of molecules over Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures and supported Pt3d catalysts. Goda et al. (306) performed DFT calculations of 1-butene and 1-hexene on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces and found that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds more weakly to 1-butene and 1-hexene than on Pt(111) and 3dPtPt(111) surfaces, similar to the trend observed for cyclohexene. Murillo et al. (228) verified the DFT predictions with TPD measurement of facile low-temperature hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene on PtNiPt(111). These results further suggest that DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energy can be used as descriptors for catalysts with good hydrogenation activity. Similar DFT calculations have been performed for the binding energies of 1,3-butadiene, (238) 1,3-cyclohexadiene, (244) 1,4-cyclohexadiene, (243) and benzene (277) on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces. On the basis of the binding energies and subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structures, correspondingly supported Pt3d catalysts are predicted to show high hydrogenation activity for these molecules. These DFT predictions have been confirmed in reactor studies, as described below.

The theoretical and experimental studies on the hydrogenation of C═C bonds in various molecules using Pt3d catalysts have shown a strong correlation between DFT calculations of the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies and the experimental observations made through techniques such as TPD measurements. These calculations allow for the prediction of hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems. The integrated approach combining theoretical insights with experimental validation enables researchers to forecast the performance of Pt-based catalysts under different conditions and identify promising materials for specific applications, such as the hydrogenation of olefins, dienes, and aromatics.

In the case of the hydrogenation of 1-butene and 1-hexene, DFT calculations by Goda et al. (306) suggested that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) structure binds less strongly to these molecules compared to other surface structures, aligning with trends observed for other cyclic hydrocarbons. This finding was corroborated by Murillo et al. (228), who confirmed the DFT predictions with TPD measurements on PtNiPt(111) surfaces. These results underscore the utility of DFT calculations in predicting the hydrogenation activity of Pt-3d catalysts.

For 1,3-butadiene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, DFT calculations have provided insights into the binding energies of these molecules on 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, allowing for the prediction of which molecules would likely exhibit high hydrogenation activity when supported on Pt3d catalysts. Additionally, the study of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M = Co, Ni, Cu) supported on γ-Al2O3 has revealed that bimetallic catalysts generally outperform their monometallic counterparts in terms of hydrogenation rates. Notably, the PtCu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated higher selectivity towards specific products, suggesting its potential for partial hydrogenation reactions, which can be particularly useful in industrial processes where control over product distribution is critical.

Overall, the combined use of DFT calculations and experimental techniques offers a robust framework for understanding and optimizing the performance of Pt-3d catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, facilitating the development of more efficient and selective catalytic systems for a range of chemical transformations.

理论与实验研究在各种分子中使用Pt3d催化剂进行C═C键氢化时，显示出DFT计算表面d能带中心和吸附剂结合能之间的强大相关性与通过技术如TPD测量获得的实验观察之间存在紧密联系。这些计算允许预测氢化活性并指导更高效的Pt-3d催化系统的设计。将理论洞察与实验验证相结合的方法使研究人员能够预测不同条件下的催化剂性能，并识别特定应用（如烯烃、二烯和芳香族化合物的氢化）的有前景材料。

例如，在1-丁烯和1-己烯的氢化过程中，Goda等人的DFT计算（306）表明，亚表面Pt3dPt(111)结构对这两种分子的结合力较弱，这与对其他环状烃观察到的趋势一致。Murillo等人通过在PtNiPt(111)表面上进行TPD测量证实了这些DFT预测（228）。这些结果强调了DFT计算在预测Pt-3d催化剂活性中的作用。

对于1-丁二烯、1-环己二烯和1-环己烷二烯，DFT计算提供了这些分子在3d/Pt(111)表面的结合能信息，从而预测了哪些分子可能具有高氢化活性，当它们被支持在Pt3d催化剂上时。此外，对含钴、镍或铜的双金属PtM（M = Co、Ni、Cu）催化剂的研究显示，双金属催化剂通常比单金属催化剂具有更高的氢化速率。值得注意的是，PtCu/γ-Al2O3催化剂表现出对某些产物的更高选择性，这表明它在部分氢化反应中具有潜力，特别是在工业过程中需要控制产物分布时。

总之，DFT计算与实验技术的结合提供了一个强大的框架来理解并优化Pt-3d催化剂在氢化反应中的性能，促进更多高效和选择性的催化系统的发展，适用于一系列化学转化。
