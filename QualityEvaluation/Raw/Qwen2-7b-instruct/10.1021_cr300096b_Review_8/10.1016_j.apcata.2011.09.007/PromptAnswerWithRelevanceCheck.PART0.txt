<questions>

How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "For the purpose of comparison, similar comparative studies are performed on one of the most commonly used supports, alumina (α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3), using the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene as a probe reaction."
[2] "The thermodynamic stability of these Pt/Ni surface configurations is also of interest because both computational and experimental studies have shown that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates."
[3] "In the absence of 2-butenes, the CC stretching mode at 1655 cm1 was attributed solely to 1-butene, and used to calculate its concentration."
[4] "The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, which have been identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document explores the influence of oxide support surface area on the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, it compares the performance of these catalysts supported on low and high surface area alumina (α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3) and zirconia (LSA-ZrO2, HSA-ZrO2). The study employs techniques like pulse CO chemisorption, TEM imaging, XANES, and EXAFS to characterize the catalysts and assess their activity. It finds that the α-Al2O3-supported catalyst demonstrates a greater extent of bimetallic bond formation compared to the γ-Al2O3-supported catalyst, yet their hydrogenation activities are comparable. In contrast, the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows both a higher absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation and significantly greater hydrogenation activity than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst. This difference in activity is attributed to a potential strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the HSA-ZrO2 and the bimetallic catalysts, which may lead to particles with no Pt core.

文档研究了氧化物支持表面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂氢化活性的影响。具体来说，它比较了在低和高表面积的氧化铝（α-Al2O3、γ-Al2O3）和氧化锆（LSA-ZrO2、HSA-ZrO2）上支持的这些催化剂的性能。这项研究采用脉冲CO吸附、透射电子显微镜成像、XANES和EXAFS等技术来表征催化剂并评估其活性。研究发现，α-Al2O3支持的催化剂显示出比γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂更广泛的双金属键形成，但它们的氢化活性相当。相反，PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂在绝对程度上显示出更高的双金属键形成，并且具有显著更大的氢化活性与PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂相比。这种活性差异被归因于HSA-ZrO2和双金属催化剂之间可能存在的强烈金属支持相互作用（SMSI），这可能导致没有Pt核心的颗粒。

The amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support, which results in a reduction of the support surface area, might cause some metal nanoparticles to be trapped within the ZrO2 pores.
