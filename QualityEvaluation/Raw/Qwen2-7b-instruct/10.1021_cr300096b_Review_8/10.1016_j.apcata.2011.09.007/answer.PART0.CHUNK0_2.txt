[1] "It is postulated that this lower activity is due to a strong metal-support interaction between the HSA-ZrO2 and the bimetallic catalysts leading to particles with no Pt core."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The lower hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst is hypothesized to be caused by a strong metal-support interaction between the HSA-ZrO2 support and the bimetallic catalysts, resulting in particles without a Pt core.

<quotes>
[1] "Although the amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support (Fig. 5), which is accompanied with a decrease in support surface area [25], may trap some of the metal nanoparticles within the ZrO2 pores, this is unlikely the reason for the lower (at least per site) activity on the HSA-ZrO2-supported catalyst."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support, which results in a reduction of the support surface area, might cause some metal nanoparticles to be trapped within the ZrO2 pores. However, this is not likely the cause of the lower activity on the HSA-ZrO2-supported catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
HSA-ZrO2支持材料从非晶态转变为四方相，伴随支持表面面积的减少，可能会导致一些金属纳米颗粒被困在ZrO2孔内。然而，这不太可能是HSA-ZrO2支持催化剂活性降低的主要原因。

[1] "The TEM images in Fig. 1 and the chemisorption results in Table 1 indicate that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images and chemisorption data in Table 1 show that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst has slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
图1中的TEM图像和表1中的化学吸附结果表明，PtNi/α-Al2O3催化剂的颗粒略大，CO吸附量较低，与PtNi/γ-Al2O3催化剂相比。

[1] "The formation of NiAl2O4 on γ-Al2O3may be responsible for the decreased extent of bimetallic bond formation compared to the α-Al2O3-supported catalyst."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The formation of NiAl2O4 on γ-Al2O3 might explain the reduced extent of bimetallic bonding compared to the α-Al2O3-supported catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
