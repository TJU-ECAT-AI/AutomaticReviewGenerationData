[1] "It is postulated that this lower activity is due to a strong metal-support interaction between the HSA-ZrO2 and the bimetallic catalysts leading to particles with no Pt core."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The lower hydrogenation activity of PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst is attributed to a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the HSA-ZrO2 support and the bimetallic catalysts, which results in the formation of particles with no Pt core.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
HSA-ZrO2支持与双金属催化剂之间的强金属-支撑相互作用（SMSI）导致形成没有Pt核心的颗粒，这是PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂氢化活性较低的原因。

<quotes>
[1] "Overall, the similarity in the hydrogenation activity indicates that the surface area of alumina does not play a significant role in modifying the catalytic activity of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The similar hydrogenation activity across the alumina-supported catalysts suggests that the surface area of alumina does not significantly affect the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
铝氧化物支持的催化剂表现出相似的氢化活性，这表明铝氧化物的表面积对Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的催化活性影响不大。

<quotes>
[1] "Although TiO2 is the most widely studied support material that displays SMSI effects, it has been suggested that ZrO2 can also exhibit SMSI effects."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
While TiO2 is the most extensively studied support material showing SMSI effects, it is also proposed that ZrO2 can demonstrate SMSI effects.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
尽管TiO2是最广泛研究显示SMSI效应的支持材料，但也有人提出ZrO2也可以表现出SMSI效应。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, which have been identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The substantial variation in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts implies that the SMSI effects, which have been noted in certain reducible oxide supports, might contribute to the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
两个锆基催化剂之间归一化氢化活性显著差异表明，在某些可还原氧化物支持中已识别出的SMSI效应可能在PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂的低活性中起作用。
