[1] "The two alumina-supported catalysts show similar hydrogenation activity, based on catalyst mass and after normalizing with the number of actives sites."
[2] "The TEM images in Fig. 1 and the chemisorption results in Table 1 indicate that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The EXAFS results in Table 2 show that the PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a greater absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation than the PtNi/γ-Al2O3."
[4] "The zirconia-supported catalysts, on the other hand, show significant differences between the low and high surface area supports."
[5] "The Pt loadings in the two catalysts are estimated using the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge, which is related to the concentration of Pt in the catalyst samples."
[6] "Similar edge-jump heights are detected for the two catalysts, indicating that the Pt concentrations are similar for the PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on the LSA- and HSA-ZrO2."
[7] "The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst exhibits a bimodal particle size distribution, with both small particles of 1 nm and larger ones between 8 and 15 nm."
[8] "In comparison, the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst displays a narrow particle size distribution on the order of 1 nm."
[9] "Although the amorphous to tetragonal phase transformation of the HSA-ZrO2 support (Fig. 5), which is accompanied with a decrease in support surface area [25], may trap some of the metal nanoparticles within the ZrO2 pores, this is unlikely the reason for the lower (at least per site) activity on the HSA-ZrO2-supported catalyst."
[10] "Another possible reason for the low activity could be due to a lack of bimetallic bond formation; however, the EXAFS results of Table 2 clearly show that bimetallic bonds form in the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst, though the absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation is less than that exhibited by the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst."

1. The hydrogenation activity of the alumina-supported catalysts is similar when normalized with the number of active sites.
2. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst has slightly larger particles and a lower CO uptake compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
3. The PtNi/α-Al2O3 catalyst has a greater absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation compared to the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
4. There are significant differences in activity between the low and high surface area zirconia-supported catalysts.
5. The Pt loadings in the two zirconia-supported catalysts are similar based on the height of the edge-jump in the near edge region of the Pt L-edge.
6. The Pt concentrations in the PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on the LSA- and HSA-ZrO2 are similar.
7. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a bimodal particle size distribution.
8. The PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst has a narrow particle size distribution.
9. The low activity on the HSA-ZrO2-supported catalyst might be due to trapping of metal nanoparticles within the ZrO2 pores during the phase transformation, but this is unlikely the sole reason.
10. The PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst forms bimetallic bonds, but the absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation is less than that in the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst.
