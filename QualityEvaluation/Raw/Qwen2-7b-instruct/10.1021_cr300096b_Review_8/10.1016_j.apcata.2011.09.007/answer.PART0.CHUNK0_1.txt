[1] "For the purpose of comparison, similar comparative studies are performed on one of the most commonly used supports, alumina (α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3), using the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene as a probe reaction."
[2] "The binding energies of adsorbates on these surfaces have been found to correlate with the location of the surface d-band center in reference to the Fermi level, as calculated by density functional theory (DFT)."
[3] "This signifies that the electronic modification due to bimetallic formation directly affects the binding strength of adsorbates, and in turn, catalytic activity."
[4] "The normalized hydrogenation activity of the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst is similar to the two Al2O3-supported catalysts, suggesting a similar active site."
[5] "However, the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows a (per site) hydrogenation activity approximately 20 times less than that of the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst."

1. The study compares the performance of alumina-supported catalysts with those supported on zirconia with low and high surface areas using the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene as a benchmark.

2. The electronic modification caused by bimetallic formation impacts the binding strength of adsorbates, thereby influencing catalytic activity.

3. The PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst demonstrates comparable activity to the alumina-supported catalysts, indicating similar active sites.

4. The PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows significantly lower activity, approximately 20 times less per site, compared to the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst.
