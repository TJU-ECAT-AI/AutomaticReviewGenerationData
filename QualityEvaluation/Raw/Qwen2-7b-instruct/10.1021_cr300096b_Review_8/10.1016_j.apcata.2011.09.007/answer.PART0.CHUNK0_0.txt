[1] "For the purpose of comparison, similar comparative studies are performed on one of the most commonly used supports, alumina (α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3), using the low-temperature hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene as a probe reaction."
[2] "The thermodynamic stability of these Pt/Ni surface configurations is also of interest because both computational and experimental studies have shown that the Ni monolayer can migrate in the presence of adsorbates."
[3] "In the absence of 2-butenes, the CC stretching mode at 1655 cm1 was attributed solely to 1-butene, and used to calculate its concentration."
[4] "The significant difference in normalized hydrogenation activity between the two zirconia-supported catalysts suggests that the presence of the SMSI effects, which have been identified for some reducible oxide supports, may play a role in the low activity of the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst."

The document explores the influence of oxide support surface area on the hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts. Specifically, it compares the performance of these catalysts supported on low and high surface area alumina (α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3) and zirconia (LSA-ZrO2, HSA-ZrO2). The study employs techniques like pulse CO chemisorption, TEM imaging, XANES, and EXAFS to characterize the catalysts and assess their activity. It finds that the α-Al2O3-supported catalyst demonstrates a greater extent of bimetallic bond formation compared to the γ-Al2O3-supported catalyst, yet their hydrogenation activities are comparable. In contrast, the PtNi/LSA-ZrO2 catalyst shows both a higher absolute extent of bimetallic bond formation and significantly greater hydrogenation activity than the PtNi/HSA-ZrO2 catalyst. This difference in activity is attributed to a potential strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the HSA-ZrO2 and the bimetallic catalysts, which may lead to particles with no Pt core.

文档研究了氧化物支持表面积对铂/镍双金属催化剂氢化活性的影响。具体来说，它比较了在低和高表面积的氧化铝（α-Al2O3、γ-Al2O3）和氧化锆（LSA-ZrO2、HSA-ZrO2）上支持的这些催化剂的性能。这项研究采用脉冲CO吸附、透射电子显微镜成像、XANES和EXAFS等技术来表征催化剂并评估其活性。研究发现，α-Al2O3支持的催化剂显示出比γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂更广泛的双金属键形成，但它们的氢化活性相当。相反，PtNi/LSA-ZrO2催化剂在绝对程度上显示出更高的双金属键形成，并且具有显著更大的氢化活性与PtNi/HSA-ZrO2催化剂相比。这种活性差异被归因于HSA-ZrO2和双金属催化剂之间可能存在的强烈金属支持相互作用（SMSI），这可能导致没有Pt核心的颗粒。
