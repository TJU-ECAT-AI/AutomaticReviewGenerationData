[1] "Ammonia TPD is a commonly used technique for the titration of surface acid sites."
[2] "Ammonia TPD analyses show that the support has a lower total amount of acid sites than commercial hydrotreating catalysts (Fujikawa et al., 2000; Barrio et al., 2003) or activated clays (Flessner et al., 2001)."
[3] "The acidities, of the noble metal containing PILC samples (Table 1), as measured by this technique, are apparently significantly higher than that of the support, regardless of the catalyst composition."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts can correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements. By integrating theoretical predictions with experimental data, researchers can predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
