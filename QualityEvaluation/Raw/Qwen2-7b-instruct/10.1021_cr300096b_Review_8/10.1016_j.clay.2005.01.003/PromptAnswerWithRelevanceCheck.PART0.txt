How do DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules (including linear alkenes, cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatics) on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements, and how can this integrated theoretical and experimental approach be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity and inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems?

[1] "The removal, within the refinery process, of aromatic hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds from light oil fractions (LCO) coming from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) has received considerable attention in recent years, due to both the increasing demand of diesel fuels and the progressively more strict environmental regulations."
[2] "The development of catalytic technologies for aromatic saturation (HYD) or sulphur removal (HDS) is in demand."
[3] "PILCs can represent suitable supports for catalysts to be used in these reactions, while replacing the more expensive dealuminated zeolites and Si/Al MCM-41 type materials."
[4] "The micropores and the total pore volume, show only a slight decrease."
[5] "Nevertheless, as shown in Table 1, after the title reaction, the BET surface area values of the catalysts show a relevant decrease (CAT2 more than CAT1)."
[6] "The main reason for the occlusion of the pores and the consequent drop of the surface area of the exhaust catalysts can be ascribed to a large tar deposition on the catalyst surface and inside the pores, favoured by both the high microporosity and acidity of the support."
[7] "Ammonia TPD is a commonly used technique for the titration of surface acid sites."
[8] "The acidities, of the noble metal containing PILC samples (Table 1), as measured by this technique, are apparently significantly higher than that of the support, regardless of the catalyst composition."
[9] "Nevertheless the quantitative correlation of these data with the acidity of the catalyst is not obvious because the possible occurrence of ammonia decomposition to nitrogen, detectable only by mass spectroscopy (Skotak et al., 2002) and of ammonia chemisorption, with not exactly known stoichiometries, on the surface of the reduced noble metal."
[10] "Furthermore in the case of the generation of the active metal sites by reduction of cationic species exchanged on the clay surface, the final surface acidity will depend by the evolution of the metal/support interaction during the reduction step (Vicente and Lambert, 2001)."

To answer the question, we need to consider the textural properties of the catalysts and how they influence the hydrogenation activity. The text states that the BET surface area and total pore volume of the catalysts remain close to those of the support, indicating that the addition of noble metals and reduction steps do not drastically alter the porosity and surface area. However, after the title reaction, the BET surface area values of the catalysts show a relevant decrease. This decrease is attributed to the occlusion of the pores and the consequent drop of the surface area caused by tar deposition on the catalyst surface and inside the pores, which is favored by the high microporosity and acidity of the support.

Ammonia TPD is used to titrate surface acid sites, and the text indicates that the noble metal containing PILC samples exhibit higher total amounts of acid sites compared to the support, regardless of the catalyst composition. However, the quantitative correlation of these data with the acidity of the catalyst is not straightforward due to potential ammonia decomposition and chemisorption, as well as the dependence of final surface acidity on the metal/support interaction during reduction.

This integrated theoretical and experimental approach can be utilized to predict hydrogenation activity by considering the surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts. The correlation between these theoretical calculations and experimental observations can inform the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems by understanding the role of surface acidity and the effect of metal-support interactions on the overall catalytic performance.

为了回答这个问题，我们需要考虑催化剂的纹理属性以及它们如何影响氢化活性。文本指出，催化剂的比表面积和总孔体积接近支持物，表明添加贵金属和还原步骤不会大幅改变孔隙率和表面积。然而，在标题反应之后，催化剂的比表面积值显示出明显的减少。这种减少归因于孔隙被阻塞和表面面积下降导致的焦油沉积在催化剂表面和孔内，这归因于支持物的高微孔性和酸性。

氨TPD用于测定表面酸中心的数量，文本表明，含有贵金属的PILC样品的总酸位量相对于支持物而言更高，无论催化剂组成如何。但是，这些数据与催化剂酸性的定量相关性并不明显，因为可能存在氨分解为氮气（仅通过质谱检测到）和氨化学吸附，其确切的化学计量未知，以及金属/支持相互作用对还原步骤的影响。

这种理论和实验相结合的方法可以用来预测氢化活性，通过考虑各种C═C键含分子在Pt-3d催化剂上的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能。这些理论计算与实验观察之间的相关性可以帮助设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统，从而理解表面酸度的作用以及金属/支持相互作用对整体催化性能的影响。

[1] "Ammonia TPD is a commonly used technique for the titration of surface acid sites. It is generally accepted that ammonia is an excellent probe molecule for testing the acid properties of solid catalysts, since its strong basicity and small molecular size allow the detection of acid sites located even in very narrow pores."
[2] "The acidities, of the noble metal containing PILC samples (Table 1), as measured by this technique, are apparently significantly higher than that of the support, regardless of the catalyst composition."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements by indicating the strength of the acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. Higher surface acidities detected through ammonia TPD measurements on noble metal containing PILC samples suggest better hydrogenation activity for these catalysts. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predictions of hydrogenation activity and guides the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.
