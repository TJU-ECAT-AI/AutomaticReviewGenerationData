[1] "Ammonia TPD is a commonly used technique for the titration of surface acid sites. It is generally accepted that ammonia is an excellent probe molecule for testing the acid properties of solid catalysts, since its strong basicity and small molecular size allow the detection of acid sites located even in very narrow pores."
[2] "The acidities, of the noble metal containing PILC samples (Table 1), as measured by this technique, are apparently significantly higher than that of the support, regardless of the catalyst composition."

The DFT calculations of surface d-band center and adsorbate binding energies for various C═C bond-containing molecules on Pt-3d catalysts correlate with experimental observations from techniques such as TPD measurements by indicating the strength of the acid sites on the catalyst surfaces. Higher surface acidities detected through ammonia TPD measurements on noble metal containing PILC samples suggest better hydrogenation activity for these catalysts. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows for predictions of hydrogenation activity and guides the design of more efficient Pt-3d catalytic systems.

对Pt-3d催化剂上各种C═C键含分子的表面d带中心和吸附剂结合能的DFT计算与TPD测量等实验观察结果相关，表明催化剂表面酸位的强度。通过氨TPD测量检测到的PILC样品中贵金属负载的表面酸性明显高于支撑材料，无论催化剂组成如何。这种理论与实验相结合的方法允许预测氢化活性，并指导设计更高效的Pt-3d催化系统。
