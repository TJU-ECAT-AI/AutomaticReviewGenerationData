1 Introduction In the past fifteen years there has been a resurgence in research into the production of chemicals and liquid transportation fuels from fossil fuel sources other than petroleum. This was largely spurred by the increased cost of petroleum and the majority of this effort was focused not only on improving the existing pathways based on the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide 1 9 2  but also led to the development of a new commercial process based on methanol conversion.
1.3,4
However, in recent years petroleum has again become inexpensive and this has significantly decreased the attention given to such research. In its place the research emphasis has now been directed at the utiliation of natural gas as a source of chemicals and fuels. The reasons for this are twofold: first, the current reserves of natural gas are considered as a large underutilized energy resource, but a large proportion of these reserves are remotely located from high densities of consumers and chemical conversion of the methane is required to facilitate transportation. Second, vast quantities of natural gas are currently flared, particularly at locations where the gas is associated with crude oil, and consequently chemical conversion could be both economically and environ- mentally beneficial.
The conversion of natural gas ria the process of partial oxidation to obtain more valuable chemical products, c.g. methanol and ethane, is not a new research topic. A large amount of pioneering research was completed in the 1920s and 1930s in which the partial oxidation reaction was investigated as a high pressure gas phase reaction, and this work has recently been reviewed by Gesser (it d S

View Article Online / Journal Homepage / Table of Contents for this issue Oxidative Coupling qf'Metlianr using 0.uide Catalysts small proportion of recent research effort has been focused on the production of methanl,.' but to a large extent the identification of catalytic materials for this reaction has been unsuccessful. By far the majority of research has been carried out into the oxidative coupling of methane using oxide catalysts to form higher hydrocarbon products, mainly ethane and ethene. In 1988 three major scientific meetings8 devoted over 60 papers solely to this reaction, which emphasizes the importance given to this topic at the present time. The aim of this review is to highlight the salient features of the recent research literature on the oxidative coupling of methane, particularly that published since 1986. In particular this review seeks to discuss the mechanism of methane oxidation over oxide catalysts and to consider experimental approaches that could enable the design of an improved catalyst. 2 Evaluation of Oxide Catalysts
A. Molecular Oxygen as Oxidant.-Initial
work by Keller and Bhasin 9.10 considered that non-selective methane oxidation, either gas phase or catalysed,could be dominant when oxygen and methane were co-fed over a catalyst. To minimize such an effect they operated the reaction cyclically, i.e. methane and air were fed individually over the catalyst interspaced by a short purge of an inert gas. In this way methane was reacted with the catalyst which was stoich- eiometrically reduced by the reaction, once all the readily reacted oxygen was depleted the reaction ceased. A range of oxides were identified which became active above 600 "C and produced ethene and ethane as major products. Of the oxides identified, supported manganese oxide was found to give the best results.
Later studies '*" demonstrated that cyclic operation was not necessary to obtain high selectivities, and in the presence of suitable catalysts co-fed methane and oxygen also gave high yields of CZ hydrocarbons. Subsequently Lunsford identified that lithium-promoted magnesium oxide could give a much improved catalytic performance. These early studies demonstrated that the oxidative coupling of methane to form CZ hydrocarbons was a high temperature reaction and temperatures in excess of 600 "C were required to observe selective products (Figure 1). At lower temperatures only COz and CO were observed as carbon- containing products. The early studies failed to observe that hydrogen was also a major reaction product, but subsequent studies noted that significant levels of hydrogen can be present." In general, the products observed in the high

Oxygenated products, e.g. CH30H and C H 2 0 are found in only trace amounts, which is in contrast to earlier gas phase s t  d i e s .  . ' Based on these early studies two catalysts are now being evaluated at pilot plant scale. Sofranko rt ri1.'6,'7 have described a cyclically fed process based on a supported manganese oxide catalyst. Under conditions of cyclic feeding they have shown that selectivity and conversion are related by a 'lOOo/, rule' (methane conversion and Cz selectivity roughly sum to loo%, see Figure 2). Co-feeding of methane and oxygen results in a loss of at least 10% in C2 selectivity. It is apparent that methane conversion decreases significantly in only a short reaction time, and hence rapid cycling between methane and oxygen is required for this process to be viable. Edwards and Tyler l 8 . I 9  have described a co-feeding process based on lithium-promoted magnesium oxide operated in a fluidized bed reactor,''I E. H. Boomer and V. Thomas, C'rr/i. J. Rcc.. Swi.

An important question remains concerning the comparison of methane oxidation using cyclic and co-feed experimental regimes;it has to be considered whether the methane activation process is the same for the two processes. Recent results2' have shown that, in the absence of gas phase oxygen, lattice oxygen in MgO or LiiMgO is inactive for methane oxidation, i .  . the stoicheiometric reaction is not observed, and hence methane oxidation in the co-fed regime must involve reaction with an adsorbed oxygen species. With supported manganese oxide the stoicheiometric oxidation is observed implicating the involvement of lattice oxide ions O2 ,possibly at low co-ordinate defect sites as found for ammoxidation catalysts,21 as active centres. Hence, superficially it could be concluded that the methane activation step could be different for the two experimental regimes. However, in the presence of gas phase oxygen an adsorbed oxygen species could also become important for the manganese oxide catalysts, and consequently further experimental work is required to address this question fully.

METHANE CONVERSION
It could be concluded from these early studies that the selectivity to Cz hydrocarbons for any particular catalyst is related to the concentration of gas phase oxygen co-fed with the methane (e.g. see Figure 3). This is not surprising since the initial products resulting from the activation of methane will be considerably more reactive with respect to oxygen and hence excess oxygen will result in consecutive oxidation of the initial products.
Since the early studies of Keller and Bhasin and Lunsford a large scale catalyst screening and evaluation exercise has been carried out by a large number of workers. As a result, the majority of the simple metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane. Representative data from these studies are summarized in Tables 1-5 for different classification of metal oxides.
A striking feature of these studies is that the product distribution remains invariant to a greater extent (i.e. C2H6, C2H4, CO, C02, H2, HzO and lesser amounts of C3+ hydrocarbons) and CH30H, CH2O or other oxygenates have been reported for only a very small range of catalyst formulations.22-24 It is possible that at the elevated temperature, > 600 O C ,  required to observe 2 2  K.

View Article Online formation of Cz hydrocarbons, the oxygenated products, such as CH30H and CHz0, are unstable and decompose possibly to carbon oxides and hydrogen.
However, formation of oxygenates at lower temperatures is not reported, and in studies where low temperature investigations have been made 2 5  no enhanced level of oxygenated products is observed. While the product type remains invariant, product selectivity is markedly affected by the choice of metal oxide as catalyst, but even for the most selective oxides the C2 yield rarely exceeds 25",, an observation consistent with the 100",,rule previously noted by Sofranko et d17 It is also apparent that the ethene'ethane product ratio varies markedly for all these studies. However, as has been recently noted by van Kasteren et (il.," this may be caused by the design of the reactor, particularly the volume of the heated zone downstream of the catalyst bed, and for most published studies summarized in this review precise details of the reactor are not given. Another general feature from these studies is that catalyst activity is related to and the increase in catalyst basicity increases activity. This is most readily observed from the addition of alkali metal additives to single oxides such as MgO and CaO (Table I )  which results in catalysts that are significantly more selective for Cz production. The role of alkali promoters will be considered in Section 3A.
The main observation that can be made from the summary of the catalytic studies (Tables 1-5) is that a very wide range of experimental conditions have been used. For example, studies have used CH4/02 mole ratios from 2: I to
200: 1 and in some studies additional inert diluent is utilized. In view of the
diversity of the experimental work it is extremely difficult to draw any broad conclusions from these studies concerning catalyst selectivity. It is apparent that metal oxides exhibit a range of catalytic activities but to some extent these variations are due solely to the intrinsic surface area, and hence density of surface sites, of the oxide. The importance of surface area with respect to the yield of C7 hydrocarbons has been noted by Aika 29 and it was concluded that low surface area materials were preferable, this being one of the major reasons for the large scale use of alkali metal compound additives since this results in loss of surfice area due to sintering. It is therefore important to compare different catalysts in terms of their specific activity (moles product m ' h-') and these data are summarized for the most active catalysts in Table 6. On this basis it is now possible to compare the relative activities of these oxides. At 700-710
"C
catalysts can be ranked in order of decreasing specific activity for C2 production as follows: L i  G. .

For this summary it may be concluded that, although catalyst selectivities may be similar,there exists a very wide range of specific activities spanning almost two orders of magnitude. Considerable scope exists to further improve on these specific activities, and as yet no detailed study has been published concerning optimiza- tion of the specific activity by using improved methods of catalyst preparation.
B. Nitrous Oxide as Oxidant.--A
number of studies have specifically utiliLed nitrous oxide as oxidant because of the specific selectivity effect that can be achieved. Liu et 1 .
and Zhen et d3' noted that with Mo and V catalysts methane was oxidized to methanol with NIO as oxidant. Subsequently, Solymosi e f ul.33 demonstrated that for Bi2O3 as catalyst use of NzO resulted in the forma- tion of high selectivities for formaldehyde at 550 "C, a temperature at which O2 is inactive. Addition of SnOz significantly enhanced this effect and it was considered that one role of the SnOz was to facilitate the decomposition of NzO enabling it to participate directly in the oxidation process. However, a number of other studies for Sm203,34.35 Mg0,36 and Li'Mg036 have shown that use of NzO does not significantly enhance the production of oxygenates for these catalysts, and hence this is not a general feature of this oxidant. Indeed, a recent study by Kasztelan and Moffatz4 demonstrated that when 0 1 was used as oxidant with silica as catalyst significant yields of formaldehyde were observed. in contrast to the results with NzO where complete oxidation was observed.Few comparative studies of the use of N 2 0  and O2 as oxidants have been reported, and these are summarized in Table 7. The main conclusion from these studies is that under comparable reaction conditions, with NzO as oxidant,significantly lower methane conversions are observed with increased Cz selec- tivity, particularly to ethane. The increase in selectivity to ethane is most marked at lower reaction temperatures. The marked increase in Cz selectivity may just be a result of the selectivityiconversion relationships that exist for these catalysts, i . c . .
higher Cz selectivities are generally observed at lower methane conversions (eg. see Figure 3). However, recent evidence" has shown this not to be the case, and at comparable conversions NzO is always more selective for Cz formation than 0 2
as oxidant (Figure 4). The decreased oxidation activity observed with N 2 0 is probably due to two factors. First, on a molar basis NzO can be considered to have only half the potential for stoicheiometric reaction compared to 02,but experiments where this has been taken into account have shown that N z O  is much less active than 01.34 Second, the decomposition of N z O  to an active "' K.

us oxidizing species may be slow, and experiments by the present authors have indicated that only partial N 2 0 decomposition occurs under most conditions.
N 2 0  has been utilized in these studies as a source of surface 0- as an oxidizing species3' and some evidence for this is further obtained from the observation (Table 7) that with N20, CO is oxidized to C02 which is produced in significantly higher quantities than with 02.Based on a detailed analysis of the reaction selectivities at 550 "C and 710 "C it has been shown 36 that 0 has two oxidizing roles on these catalyst systems, a selective oxidation role which is particularly marked at the lower reaction temperature, and a non-selective role which becomes significant at the higher temperature. The mechanistic significance of the comparison between 0 2
and N2O as oxidants will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.
C. Ozone as Oxidant.-Earlier
studies reviewed by Foster have indicated that ozone could, by virtue of its enhanced oxidizing activity, be active for methane oxidation at temperatures lower than those observed with molecular oxygen (i.e. <
500 "C).
A comparative study of ozone versus oxygen as oxidant 2 5  has shown "C. Naccache, Chem. Phix Lett., 1971. 11. 323. 269 Published on 01 January 1989. Downloaded by East Carolina University on 28/10/2014 03:41:23.

and Nishiyama2' have shown that addition of COz to CH4/02 reactant mixture can significantly enhance the yield of C 2 hydrocarbons for a broad range of catalysts,and in particular with PbO-MgO catalysts. It was concluded that the carbon dioxide was involved in these reactions as an oxidant, providing a monatomic oxygen species viu degradation to carbon monoxide. However, no isotopic studies have been reported to substantiate the involvement of oxygen from carbon dioxide. It is more probable that the role of carbon dioxide is to enhance or maintain the formation of surface carbonate species which produces a more selective catalyst for methane activation. It is clear that further surface and isotopic studies are required to rationalize the experimental observations. 270 Published on 01 January 1989.

A. The Role of the Alkali Promoter and Nature of the Active Site.-A
number of studies have been made concerning the elucidation of the nature of the active catalytic sites particularly for the non-reducible oxide catalysts typified by MgO and Smz03,and particular attention has been given to establishing the role of the alkali promoter. Addition of Li+ to MgO has been shown38.39 to decrease the surface area, increase specific activity, both for methane oxidation and the selective production of C2 hydrocarbons (Table 6), and significantly increase CZ selectivity, particularly for C2H6. Even the addition of very low levels of Li+ have been shown to exhibit these effects eg.
0.4",, by mass.18
Lunsford and co-workers 13.38.40 44 have extensively studied the Li'MgO catalyst using e.p.r. spectroscopy and have shown that in the presence of 0 2 this catalyst forms 0- as a surface species, which is stabilized by the formation of [Li'O-] sites. Previous studies of Abraham and c o -  o rkers" 49 have demon- strated that [Li'O-] centres can be found in Li+-doped MgO or CaO,either by thermal treatment or by high intensity electron bombardment.Lunsford and co-workers 43 have further shown that gas phase methyl radicals were found when CH4/02 were reacted over Li/MgO at 500C. Direct correlations were observed between the concentration of CH; and the concentra- tion of [Li+O-] centres, as well as between the degree of methane conversion and the concentration of the [Li'O-] centres. It was therefore concluded that the CH; radical was produced from the interaction of CH4 with the 0- of the [Li+O-] centre.The active [Li'O -1 was subsequently regenerated from the resultant LiOH by reaction of LiOH with molecular oxygen. For MgO, doping with Na' was not found to be as effective as Li+.This has been explained in terms of the ionic radii of Li+, Na', and ME'+. The [Li'O-] centres are formed by substitution of Li' for Mg2+ in the MgO lattice and these ions have similar radii (Li' 68 pm, Mg2+ 66 pm). The larger Na' ion can not be so readily accommodated in the MgO lattice, and hence is less effective at generating the equivalent [Na+O -1 centre.However, Na+ and Ca2+ also have very similar ionic radii (Na' 99 pm, Ca2+ 97 pm) and it is important to note that for CaO the most effective dopant is Na+ .

Confirmation of the role of 0- in the selective oxidation of methane has come from photoluminescence studies 5 0  which have shown a direct correlation between the concentration of 0- on the surface of MgO and the conversion of methane. In addition, model studies using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on oxidized Mg for the analogous activation of N-H bonds in ammonia have also demonstrated the importance of the 0- species." Use of N20 as oxidant,36 a known source of surface 0-,37 has also confirmed the role of 0- in the selective oxidation of methane. Hence, there appears to be a general consensus that 0- on the surface of MgO and CaO, stabilized by the addition of Li' on Na', is the species responsible for the initial activation of methane cia hydrogen atom abstraction to form a methyl radical. It must be noted that the presence of alkali cations is not crucial in this respect since undoped MgO and CaO are also active for methane partial oxidation.The nature of the active centre on lanthanide oxide catalysts has been extensively studied. An e.p.r. study by Lunsford and co-workers 5 2  demonstrated that the rate of methyl radical formation was higher on La203 than on Li/MgO under comparable conditions. They found that superoxide, 0 2 ,  was the most abundant species and they considered that the broad e.p.r. spectrum of 0; might have masked the presence of 0- . It is interesting to note that doping La203 with Li' does not significantly enhance the specific activity (Table 6) which is in direct contrast to the effect of Li' on MgO and Sm203,and hence this could indicate that 0- may not be the active surface species for La203 oxide. However, it is clear that the methane activation on La203 is analogous to that on MgO and Li/MgO, i.e. ciu the generation of methyl radicals.Otsuka and co-workers 3 4 3 5 3 have carried out a detailed kinetic study of Sm2O3 and have concluded that the active species for methane activation on this oxide is a diatomic oxygen species. Otsuka et u I . subsequently demonstrated that solid peroxides Na202, Ba02, S r 0 2 were active for the formation of ethane from methane in the absence of molecular oxygen. Based on these studies Otsuka has suggested that 0;- could be the active species on this oxide. More recently, Lee and Oyama 5 5  have noted that O', -, which is difficult to characterize on an oxide surface, can be regarded as a dimer of 0-,i..O--O-, and the formation of 0- from 0;- has been previously considered in the extensive reviews of Che and T e n  h .Further evidence that 0
is the active species on Smz03 is provided by the observation that addition of Li' gives a significant increase in specific activity (Table 6) which is directly analogous to the effect of Li' dopijig on MgO. In addition, use of N 2 0 as oxidant in place of molecular oxygen (Table 7) significantly increases the formation of C2Hh ' 3  decreased methane

Driscoll and Lunsford 42 did not observe methyl radical formation in the CHs/02 reaction over PbO at 475 "C whereas methyl radicals were observed over both MgO and Li MgO at this temperature. It is clear that this aspect of methane oxidation requires further detailed study before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.
B. Primary Hydrocarbon Product Formation.-(i)
/dcr.rzt$cutiotz of' Priincir!?Hjdroc.uvhoti Products. Until recently only limited attention had been given in the research literature to consideration of the nature of the primary hydrocarbon products. This is surprising since without this detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanism it is unlikely that future improvements in catalyst design will be effected in a scientific manner. In part this is the result of early studies,".'* which concluded that ethane was the only primary hydrocarbon product and that the direct formation of ethene from methane was negligible. Subsequent studies have therefore worked on this basis, which is unfortunate since ethene is considered to be the more desired product on an economic basis and the identification and enhancement of a direct formation pathway would be a significant advance in catalyst design. A recent detailed study by the present a  t h o r s   .  ' . ha s shown that direct formation of ethene from methane is not negligible for all catalysts,and must therefore be considered in a mechanistic scheme. This investigation involved the standard procedure for determining primary selectivity by varying reactant feed-rate at constant reaction temperature and methanejoxidant ratio,both molecular oxygen and nitrous oxide were used as oxidants, and repre- sentative data are shown for MgO and LiIMgO in Figure 6. From this study it was concluded that for MgO, SmrO3, and La203 with both 0' and NzO, and for LiiSmzO3 with 0 2 ,  both ethene and ethane are the primary hydrocarbon products. For LiiMgO with 0 2
and NlO (Figure 6). Li;La203 with 0 2 , 3 5  and Li/Sm203 with N 2 0 3 '  as oxidant the addition of Li' had a marked effect enhancing the formation of ethane relative to the unpromoted system. From these catalysts it was possible to conclude that ethane was a primary product,but the situation was less clear for ethene, since although linear extrapolation of the plots (e.g. Figure 6b) could have indicated a positive intercept for both ethane '-

and ethene, it was possible that the shortest residence times used in these initial experiments may still have been too long to conclude that ethene was a minor primary product with these catalysts/oxidants. Further detailed studies 2 0 3 3  were then carried out with Li/MgO using a small catalyst bed volume (0.5 ml) with a minimized post reactor heated zone to limit the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane downstream of the catalyst.26 It was observed that for CH4/02 = 3 a significant selectivity to ethene of cci. 4"/,, was obtained on extrapolation to zero methane conversion (Figure 7), indicating that ethene selectivity and methane conversion is not linear in the conversion range of &lo%, and in particular that extrapolation of data obtained for 2 5 % )  conversion could lead to a misleading conclusion concerning ethene as a primary product. This may have been the case in the earlier studies concerning primary product It was also shown 2 o  that decreasing the oxygen concentration did not significantly affect the ethene selectivity at low conversion while it did enhance the ethane selectivity,which indicated that the ethene primary selectivity was reasonably independent of the CH4,02 ratio. It was observed that this finding strongly supported the conclusion that ethene was a primary reaction product, since if ethene were to be formed solely from oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, as postulated in earlier studies,' . 5  5.s then variation in [02] would have been expected to affect the selectivity to ethene, and this was not observed. Based on this detailed study it was concluded that a small but significant primary selectivity to ethene could be observed for these catalysts.

Based on the literature review in Section 3B(i) it is clear that both ethane and ethene must be considered as the primary hydrocarbon products, although for most catalysts ethane is the dominant primary product.There is general that surface 0 ,derived from NzO decomposition or stabiliLed by Li + doping, is the selective oxidizing species for ethane formation.Interaction of 0- with methane, either gas phase or surface associated (since recent studies 60-61 have indicated that significant amounts of methane are associated with some oxide surfaces even at 700 "C),leads to the formation of gas phase methyl radical vicc hydrogen atom abstraction. Cant o r  ri1.62 have shown the existence of a kinetic isotope effect indicating that this hydrogen atom abstraction is the rate determining step in the formation of ethane. The radical nature of this reaction has been further confirmed in experiments using nitric oxide as a radical cavenger.' It is generally agreed that dimerization of methyl radicals leads to the formation of the ethane primary product, and this process occurs in the gas phase.It has been noted20.64 that the presence of Li' as dopant, which aids the stabilization of 0-,has significantly different effects on ethene and ethane selectivities, and from this observation it has been concluded that the surface 0- species cannot be the oxidizing species responsible for the formation of the ethene primary product. In addition it is probable that the primary formation of ethene must involve a surface-catalysed process since the diverse range of oxide catalysts give a wide range of primary ethene s e l e c t i v i t i e  .Recent studies by Martin and Mirodatos " have indicated that methylene carbene may be involved as a reactive intermediate in methane oxidation. They have postulated that the formation of the primary ethane product results from insertion of methylene carbene into a carbon-hydrogen bond of methane. Subsequent studies 66 using isotopic labelling have shown that this reaction does not occur. Oxidation of CD4 and CH4 mixtures resulted in the formation of ethane with isotopic distribu- tions of CH3-CH3, CD3-CD3, and CH3-CD3; no ethane product containing CD2 or CH2 units were observed indicating that the methylene carbene species were not involved in the production of ethane. However, this species could be

Hence it has been concluded that the oxidizing species responsible for methylene carbene formation, and consequently the primary ethene product,must be able to abstract two hydrogens from methane in a single interaction of methane with the surface.

Ethene can be formed from the primary ethane product tiin two reaction pathways: For MgO, La2O3. and Sm203 it has been noted35.64 that the selectivities of ethene and ethane are comparable at most reaction conditions. Hence the ethene,ethane ratio observed experimentally is close to that expected for thermodynamic equilibrium according to equation 3.67 Hydrogen is a major reaction product for methane oxidation over undoped oxides which is consistent with this reaction. Subsequent studies 2o demonstrated that this non-oxidative pathway occurred only to a limited extent in the presence of an oxidant, and hence reaction 4 is the major pathway for secondary ethene formation under conditions of non-total oxidant conversion.

In general, as expected, ethane and ethene are oxidized far more rapidly than methane, a feature which has been neglected in some kinetic modelling studies.28 Comparison of N2O with O2 as an oxidant for ethane has indicated2" that N2O is always more selective for ethene formation than 02,and hence a monatomic oxygen species is the selective oxidizing species for this reaction. These studies
20.68.h9 have all provided
evidence that reaction 4 is a gas phase reaction and the presence of a catalyst only leads to enhance the parallel total oxidation pathway. However, these studies also indicate that reaction 4 is facile under the conditions required for methane partial oxidation and at high conversions, >5/o, it must be considered to be the major route for ethene production.

Lunsford and co-workers'" have proposed that ethane is oxidized to carbon oxides viti ethene and a direct pathway from ethane is not significant. However. no firm experimental evidence was provided in support of this hypothesis, and other studies have indicated that direct oxidation of ethane to carbon oxides occurs for Li'Mg04' and Sm203.58 From a detailed comparison of ethane oxidation by either 0 2

Roos et al.?l considered that the hydrogen could result from a number of different pathways including: dehydrogenation of ethane, the water gas shift reaction, the decomposi- tion of formaldehyde, and steam reforming reactions. In addition, hydrogen is well known as a reaction product from previous gas phase methane oxidation studies,' and Kimble and Kolts 72 account for hydrogen formation uia decomposi- tion of ethyl radicals to ethylene and hydrogen atoms, i.e. reaction 2. At the current level of definition it is possible to discount the significant involvement of ethane dehydrogenation, reaction 3, when unconverted oxidant is present. This has been shown by direct studies with ethane,20 and in addition it is apparent that considerably more hydrogen than ethene is produced in the overall reaction (Table 6). It has also been observed" that the ratio of hydrogen and carbon oxides remains constant at variable contact time for a specific catalyst at constant temperature. The ratio H,/CO, was found to be dependent on the volume of the catalyst bed. It was concluded that a major pathway for hydrogen formation was from a reaction which is linked directly to the formation of carbon oxides. It was considered that a possible route was from the gas phase decomposition of oxygenated products, r.g. CH30H, CH20, formed from the reaction of CH; or CH2 with O2 in the gas phase, cia known reactions.' However, it is clear that a definitive study is still required to fully unravel the origin of hydrogen in this high temperature oxidation reaction.
D. Importance of Gas Phase Reactions.-A
number of the individual reaction pathways considered in the preceding discussion are cited as involving gas phase reactions, rather than being wholly surface-catalysed. In particular, it appears that the prime function of the catalyst surface is to activate methane uia interaction with a surface 0
species, which generates methyl radicals. These radicals are released into the gas phase and subsequently dimerize to form ethane or could react with oxygen to form the methyl peroxy radical which is a precursor for the formation of carbon oxides. Previous studies by Boomer et il." have demonstrated that at high reaction pressures methane can be activated uiu a radical pathway in the absence of a catalyst acting as a radical initiator. It was therefore clear that the effect of increased reaction pressure in the catalysed methane oxidative coupling reaction should be evaluated. An initial study by the present authors 7 3  demonstrated that increasing reaction pressure from 85 kPa to 585 kPa negated the requirement for a catalyst, since at this pressure significant gas phase radicals can be thermally generated. It was noted that the presence of a catalyst could be deleterious since it tended to catalyse the non-selective pathways and hence decrease the yield of the desired products. Subsequent -' J .  B.

Since if the overall activation of methane should be via the oxidative coupling reaction to ethane, with consecutive oxidative dehydrogena- tion to ethene, then based on current evidence it is probable that use of enhanced reaction pressure may yield the best results.It is interesting to note that the enhancement in the selectivity to Cz hydrocarbons observed on addition of LiCl to NiO, in comparison to the effect of addition of Li2C03 or LiN03 (Table 31, may also be due to the involvement of gas phase reactions. It is possible that LiCl acts as a source of gas phase chlorine atoms that can initiate methane activation ilicr hydrogen atom abstraction to form methyl radicals. The observation that catalyst lifetime is proportional to [LiCl] further confirms the direct involvement of the chloride in a non-catalytic mode. It is clear that further experimental work is required to elucidate whether chloride additives to catalysts (Tables 3 and 5 )  do have a true surface catalytic function. Recent studies by Burch ct have started to address this area and preliminary results indicate that surface reactions are involved in the production of ethene with chloride modified catalysts.
E. Overall Reaction Mechanism.--Most
studies, summarized recently by Lee and Oyama have concluded that a simplified reaction network can be utilized to describe the oxidative coupling of methane (Figure 8) and this has been used in various forms in a number of kinetic studies. * 2 8 . 5 8  However, the present review of the current literature indicates that this level of simplification omits essential mechanistic details. Lunsford has considered the reaction in more detail (Figure 9) and has postulated that reaction of a gas phase methyl radical with a surface oxide anion can lead to the formation of a surface methoxy intermediate which is involved in non-selective oxidation. However, the mechanistic proposal does not account for the direct oxidation of ethane to carbon oxides, nor does it consider the direct formation of ethene from methane. It is apparent that for the range of non-reducible oxide catalysts investigated to date (Tables 1 - -5) the K .  Seshm. Appl. C  ( i i d .  19XX. 44. 275.

For the oxides investigated to date the direct formation of ethene from methane occurs only as a minor pathway; it is clear, however, that Sm203 and Li/Sm203 demonstrate the highest primary selectivity to ethene.3s In addition Li/Sm203 has been identified as having a specific activity for ethene formation that is over an order of magnitude higher than Li/MgO (Table 6). However, a detailed study of the surface characterization of S m z03 and Li/Sms03 has yet to be carried out. Such a study used in combination with similar studies for LiiMgO can be expected to be of value in the preparation of Sm103-based catalysts that exhibit improved ethene selectivity and activity. 4 Concluding Remarks The aim of this review has been to highlight the most important aspects of the recent extensive literature concerning the oxidative coupling of methane to higher hydrocarbon products. In this respect a general mechanism for the methane oxidation over non-reducible catalysts has been described and discussed.A major feature of these oxides is that they only became active for carbon- carbon bond formation reactions at high temperatures (>
700 "C)
and at such temperatures it is clear that the gas phase nature of the overall reaction is dominant. Indeed, the use of increased reaction pressure can be more significant in effect than the use of the oxide catalysts described to date. However, it is also apparent that alkali-doped oxide catalysts exhibit a wide range of catalytic activities-a feature that has yet to be optimized. This, therefore, represents a major aspect identified in this review that is worthy of further detailed study. It is anticipated that an investigation of the solid state and surface chemistry of these doped oxides, together with optimization of the surface area, should provide the basis for the identification of improved activity catalysts containing an enhanced concentration of active surface sites. While the current studies indicate that use of increased pressure may be more effective, the use of a suitable catalyst will be of paramount importance in the control of the reaction selectivity. It is further suggested that significant efforts should now be given to the identification of oxide catalysts that are active for selective methane oxidation at lower tempera- tures (<500C) when surface reactions, in preference to gas phase radical chemistry, can be used to control selectivity to the desired product. A feature which is emphasized in this review is that specific oxygen species are responsible for both selective and nonselective oxidation. In particular, studies have indicated the existence of an oxidizing species or site that is involved specifically with total oxidation, but at the present it has not been identified. It can be expected that identification and control of this species or surface site could be of benefit in the preparation of improved catalysts.The most striking feature of the wide range of catalyst evaluation studies reviewed in this article is that few general conclusions can be drawn from the vast body of data. This is primarily a result of the diverse reaction conditions 282 Published on 01 January 1989.
