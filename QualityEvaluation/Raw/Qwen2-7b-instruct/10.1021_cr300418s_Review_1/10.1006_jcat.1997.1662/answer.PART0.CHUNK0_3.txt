[1] "In interpreting the results it is assumed that the concentration of oxygen anion vacancies in the bulk and on the surface are interrelated by a dynamic equilibrium; i.e.,the absolute values may be different in the bulk and on the surface."
[2] "The increasing coverage of the catalyst surface by insulating SrO inhibits the diffusional exchange of oxygen-anions, as well as vacancies between surface and bulk of the catalyst."

The historical perspective of unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis suggests that impurities and additives in oxide catalysts play a crucial role in altering the properties of the catalysts. These additives, like strontium in the case of SrO-doped La2O3, can lead to changes in conductivity and, consequently, catalytic behavior. This understanding implies that the development of modern catalyst design should take into account the dynamic equilibrium between the concentration of vacancies in the bulk and on the surface of the catalyst, and the potential for phase segregation and enrichment of certain elements on the surface, which can impact the catalyst's performance.

历史上，氧化物催化剂中杂质和添加剂的无意使用表明，这些添加剂在改变催化剂性质方面起着关键作用。像SrO掺杂的La2O3中的Sr这样的添加剂会导致导电性的变化，进而影响催化性能。这一理解暗示，现代催化剂设计应该考虑到催化剂本体与表面之间空位浓度的动态平衡，以及表面可能存在的相分离和元素富集现象对催化剂性能的影响。
