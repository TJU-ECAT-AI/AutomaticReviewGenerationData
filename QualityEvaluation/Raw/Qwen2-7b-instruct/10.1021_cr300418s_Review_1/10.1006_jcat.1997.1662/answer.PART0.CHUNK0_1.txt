[1] "It has been reported that many selective OCM catalysts have oxygen anion vacancies in the oxide lattice, which lead to the mobility of oxygen anions at temperatures (>700C) applied in the OCM."
[2] "The oxygen-anion conductivity (σ ion) of metal oxides is related to the concentration of oxygen vacancies c(V••O ), their charge ze, and their mobility ion (17); using the KroegerVink-notation one obtains σion = c(V•• O ) 2e ion;"
[3] "Besides anionic conductivity most of the selective catalysts exhibit defect electron conductivity (σp), which results from the uptake of oxygen which interacts with the anion vacancies (18)."
[4] "In the present work, La2O3 known as OCM catalyst (2, 19, 20), was doped with 1 at-% of Zn2+, Ti4+, and Nb5+ and different amounts of Sr2+ (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 20.0 at-%) as indicatedinTable1whichalsocontainsfurtherdetailsofthe preparation procedure."
[5] "The apparent activation energies derived from Figs. 1 and 2arelistedinTable3.IncomparisontoundopedLa2O3,the addition of Ti4+ and Nb5+ increases the activation en- ergy for oxygen-anion mobility, while it is decreased by the addition of Zn2+ or Sr2+. With increasing SrO content the activation energy diminishes from 109 kJ/mol (undoped La2O3) to 75 kJ/mol (3 at-% SrO); the activation energy is not significantly changed by further SrO addition up to 20 at-%."
[6] "As indicated by Eq. [6], p-type conductivity is affected by anion vacancy concentration. Therefore, when the concen- tration of unoccupied O2-lattice sites is increased by Sr2+ or Zn2+ doping, not only ionic but also p-type conductivity is increased; addition of Ti4+ or Nb5+ causes the opposite effect."
[7] "From the above results and the respective discussion it might be concluded that changes in the foreign-cation content should affect conductivity and thus, C2+ selectivi- ty. However, whereas anionic conductivity of SrO-doped La2O3 increases with increasing SrO content C2+ selectivi- ty passes through a maximum at 1.0 at-% Sr (see Figs. 2 and 6)."

The document discusses how impurities and additives, specifically in the case of La2O3 doped with Zn2+, Ti4+, Nb5+, and varying amounts of Sr2+, have been used to alter the concentration of oxygen anion vacancies within the oxide lattice. These changes in vacancies impact the oxygen-anion conductivity and, subsequently, the catalytic properties of the material. The study shows that a higher concentration of oxygen anion vacancies favors the adsorption of gaseous oxygen and its transformation into lattice oxygen, which reduces the presence of weakly adsorbed electrophilic oxygen species. This reduction suppresses non-selective surface reactions, improving the selectivity for C2+ hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) process. The historical perspective of using impurities inadvertently in catalysts highlights the importance of understanding the role of oxygen-anion conductivity in catalyst performance, influencing the development of modern catalyst design strategies.

The key findings suggest that the oxygen-anion conductivity is the dominant factor affecting the C2+ selectivity in OCM reactions. The conductivity of the catalyst increases with the concentration of oxygen anion vacancies, which in turn affects the adsorption and transformation of oxygen species, thereby impacting the selectivity towards desired products. The study also points out that the surface enrichment of certain impurities, like SrO, can lead to a decrease in conductivity and selectivity due to the formation of a low-conductivity marginal layer, which restricts the diffusive exchange of oxygen anions between the bulk and surface of the catalyst. This insight underscores the complex interplay between bulk and surface properties in determining catalytic performance and the need for precise control over defect concentrations for optimized catalyst design.

文档讨论了如何杂质和添加剂，特别是在镧酸盐La2O3中掺入锌2+、钛4+、铌5+以及不同量的锶2+，改变了氧化物晶格中氧离子空位的浓度。这些空位的变化影响了氧离子传导性和随后的催化性能。研究表明，高浓度的氧离子空位有利于吸附气体氧并将其转化为晶格氧，从而减少了弱吸附的亲电氧物种的存在。这抑制了表面非选择性反应，提高了甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）过程中C2+烃类的选择性。催化剂历史上的意外使用表明，理解氧离子传导性在催化剂性能中的作用对于现代催化剂设计策略的发展至关重要。

主要发现表明，氧离子传导性是决定OCM反应中C2+选择性的主导因素。催化剂的传导性随着氧离子空位浓度的增加而增加，进而影响氧物种的吸附和转化，从而影响所需产品的选择性。研究还指出，某些杂质，如锶氧（SrO），的表面富集会导致传导性和选择性的下降，由于形成了一层低传导性的边缘层，限制了氧离子在催化剂体部与表面之间的扩散交换。这一见解强调了体部和表面属性之间复杂相互作用在确定催化性能中的重要性，并且需要精确控制缺陷浓度以实现优化的催化剂设计。

文档揭示了掺杂对催化性能的影响机制，以及如何通过调整氧离子传导性来调控反应选择性。此外，研究还探讨了表面富集特定杂质导致的传导性降低和选择性损失的原因，这是由于形成了限制氧离子在催化剂本体和表面间扩散交换的低传导性边缘层。这些发现对于理解催化过程的动态平衡和开发更高效的催化剂具有重要意义。
