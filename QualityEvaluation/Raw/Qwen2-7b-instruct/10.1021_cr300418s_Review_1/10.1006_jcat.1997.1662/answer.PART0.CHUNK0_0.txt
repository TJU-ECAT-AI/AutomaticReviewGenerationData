The incorporation of lower valent cations (Zn2+, Sr2+) leads to an increase in anion conductivity; for cations of higher valency (Nb5+, Ti4+) the opposite effect was observed.
At constant temperature oxygen-anion conductivities of SrO/La2O3 mixed oxides increases with a rising SrO content and approaches a maximum value at 3 at-%.
The apparent activation energies derived from Figs. 1 and 2 are listed in Table 3. 
Since oxygen-anion conductivity is directly proportional to the concentration of oxygen lattice vacancies the conductivity change caused by altervalent doping with lower-or higher-valent cations can be attributed to the creation or depletion of anion vacancies.
The correlation between oxygen-anion conductivity and C2+ selectivity manifests that oxygen-anion conductivity is obviously the overwhelming catalyst property which affects C2+ selectivity, i.e., the higher oxygen-anion conductivity the higher C2+ selectivity.

The presence of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as doping with lower valent cations like Sr2+ or Zn2+, has led to an increase in anion conductivity, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards higher carbon hydrocarbons in the oxidative coupling of methane. Higher valency cations like Ti4+ or Nb5+ have the opposite effect, reducing conductivity and selectivity. This indicates that the concentration of oxygen lattice vacancies, which is directly proportional to anion conductivity, plays a crucial role in the catalytic performance. The correlation between anion conductivity and C2+ selectivity highlights that higher conductivity leads to better selectivity, suggesting that modern catalyst design should aim for low activation energy for oxygen-anion conductivity to achieve high oxygen mobility at lower temperatures.

在氧化物催化剂中添加杂质和添加剂，例如通过Sr2+或Zn2+掺杂，导致氧离子导电性的增加，从而提高了甲烷氧化偶联过程中更高碳氢化合物的选择性。高电荷价态的元素如Ti4+或Nb5+则产生相反的效果，降低导电性和选择性。这表明氧原子晶格位点的浓度，与氧离子导电性成正比，对催化性能至关重要。氧离子导电性和C2+选择性的相关性表明，更高的导电性可带来更好的选择性，暗示现代催化剂设计应致力于在较低温度下实现较高的氧分子活性。
