[1] "Many selective OCM catalysts have oxygen anion vacancies in the oxide lattice, which lead to the mobility of oxygen anions at temperatures (>700C) applied in the OCM."
[2] "The conductivity data were then related to the corresponding C2+ selectivities."
[3] "By blocking the oxygen anion vacancies, the transformation of weakly adsorbed oxygen species into lattice oxygen is restrained markedly, resulting in a selectivity decrease as compared to the maximum."

1. Doped oxide catalysts have contributed to unintentional uses historically due to the presence of oxygen anion vacancies, which enhance oxygen mobility at high temperatures. These vacancies allow for better oxygen adsorption and transformation, impacting the selectivity of reactions like the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM).
2. The conductivity of doped oxide catalysts was correlated with their C2+ selectivity, indicating that the mobility of oxygen ions affects the efficiency of the catalytic process.
3. The enrichment of insulating substances like SrO on the surface of doped oxide catalysts can inhibit the diffusion of oxygen anions and vacancies between the surface and bulk, leading to a reduction in the concentration of unoccupied oxygen lattice sites on the surface and thus decreasing selectivity.

1. 历史上，掺杂氧化物催化剂的非故意使用是由于氧化离子空位的存在，这在高温下提高了氧气的流动性。这些空位允许更好的氧吸附和转换，影响了甲烷氧化耦合（OCM）等反应的选择性。
2. 掺杂氧化物催化剂的导电性与它们的C2+选择性相关，表明氧气离子的流动性影响催化过程的效率。
3. 在掺杂氧化物催化剂表面富集绝缘物质如SrO可以抑制氧气离子和空位在表面和主体之间的扩散，导致表面未占有的氧晶格点浓度降低，从而减少选择性。
