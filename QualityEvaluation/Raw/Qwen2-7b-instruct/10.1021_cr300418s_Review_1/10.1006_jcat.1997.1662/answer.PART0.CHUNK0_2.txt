[1] "In the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2- hydrocarbons the nature of oxygen species participating in the reaction is not yet fully understood."
[2] "It has been reported that many selective OCM catalysts have oxygen anion vacancies in the oxide lattice, which lead to the mobility of oxygen anions at temperatures (>700C) applied in the OCM."
[3] "Assuming a dynamic equilibrium between the concentration of oxygen anion vacancies in the bulk and on the surface of the solid catalyst the incorporation of adsorbed oxygen in the catalyst is favoured by a high oxygen-anion conductivity."
[4] "By blocking the oxygen anion vacancies, the transformation of weakly adsorbed oxygen species into lattice oxygen is restrained markedly, resulting in a selectivity decrease as compared to the maximum."

The impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as oxygen anion vacancies, have historically led to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. These vacancies facilitate the mobility of oxygen ions and contribute to the selectivity of catalysts in reactions like the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). As the concentration of oxygen anion vacancies increases, the adsorption of oxygen and its transformation into lattice oxygen are favored, which in turn affects the selectivity of the catalyst. The historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the role of these vacancies in catalyst behavior, guiding modern catalyst design to optimize selectivity and efficiency.

氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂，如氧离子空位，历史上导致了掺杂氧化物催化剂的非故意使用。这些空位促进了氧离子的移动性，并对甲烷氧化合物（OCM）反应的选择性有影响。随着氧离子空位浓度的增加，氧气的吸附和转化为晶格氧得到促进，从而影响催化剂的选择性。历史视角强调了理解这些空位在催化剂行为中的作用的重要性，指导现代催化剂设计以优化选择性和效率。
