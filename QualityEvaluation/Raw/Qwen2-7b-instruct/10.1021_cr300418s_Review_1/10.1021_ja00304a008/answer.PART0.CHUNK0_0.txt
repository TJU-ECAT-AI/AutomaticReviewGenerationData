[1] "These results parallel those of gas-phase studies involving 0- and al- kanes.I0"
[2] "The C2 yield is defined as the product of conversion and C, selectivity."
[3] "The reason for this unusual phenomenon is not obvious."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The findings in this study mirror the outcomes from gas-phase investigations focusing on 0- and alkanes.
2. The C2 yield is calculated by multiplying the conversion rate and the C, selectivity.
3. The rationale behind the peculiar observation remains unclear.
