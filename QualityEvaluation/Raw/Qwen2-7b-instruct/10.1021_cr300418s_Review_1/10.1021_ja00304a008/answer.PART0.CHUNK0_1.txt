[1] "Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities when CHI and O2 are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures."
[2] "These C2 compounds are formed via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced mainly by the reaction of CHI with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO."
[3] "An unusual feature of this reaction system is that both the C2 selectivity and the CH4 conversion increase with increasing temperatures up to ca. 700 'C."
[4] "One of the dominant pathways which leads to undesirable products of CO and C02 is the reaction of CH3. with surface 02- ions; therefore, low surface areas favor high C2 selectivities."
[5] "The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst which does not contain metal ions having a variable oxidation state."

1. When methane and oxygen are passed over lithium-promoted magnesium oxide catalysts at high temperatures, ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities.
2. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced by the reaction of methane with active [Li'O-] centers on magnesium oxide, forms these C2 compounds.
3. Both the selectivity for C2 compounds and the conversion of methane increase with temperature up to around 700°C in this reaction system.
4. The reaction of methane radicals with surface oxygen ions leads to the formation of undesired products like CO and CO2, which favors high C2 selectivities when the surface area is low.
5. The lithium-promoted magnesium oxide system is a novel type of oxidation catalyst that lacks metal ions with variable oxidation states.

1. 当甲烷和氧气在锂促进的镁氧化物催化剂上以高温通过时，会在高产率下得到良好的选择性乙烯和乙烷。
2. 通过甲烷与镁氧化物上的活性[Li'O-]中心反应形成气相甲基自由基，这些甲基自由基结合形成C2化合物。
3. 在这个反应体系中，随着温度上升到约700°C，C2的选择性和甲烷的转化率同时增加。
4. 甲烷自由基与表面氧离子的反应会导致CO和CO2等不希望产物的生成，因此较低的表面积有利于较高的C2选择性。
5. 锂促进的镁氧化物系统是一种新型的氧化催化剂，不含具有变价氧化态的金属离子。
