[1] "The Li/MgO system is a new type of oxidation catalyst which does not contain metal ions having a variable oxidation state."
[2] "Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities when CHI and O2 are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures."
[3] "These C2 compounds are formed via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced mainly by the reaction of CHI with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO."
[4] "An unusual feature of this reaction system is that both the C2 selectivity and the CH4 conversion increase with increasing temperatures up to ca. 700 'C."
[5] "One of the dominant pathways which leads to unwanted products of CO and C02 is the reaction of CH3. with surface 02- ions; therefore, low surface areas favor high C2 selectivities."

1. The Li/MgO catalyst system is unique as it doesn't involve metal ions with changing oxidation states, distinguishing it from traditional catalyst designs.
2. When methane and oxygen are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures, high yields of ethane and ethylene are produced with good selectivity.
3. The C2 compounds, such as ethane and ethylene, are formed through the coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals, primarily generated by the reaction of methane with active [Li'O-] centers on the MgO surface.
4. A distinctive characteristic of this reaction system is that both the selectivity for C2 compounds and the conversion of methane improve with increasing temperature up to around 700°C.
5. One of the primary pathways that generates undesired products like CO and CO2 involves the reaction of CH3 radicals with surface O2 ions; hence, catalysts with lower surface areas are favored for higher C2 selectivities.
6. The Li/MgO system represents a novel type of oxidation catalyst that lacks metal ions with variable oxidation states, offering a distinct approach in catalysis.

1. Li/MgO催化剂系统独特之处在于不包含具有可变氧化状态的金属离子，与传统催化剂设计不同。
2. 当甲烷和氧气在高温下通过Li/MgO催化剂时，可以高产率地生成乙烷和乙烯，并且选择性良好。
3. 这些C2化合物（如乙烷和乙烯）是通过气相甲基自由基的耦合形成的，主要由甲烷与MgO表面活性的[Li'O-]中心反应产生。
4. 这个反应体系的一个显著特征是，随着温度的升高（直到约700°C），C2化合物的选择性和甲烷的转化率都会增加。
5. 生成CO和CO2等不希望产物的主要途径是甲基（CH3）自由基与表面O2离子反应；因此，低表面积有利于提高C2选择性。
6. Li/MgO系统代表了一种新型的氧化催化剂，它不含具有可变氧化状态的金属离子，提供了一种独特的催化方法。
