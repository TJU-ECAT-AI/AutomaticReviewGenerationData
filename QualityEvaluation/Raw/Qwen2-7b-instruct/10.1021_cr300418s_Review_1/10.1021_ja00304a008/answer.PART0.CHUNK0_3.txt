[1] "One of the dominant pathways which leads to undesirable products of CO and CO2 is the reaction of CH3. with surface O2- ions; therefore, low surface areas favor high C2 selectivities."
[2] "An unusual feature of this reaction system is that both the C2 selectivity and the CH4 conversion increase with increasing temperatures up to ca. 700 'C."
[3] "Ethane and ethylene are produced in high yields with good selectivities when CH4 and O2 are passed over Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures."
[4] "These C2 compounds are formed via the coupling of the gas-phase methyl radicals, which are produced mainly by the reaction of CH4 with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO."
[5] "An attempt is currently being made to detect [Li'O-] centers in quenched Li2CO3."

1. Low surface areas favor high C2 selectivities due to the reaction of CH3. with surface O2- ions leading to undesirable products of CO and CO2.
2. The C2 selectivity and the conversion of CH4 increase with increasing temperatures up to around 700°C in this reaction system.
3. Ethane and ethylene are produced efficiently with good selectivity when CH4 and O2 are used with Li/MgO catalysts at high temperatures.
4. The coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals forms C2 compounds, which are mainly produced by the reaction of CH4 with active [Li'O-] centers on MgO.
5. Researchers are currently trying to detect [Li'O-] centers in quenched Li2CO3.

1. 低表面面积有利于高C2选择性，因为CH3.与表面O2-离子反应会产生不希望得到的CO和CO2产品。
2. 在此反应体系中，C2选择性和CH4的转化率随温度升高至约700°C而增加。
3. 当使用Li/MgO催化剂在高温下处理CH4和O2时，可以高效地产生乙烷和乙烯，并具有良好的选择性。
4. 气相甲基自由基的耦合形成C2化合物，主要通过CH4与MgO上的活性[Li'O-]中心反应产生。
5. 研究人员目前正尝试在冷却的Li2CO3中检测到[Li'O-]中心。
