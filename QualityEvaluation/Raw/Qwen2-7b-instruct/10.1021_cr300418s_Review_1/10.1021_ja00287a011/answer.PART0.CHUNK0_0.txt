[1] "The fact that sodium was less effective in generating active sites than lithium also suggests the importance of a substitutional defect site."
[2] "Moreover, a good correlation was found between the rate of methyl radical formation and the"
[3] "Although this behavior was observed for these samples, the remaining results indicate that when the samples of different purity were examined, the activity was influenced to a much greater extent by the sample purity than by variations in the surface area."
[4] "The initial activity of the different MgO samples examined, along with their specific surface areas, is presented in Table 11."
[5] "Activity was found to increase by a factor of 1.7 in going from the undoped MgO(F) sample to the ultrapure undoped MgO(B) sample; however, accompanying this increase there was a decrease in surface area by a factor of 5.1."

1. The effectiveness of generating active sites varies with different impurities, suggesting the significance of substitutional defect sites in catalyst performance.
2. There is a good correlation between the rate of methyl radical formation and the concentration of specific centers, possibly indicating the importance of certain defect sites.
3. Sample purity has a greater impact on catalytic activity than changes in surface area, affecting the efficiency of methane conversion.
4. The initial activity of MgO samples is listed in Table 11, showing the relationship between surface area and activity.
5. Going from the undoped MgO(F) sample to the ultrapure MgO(B) sample, the activity increases by a factor of 1.7, but the surface area decreases by a factor of 5.1.
