1. The catalytic activity of MgO for butene isomerization and H2-D2 exchange has been attributed to oxygen ions at sites of low coordination. These reactions were found to be stoichiometric rather than catalytic, with 0-, OF, and 0- species showing reactivity, with 0- being the most active.

2. The study of reactions of alkanes with oxygen ions 0-, OF, and 0- revealed that these reactions were not catalytic but rather stoichiometric, indicating the reactivity of these oxygen species at different coordination sites.

3. Among the three species, 0- ions were found to be the most reactive, capable of abstracting hydrogen from methane to form methyl radicals, even at low temperatures of 77 K.

4. Over pure MgO, intrinsic cation vacancies interact with molecular oxygen to create an 0- center that abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane, leading to the formation of a methyl radical.

5. Lithium doping in MgO leads to the formation of [LitO-] centers, which contribute to the enhanced activity of the catalyst.

6. The large activation energy of 42 kcal mol-1 likely involves the mobility of species across the surface or the endothermic formation of 0; centers.

7. Ethane formation through the coupling of gas-phase methyl radicals is probable, although the conversion of methane is minimal.

1. MgO在丁烯异构化和H2-D2交换过程中的催化活性归因于低配位点上的氧离子。这些反应被认为是定量反应而非催化反应，其中0-、OF和0-物种显示出反应性，且0-是活性最高的。

2. 对烷烃与氧离子0-、OF和0-的研究显示，这些反应是定量反应而不是催化反应，表明这些氧物种在不同配位点的反应性。

3. 其中，0-离子被发现是最活跃的，能够从甲烷中抽象氢原子形成甲基自由基，即使在77 K的低温下也是如此。

4. 在纯MgO上，内在的阳离子空位与分子氧相互作用产生一个0-中心，该中心从甲烷中抽象氢原子，导致甲基自由基的形成。

5. 锂掺杂在MgO中导致形成[LitO-]中心，这增加了催化剂的活性。

6. 大约42 kcal mol-1的活化能可能涉及表面物种的移动或形成0;中心的吸热过程。

7. 通过气相甲基自由基的耦合形成乙烷的可能性很大，尽管甲烷的转化率很低。
