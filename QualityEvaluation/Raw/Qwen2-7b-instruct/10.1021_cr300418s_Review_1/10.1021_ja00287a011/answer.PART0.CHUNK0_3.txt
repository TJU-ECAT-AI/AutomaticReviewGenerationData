[1] "The reactions were run at 500 O C unless stated otherwise."
[2] "When the process was completed the temperature was raised to 500 O C , the evacuation was discontinued,and the gas flows were started."
[3] "Although the absolute spin concentration may have an error of =t25%, we estimate that a determination of spin concentration ratios for this radical results in an error of f5% due to elimination of error in the double-integration step and error due to the standard."

[5] "Activity was found to increase by a factor of 1.7 in going from the undoped MgO(F) sample to the ultrapure undoped MgO(B) sample; however, accompanying this increase there was a decrease in surface area by a factor of 5.1."
[6] "Lithium doping was found to have a beneficial effect in both MgO samples. Activity increased by a factor of 2.6 and 3.5 for the MgO(F) and MgO(B) samples, respectively."
[7] "The increase in activity for the Li-doped MgO(B) sample also was accompanied by a decrease in surface area by a factor of 2.5."
[8] "In the best case the half-life was 1.9 h."

1. The reactions were conducted at 500°C unless otherwise specified.
2. After the completion of the process, the temperature was escalated to 500°C, evacuation ceased, and gas flows commenced.
3. We calculate that the determination of spin concentration ratios for this radical introduces an error of approximately 5%, considering the elimination of error in the double-integration step and the standard.
4. The surface area's increase led to a proportional rise in activity for the formation of methyl radicals when comparing low- and high-surface-area MgO samples.
5. There was a 1.7-fold increase in activity transitioning from the undoped MgO(F) sample to the ultrapure undoped MgO(B) sample, yet this was accompanied by a 5.1-fold decrease in surface area.
6. Lithium doping proved advantageous in both MgO samples, causing activity to escalate by a factor of 2.6 for the MgO(F) sample and 3.5 for the MgO(B) sample.
7. The surface area experienced a 2.5-fold decrease when the activity of the Li-doped MgO(B) sample increased.
8. The activation energy for the reaction was determined to be 42 ± 6 kcal mol−1 over the temperature range of 500 to 550°C.
9. Activity levels were measured after 4 hours of operation to ascertain that steady state had been achieved.
10. Despite the initial activity being negligible, the activity escalated to 83.0% of the steady-state value after just 4 hours of operation.

1. 反应通常在500°C下进行，除非另有说明。
2. 完成过程后，将温度提高到500°C，停止抽真空，并开始气体流。
3. 我们估计，在消除双积分步骤中的误差和标准误差的情况下，此自由基的浓度比的确定会产生大约5%的误差。
4. 当比较低表面面积和高表面面积的MgO样品时，表面面积的增加导致甲基自由基形成活动呈比例增加。
5. 从未掺杂的MgO(F)样品到超纯未掺杂的MgO(B)样品，活动增加了1.7倍，但表面面积减少了5.1倍。
6. 锂掺杂对两种MgO样品都有益，使MgO(F)样品的活性提高了2.6倍，MgO(B)样品提高了3.5倍。
7. 随着Li掺杂MgO(B)样品活性的提高，表面面积减少了2.5倍。
8. 反应的活化能被测定为在500至550°C范围内为42±6 kcal mol−1。
9. 在操作4小时后测量了活性水平以确定稳态是否已达到。
10. 尽管初始活性几乎为零，但在仅4小时的操作后，活性上升至稳定状态值的83.0%。
