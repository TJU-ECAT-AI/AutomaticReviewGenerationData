[1] "Recent work has shown that it is possible to produce a [Li'O-] center in single crystals of lithium-doped MgO by heating the samples to temperatures of 1000 to 1300 °C in the presence of O2 and then rapidly quenching to 77 K."
[2] "These paramagnetic centers are characterized by g ,(13) Abraham, M. M.; Chen, Y.; Boatner, L. A,; Reynolds, R. W. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1976, 37, 849."
[3] "The signal at g = 2.0544 is in excellent agreement with the published value of g, = 2.0545."
[4] "The signal intensity was strongly influenced by the conditioning temperature."
[5] "The centers produced on quenching from 1000 and 700 °C were found to be indefinitely stable on standing at ambient temperatures under a static vacuum or in the presence of air."
[6] "The major difference being that no [Li+O-] signal was detected, as expected, in the absence of any added lithium; whereas, the pure MgO exhibited a small amount of intrinsic activity for CH,. radical formation."
[7] "Moreover, the signal could not be eliminated by reaction with gas-phase molecules including CO, CH,, or O,, and the signal was not altered when the sample was in the presence of 175 torr of gas-phase O2."
[8] "The possible role of 02- in forming methyl radicals was explored."
[9] "In earlier work it was demonstrated that 02- could be produced on MgO at low temperatures by preadsorbing hydrogen or other hydrocarbon prior to O2 exposure."
[10] "It seems more reasonable that the 0,- ions were formed thermally at defect and lithium impurity sites."
