[1] "Noble metal ions in a number of new oxide supports such as Ce1xAxO2 (A = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th,) can be developed."
[2] "Substitution of first row transition metal ions in CeO2 are amenable to redox coupling between M(3d) and Ce(4f)."
[3] "There are a number of other reducible oxide supports such as SnO2 or V2O5. Redox properties of noble metal ions in first row transition metal oxides are not yet explored."

Historically, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have unintentionally led to the development of doped oxide catalysts. These impurities and additives have altered the catalytic properties of the materials, contributing to the evolution of catalytic processes. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between the dopants and the host material, as well as the redox properties of the catalysts. It suggests that the exploration of redox behavior in reducible metal oxides doped with more easily reducible noble metal ions could be a fruitful area for future research in catalysis combined with solid-state chemistry.
