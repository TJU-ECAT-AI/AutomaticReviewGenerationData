[1] "Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have historically led to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. These impurities and additives often serve as dopants, altering the properties of the base oxide. The historical perspective underscores the complex interplay between dopant elements and the catalytic performance of oxide catalysts."
[2] "Understanding the historical context of doped oxide catalysts highlights the importance of considering dopant effects in modern catalyst design. It suggests that careful selection of dopants can significantly influence catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability."
