The historical perspective on impurities and additives in oxide catalysts reveals how unintentionally doped oxides have evolved through catalysis development. The incorporation of various impurities and additives, such as Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th in Ce1xAxO2, has led to the discovery of new catalyst properties. This historical understanding underscores the significance of redox coupling in catalyst design, particularly between metal ions and the surrounding oxide lattice. By exploring the redox behavior of reducible metal oxides with additional noble metal doping, researchers can enhance catalyst performance, making it a promising area for future catalyst design.
