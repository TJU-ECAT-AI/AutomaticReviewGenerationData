[1] "The catalytic activity of noble metal ion substituted in reducible oxide is much higher than the corresponding metal particles supported on oxides."
[2] "The debate on the exact nature of noble metalsupport oxide interaction continues and a basic principle to design a three-way catalyst is yet to emerge."
[3] "Noble metal ions in a number of new oxide supports such as Ce1xAxO2 (A = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th,) can be developed. Substitution of first row transition metal ions in CeO2 are amenable to redox coupling between M(3d) and Ce(4f)."

Historically, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have led to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts. These impurities and additives, often introduced during the manufacturing process, have interacted with the base materials in ways that researchers did not fully understand. This has resulted in catalysts with unexpected properties and performance. This historical perspective highlights the complexity of catalyst behavior and underscores the importance of understanding the interactions between the base materials, additives, and impurities. It implies that a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic process is crucial for the development of modern catalyst design. Modern catalyst development aims to harness these unintentional effects deliberately by carefully selecting impurities and additives to achieve desired catalytic properties.

In the context of the provided literature, the authors discuss the development of noble metal ionic catalysts, which are a result of doped oxide catalysts. The literature explains how the substitution of noble metal ions in reducible oxide supports like CeO2, TiO2, and Ce1xTixO2 leads to improved catalytic activity. This development is significant because it allows for the optimization of catalysts by precisely controlling the doping process. The implications for modern catalyst design include the potential to create catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications, such as enhanced selectivity in automotive exhaust catalysts.

The literature also suggests that there is still room for exploration in understanding the redox behavior of reducible metal oxides doped with noble metal ions. This ongoing research could lead to the development of new catalysts with improved performance, expanding the possibilities for the application of doped oxide catalysts in various industries.
