[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is not our intention to provide an accurate or comprehensive history of the subject. Paravano (55-57) seems to be the first scientist who prepared substitutionally doped oxide intentionally, to boost the performance of an oxide catalyst."
[4] "We are aware of only two articles that review catalytic chemistry of doped oxides (besides the ones mentioned in connection with oxidative methane coupling). One, by Cimino and Stone, (83) is mainly concerned with oxides more complex than the binary oxides studied here."

1. Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis by affecting catalytic activity. Even at low concentrations, substitutional dopants can alter the surface properties of oxide catalysts, impacting their performance. Additives, such as those in industrial catalysts, also play roles in preventing coarsening, enhancing stability, and increasing conversion efficiency, among other benefits. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the composition of catalysts and the potential effects of minor components on catalytic processes.

2. The historical note suggests that the concept of doped oxide catalysts was not formally recognized until Paravano's work in the late 20th century. Paravano intentionally prepared doped oxides to improve the performance of oxide catalysts, demonstrating that the idea of using dopants in catalysts was not entirely new. This work laid foundational groundwork for further research in this area.

3. There are limited resources that comprehensively review the catalytic chemistry of doped oxides, particularly those focusing on binary oxides. Cimino and Stone's article addresses more complex oxide systems, while Hegde's work emphasizes the extensive research conducted within his Bangalore-based group. These reviews indicate a specialized focus in the field, with a need for more general overviews that encompass various types of doped oxide catalysts.

1. 氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂通过影响催化活性，在催化历史中促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的非故意使用。即使在低浓度下，取代掺杂物也可能改变氧化物催化剂表面的性质，影响其性能。工业催化剂中的添加剂也起到防止粗化、提高稳定性、防止催化剂蒸发、增加转化率、提高选择性或抑制不需要反应等作用。这一历史视角强调了理解催化剂组成以及成分对催化过程潜在影响的重要性。

2. 历史记录表明，掺杂氧化物催化剂的概念直到20世纪末才被正式认可，Paravano的工作是这一领域的先驱。Paravano有意制备掺杂氧化物以提升氧化物催化剂的性能，这表明使用掺杂物作为催化剂的想法并非全新的。他的工作为这一领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

3. 目前仅有限的资源全面回顾了掺杂氧化物的催化化学，特别是针对二元氧化物的研究。Cimino和Stone的文章侧重于更复杂的氧化物系统，而Hegde的工作则强调了其在班加罗尔团队进行的广泛研究。这些综述显示了该领域的一个专业化焦点，需要更多覆盖各种类型掺杂氧化物催化剂的综合概述。
