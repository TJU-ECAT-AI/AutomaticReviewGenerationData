[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."
[4] "Paravano (55-57) seems to be the first scientist who prepared substitutionally doped oxide intentionally, to boost the performance of an oxide catalyst."
[5] "Lunsford (60) showed that Li-doped MgO is a selective catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene."

The historical note highlights how impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have played a significant role in unintentionally using doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. These low-level impurities, which can act as substitutional dopants, affect the catalytic activity at the surface without significantly altering the overall concentration. Additionally, additives present in industrial catalysts serve various purposes such as preventing coarsening, enhancing mechanical stability, inhibiting catalyst evaporation, increasing conversion efficiency, improving selectivity, or poisoning unwanted reactions. This suggests that the intentional use of doped oxides as catalysts is not a recent phenomenon, potentially as old as traditional oxide-based catalysis itself. However, the explicit awareness of this practice has only emerged more recently, with notable contributions from researchers like Paravano and Lunsford, who demonstrated the effectiveness of lithium-doped magnesium oxide in oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene.

历史记录指出，氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂在催化历史上无意中使用掺杂氧化物催化剂方面发挥了重要作用。这些低水平的杂质可以作为取代掺杂剂，在表面影响催化活性，而不显著改变总体浓度。此外，工业催化剂中的添加剂用于防止粗化、增强机械稳定性、抑制催化剂蒸发、提高转化率、提升选择性或中毒不希望的反应（实现选择性的方法之一）。这表明有意使用掺杂氧化物作为催化剂并非近期现象，可能与传统的氧化物基催化一样古老。然而，这一实践的明确意识直到最近才出现，得益于帕瓦诺等研究人员的工作，他们展示了锂掺杂的镁氧化物在甲烷氧化耦合到乙烯中的选择性催化剂作用。
