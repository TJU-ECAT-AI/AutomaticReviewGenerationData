[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is not our intention to provide an accurate or comprehensive history of the subject. Paravano (55-57) seems to be the first scientist who prepared substitutionally doped oxide intentionally, to boost the performance of an oxide catalyst."
[4] "The idea of using substitutional doping of oxides in catalysis languished until around 1985 when Lunsford (60) showed that Li-doped MgO is a selective catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene."

The historical note suggests that impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, which are often present in low concentrations, have inadvertently contributed to the use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. These impurities and additives, acting as dopants, can affect the catalytic activity of oxide catalysts without explicit intent. The introduction of substitutional doping became more prominent around 1985, following Lunsford's demonstration that lithium-doped magnesium oxide (Li-doped MgO) could selectively catalyze the oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene. This finding revitalized the use of substitutional doping in oxide catalysts for various industrial applications.

历史记录表明，氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂，由于浓度通常很低，意外地促进了氧化物掺杂催化剂在整个催化历史中的应用。这些杂质和添加剂作为掺杂剂，可以在不知情的情况下影响氧化物催化剂的催化活性。大约在1985年，随着Lunsford展示锂掺杂的镁氧化物（锂掺杂MgO）可以选择性地催化甲烷氧化耦合为乙烯，掺杂氧化物在工业应用中的使用重新受到重视。这一发现激发了氧化物掺杂催化剂的更多应用。
