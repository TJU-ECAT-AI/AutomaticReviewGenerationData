[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."
[4] "The idea of using substitutional doping of oxides in catalysis languished until around 1985 when Lunsford (60) showed that Li-doped MgO is a selective catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene."

1. Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have historically contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts by affecting catalytic activity. These impurities, which are often substitutional dopants, can alter the catalyst's surface properties and thus influence its performance, even when their overall concentration is low. Additives in industrial catalysts also play roles such as preventing coarsening, providing mechanical stability, and increasing conversion or selectivity, which might mimic the effects of doped oxides without explicit intention.

2. The historical perspective suggests that the use of doped oxides in catalysis could date back to the early days of catalysis itself, although this was not widely recognized. This realization highlights the potential for discovering novel catalysts through the study of existing materials.

3. The idea of using substitutional doping in oxides for catalytic purposes experienced a resurgence around 1985, thanks to Lunsford's demonstration of lithium-doped magnesium oxide as an effective catalyst for the oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene. This event marked a significant advancement in the field, leading to a surge in subsequent research.

1. 氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂通过影响催化活性，历史上促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的非故意使用。这些杂质往往是置换掺杂剂，它们可以改变催化剂表面的性质，从而影响其性能，即使它们的整体浓度非常低。工业催化剂中的添加剂也扮演着防止粗化、提供机械稳定性、防止催化剂蒸发、提高转化率或抑制不需要反应（一种实现选择性的方法）的角色，这可能与掺杂氧化物的效果相似，但没有明确的意图。

2. 历史视角表明，掺杂氧化物在催化中的应用可能可以追溯到催化早期，尽管这一事实并未广为人知。这一认识揭示了通过研究现有材料发现新型催化剂的可能性。

3. 掺杂氧化物用于催化的想法在1985年前后重新兴起，多亏了Lunsford证明了锂掺杂的镁氧化物是甲烷氧化耦合至乙烯的有效催化剂。这一事件标志着该领域的一个重大进步，随后的研究激增。
