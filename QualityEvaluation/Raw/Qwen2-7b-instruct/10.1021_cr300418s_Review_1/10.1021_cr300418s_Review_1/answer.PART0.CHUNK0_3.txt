[1] "Most oxide catalysts have low levels of impurities that may be substitutional dopants; if they segregate at the surface, they can affect the catalytic activity without our knowledge even though their net concentration is very low."
[2] "Furthermore, most industrial catalysts have small amounts of additives that prevent coarsening, provide mechanical stability, prevent the evaporation of the catalyst, increase conversion, increase selectivity, or poison an unwanted reaction (one way of achieving selectivity)."
[3] "It is possible that catalysis by doped oxides is as old as catalysis by oxides, but we were not aware of the fact."

1. Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis by affecting catalytic activity and enhancing various properties of catalysts. These elements, though present in low concentrations, can modify the electronic properties of oxides, such as conductivity and adsorption spectra, influencing catalytic chemistry, especially in reactions involving electron transfer.

2. The historical perspective highlights the potential for doped oxide catalysts to have been utilized long before the concept was explicitly formulated. The presence of impurities and additives in catalysts has led to the enhancement of catalytic performance without explicit recognition, suggesting that doped oxides could have been employed since the inception of catalysis.

1. 氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂通过影响催化活性并增强催化剂的各种性质，对氧化物掺杂催化剂在催化历史中的意外使用做出了贡献。这些元素虽然浓度极低，但可以改变氧化物的电子性质，如导电性和吸附光谱，从而影响催化化学，特别是在涉及电子转移的反应中。

2. 历史视角表明，掺杂氧化物催化剂可能早在概念被明确阐述之前就被使用。催化剂中存在的杂质和添加剂使得催化性能得到提升，而这种现象并未得到明确认识，暗示掺杂氧化物可能自催化诞生之初就已被采用。
