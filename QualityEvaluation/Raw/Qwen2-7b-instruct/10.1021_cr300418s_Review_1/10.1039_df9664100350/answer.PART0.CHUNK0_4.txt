[1] "The research described in this paper was a combined investigation carried out in the Universities of Bristol and Palermo and was supported by a joint award under the N.A.T.O. Research Grants Programme."
[2] "The link between semiconductivity and catalysis is consequently much less direct and currently of limited heuristic value."
[3] "It is possible that the lower figures for coverage on MN 10 and NiO may reflect a greater difficulty in cleaning the surface of chemisorbed oxygen at the start of the experiment : the stronger the chemisorption on an oxide the more likely it is that the process studied (and the coverage estimated) in a chemisorption experiment is one in which the residue of a chemisorbed layer is re-filled."
[4] "The active centres must be capable of chemisorbing atoms of oxygen (as opposed to molecules) and we imagine that they are held as 0- ions."

1. This paper was conducted in collaboration between universities in Bristol and Palermo, funded by the N.A.T.O. Research Grants Programme.
2. The connection between semiconductivity and catalysis is less straightforward and currently offers limited practical guidance.
3. The lower coverage figures for MN 10 and NiO might indicate a challenge in removing chemisorbed oxygen at the beginning of the experiment, suggesting that the process measured in chemisorption experiments is one where a previously adsorbed layer is refilled.
4. The active sites are thought to hold oxygen atoms as 0- ions, rather than molecules, capable of chemisorption.

1. 这项研究是在布里斯托尔和帕尔马的大学之间合作进行的，并由北约研究基金计划联合资助。
2. 半导体与催化之间的联系相对不直接，目前在指导性上价值有限。
3. MN 10 和 NiO 上的较低覆盖度可能反映了在实验开始时去除化学吸附氧的更大困难，这表明在吸附实验中测量的过程可能是先前吸附层被重新填充的情况。
4. 活性中心被认为能够吸附氧原子作为0-离子，而不是分子，具有化学吸附的能力。
