The unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout history was largely due to the intentional introduction of impurities and additives for centuries to enhance catalyst performance. These enhancements were often unrecognized, leading to the development of doped catalysts. This historical insight has provided valuable information on catalytic mechanisms, which has influenced modern catalyst design, highlighting the significance of precise control over impurity incorporation.
