[1] "The comprehensive statistical analysis applied to data from past OCM experiments allowed one to extract information relevant for the design of potential catalytic materials with improved performances."
[2] "Metal oxides and their binary and ternary combinations that are important for high-catalyst performance in the OCM reaction were derived. Mn- and Mo-containing catalysts, which have been more recently described in the open literature as well as in patents, were also identified as promising catalysts."
[3] "A new strategy is proposed that uses synergetic effects in multicomponent materials based on strongly basic oxides (Mg, La) with dopants having positive effects on both C2 selectivity (Cs, Na, Sr, Ba) and catalyst activity (Mn, W, Cl anion)."
[4] "Catalysts with the compositions identified by using data analysis perform close to the target required for an industrially applied OCM process. Further improvement in the performance of the catalysts based on the selected key components is expected by applying an evolutionary catalyst development approach."

1. The statistical analysis of past experimental data on the oxidative methane coupling (OCM) reaction has led to the extraction of crucial information for designing catalytic materials with enhanced performance. This analysis has revealed the importance of metal oxides and their binary and ternary combinations in achieving high performance in the OCM reaction. Promising catalysts containing manganese (Mn) and molybdenum (Mo) have also been identified, both from recent literature and patents.

2. A novel strategy has been proposed that leverages the synergistic effects in multicomponent materials, particularly those featuring strongly basic oxides such as magnesium (Mg) and lanthanum (La), with dopants that positively impact both the selectivity (Cs, Na, Sr, Ba) and activity (Mn, W, Cl anion) of the catalysts.

3. The catalysts developed through this statistical analysis approach perform nearly at the industry-targeted levels for the OCM process. Further enhancements in their performance are anticipated through the implementation of an evolutionary catalyst development strategy.

4. This research not only contributes to the improvement of the OCM catalysis but also provides valuable insights into the fundamental aspects of high-performance catalysts, guiding the advancement of catalyst design methodologies.
