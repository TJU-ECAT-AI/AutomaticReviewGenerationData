[1] "Surprisingly, only a relatively small amount of references that deal with catalyst development were usable for the data assessment procedure."
[2] "In literature, alkaline-earth metals with an alkali dopant, in particular magnesia doped with lithium, have been most frequently studied."
[3] "The LiMgO system (see above), favored quite often in the past, was, however, not identified by the statistical analysis as a promising high-performance material; this is in agreement with the conclusion of an extended review on LiMgO catalysts."

The historical use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as doped lithium magnesium oxide (LiMgO), has often been favored due to its prevalence in literature. However, statistical analysis of past experimental data suggests that the LiMgO system, while commonly studied, is not identified as a promising high-performance material. This conclusion aligns with broader reviews on LiMgO catalysts.

历史上，杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中的使用，尤其是掺杂锂镁氧化物（LiMgO）系统，经常被青睐。然而，对过去实验数据的统计分析表明，LiMgO系统并不是被识别为高性能材料的前景。这一结论与对LiMgO催化剂的广泛审查是一致的。
