[1] "Surprisingly, only a relatively small amount of references that deal with catalyst development were usable for the data assessment procedure."
[2] "In particular, at temperatures from 950 to 1200K typical of the OCM reaction, homogeneous processes mainly control the coupling reaction."
[3] "Therefore, the performance data shown in Figures4 and 5 have been obtained under quite different reaction conditions: temperatures from 600 to 1200K; ratios of p(CH4)/p(O2) from 0.8 to 16; contact times from 0.2 to 18s; the resulting degree of oxygen conversion amounted usually from 80 to 99%, occasionally being significantly lower."
[4] "That is to say, scientists might have been induced in using well-performing catalysts by the guidance of prior published data."
[5] "Elements with positive values (>0.01) of the linear and Spearmans coefficients of correlation for both S(C2) and Y(C2) are Li, Na, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba, La, Nd, Re, Cs, Bi, Mo, Yb, Ga, F, and B."
[6] "The mean values of Y(C2) and S(C2) presented in Figure8-10 were calculated not accounting for the other elements within the catalysts."
[7] "Despite the differences of the reaction conditions and of the various preparation methods as documented in the database, we believe that the simplification of not accounting for these circumstances may be acceptable as a first approximation."

1. Only a small portion of references dealing with catalyst development were applicable for the data assessment process.

2. Homogeneous processes primarily govern the OCM reaction at temperatures from 950 to 1200K.

3. The performance data presented in Figures 4 and 5 were gathered under varied conditions including temperatures from 600 to 1200K, pressure ratios of p(CH4)/p(O2) from 0.8 to 16, contact times from 0.2 to 18s, and oxygen conversion degrees from 80 to 99%.

4. Scientists might have been influenced by previous published data to choose effective catalysts.

5. Elements showing positive linear and Spearmans correlation coefficients for both S(C2) and Y(C2) include Li, Na, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba, La, Nd, Re, Cs, Bi, Mo, Yb, Ga, F, and B.

6. The mean values of Y(C2) and S(C2) in Figures 8-10 were computed without considering the other elements in the catalysts.

7. The simplification of ignoring the reaction conditions and preparation methods documented in the database was deemed acceptable for a preliminary approximation.

1. 只有少量关于催化剂开发的参考文献适用于数据评估过程。

2. 在950至1200K的温度范围内，同质过程主要控制OCM反应。

3. 图表4和5中呈现的性能数据是在温度从600到1200K、p(CH4)/p(O2)压力比从0.8到16、接触时间从0.2到18s以及氧转化度通常在80到99%之间的情况下收集的。

4. 科学家可能受到先前出版数据的指导，选择表现良好的催化剂。

5. 对于同时影响S(C2)和Y(C2)的线性和斯皮尔曼相关系数具有正值（>0.01）的元素包括Li、Na、Ca、Mg、Sr、Ba、La、Nd、Re、Cs、Bi、Mo、Yb、Ga、F和B。

6. 图8-10中展示的Y(C2)和S(C2)的平均值是在没有考虑其他催化剂成分的情况下计算得出的。

7. 考虑到数据库中记录的反应条件和制备方法的不同，我们相信忽略这些情况的简化作为初步近似是可以接受的。
