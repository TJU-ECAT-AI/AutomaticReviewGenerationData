[1] "For example, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts can sometimes contribute to unexpected use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis."
[2] "This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the role of impurities and additives in modern catalyst design."
[3] "The use of doped oxide catalysts has a long history, with many instances where impurities and additives were not intentionally added but were found to enhance catalytic activity."
[4] "This has led to the development of modern catalyst design principles that consider the potential benefits of impurities and additives."
