[1] "An empirical evidence of properties and the relationships between the various variables that describe the catalysts is only an intermediate, that is, secondary objective."
[2] "In multicomponent catalysts, additive, synergistic, or adverse effects may occur. Usually, the design of high-performance catalysts implies finding compositions with synergistic effects, whereby the combination of individual components often results in catalytic performances not obtainable by any of the components independently."

Historically, the use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has unintentionally led to the development of doped oxide catalysts. These impurities, such as dopants, have contributed to the unintentional creation of catalysts with enhanced performance due to their ability to modify the structure and properties of the host oxide. This historical perspective highlights the importance of considering the synergistic effects between different components when designing catalysts. The discovery of these effects often leads to catalytic performances that surpass those achievable with individual components alone, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach in catalyst development.
