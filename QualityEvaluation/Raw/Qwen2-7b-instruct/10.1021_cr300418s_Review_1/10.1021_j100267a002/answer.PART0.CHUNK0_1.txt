(1) "All of the oxides examined were capable of promoting gas-phase allyl radical formation from propylene which, based on C-H bond strengths, contained the yost easily abstracted hydrogen atom of the four hydrocarbons studied."
(2) "Gas-phase radical formation over Li/MgO was also considerably higher."
(3) "The Biz03 and PbO samples apparently contained a significantly larger number of active sites per unit of surface area which were capable of promoting gas-phase organic radical formation from hydrocarbons with C-H bond strengths 1 8 9  kcal mol-'."
(4) "It appears that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are most likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, and not Pb(1V)."

1. All the examined oxides could generate gas-phase allyl radicals from propylene, which contains the most easily abstracted hydrogen atom among the four hydrocarbons studied.
2. The gas-phase radical production over Li/MgO was notably higher.
3. The Biz03 and PbO samples had a significantly larger number of active sites per unit of surface area, enabling the promotion of gas-phase organic radical formation from hydrocarbons with C-H bond strengths up to 189 kcal/mol.
4. The sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on the oxides are most likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, rather than Pb(IV).

1. 所有研究过的氧化物都能够从丙烯生成气相反式丙基自由基，丙烯含有四个碳氢化合物中最容易被抽象的氢原子。
2. 在Li/MgO上的气体自由基生成量显著更高。
3. Biz03和PbO样品每单位表面积具有显著更多的活性位点，能够促进从C-H键强度高达189 kcal/mol的烃类分子形成气相有机自由基。
4. 这些氧化物上负责氢原子抽象的位点最可能是与Pb(I1)离子相关的晶格Os2-离子，而不是Pb(IV)。
