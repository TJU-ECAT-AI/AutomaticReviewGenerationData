(1) "Early work by Hart and Friedli and Dolejsek and Novakova2 employed conventional mass spec- trometry for detection of these species."
(2) "With current advances in instrumentation, a number of new spectroscopic techniques have been developed which allow detection of surface-generated gas- phase radicals."
(3) "EPR matrix isolation is a very sensitive and versatile technique for detecting the formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals."
(4) "Furthermore, the versatility of the technique allows a variety of different catalysts and gas reactants to be examined without modification of the system."
(5) "The results obtained also provide insight into the relative reactivity of surface oxygen ions for hydrogen atom abstraction."

The use of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has historically led to the creation of doped oxide catalysts. These additives and impurities can alter the chemical properties of the catalyst, leading to unexpected behavior and performance. This historical perspective highlights the complexity of catalyst design and the importance of understanding the interactions between the catalyst, reactants, and the surface chemistry. It informs the current understanding of catalytic processes by emphasizing the need for precise control over catalyst composition and the potential for unforeseen outcomes. Modern catalyst design takes these factors into account to optimize performance and predictability.
