(1) "With this system it was possible not only to detect the formation of gas-phase radicals, but also to determine the amounts."
(2) "The formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals during the reactions of methane, ethane, ethylene, and propylene over selected oxide catalysts was examined."
(3) "Previous reports, from this laboratory, have shown that EPR matrix isolation is a very sensitive and versatile technique for detecting the formation of surface-generated gas-phase radicals."
(4) "The results of this study, along with the specific surface areas of the oxides examined and the bond strengths of the most labile hydrogen atom of the hydrocarbons, are presented in Table I."
(5) "Considering this chemistry and the radical amounts observed for the PbO samples, it appears that the sites responsible for hydrogen atom abstraction on these oxides are most likely lattice Os2- ions associated with Pb(I1) ions, and not Pb(1V)."
