[1] "Early work by Hart and Friedli and Dolejsek and Novakova2 employed conventional mass spec- trometry for detection of these species."
[2] "With current advances in instrumentation, a number of new spectroscopic techniques have been developed which allow detection of surface-generated gas- phase radicals."
[3] "These differences in reactivity are attributed to differences in reactivity of the oxide ions on these surfaces toward hydrogen atom abstraction."
[4] "It is likely in these cases that small amounts of gas-phase methyl radicals were produced during surface de- composition of the C2 compounds, and not via the formation of gas-phase C2 radicals from hydrogen atom abstraction, followed by gas-phase decomposition."

The impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have historically led to the unintentional creation of doped oxide catalysts. This phenomenon has significant implications for our understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design. By examining the historical context, we can gain insights into how different impurities affect the reactivity of catalyst surfaces, leading to unexpected chemical behaviors. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and designing new catalysts with desired properties.
