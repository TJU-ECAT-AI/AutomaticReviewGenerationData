Historically, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have often been used unintentionally, leading to the discovery of new catalytic properties. This has contributed to the evolution of catalysis as a field, offering insights into the complex interactions between catalysts and reactants. The historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the role of surface defects and active sites in catalytic processes. This knowledge is crucial for modern catalyst design, enabling researchers to engineer materials with tailored properties for specific applications. By studying the effects of impurities like lithium on the surface reactivity of magnesium oxide nanoparticles, scientists can estimate the number of chemically active sites, which informs the development of more efficient catalysts.
