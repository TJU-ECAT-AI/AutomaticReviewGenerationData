The document discusses the effects of lithium (Li) impurities on magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles, specifically focusing on changes in surface reactivity and properties. The presence of Li ions in MgO leads to the generation of [Li+O] centers, which might serve as active sites for catalytic reactions. Thermal treatment influences the material properties of Li-doped MgO, such as the loss of structural oxygen at elevated temperatures, leading to p-type conductivity. Specific surface area determination is carried out using BET adsorption isotherms at 77 K, and EPR measurements are performed under high-vacuum conditions to identify paramagnetic surface defects.

文档讨论了镁氧化合物（MgO）纳米颗粒中锂（Li）杂质对表面反应性和性质的影响。Li离子在MgO中的存在会导致[Li+O]中心的生成，这可能作为催化反应的活性位点。热处理会影响Li掺杂MgO的材料属性，如在较高温度下促进结构氧的损失，导致p型导电性。特定表面积的确定使用的是77K下的BET吸附等温线，而EPR测量是在高真空条件下进行的，以识别表面磁性缺陷。
