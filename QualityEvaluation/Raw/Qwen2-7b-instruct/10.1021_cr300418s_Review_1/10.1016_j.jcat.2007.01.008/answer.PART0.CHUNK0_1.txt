The introduction of impurities and additives, such as lithium (Li+) ions, in oxide catalysts has led to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. This historical perspective highlights the unpredictable yet significant impact of impurities on the properties and functionality of catalysts. For example, Li+ ions can alter the particle morphology of MgO-based crystallites, leading to a loss of regular morphology and the generation of hole centers that destabilize low-index planes. Moreover, Li+ ions can significantly decrease the thermal stability of the doped polycrystals, which can limit their practical application due to the decrease in chemically active surface area.

In the context of MgO nanoparticles, the thermal stability decreases with the increase in Li+ concentration. Specifically, the specific surface area is maintained up to 673 K, but it drops to 300 m2 g1 between 673 K and 873 K and remains constant thereafter. This demonstrates that Li+ doping affects the surface reactivity and morphology of MgO nanoparticles, potentially altering their catalytic performance.

The introduction of Li+ ions also influences the way hydrogen interacts with the MgO surface. At room temperature, hydrogen splitting proceeds via two different heterolytic pathways on pure MgO, leading to the formation of Mg2+OH and Mg2+H+ species. However, with the presence of Li+, all MgO-specific IR bands disappear, indicating a complete replacement of MgO surface characteristics.

Furthermore, Li+ doping affects the surface-trapped electron centers and adsorbed oxygen species on MgO nanoparticles. On pure MgO, the presence of trapped electron centers leads to the formation of (H+)(e) centers, which are extensively studied as surface probes. However, with the addition of Li+, these signatures are gradually replaced by a broad isotropic signal, indicating the loss of specific surface properties associated with pure MgO.

Lastly, the introduction of Li+ ions facilitates the formation of [Li+O] centers and surface F-centers as active sites, suggesting a potential mechanism for the enhancement or modification of catalytic activity. This historical perspective underscores the importance of considering impurities and additives in the design and optimization of modern catalysts, as they can unexpectedly influence the performance and efficiency of catalysts.

The implications of this historical perspective for current catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design involve a deeper understanding of how impurities and additives can alter the surface properties and reactivity of catalysts. This knowledge enables researchers to predict and control the effects of impurities, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and versatile catalysts tailored for specific applications. By incorporating insights gained from studying the historical use of doped oxide catalysts, modern catalyst design can leverage the unpredictability of impurities to enhance catalytic performance or exploit it for desired outcomes.

杂质和添加剂在氧化催化剂中的引入导致了历史上无意识使用掺杂氧化催化剂的现象。这种历史视角强调了杂质对催化剂性质和功能的不可预测但显著的影响。例如，锂（Li+）离子可以改变镁基结晶体的粒子形态，导致规则形态的丢失，并引发表面孔中心的生成，这会破坏低指数平面的稳定性。此外，Li+离子显著降低了掺杂多晶材料的热稳定性，这限制了它们的实际应用，因为化学活性表面积的减少。

以镁氧纳米颗粒为例，热稳定性随Li+浓度的增加而降低。具体而言，在673 K到873 K之间，特定表面积从300 m2 g1下降至300 m2 g1，此后至少在1173 K之前保持不变。这表明Li+掺杂影响了镁氧纳米颗粒的表面反应性和形态，可能改变了它们的催化性能。

Li+离子也影响了镁氧表面陷阱电子中心和吸附氧物种的性质。在纯镁氧中，存在陷阱电子中心导致形成（H+）（e）中心，这些是广泛研究的表面探针。然而，在添加Li+后，这些特征逐渐被一个广泛的各向同性信号取代，指示与纯镁氧相关的特定表面属性的丧失。

最后，Li+离子促进了[Li+O]中心和表面F中心作为活性位点的形成，这暗示了一种潜在的增强或修改催化活性的机制。这种历史视角强调了考虑杂质和添加剂对于当前催化过程和现代催化剂设计的重要性，因为它们可以意外地影响催化剂的性能和效率。

这一历史视角的含义对于当前的催化过程和现代催化剂设计的发展涉及深入理解杂质和添加剂如何改变催化剂表面性质和反应性的知识。通过借鉴研究历史上掺杂氧化催化剂使用的见解，现代催化剂设计可以利用杂质的不可预测性来提高催化性能或实现预期结果。
