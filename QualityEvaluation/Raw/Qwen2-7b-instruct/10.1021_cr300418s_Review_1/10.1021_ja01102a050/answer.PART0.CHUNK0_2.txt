[1] "The role played by active oxygen in oxidation catalysis has been recently studied by Krauss,2 who was able to show that the formation of nitrous oxide from ammonia-oxygen mixtures is directly dependent on the oxygen content of the solid phase and independent of the type of oxide catalyst used."
[2] "On the basis of these and previous results on a variety of oxidation processes it can be concluded that oxidation catalysis on these oxides does not proceed through alternate reduction-oxidation steps, involving the production of separate phases, but rather by means of the excess oxygen present on the surface, whose steady state concentration during catalysis is dependent on the partial pressure of the oxygen in the gas phase."
[3] "It was therefore of interest in catalytic studies of oxidation reactions to investigate how the excess oxygen of the solid phase affects the overall catalytic process."
[4] "The above interpretation of the experimental data is consistent with the results of Wagner and Hauffe.l2 These authors on the basis of semi-conductivity data concluded that the controlling step for the carbon monoxide oxidation on nickel oxide at 700 is determined by the rate of carbon monoxide interaction with the nickel oxide surface."
[5] "Less clear are the reasons for the reversal of the kinetics in passing from the low to the high temperature interval. Possibly this effect might be associated with different energy levels present in nickel oxide containing excess oxygen."

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have historically led to the unintentional creation of doped oxide catalysts. These dopants can alter the properties of the catalyst, affecting its activity and selectivity. This historical context underscores the importance of understanding the nature of dopants in modern catalyst design. The presence of excess oxygen in the solid phase significantly influences the kinetics of oxidation reactions. The type of oxygen, whether surface-bound or embedded within the material, seems to dictate the activation energy required for catalytic processes. The historical perspective suggests that careful consideration of dopants and their effects on catalyst performance is crucial for optimizing catalytic systems. The reversals in kinetics across different temperature intervals hint at the potential for temperature-dependent changes in the electronic structure of the catalyst, which could be influenced by the doping elements. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient catalysts tailored to specific reaction conditions.
