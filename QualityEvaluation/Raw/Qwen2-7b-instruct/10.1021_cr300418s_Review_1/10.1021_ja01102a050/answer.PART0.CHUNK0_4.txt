[1] "Nickel oxide samples were prepared in the following ways. C.P. nickel nitrate was decomposed for 3 hours at 300, fired in air at 640' for an additional 3 hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature."
[2] "A second sample of nickel oxide was obtained under similar conditions except that decomposition and firing of the nickel nitrate was accomplished in an atmosphere of purified helium."
[3] "Experimental Materials.-Nickel oxide samples were prepared in the following ways. C.P. nickel nitrate was decomposed for 3
hours at 300, fired in air at 640' for an additional 3 hours,then slowly cooled to room temperature. The resulting gray-green oxide was found to liberate iodine from an acid solution of potassium iodide, to have a BET surface area of 2.2 m2g.-l and to show an X-ray pattern of pure nickel oxide."
