[1] "Nickel oxide samples were prepared in the following ways. C.P. nickel nitrate was decomposed for 3 hours at 300, fired in air at 640' for an additional 3 hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature."
[2] "A second sample of nickel oxide was obtained under similar conditions except that decomposition and firing of the nickel nitrate was accomplished in an atmosphere of purified helium."
[3] "On the basis of these and previous results on a variety of oxidation processes it can be concluded that oxidation catalysis on these oxides does not proceed through alternate reduction-oxidation steps, involving the production of separate phases, but rather by means of the excess oxygen present on the surface, whose steady state concentration during catalysis is dependent on the partial pressure of the oxygen in the gas phase."
[4] "It was therefore of interest in catalytic studies of oxidation reactions to investigate how the excess oxygen of the solid phase affects the over-all catalytic process."

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have led to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. The document provides insights into how the concentration of excess oxygen in the solid phase of these catalysts significantly influences the kinetics of oxidation reactions. The historical perspective highlights the importance of considering the specific properties of the catalyst's surface, including the presence of excess oxygen, in understanding and predicting catalytic behavior. This understanding has implications for the design of modern catalysts, emphasizing the need to control and utilize such properties effectively to optimize catalytic performance.
