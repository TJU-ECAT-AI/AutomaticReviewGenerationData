"On the basis of these and previous results on a variety of oxidation processes it can be concluded that oxidation catalysis on these oxides does not proceed through alternate reduction-oxidation steps, involving the production of separate phases, but rather by means of the excess oxygen present on the surface."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Based on these findings and previous studies on various oxidation processes, it can be concluded that the catalytic oxidation of these oxides does not occur through alternating reduction-oxidation cycles, which would involve the creation of distinct phases, but rather through the presence of excess oxygen on the surface.
