[1] "The excess oxygen, which is often referred to as active oxygen,affects a large number of physico-chemical properties of these oxides."
[2] "The role played by active oxygen in oxidation catalysis has been recently studied by Krauss,2 who was able to show that the formation of nitrous oxide from ammonia-oxygen mixtures is directly dependent on the oxygen content of the solid phase and independent of the type of oxide catalyst used."
[3] "It can be concluded that oxidation catalysis on these oxides does not proceed through alternate reduction-oxidation steps, involving the production of separate phases, but rather by means of the excess oxygen present on the surface, whose steady state concentration during catalysis is dependent on the partial pressure of the oxygen in the gas phase."
[4] "The present investigation represents an attempt to apply these considerations in deriving the kinetics of the oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide."
[5] "Several metal oxides are known to contain oxygen in excess of the stoichiometric amount."
[6] "On the basis of these and previous results on a variety of oxidation processes it can be concluded that oxidation catalysis on these oxides does not proceed through alternate reduction-oxidation steps, involving the production of separate phases, but rather by means of the excess oxygen present on the surface, whose steady state concentration during catalysis is dependent on the partial pressure of the oxygen in the gas phase."
[7] "Supporting evidence for the validity of these deductions may be found in the effect of additions of foreign ions to nickel oxide on the activation energy of the oxidation reaction."
[8] "It is therefore of interest in catalytic studies of oxidation reactions to investigate how the excess oxygen of the solid phase affects the overall catalytic process."
[9] "Therefore, it may be concluded that equation (4) represents the determining step for the high temperature interval, while equation (5) that for the low temperature range."
[10] "It can be seen that equations (9) and (10) agree well with equations (2) and (3) derived from experimental data, with β ≈ 0.50."

The impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, particularly the excess oxygen within them, have historically influenced the creation of doped oxide catalysts. This historical context underscores the significance of the composition of catalysts in determining their catalytic efficiency and behavior. Understanding how these impurities impact catalytic processes can inform the design of more effective catalysts. For instance, the presence of excess oxygen affects the kinetics of oxidation reactions, influencing whether the process follows a first-order or a more complex reaction mechanism. The steady-state concentration of this excess oxygen depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen in the gas phase, indicating that the composition of the catalyst can significantly influence the catalytic process. The study of how impurities like excess oxygen affect catalysis can guide the development of modern catalyst design, ensuring that catalysts are optimized for specific reactions and conditions.
