1. "The activation energy for the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction on nickel oxide is not affected at low temperature (100- 180') by the addition of foreign ions to the nickel oxide lattice."
2. "At higher temperatures, however, the activation energy of the catalytic reaction is dependent upon the type of addition."
3. "This effect is related to the kinetic mechanism of the reaction and to the changes in electronic properties of nickel oxide brought about by the introduction in its lattice of foreign ions."
4. "The addition of foreign ions into the nickel oxide lattice might modify the concentration and distribution of holes and electrons by suitable changes of the Fermi level of the semiconductor."
5. "Further, the work of Hadow and Hinshelwood5 shows that water has no effect on the rate of the slow oxidation of cyanogen (apparently a surface reaction)."

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as foreign ions in nickel oxide, have significantly influenced the activation energy and kinetic mechanisms of catalytic reactions. These additives can alter the electronic properties of the catalyst, affecting the distribution of charge carriers like holes and electrons within the material. This modification can lead to changes in the catalytic activity at different temperatures. For instance, the presence of foreign ions in nickel oxide lattice can impact the rate of carbon monoxide oxidation, particularly at higher temperatures. This finding supports the hypothesis that the interaction between catalyst surfaces and reactants plays a crucial role in catalytic processes. Moreover, the study highlights the potential for controlling activation energies in heterogeneous processes through the strategic introduction of additives, offering a novel approach to fine-tuning catalyst performance.

In the context of water's effect on the burning velocity of cyanogen-oxygen-argon mixtures, the presence of water does not significantly affect the rate of slow oxidation of cyanogen, suggesting that surface reactions might dominate over bulk reactions in this scenario. The absence of water's impact aligns with the Tanford-Pease theory of flame speed, emphasizing the importance of hydroxyl radicals over hydrogen atoms in determining flame propagation rates. This research underscores the complexity of flame dynamics and the intricate interplay between fuel composition, reactant properties, and environmental factors in determining combustion kinetics.

氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂，如镍氧化物中的外加离子，显著影响催化反应的活化能和动力学机制。这些添加剂可以改变催化剂的电子性质，影响材料内部载流子（如空穴和电子）的浓度和分布。这种修改可以导致不同温度下的催化活性变化。例如，在镍氧化物晶格中加入外加离子可能会影响一氧化碳氧化的速率，特别是在较高温度下。这一发现支持催化剂表面与反应物相互作用在催化过程中起关键作用的假设。此外，研究表明通过有选择地引入添加剂来控制激活能为异相过程提供了一种新的方法，这有助于提高催化剂性能。

在水对氰化氢-氧气-氩气混合物燃烧速度的影响研究中，水的存在并未显著影响氰化氢的慢氧化率，这表明表面反应可能在这一情境中占主导地位，而不仅仅是整体反应。水不存在的影响与Tanford-Pease火焰速度理论一致，强调了羟基自由基而非氢原子在确定火焰传播速率中的重要性。这项研究突出了火焰动力学的复杂性和燃料组成、反应物性质以及环境因素之间在决定燃烧热力学时的相互作用。
