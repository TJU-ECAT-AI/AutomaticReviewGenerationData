[1] "Nickel oxide samples, containing foreign ions, were prepared under strictly controlled conditions, as previously described."
[2] "In the course of the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide and cuprous oxide surfaces electron transfer processes occur between the gas and the solid phase."
[3] "The data reported show that the kinetic equations which were found to describe the reaction on"
[4] "This can be related to the experimentally observed effect of additions on the activation energy of heterogeneous processes involving formation and/or destruction of acceptor and donor levels in semiconductors."
[5] "Since in that case it was concluded that the ov-er-all process is determined by hydrogen chemisorption and since it is known from semi-conductivity that on p-type oxides carbon monoxide behaves essentially as an electron donor, it is possible to conclude from the effect o f impurities on the activation energy of the oxidation reaction that the interaction of carbon monoxide with the oxide surface is the controlling step in the high temperature interval of the reaction."

The presence of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has inadvertently led to the development and use of doped oxide catalysts throughout history. These additives, such as foreign ions in nickel oxide, can modify the electronic properties of the catalyst, affecting its kinetic mechanisms and activation energies. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between the electronic structure of surfaces and their catalytic activity. By studying how impurities impact activation energies, researchers can gain insights into the catalytic processes and potentially control the activation energies of heterogeneous reactions on semiconductor materials, contributing to advancements in modern catalyst design.
