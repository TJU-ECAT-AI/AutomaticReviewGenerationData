[1] "The activation energy for the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction on nickel oxide is not affected at low temperature (100- 180') by the addition of foreign ions to the nickel oxide lattice."
[2] "At higher temperatures, however, the activation energy o f 
the catalytic reaction is dependent upon the type o f addition."
[3] "This effect is related to the kinetic mechanism of the reaction and to the changes in electronic properties of nickel oxide brought about by the introduction in its lattice of foreign ions."
[4] "The addition o f foreign ions into the nickel oxide lattice might modify the concentration and distribution of holes and electrons by suitable changes o f the Fermi level of the semi-conductor."
[5] "Further- more, the work of Hadow and Hinshelwood5 shows that water has no effect on the rate of the slow oxidation of cyanogen (apparently a surface re- action)."

1. Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as foreign ions in nickel oxide, can significantly influence the activation energy of catalytic reactions, especially at higher temperatures. This impact is linked to both the kinetic mechanism of the reaction and the alteration of the electronic properties of the catalyst due to the introduction of these additives. This historical insight underscores the importance of understanding the electronic structure of surfaces in relation to their catalytic activity.

2. The addition of foreign ions to the lattice of oxide catalysts can modify the concentration and distribution of holes and electrons by changing the Fermi level of the semiconductor. This modification can have significant implications for the performance and efficiency of catalytic processes, particularly in terms of activation energy.

3. The historical perspective reveals that the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts has led to valuable discoveries and advancements in catalysis. The understanding gained from studying the effects of impurities on catalysts has informed the development of modern catalyst design, emphasizing the importance of controlling electronic properties to optimize catalytic activity.

4. The work of Hadow and Hinshelwood demonstrates that water has no effect on the slow oxidation of cyanogen, suggesting that the rate of such reactions is primarily determined by surface interactions rather than the presence of water molecules. This finding highlights the complexity of surface chemistry and its role in controlling reaction kinetics.

1. 在较低温度下（100-180°C），外加离子对镍氧化物上的二氧化碳氧化反应的活化能没有影响。然而，在较高温度下，催化反应的活化能依赖于添加的类型。这种效应与反应的热力学机制和由于将外加离子引入其晶格中而引起镍氧化物电子性质的变化有关。这一历史视角表明，理解表面的电子结构对于确定其催化活性的重要性。

2. 将外加离子添加到氧化物催化剂的晶格中可能会通过适当地改变半导体的费米能级来修改空穴和电子的浓度和分布。这种修改可能对催化剂的性能和效率产生重大影响，尤其是在活化能方面。

3. 历史视角揭示了无意中使用掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用导致了催化研究中的有价值发现和进展。从研究杂质对催化剂的影响中获得的知识已经指导了现代催化剂设计的发展，强调了控制电子性质以优化催化活性的重要性。

4. Hadow 和 Hinshelwood 的工作表明水不会影响氰化氢的缓慢氧化速率，这表明此类反应的主要决定因素是表面相互作用而不是水分子的存在。这一发现突出了表面化学的复杂性及其在控制反应动力学中的作用。
