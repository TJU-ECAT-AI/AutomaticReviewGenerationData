The presence of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as foreign ions in nickel oxide, can significantly influence the activation energy of catalytic reactions. This impact varies depending on the temperature, with activation energies being less affected at lower temperatures. However, at higher temperatures, the type of additive becomes crucial, affecting both the kinetic mechanism of the reaction and the electronic properties of the oxide lattice. This demonstrates that the choice of additives can dramatically alter the catalytic performance of oxide-based catalysts, leading to the unintentional discovery and use of doped oxide catalysts throughout history. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the detailed interactions between additives, electronic properties, and reaction kinetics in modern catalyst design.

在氧化物催化剂中，如镍氧化物中的外加离子，杂质和添加剂对催化反应的活化能有显著影响。这种影响随着温度变化而变化，在较低温度下，添加的外加离子对活化能的影响较小。然而，在较高温度下，添加剂的类型至关重要，既影响反应的热力学机制，也影响氧化物晶格中引入的外加离子的电子性质。这表明选择添加剂可以极大地改变氧化物基催化剂的催化性能，导致历史上意外发现并使用掺杂氧化物催化剂。这一历史视角强调了在现代催化剂设计中理解添加剂、电子性质和反应动力学之间详细相互作用的重要性。
