The activation energy for the carbon monoxide oxidation reaction on nickel oxide is not affected at low temperature (100- 180') by the addition of foreign ions to the nickel oxide lattice. At higher temperatures, however, the activation energy o f
the catalytic reaction is dependent upon the type o f addition. This effect is related to the kinetic mechanism of the reaction and to the changes in electronic properties of nickel oxide brought about by the introduction in its lattice of foreign ions.
Present knowledge on the typical behavior o f
electron transfer processes involved in chemical reactions catalyzed by oxide semiconductors have been mainly obtained through the pioneering studies of Wagner and Hauffe' and Garner and associates2 These authors showed that in the course of the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide and cuprous oxide surfaces electron transfer processes occur between the gas and the solid phase, as evidenced by measurements of the semi-conductivity of the solid phase during the reaction. Thus it became apparent that the de- fective structure of the catalytic surface, which controls its semi-conductivity, would affect the chemical reaction occurring on it. A study on the relation between the defective structure o f the sur- face and its catalytic activity can therefore be in- strumental in deciding how far a correlation be- tween electronic structure of surfaces and their activity to catalyze chemical changes can be established. The present communication refers to the oxidation of carbon monoxide on nickel oxide samples, whose electronic characteristics have been modified following the method of controlled valency semi-conductors, recently developed by Yerwey and associates.3 Experimental Nickel oxide samples, containing foreign ions, were pre- pared under strictly controlled conditions, as previously decribed.The purification of gases and the apparatus

for the sample NiO + 1 mole % AgzO an over-all activation energy of 3.0 and 17 kcal./mole for the low and the high temperature interval, res- pectively.
In order to obtain a rapid determina- tion of the activation energies non-isothermal runs were performed by submitting the catalyst to a heating rate, which was linearly increasing with time and correcting the data for the thermal expansion of the gases. I f
T = TO
+ yt, where T = temperature, t = time, y = constant and - dp/dt = kp is the rate law, then For sufficiently small temperature intervals it is possible to approximate - dp/dt E -Api/ATi,being successive pressure readings at temperatures Ti-1 and Ti, respectively.
Equation (1) then becomes -dP/dT = (k/r)P (1) where APi = p i  - Pi-1, ATi = T i  - Ti-1, pi, pi-1 Api/PiATi 7 k '
e-E/RT A plot of log ( A p i / A T )  VS. 1/T should give a straight line, whose slope is proportional to the activation energy E. In order to test the correctness of this method a comparison was made among E values obtained from isothermal and non-isothermal runs. The data are summarized in Table I.

Different heating speeds were tried on the same sample and the values of E obtained did not differ appreciably. The non-isothermal method how- ever suffers from the disadvantage that the experi- mental error in pi is built up through the deter- mination of Api. Therefore when rate data for the calculation of the pre-exponential factor are needed,they are best obtained through isothermal runs.
All the data obtained on nickel oxide samples con- taining foreign ions are collected in Figs. 4 and 5 and in Table 11.

VOl. 75 A similar effect was already found in the reduc- tion of nickel oxide with hydrogen.? Since in that case it was concluded that the ov-er-all process is determined by hydrogen chemisorption and since it is known from semi-conductivity that on p-type oxides carbon monoxide behaves essentially as an electron donor, it is possible to conclude from the effect o f impurities on the activation energy of the oxidation reaction that the interaction of carbon monoxide with the oxide surface is the controlling step in the high temperature interval of the reaction. -4 similar conclusion was previously reached on kinetic  ground. This agreement is regarded as supporting evidence for the kinetic scheme pro- posed. The addition o f foreign ions into the nickel oxide lattice might modify the concentration and distribution of holes and electrons by suitable changes o f the Fermi level of the semi-conductor.
This can be related to the experimentally observed effect of additions on the activation energy of heterogeneous processes involving formation and/or destruction of acceptor and donor levels in semi- conductors. Although the effect has been ob- served so far on the over-all activation energy, it may lead, if substantiated by further experimental work, to a method for controlling, at least quali- tatively, the activation energies of heterogeneous processes occurring on semi-conducting materials.

The Effect of Water on the Burning Velocities of Cyanogen-Oxygen-Argon Mixtures1

3, 1952 Burning velocities have been determined for cyanogen-oxygen-argon mixtures containing varying amounts of moisture.
Experiments with heavy water The effect of water is explainable on the basis of the Tanford-Pease theory of flame speeds. suggest that the hydroxyl radical is more important than the hydrogen atom in determining the rate of flame propagation.
Tanford and Pease? have put forward a theory of burning velocity which assumes that the rate of flame propagation is determined by the rate at which atoms and radicals from the burned gas diffuse into and react with the unburned fuel.
In particular they applied their theory to the measurements of Jahn3 on moist carbon monoxide.
In these calculations hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals were the active species considered. Hoare and Linnett4 have pointed out that it is possible to explain the effect of water or hydrogen on carbon monoxide flame velocities by a thermal theory of flame propagation.
In view o f the above, it was felt that it would be desirable to determine the effect of added water on the burning velocity of another hydrogen-free fuel.
Cyanogen was selected for these studies, since it is easily prepared, and as it is composed of carbon and nitrogen alone, equilibrium flame temperature calculations are not unduly complicated. Further- more, the work of Hadow and Hinshelwood5 shows that water has no effect on the rate of the slow oxidation of cyanogen (apparently a surface re- action).

Experimental Flame velocities have been determined on a bunsen burner apparatus. Capillary flow meters were used to measure the rates of oxygen and argon flow.
In order to conserve cyanogen, this gas was added to the gas stream by mercury displacement from a cylindrical reservoir flask of about 300-cc. capacity. A hydraulic cylinder was used to raise a cylindrical leveling bulb a t  a uniform rate, controlled by a . needle valve on the water line. The travel of the hydraulic cylinder also closed and opened a switch on a Gralab Model So. 201 microtimer which measured the time required to displace a standard volume of gas, and thereby the cyanogen flow rate.
The flames were ignited by means of an induction spark and were stabilized on a 0.806 cm. i.d. Pyrex burner en- closed in a 4-cm. mantle. A flow of dry nitrogen approxi- mately equal to the flow rate through the burner was intro- duced into the annular space. This helped to sweep out combustion products and aided in stabilizing the flame.
Photographs were taken with a Leica camera equipped with a 5-cm. extension tube. The flames are highly luminous so that exposures as fast as l/500 second a t f25 on Kodak plus-
S
film were in some instances used. Burning velocities were determined by considering the flow through a frus- tum of the cone between the diameters of 0.2 to 0.7 cm.
This method, proposed by Dery,6 eliminates the disturbed areas at the base and tip of the cone. Frustum areas were obtained from enlarged tracings of the flame photographs.
Cyanogen was prepared by thermal decomposition of mer- curic cyanide which was first mildly heated in vacuo to drive oft any moisture which might be present.
The cyanogen was passed over magnesium perchlorate and frozen out by liquid nitrogen.
It was stored in 3- and 5-liter glass flasks,a t i d  could he introduced into the cylindrical reservoir flask I)>- means of :
