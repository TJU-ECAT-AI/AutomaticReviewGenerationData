[1] "The known literature about the morphological aspects of OCM catalysts,among them Li/MgO, is summarized in detail in a book chapter of Martin and Mirodatos (62)."

[2] "However, the Li was found to be instable in the Li/MgO catalyst. The publications on the optimal Li-loading report very different amounts."

[3] "The strong dependence of the presence of the different surface species on preparation and operation conditions results in a complex picture of the mechanism of OCM and the difficulty to derive clear structure-reactivity relation."

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, like Li/MgO, have historically contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts by influencing their morphology, stability, and reactivity. This complexity in the structure-reactivity relationship poses challenges in understanding catalytic processes and designing modern catalysts. The instability of Li in Li/MgO catalysts, for example, affects their optimal loading and performance. The strong dependence of surface species on preparation and operational conditions further complicates the relationship between catalyst structure and activity, necessitating detailed characterization and careful control in catalyst design.

氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂，如Li/MgO，历史上无意中促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的使用，通过影响其形态、稳定性和活性。这种结构-反应性关系的复杂性给理解催化过程和设计现代催化剂带来了挑战。例如，Li在Li/MgO催化剂中的不稳定性影响了其最佳负载和性能。表面物种对制备和操作条件的强烈依赖性进一步复杂化了催化剂结构与活性之间的关系，这需要详细的表征和精确控制在催化剂设计中。
