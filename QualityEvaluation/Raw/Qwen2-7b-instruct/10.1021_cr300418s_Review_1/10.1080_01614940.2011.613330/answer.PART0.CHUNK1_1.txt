[1] "In an earlier study, Bi et al. investigated the OCM reaction over a series of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides, prepared by an impregnation method. SiO2, Al2O3, and several different MgO materials were used as support material. MgO was found to be the most promising support and Li/Ce/MgO to be the most promising catalyst."
[2] "Korf et al. observed the effect of additives, various oxides of transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides, on Li/MgO in the oxidative coupling of methane."

How have impurities and additives in oxide catalysts contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis, and what implications does this historical perspective have for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design?

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have historically contributed to the development of doped oxide catalysts by enhancing their performance and selectivity in various catalytic processes. This has been observed in the use of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides as dopants for Li/MgO catalysts. The introduction of these impurities and additives has led to the discovery of catalysts with improved activity and selectivity, such as Li/Ce/MgO. This historical perspective highlights the importance of considering the synergistic effects of different elements in catalyst design. Modern catalyst development benefits from this knowledge by incorporating a broader range of materials and understanding the role of dopants in enhancing catalytic properties. This approach allows for the creation of catalysts with tailored performance characteristics for specific applications.
