[1] "Li/MgO has been treated with different dopants; a general overview is shown in Table 3. The main idea of doping Li/MgO was to prevent the loss of Li, either by modification of the solid phase or by change the reaction conditions towards milder conditions."
[2] "In an earlier study, Bi et al. investigated the OCM reaction over a series of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides, prepared by an impregnation method. SiO2, Al2O3, and several different MgO materials were used as support material. MgO was found to be the most promising support and Li/Ce/MgO to be the most promising catalyst."
[3] "Korf et al. observed the effect of additives, various oxides of transition metal oxides and rare earth oxides, on Li/MgO in the oxidative coupling of methane."

1. The main purpose of doping Li/MgO catalysts is to prevent the loss of Li, either by modifying the solid phase or adjusting the reaction conditions to milder ones. 
2. Bi et al.'s study demonstrated that among alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides used as supports, MgO showed the greatest potential, with Li/Ce/MgO being the most effective catalyst for the oxidative coupling of methane.
3. Korf et al. explored the impact of adding various transition metal and rare earth oxide additives to Li/MgO catalysts in the process of methane oxidative coupling.

1. 添加Li/MgO催化剂的主要目的是防止锂的流失，要么通过改变固体相，要么通过调整反应条件到较温和的状态。
2. Bi等人对碱金属、碱土金属和稀土金属氧化物进行了研究，这些作为支持材料，通过浸渍法制备。发现MgO是最佳的支持材料，而Li/Ce/MgO是氧化甲烷最有效的催化剂。
3. Korf等人研究了在Li/MgO催化剂中添加各种过渡金属和稀土氧化物添加剂对甲烷氧化耦合的影响。
