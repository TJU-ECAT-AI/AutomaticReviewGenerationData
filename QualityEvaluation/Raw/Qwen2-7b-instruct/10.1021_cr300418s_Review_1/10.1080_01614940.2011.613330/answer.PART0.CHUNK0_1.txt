[1] "In the past, the research strategy was often characterized by random testing of catalysts with a focus on maximization of the C2 yield."
[2] "However, from a thermodynamic point of view, the partial oxidation (Reaction 2) and the total oxidation (Reaction 3) are thermodynamically much more favored than the oxidative coupling of methane."
[3] "The group of Dreiss applied a single source precursors approach. They prepared magnesium alkoxide clusters, which were thermally decomposed. The substitution of a Mg atom for a Li atom in one corner of the cubane, led to the formation of Li/MgO."
[4] "The addition of SiO2 to Li/MgO via hydrothermal treatment led to basic magnesium hydrosilicates. If the added amount of silica was not too large, the catalyst became more active and selective towards C2H4, however, the overall C2+ selectivity remained unchanged."

The historical perspective of using doped oxide catalysts, such as Li/MgO, has been marked by a focus on maximizing the yield of specific products. This approach often led to the unintentional use of these catalysts due to the optimization of certain chemical pathways over others. Thermodynamically, partial oxidation and total oxidation are more favorable than the oxidative coupling of methane, influencing the choice of catalysts in research and industrial applications.

The introduction of a single source precursor approach by the Dreiss group involved the preparation of magnesium alkoxide clusters, which were then thermally decomposed. This method allowed for the substitution of a magnesium atom with a lithium atom, leading to the formation of Li/MgO catalysts. The addition of silica to Li/MgO via hydrothermal treatment resulted in a catalyst with improved activity and selectivity towards the formation of C2H4, while maintaining the overall selectivity for higher hydrocarbons.

过去，催化剂的研究策略通常集中在最大化C2产量上，这导致了对这些催化剂的无意使用。从热力学角度看，部分氧化和完全氧化比甲烷的氧化耦合更为有利，影响了研究和工业应用中催化剂的选择。

德里斯小组引入了一种单一源前体方法，通过制备镁醇盐簇，并在高温下分解，这种方法允许镁原子被锂原子替换，从而形成Li/MgO催化剂。向Li/MgO中添加硅酸盐通过水热处理方式，导致生成了具有改善活性和C2H4选择性的催化剂，同时保持了更高烃类产物的总选择性。
