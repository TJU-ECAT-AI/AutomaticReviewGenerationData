[1] "In an earlier study, Bi et al. investigated the OCM reaction over a series of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metal oxides, prepared by an impregnation method. SiO2, Al2O3, and several different MgO materials were used as support material. MgO was found to be the most promising support and Li/Ce/MgO to be the most promising catalyst."
