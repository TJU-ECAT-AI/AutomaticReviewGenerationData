[1] "Formation of [Li+O)] type defect sites is energetically demanding and requires high temperature (> 850 C) treatments."
[2] "To improve efficiency of the catalyst, enhancing the surface defect site concentration is essential."
[3] "Formation of 4 and 3 coordinated Mg2+ sites when lithium is present in the MgO matrix indicates the possibility of the formation of lithium based defect sites in the catalysts even under the mild conditions required for the solgel synthesis."
[4] "The solgel synthesis thus allows for the incorporation of Li into the MgO lattice at mild conditions, results in materials with enhanced surface areas and defect site concentrations."
[5] "Li/MgO catalysts have promise as oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts for making olefins from propane, because consecutive deep oxidation is by far less prominent as compared to conventional redox catalysts."

The presence of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts has historically led to the unintentional creation of doped oxide catalysts. This has resulted in the discovery of new catalytic properties and functionalities. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the role of dopants and impurities in catalyst design. Modern catalyst design benefits from this knowledge by incorporating dopants strategically to enhance specific catalytic activities. The solgel synthesis method provides a pathway for the incorporation of lithium into magnesium oxide at mild conditions, leading to the formation of materials with high surface areas and defect site concentrations, which are beneficial for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce olefins.
