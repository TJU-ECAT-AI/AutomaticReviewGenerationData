[1] "During the solgel process mainly two reactions take place i.e., hydrolysis and condensation."
[2] "When Li is present the extent of hydrolysis/condensation is altered quite drastically."
[3] "Thus in the presence of Li, composition of the gel is changed."
[4] "It is interesting to note that the catalysts give high olefin (ethene + propene) selectivities."
[5] "Presence of ethene also suggests that some cracking (CC bond rupture) occurs."
[6] "Unlike redox based catalysts (figure 1) selectivity to olefins does not decrease with increasing propane conversion."

The presence of lithium in the solgel process significantly alters the extent of hydrolysis and condensation, changing the composition of the gel. This results in high olefin selectivities and suggests some cracking of the alkane molecules. Moreover, lithium doped catalysts maintain high olefin selectivity even as the propane conversion increases, unlike redox-based catalysts.

在溶胶过程中的锂的存在显著改变了水解和缩合的程度，改变了凝胶的组成。这导致高烯烃选择性，并暗示烷烃分子的一些裂解。此外，含锂催化剂即使丙烷转化率增加也能保持高烯烃选择性，与基于还原性的催化剂不同。
