The historical development of catalysts has shown that impurities and additives in oxide catalysts can lead to the unintentional creation of doped oxide catalysts. This has provided valuable insights into catalytic processes and has influenced the design of modern catalysts. By studying the unexpected properties of historical catalysts, researchers have gained a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in catalysis. This knowledge has been instrumental in developing more effective and selective catalysts for industrial applications.
