[1] "Formation of 4 and 3 coordinated Mg2+ sites when lithium is present in the MgO matrix indicates the possibility of the formation of lithium based defect sites in the catalysts even under the mild conditions required for the solgel synthesis."
[2] "The disadvantage of this is that this mobility of the Li species facilitates sintering of MgO (alkali salts are known to facilitate sintering [8]) and subsequent loss of surface area (Table 2)."

Impurities and additives, such as lithium, have contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. These additives can alter the properties of the catalysts, leading to the formation of defect sites. The historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding how these additives affect the catalytic processes. Modern catalyst design aims to harness these effects intentionally, optimizing the properties of the catalysts for specific applications. The implications of this historical understanding are that careful selection and control of additives are crucial in modern catalyst development.
