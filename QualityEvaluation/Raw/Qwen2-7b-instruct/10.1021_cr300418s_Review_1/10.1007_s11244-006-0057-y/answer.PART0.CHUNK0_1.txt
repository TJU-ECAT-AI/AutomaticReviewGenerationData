<p>During the solgel process mainly two reactions take place i.e., hydrolysis and condensation.</p>
<p>When Li is present the extent of hydrolysis/condensation is altered quite drastically.</p>
<p>In the case of 5 wt% Li sample about 70% of Li added was shown to be present as free LiNO3 molecules (TG results).</p>
<p>No other free Li phases were observed (XRD, figure 7).</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this is that this mobility of the Li species facilitates sintering of MgO (alkali salts are known to facilitate sintering).</p>
<p>Preparation of Li/MgO catalysts by conventional methods (impregnation of bulk MgO with Li salts followed by calcination) leads to the formation of mixture of phases of Li2CO3 and MgO.</p>
<p>Formation of oxygen vacancies and low coordinated sites can be followed by infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption on Mg2+ Lewis acid sites.</p>
<p>In this way as compared to conventional preparation method temperature necessary in the preparation of Li/MgO catalysts can be limited and significant higher surface area can be obtained.</p>

The presence of impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, particularly lithium in this context, has led to the unintentional creation of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis. This is evident in the solgel synthesis of Li/MgO oxide clusters, where lithium can be incorporated into the magnesia gel during preparation, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancies and low coordinated sites. This process allows for the creation of catalysts with enhanced surface areas and defect site concentrations, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance. The historical perspective underscores the importance of understanding the effects of impurities and additives on catalyst behavior and the potential for developing catalysts with optimized properties through controlled synthesis methods.

在整个催化历史中，氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂无意中导致了掺杂氧化物催化剂的产生。在Li/MgO氧化物簇的溶胶合成过程中，锂可以在制备过程中被纳入镁胶中，从而形成氧空位和低配位点。这一过程允许通过控制合成方法来制造具有增强表面面积和缺陷位点浓度的催化剂，可能提高催化性能。从历史上看，了解杂质和添加剂对催化剂行为的影响以及通过控制合成方法开发具有优化性质的催化剂的重要性变得至关重要。
