[1] "The use of doped defective oxides gives rise to surface-redox chemistry in the case of partial oxidation of methane over yttrium-modified zirconia, where actual removal of oxygen from the surface sites indeed takes place."
[2] "In contrast, Li-modified MgO catalyst does not allow removal of oxygen; O sites generated by Li are now able to abstract a H-radical from, e.g., propane."
[3] "The remarkable selectivity obtained in propane oxygenation on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Y at unusually low temperatures is due to the confinement of radicals in the cages of the zeolite, turning radical chemistry into stoichiometric chemistry."
[4] "The second significant effect is the very effective stabilization of the resulting oxygenate, acetone, in the cage. However, the stabilization thus also implies extremely strong adsorption of the acetone, thus preventing desorption of the product."
[5] "Our work indicates that desorption can be assisted by offering water as a competitive adsorbing species, thus opening the possibility to close the catalytic cycle."

Historically, the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts in catalysis has often been a result of impurities and additives that unexpectedly enhance the catalytic activity. This historical perspective highlights the complexity of catalyst behavior and underscores the importance of understanding the precise roles of various components within catalyst systems. It suggests that careful consideration of impurities and additives is crucial for the development of modern catalyst design, as they can significantly impact catalytic performance and selectivity. By studying the effects of impurities and additives, researchers can gain insights into how to optimize catalysts for specific applications, potentially leading to more efficient and selective catalytic processes.
