1. The stability of the catalyst can be further enhanced in the absence of chlorine, which is not essential for achieving high olefin yields during propane processing.

2. The presence of oxygen enables the regeneration of the [Li+OH] sites without removing the oxygen from the active site, which is typical for conventional redox catalysts.

3. Methane demonstrates a more effective activation than hydrogen on the catalyst surface.

4. The rate of isopropylhydroperoxide (IHP) formation and its decomposition into acetone increase with an increase in the number of Bro nsted acid sites.

5. Acetone predominantly desorbs at temperatures higher than 250°C under dry conditions, with only a small amount observed around 120°C. Adding water facilitates acetone desorption at room temperature.

1. 在没有氯的情况下，催化剂的稳定性可以进一步提高，这不会影响高烯烃产率的获得。

2. 氧气的存在允许在不移除活性位点上的氧的情况下再生[Li+OH]位点，这是常规氧化还原催化剂的典型特征。

3. 甲烷在催化剂表面的激活效果比氢气更有效。

4. IHP形成速率和其分解成乙酮的速度随Bro nsted酸性位点数量的增加而增加。

5. 在干燥条件下，乙酮主要在高于250°C的温度下脱附，而在120°C左右仅观察到少量。添加水可以在室温下促进乙酮的脱附。
