[1] "The use of doped defective oxides gives rise to surface-redox chemistry in the case of partial oxidation of methane over yttrium-modified zirconia, where actual removal of oxygen from the surface sites indeed takes place."
[2] "In contrast, Li-modified MgO catalyst does not allow removal of oxygen; O sites generated by Li are now able to abstract a H-radical from, e.g., propane."
[3] "The remarkable selectivity obtained in propane oxygenation on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Y at unusually low temperatures is due to the confinement of radicals in the cages of the zeolite, turning radical chemistry into stoichiometric chemistry."
[4] "However, the stabilization thus also implies extremely strong adsorption of the acetone, thus preventing desorption of the product. Our work indicates that desorption can be assisted by offering water as a competitive adsorbing species, thus opening the possibility to close the catalytic cycle."

Historically, impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have been utilized inadvertently to create doped oxide catalysts. This has contributed to the development of various catalytic processes. For instance, in the case of partial oxidation of methane over yttrium-modified zirconia, the actual removal of oxygen from the surface sites has occurred due to the presence of dopants. Similarly, lithium in magnesium oxide catalysts has allowed the abstraction of hydrogen radicals, enhancing the selectivity of the catalytic process. The confinement of radicals in cages of zeolites, as seen in propane oxygenation on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Y, has also played a crucial role in achieving remarkable selectivity at low temperatures. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between catalyst components and their impact on catalytic performance. Offering water as a competitive adsorbing species to facilitate the desorption of products from zeolites is a modern approach that demonstrates the evolving strategies in catalyst design to optimize catalytic cycles.

历史上，氧化物催化剂中的杂质和添加剂意外地被用来制造掺杂氧化物催化剂。这促进了各种催化过程的发展。例如，在以钇改性的锆酸盐上进行甲烷的部分氧化时，表面位点实际上确实进行了氧的去除，这是由于掺杂剂的存在。同样，在镁氧化物催化剂中使用锂允许从丙烷中抽象氢自由基，提高了催化过程的选择性。在以碱土金属改性的沸石中，丙烷的限制在低温度下实现了显著的选择性，这表明复杂的催化剂组件之间的相互作用对催化性能的重要性。提供水作为竞争吸附物种来促进从沸石中产品的脱附是现代催化剂设计优化催化循环的一种策略。
