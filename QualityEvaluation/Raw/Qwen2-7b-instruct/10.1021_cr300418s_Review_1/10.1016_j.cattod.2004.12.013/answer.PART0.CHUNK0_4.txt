1. The presence of chlorine is not essential for high olefin yields in LiMgO catalysts. Without chlorine, the stability of the catalyst is improved, and high olefin selectivity is maintained even at high conversions, with minimal secondary conversion of olefins to COx.

2. Catalysts containing trace amounts of earth alkali oxides showed a collapse in activity after a specific sintering treatment.

3. The catalytic cycle for propane oxygenation on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Y has not been fully closed because the oxygenates formed are strongly adsorbed in the zeolite.

4. Acetone primarily desorbs at higher temperatures under dry conditions, with only a small amount observed around 120°C. Adding water facilitates acetone desorption at room temperature, shifting the desorption peaks to lower temperatures and increasing their intensities.

5. Alkaline earth cations in zeolite cages demonstrate oxidation catalysis over non-redox materials, showing remarkable selectivity in selective oxidation reactions.

6. The use of unconventional catalysts in selective oxidation reactions leads to remarkable selectivity, with diverse mechanistic reasons underlying their effectiveness.

1. 在LiMgO催化剂中，氯的存在对于高烯烃产率不是必要的。在没有氯的情况下，催化剂的稳定性进一步提高，即使在高转化率下，仍能保持高烯烃选择性，并且形成的烯烃极少转化为COx。

2. 含有少量地球碱金属氧化物的催化剂在特定烧结处理后表现出活性下降。

3. 烯烃氧化的催化循环在含碱土金属改性的Y沸石上尚未完全闭合，因为生成的氧基化合物被强烈吸附在沸石中。

4. 在干燥条件下，主要在高于250°C时，乙酸酮可以脱附，仅在约120°C观察到少量。添加水可以在室温下促进乙酸酮的脱附，使脱附峰向更低温度移动并增加强度。

5. 地球碱金属在沸石笼中的活性是过氧化物催化作用于非还原氧化材料的一个突出例子，显示出在选择性氧化反应中出色的活性。

6. 非常规催化剂在选择性氧化反应中的使用确实导致了显著的选择性，尽管其机制原因可能大相径庭。
