[1] "The use of doped defective oxides gives rise to surface-redox chemistry in the case of partial oxidation of methane over yttrium-modified zirconia, where actual removal of oxygen from the surface sites indeed takes place."
[2] "Surprisingly, this oxygen species is not able to activate hydrogen to a significant extent."
[3] "In contrast, Li-modified MgO catalyst does not allow removal of oxygen; O sites generated by Li are now able to abstract a H-radical from, e.g., propane."
[4] "Radical gas-phase chemistry of the propyl radicals is then responsible for selective formation of olefins."
[5] "The remarkable selectivity obtained in propane oxygenation on earth-alkali-modified zeolite Y at unusually low temperatures is due to the confinement of radicals in the cages of the zeolite, turning radical chemistry into stoichiometric chemistry."
[6] "The second significant effect is the very effective stabilization of the resulting oxygenate, acetone, in the cage."
[7] "Our work indicates that desorption can be assisted by offering water as a competitive adsorbing species, thus opening the possibility to close the catalytic cycle."
