The addition of foreign ions to nickel oxide influences its reduction rate and activation energy. The reduction process of metallic oxides comprises multiple stages. The author explored the solubility of metals in chloride mixtures, comparing the solubility reduction effectiveness of salts based on their anion-to-cation ratio. For similar-sized cations, the metal solubility increases with a higher anion-to-cation ratio in the salt.
