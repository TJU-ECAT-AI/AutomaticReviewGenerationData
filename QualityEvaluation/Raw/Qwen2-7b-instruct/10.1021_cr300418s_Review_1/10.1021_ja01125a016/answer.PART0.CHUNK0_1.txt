[1] "The addition of foreign ions to nickel oxide affects both the rate and activation energy for reduction."
[2] "These effects have been related to the change in the electronic properties of the oxide."
[3] "In the case of nickel oxide, after an initial auto acceleration of the reduction rate, a constant value is obtained up to relatively high conversions."
[4] "The present data refer mainly to this latter stage of the reductive process and clearly show how the reaction can be greatly affected by the defective structure of the solid phase."
[5] "It must be pointed out that the above concentrations of impurities in nickel oxide refer to over-all values of impurity content. It does not imply that all the impurity is homogeneously distributed in the nickel oxide lattice."
[6] "Since the purpose of the investigation was not to study in detail the effect of concentration of impurities the amount of homogeneity was not considered in the interpretation of the results."
[7] "Supporting evidence in this respect is given by the fact that addition of metallic nickel produces no effect on the induction period for nickel oxide reduction in contrast to the findings of Pease and Taylor for copper oxide."
[8] "Furthermore, the addition of a trivalent cation (Cr³⁺) increases the number of cation vacancies in the nickel oxide lattice."
[9] "Accordingly, the ionic conductivity will increase and likewise the diffusion rate."
[10] "Process (c) however, can become significant at low pressures,where the mechanism of reduction must be different from that occurring at higher pressures."
[11] "It seems therefore that process (a), the irreversible chemisorption of hydrogen, determines the rate of the reduction process."
[12] "Nickel oxide is known to be an electron defect semiconductor, containing in its lattice cationic holes (0(Ni⁺⁺⁺)) and an electrically equivalent number of electron holes (O(e⁻⁻⁻))."
[13] "Its p-type character can be modified and controlled to a certain extent by incorporation in the lattice of suitable impurities."
[14] "Recent data by Verwey and Hauffe have clearly shown the effect of the incorporation of foreign ions on the semiconductivity of nickel oxide."
[15] "These authors were able to demonstrate that the semiconductivity can be increased by the introduction of monovalent cations (Li⁺), while cations with higher valency than two (Cr³⁺) have the reverse effect."
[16] "An opposite behavior is to be expected as far as cationic holes are concerned."
[17] "Point (1) can be explained by considering that in the case of "pure" nickel oxide the rate of reduction depends on the number of positive holes only."
[18] "On the other hand the present data show that in the case of samples containing foreign ions a direct correlation between the number of positive holes in the oxides and its rate of reduction cannot be deduced."
[19] "Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the present rate data are not in agreement with those of Wagner and Hauffe on the effect of additions of foreign ions to the rate of oxidation of nickel and zinc metals."
[20] "These authors find a definite relation between the type of addition and the rate of oxidation."
[21] "An almost continuous distribution of energy among impurity levels has been assumed by Meyer and Busch to explain the mechanism."
[22] "It is interesting to point out that the actual position of the impurity levels in the oxide does not affect the activation energy of the reduction process."
[23] "In fact, it has been found by Verwey that the activation energy for semiconductivity in lithium-containing samples decreases with increasing content of lithium."
[24] "Hauffe found that the activation energy for semiconductivity is not affected by the presence of chromia."
[25] "However, there are at present no experimental data to support these predictions."
