1. Experimental values for water-acetone mixtures confirm that at 3.25% water, the heat of solution of uranyl nitrate dihydrate reaches its minimal value, indicating the process of dissociation and coordination of water molecules absorbs a net minimum of 5.6 kcal, resulting in an overall value of -5.37 kcal for pure water.
2. The heat of solution of uranyl nitrate dihydrate in water for undissociated uranyl nitrate tetrahydrate shows a minimal value at 3.25% water, requiring a net absorption of 5.6 kcal for the dissociation and coordination of water molecules, leading to an overall value of -5.37 kcal for pure water.
3. The activation energy for the reduction of nickel oxide by hydrogen correlates with the type of addition to the oxide, suggesting that the same and opposite effects can likely be predicted for other p-type and n-type oxides respectively, though there are currently no supporting experimental data.
4. For cations of similar size, the solubility of the metal increases as the ratio of anions to cations in the salt increases, as demonstrated by the observed trends.
5. Adding salts with appropriate anion to cation ratios to cadmium chloride results in a reduction of cadmium's solubility in the mixture.

1. 水-乙酸混合物实验值证实，在3.25%水中，尿烷硝酸二水合物的溶解热达到最小值，表明硝酸盐的分解和额外两个水分子的配合吸收了净最小的5.6 kcal，导致纯水的总体值为-5.37 kcal。
2. 尿烷硝酸二水合物在水中的溶解热用于未分解的尿烷硝酸四水合物，显示在3.25%水中达到最小值，需要吸收5.6 kcal进行硝酸盐的分解和额外两个水分子的配合，最终导致纯水的总体值为-5.37 kcal。
3. 对镍氧化物的还原通过氢气进行时，添加外加离子的激活能量与镍氧化物的类型相关联，暗示对于其他p型和n型氧化物，可能可以预测相同和相反的效果，尽管当前没有支持这些预测的实验数据。
4. 对于相似尺寸的阳离子，金属的溶解度随着盐中阴离子与阳离子的比例增加而增加，这从观察到的趋势中得到证明。
5. 向镉氯化物中添加具有适当阴离子与阳离子比例的盐会降低镉在混合物中的溶解度。
