How have impurities and additives in oxide catalysts contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis, and what implications does this historical perspective have for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design?

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have been intentionally or unintentionally used throughout the history of catalysis, serving as doped oxide catalysts. This historical perspective has led to the development of modern catalyst design that considers the role of impurities and additives, contributing to a better understanding of catalytic processes and guiding the creation of more efficient catalysts.
