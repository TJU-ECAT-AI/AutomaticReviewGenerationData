How have impurities and additives in oxide catalysts contributed to the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis, and what implications does this historical perspective have for our current understanding of catalytic processes and the development of modern catalyst design?

Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have historically been seen as detrimental to their performance. However, they have also played a significant role in the evolution of catalysts. The unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts, due to the presence of impurities and additives, has led to the discovery of novel catalytic properties. This historical perspective emphasizes the importance of considering impurities and additives as potential sources of catalytic enhancement. Understanding how these elements affect the activity and selectivity of catalysts is crucial for modern catalyst design.
