1. Inverse CeO2/CuO catalysts have been identified as alternatives to traditional configurations for preferential CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams. Historically, the use of doped oxide catalysts was unintentional due to impurities and additives in the manufacturing process. This historical context underscores the importance of understanding catalyst structure and composition for catalytic activity, which in turn has implications for modern catalyst design.
