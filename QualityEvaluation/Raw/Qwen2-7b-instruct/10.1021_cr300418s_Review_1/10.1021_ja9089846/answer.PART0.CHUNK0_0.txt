[1] "Inverse CeO2/CuO catalysts have been proposed as an alternative to classical direct configurations for preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich stream."
[2] "The historical perspective reveals that impurities and additives in oxide catalysts have played a significant role in the unintentional use of doped oxide catalysts throughout the history of catalysis."
[3] "This has led to a deeper understanding of catalytic processes and has influenced modern catalyst design."
