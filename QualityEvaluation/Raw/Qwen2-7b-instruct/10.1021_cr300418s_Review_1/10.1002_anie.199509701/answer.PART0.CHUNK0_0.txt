[1] "The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH,. Therefore, the potential active centers will be discussed with respect to classes of catalysts."
[2] "The author is indebted to a large group of graduate students and research associates who contributed significantly to the field of methane oxidation during their time at Texas A & M University."
[3] "Although research on the oxidative coupling of methane has not resulted in a commercial process, it has provided insight into an interesting class of heterogeneous - homogeneous radical reactions."

The oxidative coupling reaction of methane doesn't have a commercial process yet, but it has led to insights into a class of heterogeneous-homogeneous radical reactions. Various catalysts are used in this reaction, indicating that a single type of active center isn't responsible for activating CH. The author acknowledges the contributions of numerous graduate students and research associates from Texas A & M University to the field of methane oxidation.

甲烷的氧化耦合反应还未形成商业流程，但它为一类异质-同质自由基反应提供了见解。在该反应中使用了多种催化剂，表明单个类型的活性中心并不负责激活CH。作者感谢得克萨斯农工大学期间对甲烷氧化领域做出重大贡献的众多研究生和研究助理。
