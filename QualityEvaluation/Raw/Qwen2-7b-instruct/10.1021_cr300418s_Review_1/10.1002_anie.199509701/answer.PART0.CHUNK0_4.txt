[1] "Even those catalysts that function in a cyclic mode are much more active when CH, and 0, are co-fed to the system."

[2] "Over a Li/MgO catalyst containing chloride ions a C,H, selectivity of 77% has been achieved at a C,H, conversion of 75%, which corresponds to a yield of 58 %."

[3] "Clearly, the values of R are significantly greater than 1 .  Even at 650C over Li/MgO a value of R = 3.4 was obtained. Thus, at all temperatures studied COX would be derived mainly from C,H,, provided the partial pres- sures of CH, and C,H, are comparable."

[4] "Moreover, because the C-H bond strength in C,H,(422 kJ mol- ') is less than that in CH, (439 kJ mol- I ) ,  the rates of reaction are substantially greater with C,H,."

1. Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as chloride ions, have led to the unintentional creation of doped oxide catalysts. This has contributed to the development of catalysts with unique properties and behaviors. Historically, this perspective highlights the importance of considering impurities and additives in catalyst design, as they can significantly impact catalytic performance and efficiency. Modern catalyst design must take into account these factors to optimize reaction rates and product yields.

2. The oxidative coupling of methane typically leads to the formation of ethane, which can then be converted into ethylene in situ. In contrast, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane primarily produces ethene. This difference is due to the distinct pathways and subsequent reactions of methyl radicals after their generation. Understanding these differences aids in the optimization of catalysts for specific applications, such as targeting ethene production in the oxidative coupling of methane and ethene formation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

1. 杂质和添加剂在氧化物催化剂中的作用导致了掺杂氧化物催化剂的意外产生，这促进了具有独特特性和行为的催化剂的发展。历史上，这一视角强调了在催化剂设计中考虑杂质和添加剂的重要性，因为它们可以显著影响催化性能和效率。现代催化剂设计必须考虑到这些因素以优化反应速率和产物产率。

2. 甲烷的氧化耦合通常会导致乙烷的生成，随后可以将乙烷进一步转化为乙烯。相比之下，乙烷的氧化脱氢主要产生乙烯。这些差异归因于甲基自由基生成后的不同路径和后续反应。理解这些差异有助于优化用于特定应用的催化剂，例如针对氧化耦合中的乙烯生产以及氧化脱氢中的乙烯形成。
