[1] "The diversity of catalysts used in the oxidative coupling reaction makes it unlikely that a single type of center is responsible for the activation of CH,. Therefore, the potential active centers will be discussed with respect to classes of catalysts."

[2] "The fundamental aspects of the problem involve both a heterogeneous component, which includes the activation of CH, on a metal oxide surface, and a homogeneous gas-phase component, which includes free-radical chemistry."

[3] "Ethane is produced mainly by the coupling of the surface-generated CH; radicals in the gas phase."

[4] "Less is known about the nature of the active centers than about the reaction mechanism; however, reactive oxygen ions are apparently required for the activation of CH, on certain catalysts."

[5] "There is spectroscopic evidence for surface O- or O2- ions."

[6] "Many of the same catalysts are effective, and the cross-coupling reaction also appears to involve surface-generated radicals."

[7] "Although a technological process has not been developed, extensive research has resulted in a reasonable understanding of the elementary reactions that occur during the oxidative coupling of methane."

[8] "The more effective catalysts may be divided into five groups: highly basic pure oxides, of which the early members of the lanthanide oxide series (excluding CeO,) are the best; Group IA or IIA ions supported on basic oxides (for example, Li/MgO, Ba/MgO and Sr/La,O,); monophasic oxides; a few transition metal oxides that contain Group IA ions; and any of these materials that are promoted with chloride ions."

[9] "The most defini- tive experiments to determine the origin of COX have been carried out by adding I3C,H, or 
"C,H,
to the "CH,reagent and observing the fraction of I3CO, that appears as a product."

[10] "At a constant level of 5% CH, conversion, the C,selectivity increased from 45 % to 64 % upon the addition of"

[11] "In the presence of the reagents and the catalyst at temperatures up to 800C, the involvement of peroxide ions in the oxidative coupling of CH, over these supported barium catalysts is reasonably convincing."

[12] "The addition of chloride ions to an oxidative coupling catalyst can have a marked effect on its properties, particularly with respect to the C,H,/C,H,ratio."

[13] "Perhaps the most important of these, and certainly the most thoroughly studied, is the oxidative coupling of methane with toluene to produce ethylbenzene."

[14] "While in the catalyst bed, a portion of the ethylbenzene is converted into the desired product, styrene."

1. Impurities and additives in oxide catalysts, such as chloride ions, have contributed to the development of doped oxide catalysts by enhancing their catalytic activity and selectivity. This historical perspective highlights the importance of understanding the role of various components in catalysts for the optimization of catalytic processes. Modern catalyst design aims to incorporate these insights to create more efficient and selective catalysts.

2. The oxidative coupling of methane involves the conversion of methane (CH4) into ethane (C2H6) through a heterogeneous catalytic process. The fundamental aspects include the activation of methane on a metal oxide surface, which leads to the generation of radicals, and subsequent gas-phase reactions, primarily coupling of these radicals, leading to the formation of ethane.

3. Surface oxygen ions play a critical role in the activation of methane during the oxidative coupling reaction. They are present in various forms such as O-, O2-, or O2- in a state of low coordination. These ions facilitate the activation of methane by providing the necessary reactive oxygen species required for the subsequent radical reactions.

4. Li/MgO catalysts and those containing chloride ions exhibit distinct behaviors in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity toward the oxidative coupling of methane. Li/MgO catalysts are characterized by their ability to activate methane via specific oxygen centers, whereas chloride-containing catalysts show improved selectivity towards the formation of ethane over methane, suggesting a different mechanism involving homogeneous reactions.

5. Cross-coupling reactions involving methane, such as oxidative coupling with toluene and oxidative methylation of propylene, expand the scope of methane reactions. These reactions typically involve the coupling of methane radicals with the corresponding radicals from other hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of desired products like ethylbenzene and isobutylene, respectively.

1. 杂质和添加剂在氧化催化剂中的作用促进了掺杂氧化物催化剂的发展，提高了催化剂的活性和选择性。这种历史视角强调了理解催化剂组件的重要性，以优化催化过程。现代催化剂设计旨在结合这些见解来创建更高效和选择性的催化剂。

2. 甲烷的氧化耦合涉及到将甲烷（CH4）转化为乙烷（C2H6）通过异质催化过程。基本方面包括在金属氧化物表面上激活甲烷，导致自由基的产生，随后是气相反应，主要涉及这些自由基的耦合，导致乙烷的形成。

3. 氧化耦合甲烷反应中表面氧离子在甲烷激活过程中起关键作用。它们以多种形式存在，如O-、O2-或低配位状态下的O2-。这些离子通过提供必要的反应性氧物种来促进甲烷激活，从而进行后续的自由基反应。

4. Li/MgO催化剂与含氯催化剂在甲烷氧化耦合过程中的活性和选择性表现出不同特征。Li/MgO催化剂通过特定的氧中心激活甲烷，而含氯催化剂显示出提高的乙烷选择性，表明涉及不同的机制，可能包含均相反应。

5. 涉及甲烷的交叉耦合反应，如与苯甲醚的氧化耦合和丙烯的氧化甲基化，扩展了甲烷反应的范围。这些反应通常涉及甲烷自由基与另一种烃的相应自由基之间的耦合，产生所需的产物，如乙基苯和异丁烯等。
