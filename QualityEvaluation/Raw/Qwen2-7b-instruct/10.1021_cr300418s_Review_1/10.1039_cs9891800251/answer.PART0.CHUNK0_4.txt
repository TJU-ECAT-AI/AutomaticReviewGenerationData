[1] "In its place the research emphasis has now been directed at the utiliation of natural gas as a source of chemicals and fuels."

[2] "A large amount of pioneering research was completed in the 1920s and 1930s in which the partial oxidation reaction was investigated as a high pressure gas phase reaction."

[3] "These early studies demonstrated that the oxidative coupling of methane to form higher hydrocarbon products was a high temperature reaction and temperatures in excess of 600 "C were required to observe selective products."

[4] "Based on these early studies two catalysts are now being evaluated at pilot plant scale."

[5] "An important question remains concerning the comparison of methane oxidation using cyclic and co-feed experimental regimes; it has to be considered whether the methane activation process is the same for the two processes."

1. The research focus has shifted to utilizing natural gas as a source of chemicals and fuels.

2. Pioneering research in the 1920s and 1930s investigated the partial oxidation reaction as a high-pressure gas-phase reaction.

3. Early studies showed that methane oxidation to form higher hydrocarbons was a high-temperature reaction, requiring temperatures above 600°C for selective products.

4. Two catalysts are currently being tested at pilot plant scale.

5. A key question is whether the methane activation process is identical when using cyclic versus co-feed experimental setups.
