<p>A striking feature of these studies is that the product distribution remains invariant to a greater extent (i.e. C2H6, C2H4, CO, C02, H2, HzO and lesser amounts of C3+ hydrocarbons) and CH30H, CH2O or other oxygenates have been reported for only a very small range of catalyst formulations.</p>
<p>It is possible that at the elevated temperature, > 600 O C , required to observe 2 2 </p>
<p>Since the early studies of Keller and Bhasin and Lunsford a large scale catalyst screening and evaluation exercise has been carried out by a large number of workers. As a result, the majority of the simple metal oxides have been examined as catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.</p>
<p>It is clear that considerable scope exists to further improve on these specific activities, and as yet no detailed study has been published concerning optimiza- tion of the specific activity by using improved methods of catalyst preparation.</p>
<p>However, formation of oxygenates at lower temperatures is not reported, and in studies where low temperature investigations have been made 2 5 no enhanced level of oxygenated products is observed.</p>
<p>The main observation that can be made from the summary of the catalytic studies (Tables 1-5) is that a very wide range of experimental conditions have been used.</p>
<p>For this summary it may be concluded that, although catalyst selectivities may be similar,there exists a very wide range of specific activities spanning almost two orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Until recently only limited attention had been given in the research literature to consideration of the nature of the primary hydrocarbon products.</p>
<p>It was also shown 2 o that decreasing the oxygen concentration did not significantly affect the ethene selectivity at low conversion while it did enhance the ethane selectivity,which indicated that the ethene primary selectivity was reasonably independent of the CH4,02 ratio.</p>
<p>Hence for MgO, Sm203,and La203, with and 275 Published on 01 January 1989. Downloaded by East Carolina University on 28/10/2014 03:41:23.View Article Online without Li' and for both 0 2 and N2O as oxidants, a reaction pathway exists for the direct formation of ethene from methane and independent of C2Hh.</p>
<p>It has been concluded,20 on the basis of use of N2O as oxidant or Li+ addition to MgO, that methylene carbene could not be formed in significant amounts from an interaction of CH\(,, with surface 0-, i.c. a second hydrogen abstraction.</p>
<p>In general, as expected, ethane and ethene are oxidized far more rapidly than methane, a feature which has been neglected in some kinetic modelling studies.</p>
<p>Comparison of N2O with O2 as an oxidant for ethane has indicated2" that N2O is always more selective for ethene formation than 02,and hence a monatomic oxygen species is the selective oxidizing species for this reaction.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that 0;- has been proposed by Otsukas3.s4 as an active oxidizing species for Sm203,a catalyst which gives significantly higher ethene selectivities than other oxides (Table 6).</p>
<p>These studies 20.68.h9 have all provided evidence that reaction 4 is a gas phase reaction and the presence of a catalyst only leads to enhance the parallel total oxidation pathway.</p>
<p>However, these studies also indicate that reaction 4 is facile under the conditions required for methane partial oxidation and at high conversions, >5/o, it must be considered to be the major route for ethene production.</p>
<p>It is particularly marked for MgO as a catalyst (Table 6), but the selectivity to Hr relative to that of C 2 hydrocarbons decreases on doping with Li+.</p>
<p>It can be considered that the increased surfdce concentration of 0- from doping with Li' results in oxidation of hydrogen to water.</p>
<p>It is clear that further experimental work is required to elucidate whether chloride additives to catalysts (Tables 3 and 5 ) do have a true surface catalytic function.</p>
