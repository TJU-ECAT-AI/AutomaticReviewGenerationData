[1] "In its place the research emphasis has now been directed at the utiliation of natural gas as a source of chemicals and fuels."
[2] "The reasons for this are twofold: first, the current reserves of natural gas are considered as a large underutilized energy resource, but a large proportion of these reserves are remotely located from high densities of consumers and chemical conversion of the methane is required to facilitate transportation."
[3] "Subsequently Lunsford identified that lithium-promoted magnesium oxide could give a much improved catalytic performance."
[4] "These early studies demonstrated that the oxidative coupling of methane to form CZ hydrocarbons was a high temperature reaction and temperatures in excess of 600 "C were required to observe selective products."
[5] "It could be concluded from these early studies that the selectivity to Cz hydrocarbons for any particular catalyst is related to the concentration of gas phase oxygen co-fed with the methane."

1. The research focus has shifted towards utilizing natural gas as a source for producing chemicals and fuels.

2. The reasons for this shift are twofold: first, natural gas reserves are seen as a substantial, underused energy resource, and second, many of these reserves are located in remote areas distant from high consumer populations, necessitating the conversion of methane to enable transportation.

3. Lunsford discovered that lithium-promoted magnesium oxide can significantly enhance catalytic performance.

4. Early studies showed that oxidative coupling of methane to form CZ hydrocarbons is a high-temperature process, requiring temperatures over 600°C to observe selective products.

5. Conclusively, the selectivity to Cz hydrocarbons for any catalyst depends on the concentration of gas phase oxygen co-fed with methane.

1. 研究重点已转向利用天然气作为生产化学品和燃料的来源。

2. 这一转变有两个原因：首先，天然气储量被视为一个大量未充分利用的能源资源，而这些储量中的很大一部分位于远离高人口密度消费者地区的偏远地区，因此需要将甲烷转化为便于运输。

3. Lunsford发现，锂改性的镁氧化物可以显著提高催化性能。

4. 早期研究表明，甲烷的氧化耦合形成CZ烃类化合物是一个高温过程，在超过600°C的温度下才能观察到选择性产物。

5. 总结来说，任何催化剂对Cz烃的选择性取决于与甲烷共喂入的气体相氧的浓度。
