The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This innovative approach allows for the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of these PtSn clusters are notable, enhancing their stability and dispersion. This improvement in structure leads to a notable increase in the efficiency of propane conversion.
