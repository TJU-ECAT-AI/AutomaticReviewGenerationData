[1] "The Catofin process, by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, which originally was exclusively used for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene."
[2] "Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, each lasting a few minutes (1530 min being needed for one full cycle)."
[3] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[4] "The Oleflex process uses a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C."
[5] "The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C."
[6] "The catalyst deactivation is caused by the deposition of coke and thermal sintering of the alumina support leading to a loss of surface area."
[7] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[8] "Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[9] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2."

1. The Catofin process, utilized by CB&I Lummus, was initially designed for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. 
2. In a Catofin unit, each reactor goes through three steps - dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge, taking about 15 to 30 minutes per cycle.
3. The Catofin catalyst stays in use for 23 years, and its activity decline over time is managed by incrementally increasing temperature to ensure consistent dehydrogenation activity throughout its lifespan.
4. The Oleflex process by UOP employs a PtSn catalyst under pressures of 1 to 3 bar and temperatures between 525 and 705 C.
5. The Oleflex process also uses a PtSn catalyst, functioning under pressures of 1 to 3 bar and temperatures of 525 to 705 C.
6. Catalyst deactivation in both processes is due to the formation of coke and the thermal sintering of the alumina support, resulting in a loss of surface area.
7. Zirconia is an alternative support material that has been explored for dehydrogenation processes.
8. The low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance imparted by chromia on zirconia make it a suitable substitute for alumina.
9. The increase in surface Cr5+ during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts has been associated with improved activity.

1. CB&I Lummus的Catofin工艺最初用于异丁烷的脱氢生成异丁烯。
2. 在Catofin单元中，每个反应器会经历三次步骤 - 脱氢、再生和清除，每次循环大约需要15到30分钟。
3. Catofin催化剂的使用寿命为23年，通过逐步提高温度来管理其随时间下降的活动性，以确保整个催化剂寿命期间的一致脱氢活性。
4. UOP的Oleflex工艺使用铂锡基催化剂，在1至3巴的压力下以及525至705摄氏度的温度范围内运行。
5. Oleflex工艺同样使用铂锡催化剂，在1至3巴的压力和525至705摄氏度的温度范围内运行。
6. 两种工艺中的催化剂失活都是由于在铝酸盐支撑上沉积焦炭以及导致表面面积损失的热烧结所导致的。
7. 碳化锆是一种已经探索的替代支撑材料，用于脱氢过程。
8. 由于铬氧化物赋予碳化锆的低表面酸性和增强的烧结性，它成为一种适合替代氧化铝的材料。
9. 在Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂的再生过程中，表面Cr5+的增加与活性的提高有关联。
