[1] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[2] "A Catofin installation generally consists of 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromia-alumina catalyst."
[3] "Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, each lasting a few minutes (15-30 min being needed for one full cycle)."
[4] "The reaction is run at temperatures of approximately 575 °C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar."
[5] "For environmental reasons, the use of MTBE has declined in recent years, causing a shift in the use of Catofin installations to alternative purposes, such as propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The Oleflex process uses a very different reactor design comprising fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section."
[7] "The catalyst flows through the system, the last reactor being connected to a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) unit that regenerates the catalyst by burning any carbon deposits and redisperses the Pt on the support material by means of treating the catalyst with a chlorine-air mixture."
[8] "The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products."
[9] "The Oleflex process uses a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 °C."
[10] "Three or four adiabatic radial flow reactors containing the catalyst are connected in series with preheaters in between."
[11] "A schematic representation is shown in Figure 4."

The Catofin process involves 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors with a chromia-alumina catalyst. Each reactor goes through dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge cycles. The dehydrogenation process takes place at 575 °C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. Due to environmental concerns, the Catofin process has shifted from producing MTBE to propane dehydrogenation. In contrast, the Oleflex process utilizes fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. The catalyst is regenerated by burning carbon deposits and redispersing platinum (Pt) particles on the support material using a chlorine-air mixture. The Oleflex process employs a PtSn catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures from 525 to 705 °C, with three or four adiabatic radial flow reactors connected in series and preheaters in between.

卡托芬过程包括58个并行的绝热固定床反应器，使用氧化铝-铬催化剂。每个反应器通过脱氢、再生和冲洗循环。脱氢过程在575°C和0.2至0.5巴的压力下进行。由于环境原因，卡托芬过程从生产MTBE转向丙烷脱氢。相比之下，奥莱克斯过程采用流化床反应器、催化剂再生单元和产品回收部分。催化剂通过燃烧碳沉积物和使用氯气-空气混合物重新分散铂（Pt）颗粒来再生。奥莱克斯过程使用一个基于铂锡的催化剂，在1至3巴的压力和525至705°C的温度下，有三个或四个绝热径向流动反应器串联连接，并且在两者之间有预热器。
