<quotes>
[1] "The Catofin process, by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, which originally was exclusively used for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene."
[2] "Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, each lasting a few minutes (1530 min being needed for one full cycle)."
[3] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[4] "The Oleflex process uses a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C."
[5] "The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C."
[6] "The catalyst deactivation is caused by the deposition of coke and thermal sintering of the alumina support leading to a loss of surface area."
[7] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."
[8] "Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina."
[9] "This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Catofin process, utilized by CB&I Lummus, was initially designed for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. 
2. In a Catofin unit, each reactor goes through three steps - dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge, taking about 15 to 30 minutes per cycle.
3. The Catofin catalyst stays in use for 23 years, and its activity decline over time is managed by incrementally increasing temperature to ensure consistent dehydrogenation activity throughout its lifespan.
4. The Oleflex process by UOP employs a PtSn catalyst under pressures of 1 to 3 bar and temperatures between 525 and 705 C.
5. The Oleflex process also uses a PtSn catalyst, functioning under pressures of 1 to 3 bar and temperatures of 525 to 705 C.
6. Catalyst deactivation in both processes is due to the formation of coke and the thermal sintering of the alumina support, resulting in a loss of surface area.
7. Zirconia is an alternative support material that has been explored for dehydrogenation processes.
8. The low surface acidity and enhanced sintering resistance imparted by chromia on zirconia make it a suitable substitute for alumina.
9. The increase in surface Cr5+ during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts has been associated with improved activity.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. CB&I Lummus的Catofin工艺最初用于异丁烷的脱氢生成异丁烯。
2. 在Catofin单元中，每个反应器会经历三次步骤 - 脱氢、再生和清除，每次循环大约需要15到30分钟。
3. Catofin催化剂的使用寿命为23年，通过逐步提高温度来管理其随时间下降的活动性，以确保整个催化剂寿命期间的一致脱氢活性。
4. UOP的Oleflex工艺使用铂锡基催化剂，在1至3巴的压力下以及525至705摄氏度的温度范围内运行。
5. Oleflex工艺同样使用铂锡催化剂，在1至3巴的压力和525至705摄氏度的温度范围内运行。
6. 两种工艺中的催化剂失活都是由于在铝酸盐支撑上沉积焦炭以及导致表面面积损失的热烧结所导致的。
7. 碳化锆是一种已经探索的替代支撑材料，用于脱氢过程。
8. 由于铬氧化物赋予碳化锆的低表面酸性和增强的烧结性，它成为一种适合替代氧化铝的材料。
9. 在Cr2O3/ZrO2催化剂的再生过程中，表面Cr5+的增加与活性的提高有关联。

[1] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[3] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[4] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[5] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[6] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[7] "In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner."
[8] "The recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[9] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[10] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[11] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[12] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."
[13] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[14] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."
[15] "Moreover, in Table 2, a comparison is made between the two most important processes, Catofin and Oleflex."
[16] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[17] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[18] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

[20] "A Catofin installation generally consists of 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromiaalumina catalyst."
[21] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."
[22] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8)."
[23] "The CH bonds in paraffins and olefins are considerably more reactive than CC bonds, meaning that catalysts that favor CH over CC bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions."
[24] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[25] "As was shown in the previous section, two strategies have been adopted in industry to lower paraffin partial pressure, reducing the pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process)."
[26] "Notably, the reaction equilibrium can be shifted to higher paraffin conversions by reducing the partial pressure of the paraffin or by withdrawing the hydrogen produced."
[27] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[28] "The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is discussed."
[29] "The chemistry of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation has been further discussed in a review by Albonetti et al. (31)"
[30] "Other reviews focusing on a specific family of dehydrogenation catalysts have also been published."
[31] "The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins on both supported and bulk transition metal oxides has also been discussed by Copret in a review focused on CH bond activation."
[32] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[33] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
