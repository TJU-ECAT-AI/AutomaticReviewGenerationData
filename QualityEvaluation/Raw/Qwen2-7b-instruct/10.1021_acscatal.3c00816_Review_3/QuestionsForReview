How does the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation, and what are its effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion?
