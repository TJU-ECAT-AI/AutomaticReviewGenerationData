          The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy, developed by Yu et al., addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This strategy leads to the formation of well-defined PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, enhancing their structure, formation, and catalytic performance, particularly in the context of propane conversion.
