         [1] "Yu et al. explored the influence of solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd) and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3 in tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts."
         [2] "At 580 C, initial propene yields of 63.5% and 57.5% were observed for PtGa/Hd-Al2O3 and PtGa/Sg-Al2O3, respectively."
         [3] "The enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt."

         The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by utilizing solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd), and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3 to tune the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts. This results in enhanced performance attributed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects that alter the adsorption properties of Pt. At 580 C, the initial propene yields for PtGa/Hd-Al2O3 and PtGa/Sg-Al2O3 were 63.5% and 57.5%, respectively.

         由余等人提出的超快速沸石结晶策略通过利用溶胶（Sg）、水热合成（Hd）和商业上获得的Al2O3来调整PtGa/Al2O3催化剂中Al3+物种的配位结构，从而解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这归因于电子转移和酸位调制效应，这些效应改变了Pt的吸附性质。在580摄氏度下，PtGa/Hd-Al2O3和PtGa/Sg-Al2O3的初始丙烯产率分别为63.5%和57.5%。
