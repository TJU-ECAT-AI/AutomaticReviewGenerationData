          The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the crystallization process. This approach notably influences the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. Specifically, in the context of propane conversion, the enhanced structure of these clusters results in improved selectivity and activity, contributing to more efficient dehydrogenation processes.

          The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. significantly reduces the synthesis time while maintaining the structural integrity of metal clusters within the zeolite framework. This method enables the formation of PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites with optimal dispersion and size, leading to superior catalytic activity for propane conversion. The enhanced surface area and reactivity of these clusters contribute to increased efficiency in non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
