        The development of an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy by Yu et al. has significantly addressed the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation, as evidenced through several key studies referenced below. This innovative approach has notably influenced the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, thereby enhancing their efficiency and selectivity in the context of propane conversion. 

        The strategy, initially detailed in [1], allows for the rapid formation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework, specifically targeting the creation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. As described in [2], this leads to a significant acceleration in the crystallization process, which in turn facilitates more efficient metal loading. The utilization of solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd), and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3 to tune the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts, as reported in [3], showcases the versatility and effectiveness of this approach in modulating the performance of PtGa catalysts. 

        The strategic development of such a technique, as outlined in [4], [5], and [6], not only optimizes the formation and structure of PtSn clusters but also directly impacts their catalytic performance. Specifically, the enhanced structure of the PtSn clusters, as highlighted in [7], results in improved selectivity and activity in propane conversion, demonstrating the strategy's capability to significantly enhance the catalytic capabilities of these materials.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook, based on the aforementioned studies, suggest a promising future for the application of ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategies in the field of catalyst development. These strategies offer new avenues for exploring and optimizing the synthesis of complex metal clusters within zeolite frameworks, potentially leading to the discovery of novel catalysts with unparalleled performance in various industrial applications. Future research could further delve into the optimization of these techniques for different metal clusters and zeolite types, expanding the scope of their applicability across diverse chemical conversion processes.

        由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略显著解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战，这在引用的多个关键研究中得到了证明。这一创新方法对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能产生了重大影响，从而提高了它们在丙烷转化过程中的效率和选择性。

        初步策略，如在[1]中详细描述的，允许金属簇在沸石框架内的快速形成，特别针对ZSM-5沸石中的PtSn簇。正如在[2]中所述，这导致了结晶过程的显著加速，从而促进了更高效的金属负载。通过利用溶胶（Sg）、水热合成（Hd）和商业（C）获得的Al2O3来调节Al3+物种的配位结构，以在PtGa/Al2O3催化剂中调整性能，如在[3]中所报道的，展示了这种方法在调整PtGa催化剂性能方面的多样性和有效性。

        根据[4]、[5]、[6]和[7]的研究发展，这种战略不仅优化了PtSn簇的形成和结构，而且直接影响了其催化性能。具体而言，如在[7]中强调的，增强的PtSn簇结构导致了丙烷转化过程中的更高选择性和活性，这表明该策略能够显著提升这些材料的催化能力。

        在此基础上，整合的理解和前瞻性展望表明，对于催化剂开发领域而言，超快速沸石结晶策略具有令人鼓舞的前景。这些策略为探索和优化复杂金属簇在沸石框架内的合成提供了新的途径，可能引领发现性能卓越的新催化剂，适用于各种工业应用。未来的研究可以进一步探索这些技术在不同金属簇和沸石类型的应用优化，扩大其适用范围，涵盖多种化学转化过程。
