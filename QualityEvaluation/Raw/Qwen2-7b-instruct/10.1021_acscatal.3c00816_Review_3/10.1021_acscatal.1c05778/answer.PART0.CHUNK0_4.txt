The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This method enhances the formation, structure, and stability of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to improved catalytic performance in propane conversion. The enhanced structure and controlled size of these PtSn clusters contribute to better performance during propane conversion.
