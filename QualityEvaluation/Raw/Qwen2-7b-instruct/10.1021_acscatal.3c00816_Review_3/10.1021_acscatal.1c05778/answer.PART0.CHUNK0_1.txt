The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of zeolite structures. This approach impacts the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to enhanced activity and stability in the context of propane conversion.
