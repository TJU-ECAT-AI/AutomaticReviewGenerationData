The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures. This method leads to significant improvements in the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, thereby enhancing their selectivity and activity in the context of propane conversion.
