The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. This method impacts the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of the clusters, notably enhancing their efficiency in propane conversion.
