The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by facilitating the rapid formation of zeolite structures. This enables the efficient creation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, which enhances their structure and catalytic performance. Specifically, the regioselective distribution of subnanometric CoO clusters in MFI zeolite nanosheets improves the efficiency of propane conversion.
