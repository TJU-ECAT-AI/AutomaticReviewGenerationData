The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of zeolite structures. This results in enhanced formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly boosting the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation.
