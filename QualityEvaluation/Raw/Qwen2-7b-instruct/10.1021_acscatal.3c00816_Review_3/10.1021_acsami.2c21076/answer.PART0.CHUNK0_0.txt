Yu et al.'s ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy tackles the time-scale mismatch issues in direct synthesis methods for metal encapsulation. By speeding up the crystallization process, it enables efficient metal loading. In ZSM-5 zeolites, this technique supports the creation of PtSn clusters. The strategic placement of subnanometric CoO clusters within nanosheets improves the catalyst's structure. Consequently, the PtSn clusters show superior stability and activity in propane conversion, thanks to better metal particle dispersion.
