The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the formation of zeolite structures. This leads to the improved formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly enhancing their selectivity and efficiency in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation process.
