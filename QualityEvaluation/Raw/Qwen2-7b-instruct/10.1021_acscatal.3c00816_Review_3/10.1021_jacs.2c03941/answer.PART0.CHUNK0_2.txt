The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by significantly reducing synthesis time without compromising the structural integrity of metal clusters within the zeolite framework. This approach enables the formation of PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites with optimal dispersion and size. As a result, these clusters demonstrate superior catalytic activity for propane conversion, attributed to their increased surface area and reactivity.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战，通过大幅缩短合成时间同时保持了金属簇在沸石骨架中的完整性。这种方法使ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的形成得以优化分散和尺寸。由此产生的PtSn簇表现出更优越的丙烷转化催化活性，归因于它们增加的表面积和反应性。
