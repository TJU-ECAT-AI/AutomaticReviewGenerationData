The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by significantly reducing synthesis time without compromising the structural integrity of metal clusters within the zeolite framework. This approach enables the formation of PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites with optimal dispersion and size. As a result, these clusters demonstrate superior catalytic activity for propane conversion, attributed to their increased surface area and reactivity.
