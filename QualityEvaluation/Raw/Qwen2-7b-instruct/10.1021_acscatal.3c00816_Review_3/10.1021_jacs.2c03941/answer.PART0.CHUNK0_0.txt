The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the crystallization process. This approach notably influences the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. Specifically, in the context of propane conversion, the enhanced structure of these clusters results in improved selectivity and activity, contributing to more efficient dehydrogenation processes.
