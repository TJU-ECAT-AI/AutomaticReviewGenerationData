2.2.2. VOx In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins. In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration.133 Similar to the CrOx-based catalysts that possess the redox of various Cr-relevant surface species during the reactions, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, different kinds of V species are included in the working VOx catalysts, such as monomeric, polymeric and crystalline VOx species with +3+5 valences. The reduction of high-valence V species and/or the sintering, redispersion, hydration or dehydration of V sites may occur in the DH reactions.134 Furthermore, in view of the strong interaction with the oxide supports, the V atoms may embed into the matrix for forming mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or MgOx. The changes in both structure and chemical state of the active VOx sites are significantly determined by their interaction with the employed supports. The V loading amount, preparation method, the selected support type and the reaction conditions can strongly influence the V-support interaction for tuning the catalytic DH performances (Table 4).
The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount. For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16).135 The apparent activation energy of the PDH reactions declines from 245 to 165 kJ mol1 with increasing V loading in the V/Al catalysts, indicating the structural change in the active V sites over these catalysts. The volcano-shape variation of the TOF values further suggests that the isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active in comparison with other V sites. The in situ DRIFT spectral results demonstrate that the vanadium propyl (V-C3H7) and vanadium propenyl (V-C3H5) species may serve as the reaction intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane and further transformation into propylene. By regulating the loading amount of the vanadyl acetylacetonate to be grafted on the mesoporous MCM-41 support, the isolated and oligomerized VOx species can be constructed with varied densities of the surface VOx sites from 0.05 to 1.67 nm2. The direct correlations between the apparent TOF value, the Lewis acidity and the mean number of the VOV bonds around a central V cation can explain the high intrinsic activity and anti-coking stability of the isolated V4+ and V3+ sites in the catalytic PDH reaction.136 By means of DFT calculations on a series of single metal models including V, Cr, Mn, Ru, Rh, Pt, etc., it is predicted that the single V atom anchored on the graphitic carbon nitride (V1/g-C3N4) may exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity and thermal stability for the non-oxidative PDH reaction, due to the contribution of the low-coordinated 3d orbitals of single V atom to the facile desorption of propylene through the inhibition of the di-σ binding mode of propylene on the single V atom.137 Fig. 16 Schematic representation of the states of VOx species in V/Al2O3 with different V loading.

The structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts are also improved by the selected support. A less than one monolayer Si/Al ratio of Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) strongly affects the catalytic activity and stability of the supported VOx species for the PDH reaction.138 The VOx/Al2O3SiO2 catalysts based on the Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt% of SiO2 show the highest space-time yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 mcat3 h1 at a propane conversion of 30% at 550 C, respectively, and these values are approximately two times higher than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar vanadium loading. Most of the catalysts except for one containing 70 wt% of SiO2 in the support can restore their initial activity even after ten cycles of dehydrogenation reaction and oxidative regeneration. For the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, their stability in PDH reactions can be substantially improved by the phosphorus modification through tuning the surface acidity and separating the polymerized VOx species as well as weakening the interaction between VOx species and Al2O3 matrix.139 The anti-coking stability of a 12V/Al2O3 catalyst can be significantly improved by the modification using a small amount of MgO additives through enhancing the dispersion of the V2O5 nanoparticles into two-dimensional VOx species.140 By changing the support from commercial γ-Al2O3 to ZrO2, a sixfold increased TOF value is achieved on the supported VOx catalyst for the PDH reaction, and the reaction rate increases linearly with increasing V loading until the loading reaches 2 wt% (Fig. 17a).141 This promotion effect benefits from the formation of low coordinated V species in the VOx/ZrO2 catalyst with a high ability and a low energy barrier for propane CH activation (Fig. 17bd). Based on the H2-TPR profiles, in situ Raman and XPS spectra, and the oxygen vacancy formation energies from DFT calculation results, the reduction of VO bonds including VO, VOV and VOZr can be facilitated by the specific interaction between VOx and ZrO2. The MgOZrO2 nanocomposite support with an optimal Mg/Zr ratio promotes the high dispersion of active VOx species for increasing both the activity and stability in the EDH reaction at 700 C.142 Fig. 17 (a) Catalytic PDH reaction rate of VOx/ZrO2 with different V loading.

Porous supports are employed to localize VOx species by providing the specific VOx-support interactions through their unique properties. The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) possess a well-defined 3D center-radial mesopore structure and a large pore diameter, allowing the isolated VO4 active sites to highly disperse with an appropriate concentration and facile accessibility and improving the internal diffusion of the relevant reactants.143 For mesoporous Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts, the higher crystallization temperature for Al2O3 supports prefers to form the polymerized VOx species, which are more active and stable than the isolated ones for the PDH reaction.144 Nonetheless, a crystallization temperature at 100 C also leads to an enhanced surface acidity for increased amount and graphitization degree of the deposited coke species. A 3 wt% V/SiBeta catalyst containing isolated VOx species in monolayer exhibits 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity at 600 C and 4000 mL g1 h1.145 The optimal catalytic activity is contributed to the maximum amount of the acid sites that originate from the VOSi bridges in the entirely monomeric VOx catalyst supported on the Si-beta zeolites. The porous VOx-doped SiO2 catalysts can be obtained via a one-step hydrothermal synthesis, and their structure and catalytic PDH performance can be regulated by proceeding the gelation and calcination at proper temperatures.146 For the 60-VOxSiO2-580 catalyst (60 and 580 represent the temperature of gelation and calcination, respectively), the propane conversion shows a decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h PDH reaction, and the propylene selectivity remains 91% over eight cycles of reaction and regeneration. Furthermore, the reducibility of VOx species is similar for the fresh and regenerated catalysts, while the amount of the deposited coke remains constant for the spent catalyst after the first and the eighth cycles. By changing the vanadium precursors such as ammonium meta-vanadate (NH4VO3; VO3, and V5+), vanadium acetylacetonate [V(acac)3; organic complex, V3+], and vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4; VO2+, and V4+), the structureperformance relationship of the porous VOxSiO2 catalysts can be further optimized.147 The multiple effect of the hydroxyl groups exists in the synthesis of the VOx catalysts and in the VOx-catalyzed DH reactions. During the catalyst preparation stage, the OH groups can serve as effective anchoring sites for the V-precursors to achieve the good dispersion of VOx species on the supports. On the other hand, the detrimental OH groups can also be formed in the pre-reduction of VOx catalysts by H2 feed gas and coexist with the reduced V4+ and/or V3+ sites.148 The presence of surface OH groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are proved to be strongly connected with the intrinsic PDH activity and the coke formation process, based on the results of the in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations.149 The density of surface OH groups can be increased by increasing H2 reduction time, and both the initial activity and relative deactivation rate are negatively related with the OH density (Fig. 18a and b). To further reveal the roles of OH groups in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reactions, three models of γ-Al2O3-supported dimer V2OxHy are constructed for comparatively analyzing, and V2O5, V2O5H2 and V2O3 stand for different pretreated catalyst structures, respectively (Fig. 18c). The OH group in the V2O5H2 structure does not directly participate in the propane CH bond cleavage; however, it leads to the highest reaction energy barrier in comparison with the non-reduced V2O5 and fully reduced V2O3 structures (Fig. 18d). Furthermore, the existing OH group can block the exposure of V ions for enhancing the desorption of propylene and preventing the formation of coke species, and consequently reducing the catalytic activity but promoting the stability.

In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction.150 For monomer, dimer and crystalline VOx species supported on Al2O3, their VO groups initially contribute to the formation of H2O and CH3CO*CH3 intermediates in the ODH stage. After the loss of the VO group, the non-oxidative DH pathway commences to take the dominant place over AlOV sites, suggesting the high reactivity of VO with propane molecule in comparison with the bridged and low-coordinated V sites.
2.2.3. GaOx The Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites are employed as bifunctional catalysts in the commercial manufacturing process of the propane aromatization reaction.151 It is believed that the Ga-relevant sites are responsible for the propane dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites catalyze the further transformation reactions of propylene into aromatics including oligomerization and deep dehydrogenation. The product distribution depends on the structural constitution of both sites, and propylene can be selectively produced by the Ga-based catalysts containing few acid sites.152 In the case of the most heavily investigated Ga-ZSM-5 systems, various types of Ga-involved sites exist and have been proposed to be capable of selective activation of CH bonds of ethane and propane, for instance, GaOx clusters in the channels, isolated Ga3+, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+ and [Ga2O2]+ on the framework or extra-framework of the zeolites.153159
According to the examination results of the free energies for the alkane dehydrogenation reactions over Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites, [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ serve as the stable Ga cationic species in the reduced catalyst, showing higher activity in comparison with the isolated Brnsted acid site and the Ga+ site. [GaH]2+ is the most active dehydrogenation site, due to the enthalpic stabilization effect of CH cleavage transition states (TSs) via alkyl and carbenium dehydrogenation routes.160 The kinetic results demonstrate that [GaH]2+ cations in the Ga/H-MFI zeolite display two orders of magnitude higher TOF for PDH relative to cracking, and one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding TOFs over the Ga-free H-MFI zeolite.161 The dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are both accomplished through the heterolytic dissociation at [GaH]2+ sites to form [C3H7GaH]+H+ cation pairs. The reaction rates for these two pathways are weakly dependent on the temperature (Fig. 19a, b and d, e), and their reaction rate ratio is independent of C3H8 and H2 partial pressures (Fig. 19c and f). The β-H elimination from the C3H7 fragment is identified as the rate-determining step for the PDH pathway, while the attack of CC bond in the same propyl fragment by the Brnsted acid sites is regarded as the rate-determining step for cracking. In view of the reaction between hydrogen and [GaH]2+ cations to form [GaH2]+-H+ cation pairs, an inhibition effect is observed on both dehydrogenation and cracking of propane.

By regulating the ratio of Ga/Al for the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the distribution of Ga+, Brnsted acid sites and GaOx species can be controlled, and GaOx clusters are formed at high Ga/Al ratios (>1/2), while a 1/1 ratio of Ga+ to Brnsted acid sites is achieved at a Ga/Al ratio with 1/2 for creating a LewisBrnsted acid pair.162 The 1/2 Ga/Al Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst with predominant acid pairs displays an activity more than 300 times higher than the catalyst with isolated Brnsted acid sites only and the catalyst with GaOx species only. A bifunctional PDH mechanism is proposed based on the kinetic data and theoretical calculation results. The strong Lewis acid [GaH]2+ generated from protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site coordinates with the basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted acid site, heterolytically activating the CH bond of propane with a lower intrinsic enthalpy. The presence of the Brnsted acid site also sharply reduces the energy barrier for the monomolecular elimination of H2 by recombination with a hydride.
The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during the synthesis of the gallosilicate MFI zeolites causes significantly increased content of the strong Lewis acid sites and a higher ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, for enhancing the PDH activity and propylene selectivity.163 The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst.164 The diffusion-limitation issue does not exist in either catalyst, whereas a considerably increased content of the Lewis acid sites is observed on the hierarchical catalyst compared with the bulk one. MPS additive-caused promotion effect on the PDH performance is also observed on these hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts.
The PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2 and Al2O3 supports are also investigated, and the active sites depend on the character of the support and the synthesis method. The hydrothermal-prepared Ga-incorporated beta zeolites with high Si/Ga ratios are reported to be more active in the catalytic PDH reaction relative to the low-silica or Na-modified Ga-beta zeolites as well as the impregnated Ga catalyst on dealuminated beta zeolite, due to the large microporosity and the presence of Brnsted acidity.165 GaH-beta zeolite and GaSiO2 catalysts are synthesized by grafting surface organometallic Ga species onto the supports, and similar XANES spectra for these two catalysts are observed under reducing conditions at high temperatures, which are attributed to the three-coordinate gallium alkyl species.153 These results suggest that the Ga3+ alkyls and hydride intermediates may be mechanistically involved in the CH activation in PDH reactions, and the Ga3+ state is stable that unlikely reduces into Ga+. The different support effects between Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Ga/SiO2 catalysts prepared by grafting Ga(i-Bu)3 are comparatively analyzed by spectral characterizations.166 Mononuclear Ga species exist as the major surface organometallic sites in Ga/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through selective protonolysis of the precursor at individual hydroxyl groups, whereas dinuclear Ga2 species dominate in Ga/SiO2 catalysts due to the transfer of the isobutyl group to the Si site combining with the protonolysis process (Fig. 20). Considering that the AlOGa bond facilitates the heterolytic activation of propane CH bond, the mononuclear Ga1 sites supported on γ-Al2O3 display a significantly higher PDH activity than the dinuclear Ga2Ox sites on SiO2. For the modified Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ba, the high dispersion state of β-Ga2O3 species on the α-Al2O3 is confirmed to be independent of the presence of Ba additives, and the tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites are covered with Ba atoms.167 The Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with 0.10 Ba/Ga ratio displays a high catalytic activity, 98% selectivity and low carbon formation on catalytic EDH reaction even in the presence of steam. The DFT calculation results of the EDH and PDH reactions on the Ga-doped and undoped γ-Al2O3(100) models demonstrate that the Ga modification can significantly improve the catalytic activity through the concerted and stepwise mechanisms with decreased CH activation energy barriers.168 The surface acidbase property of the GaAl2O3 catalysts determines the binding energy of dissociated hydrogen, which serves as a descriptor to predict the overall dehydrogenation reaction rates.

2.3. Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx- and Sn/SnOx-based catalysts
2.3.1. Co and CoOx For the Co-catalyzed activation and functionalization of CH bonds in the hydrocarbons, such as direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and cycloalkanes, their development has achieved notable success.169 The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes.170176 The structureperformance relationships of Co-based DH catalysts are reviewed and their corresponding possible reaction mechanisms are also discussed in this section (Table 5).

Combined structural characterizations, kinetic analyses and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the PDH processes over the single-site, high-spin, tetrahedral Co2+ species on SiO2 supports.177,178 These Co2+ sites can be prepared by grafting either with CoIII(NH3)6Cl3 or with CoIII(HMDS)2(THF) as the precursor and sequent thermal treatments. As evidenced by the in situ XAS and ex situ EPR and Raman spectral results, the structure and state of the isolated Co2+ on SiO2 are stable against the oxidation by air and the reduction by H2 or propane. A complete selective dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene includes the activation of CH bonds in propane molecules through a heterolytic cleavage across a CoOsupport bond without Co2+ redox and the sequent β-hydride elimination (Fig. 21). The formation of alkyl radicals by abstracting a proton may not occur during the Co2+/SiO2-catalyzed PDH reaction, leading to a fairly high selectivity to propylene. Nonetheless, at a high reaction temperature, the HH bond activation and the propylene hydrogenation may still be realized by the same active sites.

The structure and catalytic properties of Co2+-exchanged H-ZSM-5 catalysts have also been discussed for the dehydrogenation of alkanes.179,180 The predominant Co2+OCo2+ dimers and a small amount of Co2+ monomers coexist in the H-ZSM-5 zeolites, bridging two next-nearest neighbor Al sites. The detailed kinetics analyses demonstrate that the rate constant of propane dehydrogenation increases with increasing Co/Al ratio, because the Co cations are responsible for both dissociative adsorption and recombinative desorption of hydrogen. On the other hand, the rate constant of propane CC cracking is related to the zeolite acid sites but not to the Co sites. For the EDH reactions over CoOx catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolites with low Si/Al ratios, the highly dispersed Co2+ species are considered as the active sites to efficiently achieve the adsorptive dissociation and activation of ethane, whereas the metallic Co0 sites that originate from the Co2+ reduction result in the catalyst deactivation.181 Higher catalytic activity and propylene selectivity are obtained on the Zr-modified Co2+/SiO2 catalyst rather than the non-modified one in the PDH reaction at 550 C.182 The isolated Zr sites on SiO2 are created by organometallic synthesis using Zr(OBu)4 as a precursor, while the isolated tetrahedral Co2+ ions are anchored by the Zr-involved sites (e.g., SiOZrO) through strong electrostatic adsorption. Due to the well-tuned oxygen donation ability and CoO bond strength, the heterolytic CH cleavage can easily occur. For the Co-contained cluster sites supported on Zr-based nodes (MOF-type NU-1000 support), their CH activation ability can be regulated by the doping of a second metal.183 These bimetallic CoM (M = Ag, Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ti and Mo) oxide clusters consist of oxygen atoms connecting to a Co atom and an M atom, exhibiting distinct differences in the spin density and positive partial charge of the bridge oxygen during the reactions. In view of the diversity in the hydrogen-abstracting and alkane-adsorption abilities among these CoOM clusters, the energy barrier for the propane CH activation varies from 56.9 to 9.3 kcal mol1.The isolated Co2+ or highly dispersed Co0 sites on Al2O3 support show high propylene selectivity and high initial activity for the PDH reactions, suggesting that the state of Co species play a critical role.184190 For the Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with cobalt nitrate, the Co loading at lower levels (<10%) results in the formation of the surface CoAl spinel with tetrahedral Co2+ ions that contribute to selectively activating the CH bonds of propane and to producing propylene.184 However, the Co/Al2O3 catalysts with a higher Co loading of >10% consist of only large Co3O4 assemblies that can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles to cause dramatically serious side-reactions including CC cracking and coking (Fig. 22). Specifically, these large Co0 grains in the reduced catalysts can be reoxidized during a post-treatment under mild conditions, and transformed into the highly disperse metallic Co0 on the Al2O3 surface for consequently enhancing the propylene selectivity.185 The presence of sulfate species has been proved to promote the dispersion of the active CoOx sites on Al2O3 surfaces and suppresses the reduction into metallic Co0 sites through the interaction between SO42 and Co species.186 Fig. 22 Schematic representation of the relationship between the Co-related site state and reaction pathway for the PDH reaction. Reprinted from ref. 184, copyright 2015, with permission from Springer.The Al2O3 morphology can significantly affect the structure and the catalytic property of the isolated Co2+ ions as the active sites. For instance, these Co2+ sites exist in the mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalysts that are prepared by a one-step evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method, displaying 80% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction and TOF values of 5.1 and 23.0 h1 at 550 and 600 C, respectively.187 Providing different interactions, three types of Al2O3 supports including nano-sheets (NSs), nano-fibers (NFs) and nano-plates (NPs) with different distributions of Lewis acidity are employed to localize Co species through wetness impregnation.188 A stronger interaction between Co and Al2O3-NS rather than Al2O3-NF and Al2O3-NP is observed. The tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ sites in the Co/Al2O3-NS catalyst lead to a high propylene selectivity, whereas the metallic Co species originating from the easily reduced Co3O4 species that exist in the Co/Al2O3-NP catalyst are responsible for the formation of C12 by-products and coke. A strong interaction between the Co/Al2O3-NS catalyst and propylene at 550 C is also evidenced by the in situ DRIFT spectral analyses, and nonetheless, a lower coking reaction rate and a low graphitization degree for the deposited coke are observed on the Co/Al2O3-NS catalyst. The doping of iron into the CoOx species supported on the Al2O3 nanosheets can further promote the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity of the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction, which benefits from the strong interaction between Fe and the oxygen ligand for weakening the π domination of oxygen into the adjacent Co site as well as from the prohibition effect on the reduction of Co2+ sites.189 The synergistic effect of the active Co2+ sites and the coordinately unsaturated Alcus sites may also contribute to the enhanced PDH activity.The tetrahedral Co2+ species in isolation state can also be stabilized by γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with <6 nm thickness through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis, and this CoAl2O3-HT catalyst exhibits a high specific activity of >16 mmol g1 h1 with >97% C3H6 selectivity in the PDH reaction at 590 C.190 Striking contrasts exist with respect to the structure and catalytic properties of the CoAl2O3-HT catalyst and the Co/Al2O3-IMP as the reference catalyst that is prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The 5 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles disperse on the surface of the Al2O3 support for the Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, whereas the Co2+ ions embed into the Al2O3 matrix and occupy the tetrahedral Al3+ sites to form a local spinel structure. These Co2+ sites in the CoAl2O3-HT catalyst are structurally stable against the reductive and PDH reaction atmospheres due to the strong stabilization effect from the Al2O3 matrix. Lower apparent activation energy, lower amount of coke, and easier desorption of propylene are observed on CoAl2O3-HT than Co/Al2O3-IMP (Fig. 23AC), resulting in a high propylene selectivity and a high anti-coking stability. As the Co loading increases for the CoAl2O3-HT catalysts, the transformation of isolated Co2+ to aggregated CoOx nanoparticle occurs (Fig. 23DF), which leads to the severe coke formation and structural change of CoOx sites during the PDH reactions. The effects of Si-additive modification on the Co2+Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated.191 The Si addition introduces a number of Brnsted acid sites without changing the nano-sheet structure and tetrahedral Co2+ coordination. The Si-modified catalyst displays an enhanced PDH stability in comparison with the unmodified catalyst, due to a relatively lower graphitization degree of the coke species and a higher proportion of the highly reactive coke species toward hydrogenation and methanation reactions. It is also found that the co-fed propylene regulates the coking reaction rate but not the coke distribution, suggesting that the interaction with propylene determines the anti-coking stability of Co2+-based PDH catalysts.Fig. 23 (A) Apparent activation energy for PDH reaction, (B) TGA analyses, and (C) C3H6-TPD profiles of hydrothermal CoAl2O3-HT and impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalysts with 5 wt% Co loading.

Reprinted from ref. 190, copyright 2019, with permission from Elsevier.The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions, and the optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Sibeta catalyst displays 57% initial conversion and 96% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 600 C.192 The highly dispersed CoOx species are anchored on the vacant T-sites (with silanols) of Sibeta zeolite in the as-obtained catalyst, and the transformation of these reducible CoOx into the metallic Co can easily occur during the PDH reactions.
2.3.2. Fe and FeOx Al2O3-supported Fe and Fe2+ species obtained from the pre-reduction of the 10FeAl catalyst by CO or H2 are catalytically active and selective for PDH reactions, because of the elimination of the surface electronegative oxygen species that are responsible for suppressing the propylene cracking and the formation of coke species.193 The modification of Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with P-additives promotes the activity in the PDH reactions, and the 1Fe:P/Al2O3 catalyst displays >80% propylene selectivity and a 19 h1 TOF value.194 The metallic Fe0 species exist in the catalyst with a low propylene selectivity during the initial reaction stage, and sequentially transform into the iron carbide species in the further steady-state reaction, which contribute to high selectivity and activity. It should be noted that the FexC phase is also observed in the spent 10FeAl catalyst after the PDH reactions.193 The sulfated Al2O3-supported Fe2O3 catalysts with specific interaction through FeOS bonds are reported to be active in the PDH reactions due to the enhanced adsorption ability of propane.195,196 Nevertheless, an irreversible deactivation issue remains in view of the reduction and loss of the functional sulfate species. A superior performance of the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst than that of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst is observed in the hydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.197 The metallic Fe0 sites are formed from the reduction of oxide during the EDH reaction, while the carburized iron species are also generated to serve as more stable active sites. A relatively weak surface acidity and a weak binding strength of ethylene on Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts facilitate the desorption of ethylene for suppressing the deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.
The isolated framework Fe2+ in MFI-type zeolites is proved to be the active site responsible for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of ethane and propane.198200 The H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst after mild calcination at 753 K possesses framework Fe species as the most important sites.198 These Fe species migrate to extra-framework positions during steaming at 700 oC, which also serve as the active sites for the PDH reactions. The H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Fe ratio of 26 shows high propylene selectivity, when the propylene formation rate is 20 times higher than the cracking reaction rate, whereas the H-[Al]ZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 26 exhibits a lower propylene selectivity so that the ratio of dehydrogenation to cracking is as low as 0.36. In spite of structural similarity between H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Al]ZSM-5, their reactions proceed through different catalytic mechanisms. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is kinetically favored over the CC cracking over the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst due to the lower stability of ethene radical cations relative to propylene radical cations.199 A modified hydrothermal synthesis using the coordinated complex of ethylenediaminetetraacetic iron (Fe-EDTA) produces zeolite-supported Fe catalyst (FeS-1-EDTA) with isolated Feδ+ sites incorporated into the pure-silica silicalite-1 frameworks.200 Benefiting from the easy desorption property of ethylene and hydrogen products and the good anti-coking ability, the optimal FeS-1-EDTA catalyst displays great stability with 26.3% conversion and over 97.5% selectivity in 200 h of ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 600 oC.
Employing the SOMC method using a precursor of Fe(oCp)2 (bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(ii)) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment, SiO2-supported isolate and stable FeII species in three coordination are constructed as the active sites for selectively catalyzing the PDH reaction through a non-redox mechanism.201 With >99% propylene selectivity, the specific reaction rate is maintained at 3.13.9 × 104 s1 within 18 h of reaction. Either the supported metallic Fe(0) or FeOx nanoparticles can be obtained via the grafting procedure, and nonetheless, these sites exhibit relatively low activities and propylene selectivity. A sulfated Fe/SiO2 catalyst containing 5 wt% SO42 and 20 wt% Fe by impregnation synthesis is adopted in the PDH reaction with co-feeding of H2S gas.202 The Fe1-xS phase is considered as the active site for the reaction and its structural stability can be promoted by the co-fed H2S.
2.3.3. Sn and SnOx The promotion effects of Sn species in Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts through the geometric and electronic modifications have been widely studied since 1960s, as discussed in the previous sections. However, Sn alone can play the role of the active sites in the dehydrogenation reactions instead of the promoters (Table 5).203207 The metallic Sn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits comparable performance to those of KCr2O3/Al2O3 and KPtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts for PDH reactions.203 To introduce Pd species as a hydrogenation-active promoter and an anchor can further enhance the anti-coking ability and structural stability of the active Sn species. The SnPd/SiO2 catalyst retains 90% propylene selectivity, 35% conversion, and stable activity for 168 h without regeneration in the PDH reaction at 600 C and 120 h1 gas space velocity. In addition to the metallic Sn sites, the isolated or polymeric Sn2+ sites are also active for the PDH reactions. For the SnO2/SiO2 catalyst, the crystalline SnO2 is fully reduced to metallic Sn after high-temperature reduction by H2, whereas the isolated Sn2+ species can be stabilized by their strong interactions with SiO2 matrix. These isolated Sn2+ sites exhibit higher activity and stability than the metallic Sn0 sites for the PDH reaction.204 The stabilization of Sn species can also be achieved by the incorporation of the hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) support through the inhibition effect of the reduction of Sn2+-to-Sn0 due to the strong SnOSi bonds.205 The Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits significantly higher propane conversion of approximately 40% and better long-term stability of up to 170 h, even after three cycles of 600 C PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration (Fig. 24). Such a strong interaction is also observed on Sn-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Sn-DMSN) catalysts, contributing to the high stability of the PDH catalysts.206 The highly dispersed SnOx species show a superior activity than that of the polymetric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species in the Sn-DMSNs-catalyzed PDH reactions. For the NiSn/SiO2 catalyst, polymeric Sn2+ species and the Ni3Sn2 alloy nanoparticles coexist. The former species are active for the PDH to propylene, while the latter species act as a promoter for accelerating the hydrogen desorption and facilitating the regeneration of active Sn2+ sites.207

2.4. ZnOx-Based catalysts
Either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as illustrated in Table 6. The high-silica zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters show over 90% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions. The dealuminated beta zeolite consists of a large amount of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, providing the hostguest interaction for constraining massive small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the zeolite frameworks rather than being located on the external surfaces. These highly dispersed ZnO species with the absence of the strong acid sites in the dealuminated beta zeolite contribute to the high selectivity for propylene.208 As the supports for the small ZnO cluster catalysts in the PDH reactions, the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high Si/Al ratio of 250 leads to higher propylene selectivity and stability than those with lower ratios (3080).209 By encapsulating 24 nm ZnO nanoparticles into a N-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from the carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) on the silicalite-1 support, the composite ZnO@NC/S-1 catalyst shows >90% propylene selectivity at 44.4% conversion in the PDH reaction at 600 C.210 The presence of the NC layer protects the ZnO species from sintering and volatilization even at a high temperature of 700 C. Considering that the NC layer may be oxidized in the catalyst regeneration stage and lose the functions, the treatment parameters for the coke removal need to be optimized. A ZnNb2O6 phase, which is prepared by controlling the calcination temperature and the ratio between ZnO and Nb2O5 precursors, displays 84% propylene selectivity at 28.1% conversion in the PDH reaction at 600 C due to a synergetic effect with ZnO species.211 However, both the coking issue and the loss of ZnO sites through the transformation into the Zn3Nb2O8 phase cause the fast reversible deactivation of the catalyst. In a ZnOx catalyst supported on rutile TiO2 for the selective PDH reactions, the small Zn1-3Ox cluster with 13 Zn atoms rather than the rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase is identified as the active site.212 The modification with ZrO2 additives inhibits the formation of the detrimental ZnTiO3 phase, and contributes to enhance the intrinsic activity, which benefits from the stronger interaction of ZnOx with ZrO2 relative to that with the TiO2 support. It is also found that a trace amount of platinum (0.1 wt %) has profound enhancement effects on the catalytic PDH performance of ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts with improved CH activation and hydrogen desorption through increasing the Lewis acidity of Zn2+.213 Table 6 Comparison of the catalytic DH performances of various Zn- and Zr-based catalysts Catalyst Temp.

On the other hand, the nano-crystallite ZnO modifies the HY zeolite by completely eliminating the Brnsted acid sites but increasing the content of the strong Lewis acid sites, showing a higher propylene selectivity than the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst. If the fabrication of Zn species is performed for only 1 or 2 ALD cycles, isolated Zn(OH)+ sites dominate in the catalysts, displaying a higher catalytic activity for the propane conversion. It has been also reported that the Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and ion exchange (IE) consist of extra-framework Zn species with a high heterogeneity degree, including isolated Zn2+ cations, multinuclear oxygenate clusters and bulk ZnO aggregates, while the catalyst prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) predominantly contains isolated Zn2+ ions that originate from the reduction of the [ZnCH3]+ product in the stoichiometric reaction between the Brnsted acid protons and dimethyl zinc.215 The isolated Zn2+ sites exhibit lower activity than the clustered oxygenated zinc species in the PDH reactions, and nonetheless, they can be transformed into the highly dispersed oxygenated complexes with enhanced initial activity either through an oxidation pretreatment before the reaction or through co-feeding of steam at a moderate concentration during the reaction. These complexes are significantly active compared with the agglomerated ZnO species for the PDH reactions.The ethane dehydrogenation catalyzed by three types of the isolated Zn cations in HZSM-5, which are assumed to mainly exist in the Zn2+ ion-exchanged catalysts, is also modeled by the theoretical calculations.216 The Zn2+ in the vicinity of paired Al centers possesses the lowest free energy in the ethane CH activation in comparison with those of Zn(OH)+ and ZnH+ in the vicinity of one isolated Al site, due to the assisting role of the second Al center through generating a basic framework oxygen center to participate in the reaction. For the Zn(OH)+ and ZnH+ models lacking the second Al center, the transformation of the stable ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ intermediates with a higher energy barrier cannot further proceed, causing the dehydrogenation reaction to be blocked.In addition to the single-site Zn2+ in the zeolite frameworks, those onto SiO2 and ZrO2 matrixes are also catalytically active in the PDH reactions.217219 For instance, a 4 wt% Zn/TiZrOx catalyst displays a propylene yield of 1.25 kgC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at a propane conversion of 30% with a propylene selectivity of 95% in the PDH reaction at 550 C.217 The isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+ species rather than the Zrcus sites are identified as the active sites, which also show a low ability of coke formation for allowing the catalyst to extend the service life. An increased degree of ZnOx agglomeration causes a higher rate of coking reaction. Furthermore, the structure of Zn2+-containing ZrO2 catalysts is determined by the crystallinity of ZrO2 and the dopant (e.g., Ce, La, Ti or Y), and the promotion effect of Ti additives may be owing to the optimized ZrO2 crystal size and the accelerated hydrogen formation and desorption in the PDH reaction.The tetrahedral Zn(ii) ions chemisorbed into the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous SiO2 surfaces can turn to the three-coordinate active center with Lewis acidity through losing one ZnO bond during the PDH reaction.218 The single-site Zn(ii) shows a high propylene selectivity, which benefits from a low energy barrier for the heterolytic CH activation through a non-redox mechanism and a high barrier for the undesired CC cleavage (Fig. 25). The alkyl-zinc and ZnO-type sites in Zn/SiO2 systems are prepared by one-cycle ALD synthesis using diethyl zinc precursor, and their difference in the PDH performance are investigated.219 The tricoordinate ethyl zinc-silica sites exhibit a higher activity in comparison with the tetracoordinate zinc oxide-type center, while the ethyl-zinc activation follows multiple pathways such as protonation or direct hydrogenolysis.Fig. 25 Schematic representation of the proposed catalytic PDH reaction on SiO2-supported Lewis acidic Zn SA site (free energies are in kcal mol1).

2.5. ZrOx-Based catalysts
ZrO2-based catalysts show catalytic activities for the CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions (Table 6). The coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located on the top of an ideal flat surface are identified as the main active sites for the PDH reactions, and their concentration can be regulated by varying the kind of the supported hydrogenation-active metals such as Cu, Ru and Rh, and by doping with promoters such as Li, Ca, Mg, Cu, Sm, La and Y.220224 The intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites is reported to be related to their unsaturation degree, depending on the oxygen-removal amount from the catalyst. For instance, the highest degrees of removal of surface oxygen for bare YZrOx and LaZrOx are less than 0.1% under a reduction temperature of 650 C, whereas greatly higher values were found for the Ru-modified 0.05Ru/YZrOx and 0.05Ru/LaZrOx, which are 11.0% and 13.0%, respectively.221 Such oxygen removal is generally accomplished through two processes due to the high mobility of oxygen species. When a certain amount of surface oxygen vacancies is achieved, a part of the bulk lattice oxygen species diffuse to the surface for filling the vacancies until a balance between migration and reduction (Fig. 26a and b) is reached. The catalytic stability obtained on these modified ZrOx-based catalysts is comparable with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in 60 cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration in a temperature range from 550 to 625 C (Fig. 26c). The doping of Cu as a promoter and not as an active site into the ZrO2 matrix is also reported to improve the creation of more active Zrcus sites, and the optimal CuZrO-8 catalyst displays over 98% propylene selectivity and 0.47 mmolC3H8 g1 min1 initial reaction rate in the PDH reaction at 600 C.223 For the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, both increased content of Zrcus sites by the Rh loading and improved hydrogen desorption ability achieved by Rh-relevant sites are responsible for its enhanced initial activity.224 Nonetheless, high Rh loading is unfavorable because it can disturb the desorption of propylene and hydrogen from Rh sites.

The synergistic effect between CrOx and ZrOx in bulk binary CrZrOx oxides has also been proved as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts. These CrZrOx oxides are different from the CrOx catalysts on ZrOx-based supports that are discussed in Section 2.2.1 CrOx-based catalysts. For instance, the binary CrZrOx catalyst displays a superior stability than the supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalyst, suggesting that bulk promoting of ZrO2 with Cr is advantageous over simple deposition of CrOx on the LaZrOx surface.225 The XPS results of the Cr10Zr90Ox and Cr5Zr95Ox samples demonstrate an extremely low concentration of Cr on the surfaces, indicating that Cr species are nearly completely incorporated into the ZrO2 matrix forming a solid solution structure.226 The enrichment of Zr species on the catalyst surface contributes to enhancing the dehydrogenation activity and excluding the reaction route catalyzed by the conventional Cr-relevant sites. Two neighboring Zrcus sites in CrZrOx oxides are concluded to be catalytically active for the PDH reactions, and their distribution is determined by the interaction among Cr, Zr, and support, as well as by the ZrO2 crystal size.227 The Cr promotes improved reducibility of ZrO2 and content of the anion vacancies for CrZrOx oxides, thus increasing the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites in comparison with that of the Cr-free ZrO2 catalyst. In addition, SiO2 serves as a more preferable support than Al2O3 or TiO2, because of its relatively lower interaction with CrOx species. For the SiO2-supported CrZrOx-based catalysts with the same Cr contents, their ZrO2 crystallinity can be carefully regulated by thermal treatment at different temperatures, and a higher crystallinity of ZrO2 can promote the concentration of the active sites, and nonetheless, the reaction rates for propylene formation and coking are both increased to the same extent.228 To further improve the anti-coking stability of CrZrOx catalysts in the PDH reactions, the modification with combined basic Cs and acidic P promoters is proved useful to inhibit the oligomerization of two neighboring propylenes by isolating the active sites.229 The optimally designed defective ZrO2 catalyst without the usage of any dopant or supported species shows industrially relevant activity and durability in the PDH reaction at 550 C, which is superior to those of commonly used Pt, CrOx, GaOx or VOx species.230 About 40 ZrO2 samples with different particle sizes and nanostructures have been evaluated in the PDH reactions, and their propylene formation rate decreases by a factor of up to 70 when the size increases from 7 to 45 nm. If the lattice oxygen species of ZrO2 are removed through reduction with H2 or CO, the reaction rate can be significantly increased (Fig. 27a and b), suggesting that the promoted PDH activity depends on the increased concentration of the active Zrcus sites. The catalytic role of the Zrcus sites is further investigated by DFT calculations of the PDH reaction over oxygen-defective d-ZrO2(11) and stoichiometric s-ZrO2(11) surfaces with monoclinic phase. Based on the Gibbs free energy profiles (Fig. 27ce), for the activation of methylene CH bond, a ZrO pair site of s-ZrO2(11) is found to be the most favorable center through a heterolytic route, whereas it is a homolytic step that occurred on two adjacent Zr cations of d-ZrO2(11) without involving lattice oxygen. A 1.09 eV lower CH activation barrier is obtained in the presence of the oxygen vacancy on the d-ZrO2 (11) facet relative to the s-ZrO2(11) facet. For the further step of a PDH reaction, the transformation of the Zr-iso-C3H7 and H-O intermediate for producing propylene and hydrogen, their apparent free energy barriers over the d-ZrO2 (11) facet are lower than those over the s-ZrO2(11) facet, thus indicating that these two key steps are affected by the Zrcus sites. According to combined experimental observations and theoretical calculation results, the Zrcus sites in the tetragonal ZrO2 phase are also catalytically active in the PDH reactions, and both the selectivity and the generation rate of propylene increase with a decrease in the crystallite size of the tetragonal ZrO2.231 The Zrcus sites in the monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 show similar intrinsic activities through homolytic breaking of propane CH bonds, and nevertheless the monoclinic ZrO2 displays a higher propylene selectivity relative to the tetragonal ZrO2 due to a higher ratio of the Zrcus sites to those coking sites.

2.6. Other catalysts
Several noble metals, non-noble transition metals and metal oxides are reported as the active, selective and stable PDH catalysts. The monometallic Rh catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 favours the formation of methane as the primary product and larger amount of coke species, exhibiting a low conversion of 10.7% and a propylene selectivity of only 25.4% in the PDH reaction at 600 C.232 The Sn additive in the bimetallic Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst plays a critical role in suppressing the coke deposition and cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates, displaying an enhanced PDH performance of 30.8% conversion and 96.3% selectivity under identical conditions. The GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) on Al2O3 are one kind of newly emerging catalysts.233,234 At a selected PDH reaction temperature of 550 C, the Ga/Rh ratios of 25 and 34 lead to the formation of a mixture of intermetallic GaRh compounds and a liquid Ga-rich GaRh alloy, while over 80 ratios induce the formation of pure liquid droplets of GaRh alloy. The entirely liquid alloy with a highly dynamic interface shows a significant enhancement in both catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, which may be due to the maximum distribution of the single Rh atoms at the liquid/gas interface. Based on the DFT calculation results, the propane CH activation and following hydride recombination are catalyzed by the SA Rh site, and the propyl intermediate transfers to the Ga surface to synergistically accomplish a PDH cycle. DFT calculation predictions indicate that two-dimensional Ru-phthalocyanine (Ru-Pc) may be a potential SA catalyst for the selective PDH reaction in view of the high CH activation ability of SA Ru and weak π-binding interaction between Ru and propylene.235 The SiO2-supported Ru2P and RuP nanoparticles are prepared using H3PO4 as the P precursor for the PDH reactions.236 Increased P levels reduce the energy of the Ru 4d orbitals that form Ru-adsorbate bonds for weakening the adsorption of propylene and hydrogen, and therefore enhances the propylene selectivity of the catalysts. The optimal RuP catalyst with a MnP-type structure exhibits 91% selectivity at 25% propane conversion.
The PDH reactions over PdCu SAA and cluster surfaces are revealed by the DFT calculation results with respect to the activation of CH bond, the desorption of propylene, and the formation of key intermediates.237239 The doping of SA Pd into the Cu(111) surface leads to a low energy barrier for the CH bond activation and the facile coupling and desorption of hydrogen. A great difference in the energies between propylene desorption and further transformation pathways benefits a high propylene selectivity. The IR and Raman spectra of the relevant reactive intermediates considering two potential pathways are further simulated for the PdCu SAAs-catalyzed PDH reaction. The catalytic PDH performances of SiO2-supported Pd and Pd3Fe nanoparticles with similar 2 nm sizes are compared at 510 C.240 The propylene selectivity is 45% and 94%, while the specific reaction rate is 0.04 and 0.2 s1 for the monometallic Pd and the bimetallic Pd3Fe catalysts, respectively. The enhanced property is contributed to the isolation effect of the inert Fe atoms on the active Pt atoms and to the decreased energy of the Pd 4d orbits for weakening the adsorbate bond energies.
The surface isolated [InH2]+ ions in CHA zeolite are prepared via a reductive solid-state ion-exchange methodology, acting as the active sites for the selective EDH reaction through concerted and alkyl mechanisms.241 The [InH2]+-contained In-CHA catalyst displays 27% conversion and 97% ethylene selectivity for a 90 h reaction at 660 C. The formation of the zeolite-coordinated protons and carbenium intermediate species is suppressed on the [InH2]+ sites, which is beneficial for enhanced ethylene selectivity and anti-coking stability.
The P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts are reported for the EDH reactions.242 The P species may interact with the framework Al to form SAPO-like interfaces for reducing the acidic properties and changing the channel texture of the zeolite. They also provide the specific interaction with Mo for prohibiting the reduction of Mo and improving the dispersion of Mo. The greatly increased ethylene selectivity and activity are achieved in the presence of 1 wt% of P additives in the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, while enhanced stability is obtained on the 2.5 wt% P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst.
The Ni(111)-catalyzed PDH and side reactions are theoretically studied with DFT calculations.243 Since different adsorption energies are observed, the adsorption of propane and propylene is physisorption and chemisorption, respectively. For the facile first CH activation, the formation of 1-propyl intermediate is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than that of the 2-propyl intermediate. However, the strong adsorption of propylene results in the deep dehydrogenation for a low PDH selectivity. Unlike the Ni(111) site, the SiO2-supported tetrahedral Ni(ii) phosphosilicate SA site affords a propylene selectivity of 90% in the PDH reaction at 600 C.244 The NiOSi bond is responsible for the propane CH activation, while the NiOP bond prevents the reduction of Ni(ii) to Ni(0), and therefore this Ni-P/SiO2 catalyst shows a high catalytic PDH property. Electrochemical EDH processes using Ni-contained proton-conducting solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEs) have been developed recently, and 75% conversion and 100% ethylene selectivity can be achieved at 700 C and 0.8 V voltage using a NiCu-doped Nb-Ti-MnO anode.245,246 The defective TiO2 has been reported as a catalytically active catalyst for the PDH reaction, while the fourfold-coordinated Ti atoms surrounding oxygen vacancies are believed to be the main active sites.247,248 For the nanosized anatase TiO2, its oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations (Ticus) can originate from a reaction between surface lattice oxygen and reductive propane and its derivatives. Through the synergistic effect of the Ostwald ripening and high-temperature reduction of nanosized TiO2, a moderate migration of mobile lattice oxygen atoms allows the equilibrium between formation and stability of vacancies and Ticus to be easily reached, whereas excessive reduction causes the catalyst deactivation. The in situ reduced TiO2-x nanoparticles exhibit an initial propane conversion of 67% and a one-pass yield of propylene at 45% in the PDH reaction at 600 C. For the defective anatase TiO2(101)-catalyzed PDH reaction, the catalytic roles of the Ticus cations are further investigated by the DFT calculations. The Ticus cations facilitate the breaking of the second CH bond of propane rather than the first CH bond with the aid of a stronger hydrogen chemisorption effect.
3. Mechanistic considerations
The corresponding catalytic mechanisms of EDH and PDH reactions over a variety of nobble metal and transition metal oxide catalysts have been compared in a review reported by Weckhuysen et al. in 2014.8 As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen.249,250 According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step.8
3.1. CH activation and olefin desorption
The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt.251 After the cleavage of the second CH bond, the olefin intermediate adsorbs on the Pt catalysts with π- or di-σ-type binding depending on the catalyst surface property and coverage degree as well as the conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and composition of co-fed gases), according to the experimental observations of the propylene chemisorption on the Pt(111) surface under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions using reflectionabsorption IR spectroscopy and TPD characterizations.252,253 The adsorption strength of olefin on the Pt sites is determined by the geometric and electronic properties of Pt. For instance, the DFT calculation results demonstrate that propylene prefers a di-σ configuration on Pt(111) with an adsorption energy of 0.51 eV, whereas the adsorption on the step edge of Pt(211) is a more exothermic process with an energy of 0.81 eV.254256 For the adsorption of propylene on the Sn-modified Pt3Sn(111) surface, a di-σh binding with an energy of 0.24 eV is favored over a di-σf binding, and a similar preference of di-σh over di-σf site is also observed in the ethylene adsorption on Pt3Sn(111), which is due to the decoration effect of Sn atoms on the Pt step sites.257 For the EDH reaction over a single Cr3+O site on SiO2, the CH activation produces CrC and OH bonds through σ-bond metathesis and then the β-H transfer occurs onto a Cr site.258 For most of the DH reactions catalyzed by the metal oxides with coordinatively unsaturated sites, the heterolytic CH cleavage route is energetically favorable to form a metalalkyl intermediate and OH species, which is in accordance with the observations in the cases of V3+, Co2+-, Feδ+-, and Zrcus-based systems. On the other hand, the abstraction of hydrogen from ethane or propane can also result in the formation of the alkoxide intermediate species (e.g., ethoxide and isopropoxide) on the metal oxide surface, for instance, on the Cr2O3Al2O3 composite.259 Summarizing the specific rate values (mol propane per mol metal per s) of the PDH reactions catalyzed by metals and metal oxides, the monometallic Pt and the bimetallic sites like PtSn typically show the highest rates of 101 s1, which are four or three orders of magnitude greater than the 105104 s1 rates obtained on the metal oxide-based active sites, exemplified by CrOx, GaOx, VOx, ZrOx, CoOx and ZnOx. For enhancing the intrinsic activity and selectivity of metal- and metal oxide-catalyzed EDH and PDH reactions, the catalyst design strategies are still required to optimize the promoter addition and to control the interface properties between the active metals/ions and the adjacent support sites.
Specifically, the strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces may tightly bond with olefin intermediates, allowing their further transformation such as deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization for the formation of coke precursors, and therefore significantly influencing the DH selectivity and catalytic stability. It is necessary to properly modify the commonly used metal oxide-based supports (e.g., Al2O3) with reduced acidity or to employ the high-silica and pure-silica zeolites with the minimal acidity to localize metal sites, suppressing the acid site-determined side reactions.
3.2. Coke species and coking processes
Except for the structural change of active sites through metal sintering and metal oxide reduction, the accumulation of coke species blocking the pores or active sites significantly deactivate the DH catalysts. Coke, a group of hydrocarbons with various graphitization degrees and C/H ratios, is generally generated on the Brnsted acid sites or other active sites during the DH reactions through complex processes including cracking, deep dehydrogenation, polymerization and addition of alkanes, olefins and radicals. For instance, by combining HRTEM, FT-IR, Raman, TGA, and pyrolysis GC-MS characterizations, aliphatics, aromatics, and pre-graphite coke are identified to be deposited on the metal, in the vicinity of the metal, and on the support of the PtSn/Al2O3-based PDH catalyst, and their amounts are 69.0, 4.4, and 26.6 wt %, respectively, and furthermore the in situ DRIFT spectral results also reveal the transformation process from the aliphatic coke into the aromatics through deep dehydrogenation.260 In consideration of both monolayer and multilayer coke formation as well as exponential deactivation rate, a kinetic model has been proposed to describe the coking step in the PDH over a PtSn/hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolite catalyst.261 The dimerization of adsorbed propylene intermediates on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is regarded as the kinetically relevant step for the coke formation on the metal sites, causing a larger hydrogen/carbon ratio of these coke species on the metals in comparison with that on the support.262 Depending on the coking rates, the Pt-catalyzed PDH reaction typically includes two distinct stages, initially a quick deactivation and then a following steady state. According to the DFT-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results, two kinds of geometries of the active surface Pt sites for dehydrogenation and deep reactions exist: one is the sites that are mainly occupied by strongly adsorbed C2/C1 species causing the quick deactivation, and another is the unoccupied sites survived in the initial stage, which can steadily catalyze the PDH reaction to propylene.263 An additional transport process is observed to be involved between the formation of coke precursors on Pt sites and their subsequent assimilation into the growing graphene sheets during the Pt/MgAlOx-catalyzed PDH reaction.264 A hypothesis called drain-off effect has been proposed to explain the removal and migration processes of the mobile coke precursors from the vicinity of active Pt sites to the support where they finally deposit as coke for keeping the active sites clean.265,266 For the activity-coke content relationship over the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, a monolayer-multilayer coke growth model has been proposed to quantitatively describe it.267 This kind of model can also quite accurately describe the coking processes of VOx/Al2O3SiO2 catalysts during the PDH reactions based on the kinetic analysis results of TGA profiles.268 The rate constant of coke formation is found to increase with the polymerization degree of VOx species rather than the acidity of the catalyst.
To achieve the effective control of coke deposition for extending the catalyst lifetime, some strategies have been reported. The combination of the electronic and drain-off effects highlights the superiority of the anti-coking ability of bimetallic catalysts (e.g., PtSn, PtGa and PtCu) than that of monometallic Pt catalysts because the electron-rich Pt atoms can dramatically weaken the interaction of Pt with coke precursors and facilitate their desorption and migration.39,68,269 The elimination of the acid sites from the selected support and the poisoning of the coking-relevant active sites as well as the improvement of the mass transport through optimizing the porous structure can effectively suppress the coke formation on the DH catalysts.270 For instance, introducing the hierarchical pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite can decrease the acid content of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, greatly improving the capacity for coke accommodation and modifying the migration process of coke from the active metal sites to the supports.271 The isolation of the active coking sites has also been proved to be a suitable strategy to prevent the polymerization of the coke precursors. Furthermore, regulating the DH reaction atmosphere with co-feeding of water vapor, hydrogen, or soft oxidant CO2 can reduce the generation of coke species to a certain extent.272 To meet the requirements for continuous production, a regeneration of the coked DH catalyst under an oxidative atmosphere is a critical process for determining the recycling stability of the catalyst. The operation parameters of the regeneration are apparently related to the amount and the type of the deposited coke species on the spent catalyst. However, the oxidative conditions may result in the structural change of the metals or ions as the active sites in the catalyst, and thus this requires the stabilization effect that the promoter or the support provides. It has been reported that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance, especially the stability of PtSn/γ-Al2O3-based PDH catalysts in comparison with the regeneration processes under nitrogen and oxygen.273 Treatment using nitrogen can only eliminate those low-density coke species, while burning in oxygen causes phase separation and particle agglomeration of PtSn bimetals during repeated redox processes. A relatively marginal impact is observed on the hydrogen-regenerated catalyst with respect to the active metal structure and size. In addition to the removal of the low-density coke, a higher mobility of the residual coke can also be achieved through hydrogenation reactions, consequently freeing the active metal sites to launch the catalytic DH reaction.
3.3. Catalytic role of co-feeding of hydrogen
The co-feeding of hydrogen is widely adopted in the catalytic EDH and PDH reactions in view of the multiple positive roles of hydrogen. In the case of the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reactions, the presence of hydrogen increases the propylene formation rate and decreases both the formation rate and the graphitization degree of coke species.272 The acceleration effect of hydrogen on the EDH and PDH activities are observed on the Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts, and a volcano-shape relationship between the DH reaction rates and H2/alkane ratios along with little impact on the olefin selectivity is obtained.231 The assistance of a moderate amount of hydrogen species improves the dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of alkane, and however, the excess hydrogen species contribute to the deep hydrogenation of olefin intermediates. The co-feeding of hydrogen in the Cr/BaZrO3-catalyzed EDH reaction can suppress the formation of coke, but leads to a reduced reaction rate of ethylene formation.274 It has also been reported that the ethylene selectivity decreases dramatically with increasing H2/C2H6 ratio for the monometallic Pt/Mg(Al)O but only slightly for the bimetallic PtSn/Mg(Al)O, while a more significant inhibition effect on the coke formation by hydrogen additives is obtained on PtSn/Mg(Al)O rather than Pt/Mg(Al)O.275 A certain interaction between hydrogen species and Pt metal sites exists in the co-fed hydrogen-DH reactions, suggesting that, not only the single adsorption competition effect among co-fed gases, both the catalyst structure sensitivity and the synergistic effect of metals/ions and hydrogen species should be considered for explaining the relevant reaction steps of hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and oligomerization.
The mechanism of the positive roles of co-feeding of hydrogen is explored with DFT calculations on the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH process.276 A decreased coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors such as ethylidyne and methylidyne species is observed on the Pt(111) surface with increasing hydrogen pressure. Furthermore, increasing hydrogen coverage decreases the adsorption strength of propylene intermediates and increases the energy barriers for their further dehydrogenation pathways for preventing the side reactions (Fig. 28). The contributions from these three aspects explains the higher catalytic PDH activity of the Pt catalysts in the presence of hydrogen. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the PDH reaction on Pt(111) also demonstrate a dual role of accelerating propylene formation rate and reducing the consumption of the formed propylene.263 The inhibited coke formation is also demonstrated in a case of the co-feeding of hydrogen during the DH reaction over a Pt4 model.277 The Pt4H phase is identified to be stable under the typical reaction conditions, which can improve the olefin selectivity by shifting the third CH cleavage step to higher energy for hardly competing with the preferred olefin desorption.

4. Conclusions and perspectives
The installations of industrial PDH projects have been built in recent years with utilization of either Catofin CrOx/Al2O3 or Oleflex PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and nonetheless, further improvements are still required with respect to the catalytic efficiencies and the single-pass and recycling stability.
Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts. By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles. Both geometric and electronic modification effects by the promoter species can also be well regulated using favorable synthesis methods. Benefiting from the utilization of the high-resolution characterization techniques, e.g., in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM, the effective structural information of the catalysts can be observed allowing us to establish the real relationships between the adsorption and catalytic properties. It is worth making further efforts to construct stable structures for the small-sized metallic or ionic active sites for maximizing the catalytic efficiency in selective alkane DH reactions.
Selective activation of alkane CH bonds and prohibition of the CC cleavage and other side reactions are critical to achieve both high olefin selectivity and great long-term stability. The localization of metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or the zeolite framework may induce the formation of new active sites to be involved in a synergetic reaction mechanism or an undesired pathway. Their catalytic contribution is significant for the non-Pt DH catalysts than for the Pt-based catalysts, since the reaction determined by these active sites may show a similar specific reaction rate with desired selective DH reaction. For instance, the incorporation of metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework produces the acid sites in single configuration or even in LewisBrnsted acid pairs. In the former case, the excess Brnsted acid sites may catalyze the deep dehydrogenation of the formed olefin as the intermediate, whereas the LewisBrnsted acid pairs in the Ga/H-MFI catalyst show significantly higher activity than the isolated Ga+ sites toward CH activation and hydrogen elimination in the PDH reaction. Therefore, the complete functions of surface acid sites should be profoundly realized, not limited to the negative roles of serving as the active sites for CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking process.
Furthermore, the understanding on the catalyst structureactivity relationship and mechanism for the alkane ODH processes may provide a reference for the structural design of the DH catalysts, though different tasks and limitations exist between these two processes.35,7 For instance, novel BN-based or B-related materials offer promising alternatives to the commonly studied metal oxides such as VOx and CrOx, and they catalyze the key steps of selective alkane ODH reaction, such as CH activation and olefin desorption, in particular pathways.278285 As one of the efficient ODH processes, the chemical looping (CL-ODH) route includes two cyclic separate steps, alkane dehydrogenation to form olefin by the lattice oxygen species of metal oxide-based oxygen carrier and reoxidation by the oxidative gas.286,287 For the CL-ODH reaction of ethane to ethylene at 850 C, the NaW-promoted Mg6MnO8 redox catalyst displays 89.2% selectivity and 68.2% yield.288,289 For the CL-ODH reaction of propane to propylene at 500 C, the MoVO mixed oxides exhibit 89% selectivity at 36% propane conversion over 100 cycles.290 Therefore, the catalytic roles of the oxygen species that exist in the gas phase and lattice phase, and on the interface are still the fundamental catalysis topics for the selective activation of CH and CC bonds in the light hydrocarbons.291293 The irreversible coke deposition for deactivation is the most important issue that all DH catalysts suffer from. Several strategies have been performed to solve this problem. The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products. The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species. For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity. The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method able to reduce the coke amount. It is noted that these gaseous additives not only compete with the hydrocarbons in the adsorption, but also participate in the DH reactions. However, there are rare reports to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of these co-fed gases in the alkane DH reactions over non-Pt catalysts. To further increase the single-pass yield of the alkane DH reactions, the removal of hydrogen from the mixture of products can shift the equilibrium to the production of olefins by using Pd- or zeolite-based membrane reactors.294298 Nevertheless, the effect of hydrogen as a coke inhibitor is weakened, and thus the coking issue and catalyst stability remain a challenge.
Another crucial issue related to the stability for metal or metal oxide-catalyzed alkane DH processes is the dynamic structural stability of the metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment. Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites. It also results in the appearance of a relatively longer induction period in the initial reaction stage for completing the pre-activation of these active sites. This process is not ideal because of its low efficiency of raw gases and energy, while it also increases the difficulty for us to acquire the real structureactivity relationship and to propose a convincing mechanism. For these reasons, a moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports will be pivotal for the design of the DH catalysts, and an efficient pretreatment procedure needs to be developed.For both the catalyst materials and reaction routes, there still exists much room to improve our understanding. Though some metal or metal oxide catalysts have achieved industrial applications, a full picture about the working state and the catalytic mechanism for these catalysts still cannot be realized. Further exploration of the structureproperty relationship will lead to the creation of efficient, selective and stable alkane DH catalysts through combining precise catalyst syntheses, high time-space resolution characterization, and rational theoretical calculations.
