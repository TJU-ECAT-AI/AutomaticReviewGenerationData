1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the formation of zeolite frameworks. This strategy facilitates the rapid incorporation of metals such as PtSn clusters into the ZSM-5 zeolite structure, thereby reducing the time required for synthesis and potentially improving the efficiency of metal dispersion within the zeolite matrix. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, are enhanced due to the optimized distribution of the metal clusters within the zeolite framework, leading to improved activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation reactions.
