The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing for the rapid formation of zeolite frameworks. This strategy impacts the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites by facilitating their stabilization. As a result, the enhanced stability of these metal clusters improves their activity and selectivity in the context of propane conversion.
