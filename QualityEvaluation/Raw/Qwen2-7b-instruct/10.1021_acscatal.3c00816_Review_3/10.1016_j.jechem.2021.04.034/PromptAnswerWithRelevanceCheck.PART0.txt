The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures. This strategy allows for the efficient trapping and stabilization of metal species, such as zinc cations, within the zeolite framework. The resulting Zn@S-1 zeolites exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the zinc species within these zeolites are identified as the active components responsible for the PDH reaction, undergoing a partial reduction to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species, which are found to be the preferred active sites for the reaction.

3.3. Catalytic performance in PDH reaction
PDH reaction was evaluated using Zn@S-1 zeolites with different Zn loadings as catalysts and the results were shown in Fig. 5 (a). The catalytic activity of S-1 zeolite in PDH was negligible. Interestingly, upon the introduction of 4 wt% zinc to S-1 zeolite, significant improvement in propane conversion and propylene selectivity could be simultaneously obtained. Zn-4@S-1 prepared by in-situ hydrothermal route exhibited higher activity than Zn-4/S-1 prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, while the pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 in H2 resulted in the sharp decline in the catalytic activity. Intuitively, zinc cations acted as the preferred active sites for PDH reaction than the metallic zinc.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of PDH reactions was assessed using Zn@S-1 zeolites with varying zinc loadings as catalysts, as depicted in Figure 5(a). The zeolite S-1 showed insignificant catalytic activity for PDH. Notably, adding 4 wt% zinc to S-1 led to substantial enhancements in propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Zn-4@S-1, synthesized through in-situ hydrothermal processing, demonstrated greater activity compared to Zn-4/S-1 prepared via incipient wetness impregnation. Pre-reduction of Zn-4@S-1 in hydrogen caused a steep drop in catalytic activity. Intuitively, zinc cations served as the preferred active sites for PDH reactions over metallic zinc.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应性能评估中，使用不同锌负载的Zn@S-1沸石作为催化剂，结果如图5(a)所示。仅用S-1沸石作为催化剂时，PDH活性微弱。然而，向S-1中添加4 wt%锌显著提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。通过原位水热合成制备的Zn-4@S-1显示出比通过浸渍湿法制备的Zn-4/S-1更高的活性。在氢气中预还原Zn-4@S-1导致催化活性急剧下降。直观地，锌离子作为PDH反应的优选活性中心，优于金属锌。

3.4. Active zinc sites for PDH reaction
For insights into the active zinc sites for PDH reaction, the TPSR profiles on Zn-4@S-1 model catalyst were recorded under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), a weak but noticeable H2 signal could be observed at 503 K, due to the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from propane molecules on zinc sites and the combination of two hydrogen atoms to generate gaseous H2. Meanwhile, no signal of propylene could be observed. With increasing temperature to 723 K, the H2 signal increased rapidly, accompanied by the consumption of propane and the formation of propylene. That is, the PDH reaction was initiated. According to these observations, a two-step activation process of propane could be proposed, i.e.,(i) and (ii).

To gain insights into the active zinc sites for PDH reactions, temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) profiles were recorded for the Zn-4@S-1 model catalyst under various conditions. As illustrated in Figure 8(a), a faint yet detectable hydrogen (H2) signal was visible at 503 K. This was attributed to the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from propane molecules on zinc sites, followed by the combination of two hydrogen atoms to form gaseous H2. No signal for propylene was observed. Upon increasing the temperature to 723 K, the H2 signal intensified rapidly, coinciding with the consumption of propane and the production of propylene. This indicated the initiation of the PDH reaction. Based on these observations, a two-step activation process of propane could be hypothesized, involving steps (i) and (ii).

为了了解PDH反应中的活性锌位点，记录了Zn-4@S-1模型催化剂在不同条件下的TPSR轮廓。如图8(a)所示，503 K处观察到一个微弱但可辨别的氢(H2)信号。这归因于锌位点上丙烷分子的氢原子的抽取，随后两个氢原子组合形成气体H2。没有发现丙烯信号。随着温度升至723 K，H2信号迅速增加，伴随着丙烷的消耗和丙烯的生成。这表明PDH反应开始。根据这些观察结果，可以提出一个丙烷的两步激活过程，包括步骤(i)和(ii)。
