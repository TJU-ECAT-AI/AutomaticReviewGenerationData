The active sites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are partially reduced zinc cations. These zinc species are trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites through an in-situ hydrothermal synthesis process. The catalysts show improved dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reactions. The partial reduction of zinc species occurs during the reaction, identifying these partially reduced zinc cations as the active sites involved in the PDH process.

活性位点为部分还原的锌离子。这些锌物种通过在S-1沸石中硅醇基团中的原位水热合成过程被捕获并稳定化。催化剂在PDH反应中显示出良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力。在反应过程中，锌物种的部分还原发生，识别出这些部分还原的锌离子作为参与PDH过程的活性位点。
