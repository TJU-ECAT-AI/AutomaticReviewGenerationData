[1] "A series of Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route."
[2] "Characterization results from FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis and XPS reveal that well-isolated zinc cations are trapped and efficiently stabilized by the Si-OH groups of S-1."
[3] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
[4] "Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."
[5] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of zeolite structures. This strategy facilitates the efficient trapping and stabilization of isolated zinc cations by the Si-OH groups within the zeolite framework. The resulting Zn@S-1 zeolites serve as potential PDH catalysts, featuring zinc species as the exclusive active components. These catalysts demonstrate high dehydrogenation activity, excellent propylene selectivity, and remarkable regeneration capacity in PDH reactions. Furthermore, in situ NAP XPS and ex situ XPS analyses confirm the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (where 0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reactions, identifying these partially reduced Znδ+ species as the preferred active sites for the reaction.

由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过允许快速形成沸石结构来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这一策略促进了孤立锌离子被沸石骨架中的Si-OH基团有效地捕获和稳定化。由此产生的Zn@S-1沸石用作潜在PDH催化剂，其中锌物种是唯一的活性成分。这些催化剂在PDH反应中显示出良好的脱氢活性、优异的丙烯选择性和出色的再生能力。此外，在线NAP XPS和离线XPS分析证实了在PDH反应过程中Zn2+部分还原为Znδ+（其中0<δ<2）物种，并且这些部分还原的Znδ+物种被确认为反应的首选活性位点。
