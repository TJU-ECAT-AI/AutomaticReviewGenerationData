[1] "A series of Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route."
[2] "Characterization results from FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis and XPS reveal that well-isolated zinc cations are trapped and efficiently stabilized by the Si-OH groups of S-1."
[3] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
[4] "Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."
[5] "TPSR and co-feeding experiments indicate the two-step activation of propane on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction."
[6] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures. This strategy allows for the efficient trapping and stabilization of metal species, such as zinc cations, within the zeolite framework. The resulting Zn@S-1 zeolites exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Specifically, the zinc species within these zeolites are identified as the active components responsible for the PDH reaction, undergoing a partial reduction to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species, which are found to be the preferred active sites for the reaction.

由Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使沸石结构的快速形成来解决直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种策略允许金属物种，如锌离子，高效地被锁定并稳定在沸石骨架内。所得到的Zn@S-1沸石显示出在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的高脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力。具体而言，在这些沸石中，锌物种被确认为PDH反应的活性成分，并经历部分还原为Znδ+（0<δ<2）物种，这些物种被发现是反应的首选活性位点。
