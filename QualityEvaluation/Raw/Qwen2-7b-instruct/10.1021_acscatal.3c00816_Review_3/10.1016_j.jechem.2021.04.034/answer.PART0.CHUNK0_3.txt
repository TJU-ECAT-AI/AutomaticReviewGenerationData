[1] "A series of Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route."
[2] "Characterization results from FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis and XPS reveal that well-isolated zinc cations are trapped and efficiently stabilized by the Si-OH groups of S-1."
[3] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
[4] "TPSR and co-feeding experiments indicate the two-step activation of propane on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction."
[5] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction."

1. A series of Zn@S-1 zeolites with varying zinc loadings were successfully synthesized through a ligand-protected direct hydrothermal method. 
2. FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis, and XPS characterizations showed that zinc cations were effectively captured and stabilized by the Si-OH groups within S-1 zeolites.
3. The synthesized Zn@S-1 zeolites were utilized as PDH catalysts, featuring zinc as the sole active component.
4. TPSR and co-feeding experiments suggested that propane undergoes a two-step activation process on zinc sites, involving hydrogen abstraction.
5. In-situ and ex-situ XPS analyses indicated that Zn2+ species are partially reduced to Znδ+ (where 0 < δ < 2) during PDH reactions, with these partially reduced Znδ+ species identified as the preferred active sites.
