The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization process. This synchronization ensures that metal nanoclusters, formed rapidly, are encapsulated within the zeolite framework during its crystallization, achieving the encapsulation in just a few minutes. The encapsulated PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit exceptional stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with the PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst maintaining high conversion and selectivity even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures. The introduction of tin (Sn) plays a critical role in controlling the size and dispersion of the platinum (Pt) nanoclusters. The method has opened up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with complex structures and compositions. The effectiveness of this approach is substantiated by its successful application in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, showcasing the potential for continuous-flow processes in preparing metal-encapsulated zeolites as catalysts.
