[1] "Overcoming the mismatch between the rapid formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites allows the insitu encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites in just a few minutes."
[2] "The preparation of such bifunctional catalysts, however, is often restricted by the mismatching in time scale between the fast formation of nanoclusters and the slow crystallization of zeolites."
[3] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."
[4] "The concept was demonstrated by confining Pt and Sn nanoclusters into a ZSM-5 (MFI) zeolite in the course of its crystallization, leading to an ultrafast, insitu encapsulation within just 5min."
[5] "This method of ultrafast encapsulation opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity."
[6] "The ultrafast synthesis of zeolites enabled the establishment of continuous-flow synthesis of zeolites, which could greatly increase the space-time yield of zeolite production."
[7] "In addressing the low efficiency of the conventional synthesis of zeolites, our group has established an ultrafast route for zeolite synthesis."
[8] "That is, the crystallization of zeolites can be expedited to accommodate the rapid formation of metal nanocluster, thus enabling an ultrafast in situ encapsulation."
[9] "As schematically illustrated in Figure1c, the ultrafast in situ encapsulation was achieved through a one-pot synthesis without the addition of any protective agent."
[10] "Results of elemental analysis in Figure2d indicate that Pt and Sn exhibited very different evolutions in the process of the encapsulation."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization process to synchronize it with the rapid formation of metal nanoclusters. This allows for an ultrafast, in situ encapsulation within just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. Firstly, the ultrafast encapsulation enables the formation of well-dispersed PtSn clusters with sizes of approximately 1nm, contributing to the catalyst's high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Secondly, the use of tin (Sn) as a modifier in the synthesis process helps regulate the size and dispersion of the Pt clusters, leading to enhanced stability and performance. Finally, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite maintains high conversion and selectivity even after extensive reaction cycles and regeneration, demonstrating the success of the encapsulation method in improving catalyst longevity and performance.

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization process to align with the rapid formation of metal nanoclusters. This enables an ultrafast in situ encapsulation within just a few minutes. By using a one-pot synthesis method without protective agents, they were able to encapsulate PtSn clusters into ZSM-5 zeolites effectively. The elemental analysis showed distinct evolution patterns of Pt and Sn during the encapsulation process. Adding Sn was crucial for controlling the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. The synthesis temperature influenced the crystallization time and Pt content but did not significantly affect the state of the Pt and Sn species. The ultrafast encapsulation technique has broad applicability for preparing other composite porous materials with mismatched processes. Additionally, the encapsulated PtSn clusters demonstrated excellent stability and activity in propane conversion.
