The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize it with the rapid formation of metal nanoclusters. This enables an ultrafast in situ encapsulation within just a few minutes. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are that the clusters are well-dispersed, maintaining excellent stability and activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The encapsulated catalyst shows high activity and selectivity, even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures, indicating that the ultrafast encapsulation of metal clusters in the course of zeolite crystallization is successful. The method also opens up a new avenue for designing and synthesizing composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity.

俞等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加快沸石的结晶以与纳米团簇的快速形成同步，解决了直接合成方法中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这使得在几分钟内实现原位封装成为可能。对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是，簇分布良好，具有出色的稳定性和活性，在丙烷脱氢为丙烯中表现出优异性能。封装催化剂保持高活性和选择性，即使在高温下进行多次反应和再生后也是如此，表明在沸石结晶过程中封装金属簇的成功。该方法也为设计和合成具有结构和组成复杂性的复合沸石材料开辟了新途径。
