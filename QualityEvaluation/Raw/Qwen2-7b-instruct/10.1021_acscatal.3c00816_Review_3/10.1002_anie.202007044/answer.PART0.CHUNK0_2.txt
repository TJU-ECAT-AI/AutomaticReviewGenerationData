The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization process to align with the rapid formation of metal nanoclusters. This enables an ultrafast in situ encapsulation within just a few minutes. By using a one-pot synthesis method without protective agents, they were able to encapsulate PtSn clusters into ZSM-5 zeolites effectively. The elemental analysis showed distinct evolution patterns of Pt and Sn during the encapsulation process. Adding Sn was crucial for controlling the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. The synthesis temperature influenced the crystallization time and Pt content but did not significantly affect the state of the Pt and Sn species. The ultrafast encapsulation technique has broad applicability for preparing other composite porous materials with mismatched processes. Additionally, the encapsulated PtSn clusters demonstrated excellent stability and activity in propane conversion.

俞等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速结晶过程以适应纳米团簇的快速形成，解决了直接合成方法中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这使得在几分钟内实现原位封装成为可能。通过使用不含保护剂的一锅法合成方法，他们成功地将PtSn簇封装到ZSM-5沸石中。元素分析显示了Pt和Sn在封装过程中的不同演化模式。添加Sn对于控制Pt纳米簇的大小和分散至关重要。合成温度影响结晶时间和Pt含量，但对Pt和Sn物种的状态影响不大。超快速封装技术适用于准备其他具有不同过程的复合多孔材料。此外，封装的PtSn簇在丙烷转化中表现出出色的稳定性和活性。
