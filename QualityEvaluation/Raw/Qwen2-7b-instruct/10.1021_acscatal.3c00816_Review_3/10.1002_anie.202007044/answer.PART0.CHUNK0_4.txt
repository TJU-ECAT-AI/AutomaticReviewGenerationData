[7] "The encapsulation experiment was carried out in a conventional autoclave with the same recipe."
[8] "As seen from the TEM image in FigureS4, the impregnated sample contained metal nanoparticles of a much larger size, probably because the pores of MFI zeolite were mostly inaccessible to the metal precursors, resulting in unrestricted growth upon the calcination at high temperature."
[9] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."
[10] "The ultrafast encapsulation was conducted at different temperatures to investigate how the synthesis temperature affects the interplay between zeolite crystallization and nanocluster formation."
[11] "The states of Pt and Sn species, however, were not much affected by the synthesis temperature, as indicated by the UV-vis spectra in FigureS10."
[12] "The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation was verified by testing the catalytic activities of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization process to align it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This synchronization enables an ultrafast in situ encapsulation within just a few minutes. The strategy involves a one-pot synthesis without the use of protective agents, achieving the encapsulation of Pt and Sn nanoclusters into ZSM-5 zeolites. The encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit excellent activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, demonstrating the success of the ultrafast encapsulation. The method also allows for the design and synthesis of composite zeolitic materials with structural and compositional complexity. The incorporation of Sn species into the encapsulation process regulates the size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters. The synthesis temperature impacts the crystallization time and Pt content, but does not significantly affect the states of Pt and Sn species. The effectiveness of the ultrafast encapsulation is verified by the catalyst's high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, even after multiple cycles of reaction and regeneration at high temperatures.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加快结晶过程以与纳米团簇的快速形成相匹配，解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时标不匹配挑战。这种方法通过实现超快速原位封装，在几分钟内完成。策略采用了一锅法合成，无需使用保护剂，成功将铂和锡纳米团簇封装进ZSM-5沸石中。封装后的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5沸石在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的反应中表现出出色的活性和稳定性，证明了超快速封装的成功。该方法还允许设计和合成具有结构和组成复杂性的复合沸石材料。封装过程中添加锡物种调节了铂纳米团簇的大小和分散度。合成温度影响结晶时间和铂含量，但不会显著影响铂和锡物种的状态。超快速封装的有效性通过催化剂在高温度下的高活性和选择性得到验证，即使在多次反应和再生周期后也是如此。
