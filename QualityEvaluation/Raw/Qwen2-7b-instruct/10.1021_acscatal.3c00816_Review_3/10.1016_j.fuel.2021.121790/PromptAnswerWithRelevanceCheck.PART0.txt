[1] "In this work, we facilely fabricate the bimetallic-sites catalyst of Ni-Zn anchored in the zeolite framework of silicalite-1 (depicted as NiZn-S-1) by ligand-protected method, which performs high temperature stability and anti-sintering."
[2] "Comprehensive comparison, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) shows excellent catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with relatively lower deactivation rate (about 0.0778 h1) and great C3H6 selectivity (>90 %) after 30 h on stream."
[3] "Multiple characterizations further reveal that the enhancement of PDH performance ought to be attributed to the synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which is beneficial for the selective activation of CH bond and propylene desorption to reduce the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree, improving the catalyst stability."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by facilitating faster crystallization of zeolites. This allows for more efficient incorporation of metal ions into the zeolite structure, specifically targeting PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The strategy leads to the formation of well-defined PtSn clusters with a high Ni/Zn molar ratio, enhancing their catalytic performance. Specifically, the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity in propane conversion, demonstrating high initial propane conversion of 32.5%, actual turnover frequency (TOF) of 28.5 min^-1, and low deactivation rate of approximately 0.0778 h^-1. Additionally, it maintains high selectivity for propylene production and shows remarkable stability after 30 hours of operation. The catalyst's enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which improves the selective activation of CH bonds and propylene desorption, thereby reducing the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree and improving overall catalyst stability.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略，通过加快沸石的结晶速度，解决了直接合成过程中金属封装时间尺度不匹配的问题。这使得更有效的金属离子被整合到沸石结构中，特别针对ZSM-5沸石中的PtSn簇。该策略导致形成具有良好定义的高Ni/Zn摩尔比的PtSn簇，从而提高了它们的催化性能。具体而言，0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1催化剂在丙烷转化方面表现出优越的催化活性，显示出32.5%的初始丙烷转化率、实际转动频率（TOF）为28.5 min^-1和大约0.0778 h^-1的较低失活速率。此外，它在30小时的操作后仍保持较高的丙烯选择性，并显示出显著稳定性。催化剂性能的增强归因于双金属Ni-Zn位点之间的协同效应，这改善了CH键的选择性活化和丙烯脱附，从而减少了具有高石墨化度的焦炭物种的形成，并且总体上提高了催化剂稳定性。

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing for faster formation of zeolite structures. This strategy facilitates the rapid encapsulation of metal ions into the zeolite framework without significant aggregation or formation of large metal clusters. As a result, the PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are formed with a more uniform size distribution and better dispersion, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion. The improved structure and dispersion of the PtSn clusters enable more efficient and selective activation of the CH bonds, facilitating the desired dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing coke formation. This approach not only improves the catalytic efficiency but also enhances the stability of the catalyst, making it more suitable for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation processes.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过允许快速形成沸石结构来解决直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配问题。这种策略使金属离子能够更快地被封装到沸石骨架中，而不会产生大量金属簇或形成大型金属簇。因此，在ZSM-5沸石中形成的PtSn簇具有更均匀的尺寸分布和更好的分散性，这导致催化性能在丙烷转化方面得到显著提升。改进的结构和分散性使得PtSn簇能够更高效、更选择性地激活CH键，从而促进所需脱氢反应，同时减少焦炭的生成。这种方法不仅提高了催化剂的催化效率，而且增强了催化剂的稳定性，使其更适合工业应用中的丙烷脱氢过程。

1. The development of alternative catalyst design with efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly characteristics is crucial in overcoming the challenges of high-price Pt and toxic Cr(VI) catalysts, which suffer from rapid deactivation and severe coke deposition in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. The 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst, with a high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1, demonstrates superior catalytic performance in PDH, with an initial propane conversion of 32.5%, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 28.5 min^-1, and a low deactivation rate of 0.0778 h^-1 after 30 hours of operation. It also maintains high propylene selectivity.

3. Compared to the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst, the propylene formation rate and deactivation rate are slightly lower than those of Pt-based catalysts, but they surpass those of other non-noble metal catalysts (Cr, Co, Ga, Fe, V, and Zn) in terms of stability and efficiency.
