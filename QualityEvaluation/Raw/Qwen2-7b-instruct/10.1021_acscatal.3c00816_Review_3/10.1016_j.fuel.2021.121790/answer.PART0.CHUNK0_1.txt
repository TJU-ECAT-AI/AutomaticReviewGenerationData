[1] "To overcome these problems, the breakthroughs in an alternative catalyst design with efficient, low-cost and eco-friendly play a crucial role in successfully developing this process."
[2] "Here, we facilely fabricate the bimetallic-site catalyst of Ni-Zn anchored in the zeolitic framework of silicalite-1 (depicted as NiZn-S-1) by employing ligand-protected strategy, which performs high temperature stability."
[3] "Under comparable conditions, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) exhibits superior catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with low deactivation rate (0.0778 h1) and great propylene selectivity (>90%) after 30 h on stream."
[4] "The catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts is evaluated for PDH reaction in a fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure."
[5] "The design of novel bimetallic-sites catalyst can give a new idea on the development of alternative PDH catalysts with economical- and environment-friendly in the future."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing for faster formation of zeolite structures. This strategy facilitates the rapid encapsulation of metal ions into the zeolite framework without significant aggregation or formation of large metal clusters. As a result, the PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are formed with a more uniform size distribution and better dispersion, which leads to enhanced catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion. The improved structure and dispersion of the PtSn clusters enable more efficient and selective activation of the CH bonds, facilitating the desired dehydrogenation reactions while minimizing coke formation. This approach not only improves the catalytic efficiency but also enhances the stability of the catalyst, making it more suitable for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation processes.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过允许快速形成沸石结构来解决直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配问题。这种策略使金属离子能够更快地被封装到沸石骨架中，而不会产生大量金属簇或形成大型金属簇。因此，在ZSM-5沸石中形成的PtSn簇具有更均匀的尺寸分布和更好的分散性，这导致催化性能在丙烷转化方面得到显著提升。改进的结构和分散性使得PtSn簇能够更高效、更选择性地激活CH键，从而促进所需脱氢反应，同时减少焦炭的生成。这种方法不仅提高了催化剂的催化效率，而且增强了催化剂的稳定性，使其更适合工业应用中的丙烷脱氢过程。
