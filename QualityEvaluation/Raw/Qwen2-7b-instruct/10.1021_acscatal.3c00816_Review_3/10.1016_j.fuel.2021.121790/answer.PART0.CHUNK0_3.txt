[1] "To overcome these problems, the breakthroughs in an alternative catalyst design with efficient, low-cost and eco-friendly play a crucial role in successfully developing this process."
[2] "Under comparable conditions, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) exhibits superior catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with low deactivation rate (0.0778 h1) and great propylene selectivity (>90%) after 30 h on stream."
[3] "Notably, the values of propylene formation rate and deactivation rate over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 are slight lower than that of Pt-based catalysts, but are more superior than that of other non-noble metal catalysts (e.g., Cr, Co, Ga, Fe, V and Zn, etc.)."

1. The development of alternative catalyst design with efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly characteristics is crucial in overcoming the challenges of high-price Pt and toxic Cr(VI) catalysts, which suffer from rapid deactivation and severe coke deposition in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. The 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst, with a high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1, demonstrates superior catalytic performance in PDH, with an initial propane conversion of 32.5%, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 28.5 min^-1, and a low deactivation rate of 0.0778 h^-1 after 30 hours of operation. It also maintains high propylene selectivity.

3. Compared to the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst, the propylene formation rate and deactivation rate are slightly lower than those of Pt-based catalysts, but they surpass those of other non-noble metal catalysts (Cr, Co, Ga, Fe, V, and Zn) in terms of stability and efficiency.

1. 在克服高价格Pt和有毒Cr(VI)催化剂的问题时，高效、低成本、环保的替代催化剂设计起着至关重要的作用，在成功开发这一过程中扮演重要角色。

2. 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1催化剂，其Ni/Zn摩尔比为3:1，显示出在PDH中的优越催化性能，初始丙烷转化率为32.5%，实际TOF值为28.5 min^-1，且在30小时操作后具有较低的失活率0.0778 h^-1。同时，它也保持了高丙烯选择性。

3. 相对于0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1催化剂，丙烯生成速率和失活速率略低于Pt基催化剂，但它们在稳定性与效率方面超过了其他非贵金属催化剂（Cr、Co、Ga、Fe、V、Zn）。
