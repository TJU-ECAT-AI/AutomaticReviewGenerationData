<p>The emission of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as notorious greenhouse gases has been a severe environmental issue that contributes significantly to the global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>Given these, a novel metalacid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst is tailored from the evolution of hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates that are formed by subtly controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes in the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite.</p>
<p>The developed Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst renders almost equivalent CH4 and CO2 conversions (85.1 % and 88.7 %), high H2/CO molar ratio (about 1) and superb long-term stability during 100 h with no activity loss at 750 C with a WHSV of 100 L·gcat1·h1, outperforming other control catalysts under investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it further discloses that a benign balance between formation and elimination of process carbon species is responsible for improving the carbon resistance of catalyst during the DRM reaction.</p>

This research introduces a novel metal-acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst. The catalyst is engineered from hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates, created by precisely controlling the coordination environments of nickel precursor complexes within the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite framework. This catalyst demonstrates outstanding performance in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) process. It achieves equivalent conversions for both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (85.1% and 88.7%, respectively), maintains a high H2/CO molar ratio near 1, and exhibits remarkable long-term stability over 100 hours at 750°C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹, surpassing other catalysts tested. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced process, where carbon species formation and elimination are in harmony, in enhancing the catalyst's resistance to carbon deposition during the DRM reaction.

这项研究引入了一种新型的金属酸双功能Ni@S-1沸石催化剂。该催化剂由在S-1沸石晶体中通过精确控制镍前体复合物的配位环境而形成的羟基化镍层状硅酸盐制成。这种催化剂在干甲烷重整（DRM）过程中表现出优异的性能。它实现了CH4和CO2等效转化率（分别为85.1%和88.7%），保持了接近1的H2/CO摩尔比，并且在750°C下持续100小时，以100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹的重量时空间速度运行时，其活性没有损失，超过其他测试催化剂。研究表明，在DRM反应过程中，碳物种形成与消除的平衡是提高催化剂抗碳沉积能力的关键因素。
