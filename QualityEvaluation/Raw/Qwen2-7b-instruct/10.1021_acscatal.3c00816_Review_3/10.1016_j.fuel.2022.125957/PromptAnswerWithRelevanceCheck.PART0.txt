The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by controlling the formation and structure of metal clusters within zeolites. This is achieved by precisely tuning the coordination environments of metal precursor complexes during the crystallization process. As a result, PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are formed with optimized structures that enhance their catalytic performance in propane conversion reactions. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance are manifested through the creation of a benign balance between the formation and elimination of process carbon species, which improves the carbon resistance of the catalyst during the direct synthesis of metal encapsulated zeolites. This leads to superior conversion rates of both CH4 and CO2, along with a high H2/CO molar ratio, showcasing the enhanced catalytic activity of the developed Ni@S-1 catalyst compared to other control catalysts under investigation.

This research introduces a novel metal-acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst. The catalyst is engineered from hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates, created by precisely controlling the coordination environments of nickel precursor complexes within the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite framework. This catalyst demonstrates outstanding performance in the dry reforming of methane (DRM) process. It achieves equivalent conversions for both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (85.1% and 88.7%, respectively), maintains a high H2/CO molar ratio near 1, and exhibits remarkable long-term stability over 100 hours at 750°C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹, surpassing other catalysts tested. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced process, where carbon species formation and elimination are in harmony, in enhancing the catalyst's resistance to carbon deposition during the DRM reaction.

The document outlines a method for developing a metal-acid bifunctional catalyst, specifically a Ni@S-1 zeolite, which is tailored from hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates. This is achieved by precisely controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes within the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in the dry reforming of methane (DRM), converting both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) efficiently with high hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H2/CO) ratios. It maintains stability over 100 hours at 750°C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹, outperforming other catalysts. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to the synergy between uniformly sized nickel nanoparticles (35 nm) confined within the zeolite's micropores and the formation of Lewis acid sites from coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites in the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate. Moreover, the catalyst maintains a balanced formation and elimination of process carbon species, enhancing its carbon resistance during the DRM reaction.

文档描述了一种开发金属酸双功能催化剂的方法，具体是Ni@S-1沸石催化剂，该催化剂是从富含羟基的镍层状硅酸盐演化而来，通过精细控制Ni前体复合物在硅酸铝-1（S-1）沸石中的配合环境。该催化剂在甲烷（CH4）和二氧化碳（CO2）干重整反应中表现出优异性能，实现了高氢气与一氧化碳（H2/CO）比例的高效转化，并在750°C下以100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹的重量小时空速连续运行100小时，其活性没有损失，超越了其他催化剂。该催化剂的有效性归因于均匀尺寸的镍纳米颗粒（35 nm）被限制在沸石的微孔内以及从可协调不饱和Ni2+位点形成的路易斯酸位点之间的协同作用。此外，该催化剂维持了过程碳物种的形成与消除之间的平衡，从而提高了其在干重整反应中的碳抵抗能力。

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling faster formation of the zeolite structure. This approach allows for the rapid encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within the zeolite matrix, facilitating the formation of well-defined metal clusters with controlled sizes and shapes. As a result, the structure of the PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites is optimized, leading to enhanced catalytic performance for propane conversion.

2. The effects of the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites include improved control over the cluster size and distribution, which in turn enhances the surface area available for reactions and improves the selectivity towards desired products. This leads to more efficient propane conversion, characterized by higher yields of target compounds and lower levels of unwanted side reactions. Additionally, the rapid formation of the zeolite framework ensures better encapsulation of the metal clusters, reducing the risk of sintering and maintaining their activity over longer periods.

3. The optimized structure of the PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, facilitated by the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy, results in superior catalytic performance for propane conversion compared to traditional synthesis methods. This is evidenced by increased reaction rates, higher conversion efficiencies, and better product yields. Furthermore, the enhanced stability of the catalysts allows for prolonged operation without significant loss of activity, making the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

4. In summary, the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of metal encapsulation within zeolite matrices, leading to optimized structure and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters. This results in enhanced propane conversion capabilities, including increased yields of desired products, improved selectivity, and prolonged catalyst stability, ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.

This study introduces a novel metal-acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst designed to address the challenges of sintering and carbon deposition in the dry reforming of methane (DRM). By precisely controlling the synthesis of Ni precursor complexes, the researchers have tailored a catalyst featuring Ni nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in a hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicate. These NPs are confined within the micropores of the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, providing enhanced anti-sintering properties and the ability to activate methane. Moreover, the Lewis acid sites derived from coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites in the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of CO2, generating active hydroxyl species that aid in the elimination of process carbon species. This design enables a benign balance between the formation and elimination of carbon species, thereby improving the catalyst's stability during the DRM reaction at low temperatures.
