This study introduces a novel metal-acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst designed to address the challenges of sintering and carbon deposition in the dry reforming of methane (DRM). By precisely controlling the synthesis of Ni precursor complexes, the researchers have tailored a catalyst featuring Ni nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in a hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicate. These NPs are confined within the micropores of the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite, providing enhanced anti-sintering properties and the ability to activate methane. Moreover, the Lewis acid sites derived from coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites in the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of CO2, generating active hydroxyl species that aid in the elimination of process carbon species. This design enables a benign balance between the formation and elimination of carbon species, thereby improving the catalyst's stability during the DRM reaction at low temperatures.

本研究提出了一种新型的金属-酸双功能Ni@S-1沸石催化剂，旨在解决甲烷干燥重整（DRM）过程中的结块和碳沉积问题。通过精确控制Ni前体复合物的合成，研究人员制备了一种包含嵌入在羟基化镍层状硅酸盐中的Ni纳米颗粒（NPs）的催化剂。这些NPs被限制在硅酸铝-1（S-1）沸石的微孔中，提供了增强的抗结块性能，并且能够激活甲烷。此外，源自协调不饱和Ni2+离子的Lewis酸位点有助于CO2的吸附和分解，生成活性羟基物种，从而促进过程碳物种的消除。这种设计使得形成与消除碳物种之间建立了一个良性平衡，进而提高了催化剂在低温下的重整反应稳定性。
