<p>Given the challenges of sintering and carbon deposition, a novel metal-acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst is tailored from the evolution of hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates that are formed by subtly controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes in the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite.</p>
<p>The developed Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst renders almost equivalent CH4 and CO2 conversions (85.1 % and 88.7 %), high H2/CO molar ratio (about 1) and superb long-term stability during 100 h with no activity loss at 750 C with a WHSV of 100 L·gcat1·h1, outperforming other control catalysts under investigation.</p>
<p>Such superior catalytic behavior benefits from the synergy between highly uniform Ni nanoparticles (35 nm) confined in the micropores of zeolite and substantially formed Lewis acid sites due to coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites located at the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate, as revealed by detailed characterizations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it further discloses that a benign balance between formation and elimination of process carbon species is responsible for improving the carbon resistance of catalyst during the DRM reaction.</p>

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by controlling the formation and structure of metal clusters within zeolites. This is achieved by precisely tuning the coordination environments of metal precursor complexes during the crystallization process. As a result, PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are formed with optimized structures that enhance their catalytic performance in propane conversion reactions. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance are manifested through the creation of a benign balance between the formation and elimination of process carbon species, which improves the carbon resistance of the catalyst during the direct synthesis of metal encapsulated zeolites. This leads to superior conversion rates of both CH4 and CO2, along with a high H2/CO molar ratio, showcasing the enhanced catalytic activity of the developed Ni@S-1 catalyst compared to other control catalysts under investigation.

余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过精确控制金属前体复合物在结晶过程中的配合环境，解决了直接合成过程中金属封装时间尺度不匹配的挑战。这使得ZSM-5沸石中的PtSn簇形成具有优化结构，从而增强其丙烷转化反应的催化性能。这种影响体现在形成、结构和催化性能上，通过创建过程碳物种形成与消除之间的良性平衡，提高了催化剂在直接合成金属封装沸石过程中的碳抵抗力。这导致了CH4和CO2的优越转换率以及高H2/CO摩尔比，展示了开发的Ni@S-1催化剂相比其他控制催化剂在调查下表现出的增强催化活性。
