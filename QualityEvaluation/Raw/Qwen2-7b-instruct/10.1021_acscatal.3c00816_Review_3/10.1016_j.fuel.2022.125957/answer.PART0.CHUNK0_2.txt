<p>The emission of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as notorious greenhouse gases has been a severe environmental issue that contributes significantly to the global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>Given these, a novel metal-acid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst is tailored from the evolution of hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates that are formed by subtly controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes in the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite.</p>
<p>The developed Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst renders almost equivalent CH4 and CO2 conversions (85.1 % and 88.7 %), high H2/CO molar ratio (about 1) and superb long-term stability during 100 h with no activity loss at 750 C with a WHSV of 100 L·gcat1·h1, outperforming other control catalysts under investigation.</p>
<p>Such superior catalytic behavior benefits from the synergy between highly uniform Ni nanoparticles (35 nm) confined in the micropores of zeolite and substantially formed Lewis acid sites due to coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites located at the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate, as revealed by detailed characterizations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it further discloses that a benign balance between formation and elimination of process carbon species is responsible for improving the carbon resistance of catalyst during the DRM reaction.</p>

The document outlines a method for developing a metal-acid bifunctional catalyst, specifically a Ni@S-1 zeolite, which is tailored from hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates. This is achieved by precisely controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes within the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in the dry reforming of methane (DRM), converting both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) efficiently with high hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H2/CO) ratios. It maintains stability over 100 hours at 750°C with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹, outperforming other catalysts. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to the synergy between uniformly sized nickel nanoparticles (35 nm) confined within the zeolite's micropores and the formation of Lewis acid sites from coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites in the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate. Moreover, the catalyst maintains a balanced formation and elimination of process carbon species, enhancing its carbon resistance during the DRM reaction.

文档描述了一种开发金属酸双功能催化剂的方法，具体是Ni@S-1沸石催化剂，该催化剂是从富含羟基的镍层状硅酸盐演化而来，通过精细控制Ni前体复合物在硅酸铝-1（S-1）沸石中的配合环境。该催化剂在甲烷（CH4）和二氧化碳（CO2）干重整反应中表现出优异性能，实现了高氢气与一氧化碳（H2/CO）比例的高效转化，并在750°C下以100 L·gcat⁻¹·h⁻¹的重量小时空速连续运行100小时，其活性没有损失，超越了其他催化剂。该催化剂的有效性归因于均匀尺寸的镍纳米颗粒（35 nm）被限制在沸石的微孔内以及从可协调不饱和Ni2+位点形成的路易斯酸位点之间的协同作用。此外，该催化剂维持了过程碳物种的形成与消除之间的平衡，从而提高了其在干重整反应中的碳抵抗能力。
