<p>However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc. Exploring and constructing zeolites containing In species are desirable for potential catalytic applications.</p>
<p>The introduction of indium species greatly improves the propene selectivity and restricts the coke formation. The introduction of K+ into S-1 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and the stability of the catalyst. The catalyst with excellent activity and stability is potential for industrial application.</p>

To address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation, Yu et al.'s ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy allows for rapid formation of zeolites without the limitations imposed by high crystallization temperatures and pH values. This enables metal species to effectively diffuse into the zeolite channels, overcoming the issue of precipitation and facilitating the incorporation of In3+ species. The resulting zeolites contain In species, which are beneficial for enhancing the propene selectivity and suppressing coke formation. Additionally, the introduction of K+ into the zeolite framework significantly boosts the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. Consequently, the designed catalyst demonstrates outstanding performance in propane conversion, making it a promising candidate for practical industrial applications.
