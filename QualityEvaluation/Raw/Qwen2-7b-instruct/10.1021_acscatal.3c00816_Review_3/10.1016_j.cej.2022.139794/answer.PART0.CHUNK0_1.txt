1. Conventional impregnation methods for supporting metal species on zeolites typically yield large-sized particles with poor dispersion. This limits their applicability for metals like Fe3+, In3+, etc., and hinders the development of catalysts with high stability under harsh conditions.

2. Zeolites, characterized by their ordered pore structures, high surface area, and thermal stability, are ideal carriers for anchoring metal clusters.

3. The developed catalyst, encapsulating potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters in silicalite-1 (S-1), achieves a remarkable propane conversion of 43.73% with a high propene selectivity of 97.14%. It also boasts an exceptionally high propylene productivity of 20.33 mol with a WHSV of 6.75 h1.

4. The catalyst maintains its efficiency with no apparent deactivation after 48 hours of operation, showcasing an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025 h1.

5. The addition of indium species significantly boosts propene selectivity and curbs coke formation.

6. The inclusion of potassium ions within the S-1 framework notably amplifies the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst.

1. 常规浸渍法在将金属物种支持到沸石上的过程中通常产生大颗粒，分散性差。这限制了Fe3+、In3+等金属的应用，并阻碍了在恶劣条件下开发高稳定性催化剂的发展。

2. 具有有序孔结构、高表面积和热稳定性的沸石是锚定金属簇的理想载体。

3. 所开发的催化剂，在硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）中封装了钾促进的铂-铟双金属簇，实现了惊人的丙烷转化率43.73%，丙烯选择性高达97.14%。它还具有极高的丙烯产率20.33 mol，每小时空间速度（WHSV）为6.75 h1。

4. 在连续运行48小时后，催化剂未出现明显失活现象，展现出极低的失活常数0.0025 h1。

5. 添加铟元素显著提高了丙烯选择性和抑制了焦炭形成。

6. 将钾离子引入S-1框架内显着增强了催化剂的活性和稳定性。
