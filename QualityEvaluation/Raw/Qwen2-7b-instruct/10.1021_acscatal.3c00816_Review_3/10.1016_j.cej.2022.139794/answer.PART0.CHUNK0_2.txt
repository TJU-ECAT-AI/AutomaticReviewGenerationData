<p>However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc. Exploring and constructing zeolites containing In species are desirable for potential catalytic applications.</p>
<p>The introduction of indium species greatly improves the propene selectivity and restricts the coke formation. The introduction of K+ into S-1 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and the stability of the catalyst. The catalyst with excellent activity and stability is potential for industrial application.</p>

To address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation, Yu et al.'s ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy allows for rapid formation of zeolites without the limitations imposed by high crystallization temperatures and pH values. This enables metal species to effectively diffuse into the zeolite channels, overcoming the issue of precipitation and facilitating the incorporation of In3+ species. The resulting zeolites contain In species, which are beneficial for enhancing the propene selectivity and suppressing coke formation. Additionally, the introduction of K+ into the zeolite framework significantly boosts the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst. Consequently, the designed catalyst demonstrates outstanding performance in propane conversion, making it a promising candidate for practical industrial applications.

为了应对直接合成金属封装过程中时间尺度不匹配的挑战，由Yu等人提出的超快速沸石结晶策略允许快速形成沸石，而不受高结晶温度和pH值的限制。这使得金属物种能够有效地扩散到沸石通道中，克服了沉淀问题，并促进了In3+物种的整合。由此产生的沸石含有In物种，这些物种对提高丙烯选择性和抑制焦炭形成非常有利。此外，向沸石框架中引入K+显著提高了催化剂的活性和稳定性。因此，设计的催化剂在丙烷转化方面表现出色，使其成为有前景的工业应用候选者。
