[1] "The catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in S-1 zeolite works as an efficient and stable catalyst for PDH."
[2] "The catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene."
[3] "No obvious deactivation occurs after 48h on stream, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1."
[4] "The introduction of indium species greatly improves the propene selectivity and restricts the coke formation."
[5] "The introduction of K+ into S-1 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and the stability of the catalyst."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the crystallization process. This allows for faster formation of zeolites, which can then encapsulate metal clusters more effectively. It ensures that metal species can diffuse into the channels of zeolites without precipitating under alkaline conditions. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, are significant improvements in their dispersion, stability, and efficiency in converting propane to propene.
