[1] "The catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 43.73% with 97.14% selectivity of propene and an extremely high propylene productivity of 20.33mol with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.75h1."
[2] "No obvious deactivation occurs after 48h on stream, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0025h1."
[3] "The introduction of indium species greatly improves the propene selectivity and restricts the coke formation."
[4] "The introduction of K+ into S-1 can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and the stability of the catalyst."
[5] "The catalyst with potassium-promoted Pt-In bimetallic clusters encapsulated in S-1 exhibits an outstanding performance for PDH and is promising for the further application in industrial processes."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures. This allows for the efficient encapsulation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework, preserving their size and structure. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant improvements in stability, reduced sintering, and enhanced catalytic activity, particularly in the context of propane conversion.
