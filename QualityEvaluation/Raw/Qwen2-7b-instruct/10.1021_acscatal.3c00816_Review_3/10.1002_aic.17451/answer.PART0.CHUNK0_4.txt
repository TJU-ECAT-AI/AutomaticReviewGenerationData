[1] "This CoO@S-1 catalyst exhibits an attractive propylene formation rate of 13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 with selectivity of >92% and is durable during 120-h PDH reaction with five successive regeneration cycles."
[2] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[3] "Additionally, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability."
[4] "The key findings of this study include the simple in situ crystallization method to obtain well-dispersed and anti-reducing CoO clusters encapsulated within S-1 channels."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the encapsulation of metal species within zeolites (M@zeolite) through a ligand-assistance in situ crystallization method. This approach allows for the encapsulation of ultrasmall cobalt oxide clusters (CoO clusters) within silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites, resulting in a catalyst (CoO@S-1) with an attractive propylene formation rate of 13.66 mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 and a selectivity of >92%. The high PDH activity is attributed to the encapsulated CoO clusters being favorable for propane adsorption and better stabilizing detached H* species, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters prevents over-dehydrogenation compared to the di-σ binding on metallic Co, contributing to superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. The encapsulation method provides a simple way to obtain well-dispersed and anti-reducing CoO clusters within S-1 channels, enhancing the catalytic performance.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略，通过使用助剂辅助的原位结晶方法解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配问题，实现了金属物种在沸石内的封装（M@沸石）。这种方法允许将超小钴氧化物簇（CoO簇）封装在硅酸盐-1（S-1）沸石中，形成一种催化剂（CoO@S-1），其丙烯生成速率可达13.66 mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1，选择性超过92%。这种高PDH活性归因于封装的CoO簇有利于丙烷吸附，并且能更好地稳定从丙烷脱氢产生的游离H*物种，导致与框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米颗粒相比，更低的脱氢壁垒。此外，CoO簇上的π键合丙烯能够防止与金属Co上的双σ键合丙烯相比的过脱氢反应，从而提高了丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。封装方法提供了一种简单的方法来获得S-1通道内的分散良好且抗还原的CoO簇，从而增强催化性能。
