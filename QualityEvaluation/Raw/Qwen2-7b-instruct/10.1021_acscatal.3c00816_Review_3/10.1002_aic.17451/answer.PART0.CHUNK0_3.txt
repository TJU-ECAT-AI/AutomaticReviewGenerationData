[1] "This CoO@S-1 catalyst exhibits an attractive propylene formation rate of 13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 with selectivity of >92% and is durable during 120-h PDH reaction with five successive regeneration cycles."
[2] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[3] "The encapsulated CoO clusters exhibit superior catalytic PDH performance than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[4] "The low level conversion was measured to quantitatively compare the catalyst activity (r(C3H6) and TOFCo)."
[5] "The results clearly demonstrate the PDH intrinsic activity follows the sequence of Co-acac@S-1>Co/S-1 >>Co-edta@S-1."
[6] "Moreover, it is found that energy barrier of rate-determining step shows a positive correlation with dissociative H2 binding energy (Edis-2H*, related to the process of H2(g)2H*), which can be a useful descriptor for further designing Co-based PDH catalysts."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the in situ crystallization of metal species within zeolite channels. This approach allows for the encapsulation of metal clusters within the ordered porous structure of zeolites, preserving the microporous framework and enhancing the diffusion of reactants and products. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant improvements in the stability and efficiency of the catalysts. Specifically, the encapsulated PtSn clusters exhibit higher activity and selectivity in the propane conversion process compared to their non-encapsulated counterparts. This is attributed to the enhanced stability of the clusters, facilitated by the zeolite support, which prevents sintering and reduction. Additionally, the encapsulated clusters enable better stabilization of the detached hydrogen species, leading to lower dehydrogenation barriers and improved catalytic performance.

The key benefits of this strategy include the preservation of the zeolite's ordered porous structure, which enhances the diffusion properties of the catalyst, and the ability to encapsulate metal clusters in a way that promotes their stability and reactivity. The encapsulated PtSn clusters demonstrate superior activity and stability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, highlighting the effectiveness of the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy in optimizing metal-based catalysts for industrial applications.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战，通过原位在沸石通道中结晶金属物种，从而解决了这一问题。这种方法允许在有序孔结构的沸石中封装金属簇，同时保留微孔框架，从而增强反应物和产物的扩散性。对于ZSM-5沸石中的PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的催化剂改进。具体来说，封装的PtSn簇在丙烷转换过程中的活性和选择性都有所提高。这归因于簇的稳定性增强，得益于沸石支持，可以防止聚集和还原。此外，封装的簇能够更好地稳定脱氢物种，导致较低的脱氢能垒和改善的催化性能。

这种策略的关键优势包括保持沸石的有序孔结构，从而增强催化剂的扩散特性，以及以促进簇稳定性和活性的方式封装金属簇。封装的PtSn簇在丙烷裂解反应中的活性和稳定性都表现出优异的效果，突显了超快速沸石结晶策略在优化基于金属的催化剂方面的重要性。
