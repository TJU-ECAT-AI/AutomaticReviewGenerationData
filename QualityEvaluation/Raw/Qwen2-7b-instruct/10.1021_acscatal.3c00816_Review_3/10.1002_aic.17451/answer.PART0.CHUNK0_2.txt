<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The CoO@S-1 catalyst exhibits high propane dehydrogenation activity due to its encapsulated CoO clusters. These clusters enhance propane adsorption and stabilize detached H* species, resulting in lower dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles.
