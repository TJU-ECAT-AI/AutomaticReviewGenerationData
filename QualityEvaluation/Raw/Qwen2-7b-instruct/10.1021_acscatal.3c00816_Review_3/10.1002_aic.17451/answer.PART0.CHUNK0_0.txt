[1] "The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles."
[2] "In comparison, such nanoparticles are not observed in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 catalysts, indicating that the Co species exist as subnanometric scale."
[3] "The results clearly demonstrate the PDH intrinsic activity follows the sequence of Co-acac@S-1>Co/S-1 >>Co-edta@S-1."
[4] "The deactivation rate (kd) values of these catalysts were calculated based on the first-order deactivation model,41 using low propane conversion data as shown in Figure S13."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the encapsulation of metal species within zeolites in-situ. This method ensures that the metal precursors enter the zeolite pores through the subnanometric pore windows, thereby avoiding the issue of large amounts of metal species locating on the zeolite external surface. As a result, the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are improved. Specifically, it leads to a more favorable propane adsorption and stabilization of detached hydrogen species, which reduces the dehydrogenation barriers compared to framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles. This strategy allows for the encapsulation of metal species at the subnanometer scale, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使金属前体直接进入通过亚纳米孔窗口的沸石孔，解决了直接合成过程中尺度匹配的挑战。这种方法确保金属前体能够进入沸石孔，从而避免了大量的金属物种位于沸石外部表面的问题。因此，PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能得到改进。具体来说，它促进了更有利于丙烷吸附以及从丙烷中稳定脱氢氢物种，这降低了与框架Co2+离子和Co3O4纳米颗粒相比的脱氢化壁垒。该策略允许在纳米尺度下封装金属物种，从而提高丙烷脱氢的催化性能。
