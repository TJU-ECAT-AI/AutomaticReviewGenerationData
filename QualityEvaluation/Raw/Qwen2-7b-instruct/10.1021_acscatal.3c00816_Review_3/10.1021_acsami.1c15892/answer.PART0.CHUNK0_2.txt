The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by significantly reducing the synthesis time required for the formation of metal clusters within zeolite frameworks. This technique enhances the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to a catalyst that demonstrates high performance and coking resistance in the context of propane conversion.
