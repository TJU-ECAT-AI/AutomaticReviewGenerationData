The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the swift formation of metal clusters within the zeolite framework. Specifically, this technique targets the creation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, which significantly affects their structure and catalytic performance, particularly in propane conversion processes.
