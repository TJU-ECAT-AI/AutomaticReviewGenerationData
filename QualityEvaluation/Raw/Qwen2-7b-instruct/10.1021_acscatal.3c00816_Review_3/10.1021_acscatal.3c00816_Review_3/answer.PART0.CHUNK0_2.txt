Answer: The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. This results in the complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C. The rapid crystallization facilitates the encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the zeolite matrix. The XRD spectra confirm complete crystallization, and ICP data demonstrate that increasing zeolite crystallinity leads to the formation of Pt nanoclusters. Optimizing the Pt and Sn loadings results in smaller PtSn clusters, which enhances the catalyst's performance. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of an impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst.

1.余等人提出了一种基于预混物年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器组合的超快速沸石结晶策略，以解决快速金属沉淀与缓慢沸石结晶之间的时标不匹配问题。这使得在170°C下仅用5分钟就能实现ZSM-5沸石的完全结晶。快速结晶有助于将PtSn簇封装到沸石基质中。X射线衍射谱图证实了完全结晶，并且电感耦合等离子体（ICP）数据表明，随着沸石结晶度的增加，硅酸盐基质中的Pt负载量增加，这证明了Pt纳米簇的形成，并显示了ZSM-5的结晶在相同超快速节奏进行。通过优化Pt和Sn的负载量，实现了PtSn簇尺寸从4nm减小至1nm，从而提高了催化剂性能。优化后的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出65%的初始丙烷转化率，远高于浸渍型Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂。
