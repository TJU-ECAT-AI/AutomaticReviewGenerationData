The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. This strategy enables complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C, reducing the crystallization time to 2 minutes at 190°C. The ultrafast rate of crystallization facilitates the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The ICP data show that increasing zeolite crystallinity leads to increased Pt loadings in the silica matrix, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. When the Pt loading is fixed at 0.32 wt % and Sn loadings are increased, the size of PtSn clusters reduces from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过结合前体年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器来解决直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配问题。这一策略使得在170°C下仅需5分钟即可完全结晶ZSM-5沸石，在190°C时可将结晶时间缩短至2分钟。超快速的结晶速率使PtSn簇能够在ZSM-5沸石中得到完全封装。ICP数据显示，随着沸石结晶度的增加，二氧化硅矩阵中的Pt负载量增加，这证明了Pt纳米簇的形成，并显示ZSM-5的结晶过程同样以超快速度进行。当将Pt负载固定在0.32 wt %并增加Sn负载量时，PtSn簇的尺寸从4 nm减少到1 nm。优化后的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出初始丙烷转化率为65%，远高于浸渍型Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。
