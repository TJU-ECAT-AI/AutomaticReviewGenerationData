Answer: The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by utilizing a combination of precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. This strategy allows for complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C, reducing the crystallization time to 2 minutes at 190°C. As a result, the PtSn clusters can be effectively and fully encapsulated within the zeolites. The ICP data shows that the Pt loadings in the silica matrix increase with the increased zeolite crystallinity, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters. In contrast, the Sn species are fully grafted into the silica matrix during the initial synthesis stage. By optimizing the Pt and Sn loadings, the size of the PtSn clusters can be reduced from 4 nm to 1 nm, leading to a significant enhancement in the initial propane conversion rate, reaching 65% for the optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst, surpassing that of the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst.

该策略通过结合预处理年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，解决了直接合成方法中金属封装过程的时间尺度不匹配问题。这种策略能够在170°C下在5分钟内实现完全结晶，将结晶时间缩短至190°C下的2分钟。由此，铂锡簇可以有效地被封装在沸石中。ICP数据显示，随着沸石结晶性的增加，硅胶基质中的铂负载量增加，这表明形成了铂纳米簇。相比之下，锡物种在初始合成阶段完全附着到硅胶基质上。通过优化铂和锡的负载量，铂锡簇的大小可以从4nm减少至1nm，导致丙烷初始转化率显著提高，达到65%，远超过浸渍铂/锡沸石-5催化剂的转化率。

Answer: The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. This results in the complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C. The rapid crystallization facilitates the encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the zeolite matrix. The XRD spectra confirm complete crystallization, and ICP data demonstrate that increasing zeolite crystallinity leads to the formation of Pt nanoclusters. Optimizing the Pt and Sn loadings results in smaller PtSn clusters, which enhances the catalyst's performance. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of an impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst.

This strategy allows for complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C. The increased zeolite crystallinity leads to the formation of Pt nanoclusters, which are crucial for the effective encapsulation of metal species. By optimizing the synthesis conditions, the size of PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix can be reduced from 4 nm to 1 nm. The encapsulated PtZn clusters exhibit high stability, withstanding a 220-hour stability test, thanks to their unique antisintering and antireduction capacity. In contrast, catalysts prepared using conventional calcination-reduction processes show lower propylene selectivity and faster deactivation during the PDH reaction.
