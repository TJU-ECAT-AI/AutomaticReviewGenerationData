[1] "However, the time-scale mismatch between the fast metal precipitation and the slow zeolite crystallization still causes challenges for effective encapsulation (Figure 5a)."
[2] "To address this issue, Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b)."
[3] "The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C."
[4] "Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters."
[5] "When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm."
[6] "This PtZn4@S-1-H is also highly stable throughout a 220 h stability test, which is attributed to the unique antisintering and antireduction capacity of encapsulated PtZn clusters."
[7] "As the reference materials, the Pt@S-1-H and PtZn4@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination-reduction process) exhibit a lower propylene selectivity of 80% and fast deactivation during 6 h of the PDH reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by utilizing a combination of precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. This strategy allows for complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C. The increased zeolite crystallinity leads to the formation of Pt nanoclusters, which are crucial for the effective encapsulation of metal species. By optimizing the synthesis conditions, the size of PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix can be reduced from 4 nm to 1 nm. The encapsulated PtZn clusters exhibit high stability, withstanding a 220-hour stability test, thanks to their unique antisintering and antireduction capacity. In contrast, catalysts prepared using conventional calcination-reduction processes show lower propylene selectivity and faster deactivation during the PDH reaction.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过结合预混体年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配问题。这一策略允许在170°C下仅5分钟内完成ZSM-5沸石的结晶。增加的沸石结晶度促进了铂纳米簇的形成，这对于有效封装金属物种至关重要。通过优化合成条件，可以将ZSM-5沸石矩阵中PtSn簇的尺寸从4 nm降低到1 nm。封装的PtZn簇表现出极高的稳定性，能够承受长达220小时的稳定性测试，这归因于它们独特的抗结块和抗氧化还原能力。相比之下，采用传统煅烧还原工艺制备的催化剂显示出较低的丙烯选择性和更快的PDH反应过程中失活。
