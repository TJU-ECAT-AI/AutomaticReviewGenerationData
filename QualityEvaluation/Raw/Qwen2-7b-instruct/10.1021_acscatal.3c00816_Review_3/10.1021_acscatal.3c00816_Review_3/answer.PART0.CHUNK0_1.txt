The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by combining precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. This results in complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within just 5 minutes at 170°C, reducing the crystallization time to 2 minutes at 190°C. The ultrafast crystallization rate enables the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The Pt loadings in the silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, indicating the formation of Pt nanoclusters and confirming that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds at an ultrafast pace. In comparison, Sn species are fully grafted into the silica matrix at the initial synthesis stage. When the Pt loading is fixed at 0.32 wt % and Sn loadings are increased from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows an initial propane conversion of 65%, significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过结合预处理年龄、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器来解决直接合成方法中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配问题。这导致在170°C下仅用5分钟，190°C下仅需2分钟即可完全结晶ZSM-5沸石。超快速结晶速率使得PtSn簇能够在ZSM-5沸石中完全封装。随着沸石结晶性的增加，二氧化硅矩阵中的铂负载量增加，这证实了铂纳米簇的形成，并表明ZSM-5的结晶以相同超快速速率进行。相比之下，锡物种在初始合成阶段完全被涂覆到二氧化硅基质中。当将铂负载固定为0.32 wt%，并增加从0到1.2 wt%的锡负载时，PtSn簇的大小从4 nm减少到1 nm。优化的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出初始丙烷转化率高达65%，远高于浸渍式Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。
