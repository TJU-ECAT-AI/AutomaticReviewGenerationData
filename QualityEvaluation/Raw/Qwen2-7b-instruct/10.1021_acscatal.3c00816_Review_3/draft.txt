        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings detailed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy to optimize the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites, with a particular emphasis on enhancing their efficiency and selectivity in the conversion of various hydrocarbons, including propane. There is also potential to extend this strategy to other metal clusters and zeolite types, broadening its applicability across different catalytic processes. The ability to rapidly form well-defined metal clusters within zeolite frameworks could open new avenues for catalyst design, especially in scenarios where the time-scale mismatch between synthesis and desired catalytic activity is a limiting factor. Additionally, exploring the role of electronic and structural modifications, such as those induced by the regioselective distribution of subnanometric CoO clusters, could lead to the development of catalysts with improved stability and activity for high-performance catalysis. Future work might also aim to integrate machine learning and computational approaches to predict optimal conditions for the crystallization strategy, further refining its application in the synthesis of advanced catalysts.
