The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling faster formation of zeolite structures. This leads to significant influences on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly enhancing the propane conversion efficiency.
