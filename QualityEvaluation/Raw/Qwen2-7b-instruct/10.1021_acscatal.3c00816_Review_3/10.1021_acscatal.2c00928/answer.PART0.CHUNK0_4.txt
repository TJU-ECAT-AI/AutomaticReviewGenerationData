The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the formation of well-dispersed PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. This results in enhanced stability and activity in the context of propane conversion.
