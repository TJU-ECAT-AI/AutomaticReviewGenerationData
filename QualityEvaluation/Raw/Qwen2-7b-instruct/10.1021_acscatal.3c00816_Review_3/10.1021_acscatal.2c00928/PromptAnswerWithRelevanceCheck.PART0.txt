Answer: The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the crystallization process. This enables the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites to occur more rapidly, aligning better with the kinetics of propane conversion. As a result, the structure and catalytic performance of the PtSn clusters are optimized for efficient propane dehydrogenation.
