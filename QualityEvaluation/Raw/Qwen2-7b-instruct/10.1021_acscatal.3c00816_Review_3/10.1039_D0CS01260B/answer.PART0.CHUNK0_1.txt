For the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al., the passage mentions:

"The hierarchical MgAl2O4 with flower-like morphology is used to support PtSn bimetals, achieving a high stability in ten cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration, due to the contribution of a great amount of MgAl2O4(111) facets exposed on the support."

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. uses hierarchical MgAl2O4 with a flower-like morphology to support PtSn bimetals, which ensures high stability during ten cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration. This stability is attributed to the exposure of a significant amount of MgAl2O4(111) facets on the support.

1. 邱等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略使用具有花朵形态的分级MgAl2O4来支持PtSn双金属，这确保了在PDH反应和再生周期中的高稳定性。这种稳定性归因于支持物上暴露的大量MgAl2O4(111)晶面。
