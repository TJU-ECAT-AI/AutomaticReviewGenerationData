[1] "Modification by doping has been approved as an effective strategy to improve the catalytic DH performances of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts, and the dopants include transition metals or rare earth metals (e.g., Ce, Zr, Y, Mg, etc.) and nonmetals (e.g., carbon and boron species)."
[2] "The addition of an optimal content of carbon into Al2O3 has been reported to improve the activity and stability of the supported PtSnK catalyst in the PDH reaction due to large specific surface area, weak and moderate acidity and strong resistance to coke."
[3] "The promotion effect of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with the boron species on reducing the coke deposition and enhancing the propylene selectivity is observed in the PDH reaction."
[4] "The addition of a proper amount of Ga species can also decorate and modify the Pt sites via the formation of PtGa alloys."
[5] "A high strength of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can prevent the sintering of PtSn sites by the SMSI effect, while the low amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can reduce the deposition of coke species during the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction."
[6] "In comparison with the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of the penta-coordinated Al3+ in Al2O3 also contributes to the high dispersion of Pt and Ga species on the support."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite matrices. This approach facilitates the encapsulation of metal species, such as PtSn clusters, within zeolites, particularly ZSM-5 zeolites. The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant:

1. **Formation**: The ultrafast crystallization allows for the quick formation of zeolite matrices, which serves as a protective cage for the encapsulated metal species, such as PtSn clusters, during synthesis. This helps in maintaining the integrity and structure of the metal clusters.

2. **Structure**: The zeolite structure provides a defined environment for the PtSn clusters, influencing their spatial arrangement and stability. The hierarchical and ordered nature of zeolites can lead to more uniform and controlled dispersion of the PtSn clusters, which is crucial for their catalytic activity.

3. **Catalytic Performance**: The encapsulation within zeolites can enhance the catalytic performance of PtSn clusters. The zeolite matrix can modulate the reactivity of the clusters, potentially leading to improved activity and selectivity for the dehydrogenation of propane. The encapsulation might also protect the clusters from sintering and coke formation, which are common issues in high-temperature reactions.

By utilizing this strategy, Yu et al. likely aimed to create a more efficient and controllable method for synthesizing PtSn clusters with optimized catalytic properties for propane conversion, which is a key aspect of their research.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略，通过允许快速形成沸石矩阵，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这使得能够在沸石中封装金属物种，特别是ZSM-5沸石，以实现PtSn簇的封装。这种策略对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响如下：

1. **形成**：超快速结晶允许快速形成沸石矩阵，这有助于在合成过程中保护封装的金属物种（如PtSn簇）。这有助于维持金属簇的完整性和结构。

2. **结构**：沸石结构为PtSn簇提供了定义良好的环境，影响它们的空间排列和稳定性。沸石的层次化和有序特性可能导致更均匀和控制更好的分散PtSn簇，这对它们的催化活性至关重要。

3. **催化性能**：在沸石中封装可以增强PtSn簇的催化性能。沸石矩阵可能调节簇的反应性，可能导致更高的活性和选择性，用于丙烷的脱氢。封装也可能防止簇的聚集和焦炭形成，这是高温反应中常见的问题。

通过使用这种策略，余等人可能旨在创建一种更有效且可控的方法来合成具有优化催化性质的PtSn簇，这对于丙烷转化是一个关键方面。
