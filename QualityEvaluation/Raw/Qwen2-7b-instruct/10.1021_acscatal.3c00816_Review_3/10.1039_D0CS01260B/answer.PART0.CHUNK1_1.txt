[1] "Employing the SOMC method using a precursor of Fe(oCp)2 (bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(ii)) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment, SiO2-supported isolate and stable FeII species in three coordination are constructed as the active sites for selectively catalizing the PDH reaction through a non-redox mechanism."
[2] "The isolated framework Fe2+ in MFI-type zeolites is proved to be the active site responsible for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of ethane and propane."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite frameworks. This approach facilitates the encapsulation of metal species, such as PtSn clusters, within the zeolite structure. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, are significant. The rapid crystallization process ensures that metal clusters are encapsulated within the zeolite matrix, leading to improved stability and activity of the catalyst. The encapsulation process helps in maintaining the integrity of the metal clusters, preventing their agglomeration or leaching during the synthesis and reaction processes. This results in PtSn clusters with optimized sizes and dispersion, which are crucial for efficient propane conversion in the PDH reaction.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使骨架沸石的快速形成，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法有助于将金属物种，如PtSn簇，封装在沸石结构中。对于ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显着的。快速结晶过程确保金属簇被封装在沸石矩阵中，这促进了催化剂的改进稳定性和活性。封装过程有助于保持金属簇的完整性，防止其在合成和反应过程中聚集或泄漏。这导致了具有优化大小和分散性的PtSn簇，这对于高效的丙烷转化在PDH反应中至关重要。
