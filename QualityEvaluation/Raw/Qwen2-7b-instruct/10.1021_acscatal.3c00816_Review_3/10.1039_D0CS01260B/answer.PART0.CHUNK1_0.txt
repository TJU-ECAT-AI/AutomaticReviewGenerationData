[1] "The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount."
[2] "For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16)."
[3] "The apparent activation energy of the PDH reactions declines from 245 to 165 kJ mol1 with increasing V loading in the V/Al catalysts, indicating the structural change in the active V sites over these catalysts."
[4] "The volcano-shape variation of the TOF values further suggests that the isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active in comparison with other V sites."
[5] "The in situ DRIFT spectral results demonstrate that the vanadium propyl (V-C3H7) and vanadium propenyl (V-C3H5) species may serve as the reaction intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane and further transformation into propylene."

1. The distribution of vanadium species on the supports is influenced by the loading amount.

2. At a surface density of 0.7 V nm², isolated vanadium species form. At 3.9 V nm², polymetric VOx species appear. At 13.1 V nm², crystalline V2O5 species are present.

3. The activation energy of the PDH reaction decreases with increasing vanadium loading, indicating changes in the active vanadium sites.

4. The volcano-shaped variation of the turnover frequency (TOF) values indicates that isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active compared to other vanadium sites.

5. Vanadium propyl (V-C3H7) and vanadium propenyl (V-C3H5) species are identified as reaction intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane and its subsequent transformation into propylene.

[1] "The PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2 and Al2O3 supports are also investigated, and the active sites depend on the character of the support and the synthesis method."
[2] "For the hydrothermal-prepared Ga-incorporated beta zeolites with high Si/Ga ratios, they are more active in the catalytic PDH reaction relative to the low-silica or Na-modified Ga-beta zeolites as well as the impregnated Ga catalyst on dealuminated beta zeolite."
[3] "Considering that the AlOGa bond facilitates the heterolytic activation of propane CH bond, the mononuclear Ga1 sites supported on γ-Al2O3 display a significantly higher PDH activity than the dinuclear Ga2Ox sites on SiO2."
[4] "The DFT calculation results of the EDH and PDH reactions on the Ga-doped and undoped γ-Al2O3(100) models demonstrate that the Ga modification can significantly improve the catalytic activity through the concerted and stepwise mechanisms with decreased CH activation energy barriers."
[5] "For the modified Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ba, the high dispersion state of β-Ga2O3 species on the α-Al2O3 is confirmed to be independent of the presence of Ba additives, and the tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites are covered with Ba atoms."

1. The active sites for the PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2, and Al2O3 supports depend on the nature of the support and the synthesis method.

2. Hydrothermally prepared Ga-incorporated beta zeolites with a high Si/Ga ratio exhibit higher catalytic PDH activity compared to low-silica or Na-modified Ga-beta zeolites, as well as Ga catalysts impregnated on dealuminated beta zeolite.

3. The AlOGa bond aids in the heterolytic activation of the propane CH bond. Mononuclear Ga1 sites supported on γ-Al2O3 show significantly higher PDH activity than dinuclear Ga2Ox sites on SiO2.

4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on Ga-doped and undoped γ-Al2O3(100) models indicate that Ga modification can enhance catalytic activity through concerted and stepwise mechanisms, reducing CH activation energy barriers.

5. For the modified Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ba, the high dispersion state of β-Ga2O3 species on α-Al2O3 is unaffected by Ba additives, and tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites are covered with Ba atoms.
