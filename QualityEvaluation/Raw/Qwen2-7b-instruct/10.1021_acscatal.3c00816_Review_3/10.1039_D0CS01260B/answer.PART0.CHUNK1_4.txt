How does the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation, and what are its effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion?

For instance, a 4 wt% Zn/TiZrOx catalyst displays a propylene yield of 1.25 kgC3H6 kgcat−1 h−1 at a propane conversion of 30% with a propylene selectivity of 95% in the PDH reaction at 550 C.217

The isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+ species rather than the Zrcus sites are identified as the active sites, which also show a low ability of coke formation for allowing the catalyst to extend the service life. An increased degree of ZnOx agglomeration causes a higher rate of coking reaction.

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of zeolite structures. This method leads to the formation of well-defined, ordered zeolite crystals in a shorter time frame, which is particularly beneficial for the encapsulation of metals like Pt and Sn within the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix. 

The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. The ultrafast crystallization ensures that the PtSn clusters are encapsulated within a precisely structured zeolite framework, which not only stabilizes the metal clusters but also optimizes their spatial arrangement. This results in improved catalytic activity and selectivity towards propane conversion, as evidenced by the high propylene yield and selectivity observed in the PDH reaction.

Furthermore, the isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+ species, which are formed within the ZSM-5 zeolite, are identified as the active sites for the PDH reaction. These Zn2+ sites show a low ability to form coke, thereby extending the service life of the catalyst. The structure of the catalyst, characterized by the presence of these active Zn2+ sites, enables efficient conversion of propane with minimal coke formation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy in enhancing both the formation and performance of metal clusters within zeolite matrices for catalytic applications.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略，通过在较短的时间尺度内形成有序的沸石结构，解决了直接合成方法中金属封装的时标不匹配挑战。这种方法能够快速生成精确结构的沸石晶体，特别适用于Pt和Sn等金属在ZSM-5沸石中的封装。

对于PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响至关重要。超快速结晶确保了金属簇在精确结构的沸石框架内被封装，不仅稳定了金属簇，还优化了它们的空间排列。这导致了丙烷转化的改进催化活性和选择性，如在PDH反应中观察到的高丙烯产量和选择性所证明的那样。

此外，形成了Zn2+物种的孤立三配位ZSM-5沸石中，这些Zn2+位点被确认为PDH反应的活性位点。这些Zn2+位点显示出较低的焦炭形成能力，从而延长了催化剂的使用寿命。催化剂的结构特征，包括存在这些活性Zn2+位点，使丙烷高效转化，同时最小化焦炭形成，证明了超快速沸石结晶策略在提高沸石矩阵中金属簇形成和性能方面的有效性。
