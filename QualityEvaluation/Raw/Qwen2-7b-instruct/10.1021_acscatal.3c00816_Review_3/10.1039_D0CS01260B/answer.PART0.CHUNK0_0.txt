The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This approach enables the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites in a significantly shorter duration than traditional methods. The strategy results in the creation of PtSn clusters with high dispersion and a well-defined structure, which in turn leads to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in propane conversion.
