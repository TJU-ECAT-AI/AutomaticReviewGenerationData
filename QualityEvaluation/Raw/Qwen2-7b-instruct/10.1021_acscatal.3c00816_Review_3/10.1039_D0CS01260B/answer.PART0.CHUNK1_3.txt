Employing the SOMC method using a precursor of Fe(oCp)2 (bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(ii)) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment, SiO2-supported isolate and stable FeII species in three coordination are constructed as the active sites for selectively catalizing the PDH reaction through a non-redox mechanism.201 With >99% propylene selectivity, the specific reaction rate is maintained at 3.13.9 × 104 s1 within 18 h of reaction. Either the supported metallic Fe(0) or FeOx nanoparticles can be obtained via the grafting procedure, and nonetheless, these sites exhibit relatively low activities and propylene selectivity. A sulfated Fe/SiO2 catalyst containing 5 wt% SO42 and 20 wt% Fe by impregnation synthesis is adopted in the PDH reaction with co-feeding of H2S gas.202 The Fe1-xS phase is considered as the active site for the reaction and its structural stability can be promoted by the co-fed H2S.

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of zeolite structures. This strategy allows for the efficient and controlled formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, optimizing their structure and catalytic performance. Specifically, the rapid crystallization facilitates the encapsulation of PtSn clusters, leading to enhanced propane conversion. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance include the optimization of the PtSn cluster size and distribution within the zeolite framework, which in turn improves the activity and selectivity for propane conversion. The rapid crystallization ensures that the PtSn clusters are well-integrated into the zeolite matrix, enhancing the stability and efficiency of the catalyst under reaction conditions.
