The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This innovative approach enables the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. It impacts the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of these clusters, leading to their high dispersion on the ZSM-5 surface. As a result, the PtSn clusters demonstrate a remarkable ability to convert propane efficiently. Moreover, they exhibit exceptional selectivity for propylene. These attributes collectively enhance their catalytic performance in the PDH reaction.
