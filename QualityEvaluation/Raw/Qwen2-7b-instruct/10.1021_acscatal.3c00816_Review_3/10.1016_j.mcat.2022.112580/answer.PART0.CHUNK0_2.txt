<p>In this work, different Co species over Silicalite-1 are synthesized via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere and investigated for PDH systematically. In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1).</p>
<p>According to the combined characterizations, it is confirmed that the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance, while bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air has much lower catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Through in-situ FT-IR characterization, it is revealed that Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar is incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed and then further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated Silicalie-1 framework with Co2+ species under high temperature calcination.</p>

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by synthesizing Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere. Specifically, when calcinated in an oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum), the catalyst Co-S-1-Ar shows superior performance for PDH. The TOF of Co-S-1-Ar is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air, which was calcinated in an oxidative atmosphere (air). The superior performance is attributed to the incorporation of highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species into the Silicalite-1 framework, which facilitates high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity for PDH. This contrasts with the bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air, which exhibit much lower catalytic performance. The in-situ FT-IR characterization indicates that Co2+ species are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed and then further anchored by silanol nests under high temperature calcination.

这项策略通过调节热处理气氛来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配问题，特别是在金属封装的超快速沸石结晶中。具体而言，通过在无氧气氛（Ar、5%H2/Ar和真空）下对Silicalite-1进行热处理，合成的Co物种显示了在PDH过程中的出色性能。Co-S-1-Ar催化剂的TOF是Co/S-1-Air（空气气氛热处理）的催化剂的约九倍。其出色的性能归因于Co2+物种被整合到Silicalite-1框架中，并且与Lewis酸位点一起形成高度分散的四面体配合物，这促进了高Lewis酸位点和丙烷吸附性质，从而导致PDH催化活性增强。这与Co/S-1-Air中聚集的大量Co3O4物种形成的低催化性能形成鲜明对比。原位FT-IR表征表明，Co2+物种通过替换Silicalite-1的硅醇基团被整合到框架中，在这种情况下，Co前体被Ar驱动以达到高度分散的硅醇基团，并在高温下进一步锚定并整合到Silicalite-1框架中形成Co2+物种。
