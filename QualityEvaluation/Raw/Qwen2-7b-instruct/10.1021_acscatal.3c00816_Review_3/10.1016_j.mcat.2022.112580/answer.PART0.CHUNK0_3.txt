[1] "In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1)."
[2] "It is noted that two absorption peaks located at around 470 and 741 nm attributed to Co3O4 species are observed in Co/S-1-Air catalyst."
[3] "From the characterization result of H2-TPR in Fig. 11 A, no obvious H2 reduction peak is observed over 0.6Co-S-1-Ar and 1.6Co-S-1-Ar catalysts, indicating the superior stable Co species correspondingly."
[4] "The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species."

1. The oxygen-free calcination catalyst Co-S-1-Ar shows a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) turnover frequency (TOF) of 41.9 h1, which is approximately nine times higher than that of the air-calcination catalyst Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1).

2. In the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, two distinct absorption peaks are detected at around 470 and 741 nm, which are attributed to the presence of Co3O4 species.

3. The H2-TPR characterization indicates that no evident H2 reduction peaks are observed over the 0.6Co-S-1-Ar and 1.6Co-S-1-Ar catalysts, suggesting the presence of highly stable Co species on these catalysts.

4. The in-situ FT-IR investigation reveals that the Co precursors are driven by Ar to achieve high dispersion over the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 at high temperatures. These Co species are then anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework to form tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species.

1. 在无氧热处理催化剂Co-S-1-Ar中，PDH的周转频率（TOF）为41.9 h1，约为无氧气氛热处理催化剂Co/S-1-Air（4.6 h1）的九倍。

2. 在Co/S-1-Air催化剂中，检测到约470和741 nm处的两个吸收峰，这些峰归因于Co3O4物种的存在。

3. H2-TPR表征显示，未在0.6Co-S-1-Ar和1.6Co-S-1-Ar催化剂上观察到明显的H2还原峰，表明这些催化剂上存在高度稳定的Co物种。

4. 在原位FT-IR研究中揭示，Co前体被Ar驱动，在高温下达到Silicalite-1的硅醇巢的高度分散状态。随后，这些Co物种通过硅醇巢锚定并整合到Silicalite-1框架中形成四面体配位的Co2+物种。
