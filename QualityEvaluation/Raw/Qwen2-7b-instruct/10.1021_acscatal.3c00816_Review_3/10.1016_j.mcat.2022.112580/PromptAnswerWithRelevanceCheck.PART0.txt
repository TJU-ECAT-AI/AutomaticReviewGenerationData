[1] "In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1)."
[2] "It is noted that two obvious peaks at 354 and 414 C appear over Co3O4 samples, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species and the further reduction of CoO species to Co species, respectively."
[3] "For the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, a salient peak is observed at 337 C, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species."
[4] "However, a different reduction curve is obtained on the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst where a barely visible peak exists at 417 C, demonstrating that almost all Co species are difficult to be reduced, which could be ascribed to the incorporation of mostly Co species into Silicalite-1 zeolite framework, resulting in the anti-reduction of Co species over Co-S-1-Ar catalyst."
[5] "And it is noted that the proportion of Co2+ species in Co-S-1-Ar surface is 100%, which indicates that the Co2+ content dominates in the surface of Co-S-1-Ar."
[6] "In addition, the proportion of Co2+ species over spent Co-S-1-Ar catalyst after reaction maintains unchanged, which indicates that this Co2+ species is very stable and is possibly attributed to the incorporation of Co sites into the framework of Silicalite-1 zeolites."
[7] "While the Co species of Co/S-1-Air mainly exist in the form of Co3O4 species, which are extremely unstable and easily reduced."
[8] "The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species."

1. The Co-S-1-Ar catalyst shows a TOF of 41.9 h1 for PDH, which is nine times higher than that of the Co/S-1-Air catalyst with a TOF of 4.6 h1.

2. The reduction behavior of Co species in Co3O4 samples involves the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and then Co species.

3. The Co/S-1-Air catalyst shows a peak at 337 C corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO species.

4. The Co-S-1-Ar catalyst displays a barely visible peak at 417 C, indicating that Co species are difficult to be reduced, which can be attributed to their incorporation into the Silicalite-1 zeolite framework, leading to anti-reduction of Co species.

5. The surface of the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst contains 100% Co2+ species, showing that this species dominates the surface.

6. The Co2+ species on the spent Co-S-1-Ar catalyst remains stable post-reaction, suggesting its incorporation into the framework of Silicalite-1 zeolites.

7. The Co species in Co/S-1-Air mainly exist as unstable Co3O4 species.

8. The formation of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar occurs through the dispersion of Co precursors reaching the silanol nests under high temperature, followed by anchoring by silanol nests and incorporation into the Silicalite-1 framework.

1. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂的PDH TOF为41.9 h1，比Co/S-1-Air催化剂的TOF（4.6 h1）高九倍。

2. Co3O4样品中的Co物种的还原行为涉及Co3O4到CoO再到Co物种的还原。

3. Co/S-1-Air催化剂在337°C处显示出一个明显的峰值，对应于Co3O4到CoO物种的还原。

4. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂在417°C处显示一个微弱的峰值，表明Co物种难以被还原，这可以归因于它们被整合到Silicalite-1沸石框架中，导致Co物种的抗还原性。

5. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂表面的Co2+物种占比达到100%，表明这种物种主导着表面。

6. 经过反应后的Co-S-1-Ar催化剂上的Co2+物种保持稳定，表明其被整合进了Silicalite-1沸石的结构中。

7. Co/S-1-Air催化剂中的Co物种主要以不稳定Co3O4物种的形式存在。

8. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂中Co2+物种的形成发生在Co前体在高温下到达硅醇基团并分散后，随后通过硅醇基团锚定并整合到Silicalite-1框架中。

[1] "The oxygen-free calcined catalysts Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air prepared by air calcination atmosphere in terms of TOFCo."
[2] "According to the systematic characterizations, it is found that mainly tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in Silicalite-1 framework over Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum, which shows high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, exhibiting superior catalytic activity for PDH."
[3] "While extra-framework Co3O4 species exist over Co/S-1-Air, which is extremely unstable and easily reduced, resulting in the low propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
[4] "The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species."

1. The Co species over Silicalite-1 via oxygen-free heat-treatment, specifically Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum, exhibits superior performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) compared to Co/S-1-Air prepared by air calcination atmosphere. Specifically, the turnover frequency (TOF) of Co-S-1-Ar for PDH is about nine times higher than that of Co/S-1-Air.

2. The high catalytic activity of the Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts is attributed to the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species within the Silicalite-1 framework. These Co2+ species have high Lewis acidity and a high capacity for propane adsorption, which leads to superior PDH performance.

3. In contrast to the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, which contains unstable Co3O4 species that are easily reduced, leading to low propane conversion and propylene selectivity, the Co2+ species in the oxygen-free calcined catalysts maintain their stability during the catalytic process.

4. The formation of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar occurs through a process in which Co precursors are driven by Ar gas to reach the silanol nests within the Silicalite-1 framework at high temperatures. Once there, the Co species are anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the framework, resulting in the formation of Co2+ species.

1. 通过无氧热处理制备的Co物种，特别是Co-S-1-Ar、Co-S-1-H2和Co-S-1-Vacuum，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的性能优于采用空气气氛热处理制备的Co/S-1-Air催化剂。具体而言，Co-S-1-Ar的PDH转化频率（TOF）大约是Co/S-1-Air的九倍。

2. Co-S-1-Ar、Co-S-1-H2和Co-S-1-Vacuum催化剂表现出高催化活性的原因在于其SiO2-1框架中主要存在四面体配合态的Co2+物种。这些Co2+物种具有高路易斯酸性以及高丙烷吸附能力，这导致了PDH的优异性能。

3. 相对于含有不稳定Co3O4物种且易于还原，导致低丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的Co/S-1-Air催化剂，无氧气氛热处理催化剂中的Co2+物种在催化过程中保持稳定性。

4. Co2+物种在Co-S-1-Ar的形成过程是通过Co前驱体被Ar气体驱动至SiO2-1框架内的硅醇基团处，并在高温下分散。随后，Co物种被硅醇基团锚定并融入框架，最终形成了Co2+物种。

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by synthesizing Co species over Silicalite-1 via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere. Specifically, when calcinated in an oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar, and vacuum), the catalyst Co-S-1-Ar shows superior performance for PDH. The TOF of Co-S-1-Ar is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air, which was calcinated in an oxidative atmosphere (air). The superior performance is attributed to the incorporation of highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species into the Silicalite-1 framework, which facilitates high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity for PDH. This contrasts with the bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air, which exhibit much lower catalytic performance. The in-situ FT-IR characterization indicates that Co2+ species are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed and then further anchored by silanol nests under high temperature calcination.

这项策略通过调节热处理气氛来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配问题，特别是在金属封装的超快速沸石结晶中。具体而言，通过在无氧气氛（Ar、5%H2/Ar和真空）下对Silicalite-1进行热处理，合成的Co物种显示了在PDH过程中的出色性能。Co-S-1-Ar催化剂的TOF是Co/S-1-Air（空气气氛热处理）的催化剂的约九倍。其出色的性能归因于Co2+物种被整合到Silicalite-1框架中，并且与Lewis酸位点一起形成高度分散的四面体配合物，这促进了高Lewis酸位点和丙烷吸附性质，从而导致PDH催化活性增强。这与Co/S-1-Air中聚集的大量Co3O4物种形成的低催化性能形成鲜明对比。原位FT-IR表征表明，Co2+物种通过替换Silicalite-1的硅醇基团被整合到框架中，在这种情况下，Co前体被Ar驱动以达到高度分散的硅醇基团，并在高温下进一步锚定并整合到Silicalite-1框架中形成Co2+物种。

The document explains that the use of an oxygen-free heat-treatment atmosphere leads to the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species, specifically Co2+ species, which are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework. These Co2+ species are responsible for the superior performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compared to the catalyst calcinated in an air atmosphere, the one calcinated in an oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar, or vacuum) shows a nine times higher turnover frequency (TOF) for PDH. The highly dispersed Co2+ species contribute to the catalytic activity by providing strong Lewis acid sites and efficient propane adsorption properties. In contrast, the catalyst calcinated in an air atmosphere contains bulk aggregated Co3O4 species, which exhibit much lower catalytic performance due to their instability and ease of reduction.

文档说明，采用无氧热处理气氛合成的抗还原钴物种，特别是二价钴（Co2+）物种，被整合到丝光沸石框架中。这些Co2+物种对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应表现出优异的性能负责。与在空气气氛下煅烧的催化剂相比，在无氧气氛（Ar、5%H2/Ar或真空）下煅烧的催化剂在PDH反应中的周转频率（TOF）提高了九倍。高度分散的Co2+物种通过替换丝光沸石的硅醇巢提供了催化活性，提供了强Lewis酸位点和有效的丙烷吸附特性。相比之下，空气气氛下煅烧的催化剂含有聚集体Co3O4物种，由于其不稳定性及其容易还原性导致催化性能显著降低。
