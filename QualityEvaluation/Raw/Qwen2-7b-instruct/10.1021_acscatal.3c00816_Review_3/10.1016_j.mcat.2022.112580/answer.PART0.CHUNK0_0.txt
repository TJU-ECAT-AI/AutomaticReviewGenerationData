[1] "In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1)."
[2] "It is noted that two obvious peaks at 354 and 414 C appear over Co3O4 samples, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species and the further reduction of CoO species to Co species, respectively."
[3] "For the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, a salient peak is observed at 337 C, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species."
[4] "However, a different reduction curve is obtained on the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst where a barely visible peak exists at 417 C, demonstrating that almost all Co species are difficult to be reduced, which could be ascribed to the incorporation of mostly Co species into Silicalite-1 zeolite framework, resulting in the anti-reduction of Co species over Co-S-1-Ar catalyst."
[5] "And it is noted that the proportion of Co2+ species in Co-S-1-Ar surface is 100%, which indicates that the Co2+ content dominates in the surface of Co-S-1-Ar."
[6] "In addition, the proportion of Co2+ species over spent Co-S-1-Ar catalyst after reaction maintains unchanged, which indicates that this Co2+ species is very stable and is possibly attributed to the incorporation of Co sites into the framework of Silicalite-1 zeolites."
[7] "While the Co species of Co/S-1-Air mainly exist in the form of Co3O4 species, which are extremely unstable and easily reduced."
[8] "The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species."

1. The Co-S-1-Ar catalyst shows a TOF of 41.9 h1 for PDH, which is nine times higher than that of the Co/S-1-Air catalyst with a TOF of 4.6 h1.

2. The reduction behavior of Co species in Co3O4 samples involves the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and then Co species.

3. The Co/S-1-Air catalyst shows a peak at 337 C corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO species.

4. The Co-S-1-Ar catalyst displays a barely visible peak at 417 C, indicating that Co species are difficult to be reduced, which can be attributed to their incorporation into the Silicalite-1 zeolite framework, leading to anti-reduction of Co species.

5. The surface of the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst contains 100% Co2+ species, showing that this species dominates the surface.

6. The Co2+ species on the spent Co-S-1-Ar catalyst remains stable post-reaction, suggesting its incorporation into the framework of Silicalite-1 zeolites.

7. The Co species in Co/S-1-Air mainly exist as unstable Co3O4 species.

8. The formation of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar occurs through the dispersion of Co precursors reaching the silanol nests under high temperature, followed by anchoring by silanol nests and incorporation into the Silicalite-1 framework.

1. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂的PDH TOF为41.9 h1，比Co/S-1-Air催化剂的TOF（4.6 h1）高九倍。

2. Co3O4样品中的Co物种的还原行为涉及Co3O4到CoO再到Co物种的还原。

3. Co/S-1-Air催化剂在337°C处显示出一个明显的峰值，对应于Co3O4到CoO物种的还原。

4. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂在417°C处显示一个微弱的峰值，表明Co物种难以被还原，这可以归因于它们被整合到Silicalite-1沸石框架中，导致Co物种的抗还原性。

5. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂表面的Co2+物种占比达到100%，表明这种物种主导着表面。

6. 经过反应后的Co-S-1-Ar催化剂上的Co2+物种保持稳定，表明其被整合进了Silicalite-1沸石的结构中。

7. Co/S-1-Air催化剂中的Co物种主要以不稳定Co3O4物种的形式存在。

8. Co-S-1-Ar催化剂中Co2+物种的形成发生在Co前体在高温下到达硅醇基团并分散后，随后通过硅醇基团锚定并整合到Silicalite-1框架中。
