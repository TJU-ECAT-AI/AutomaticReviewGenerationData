<p>In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h1).</p>
<p>According to the combined characterizations, it is confirmed that the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance, while bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air has much lower catalytic performance.</p>
<p>Through in-situ FT-IR characterization, it is revealed that Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar is incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1.</p>

The document explains that the use of an oxygen-free heat-treatment atmosphere leads to the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species, specifically Co2+ species, which are incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework. These Co2+ species are responsible for the superior performance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Compared to the catalyst calcinated in an air atmosphere, the one calcinated in an oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar, or vacuum) shows a nine times higher turnover frequency (TOF) for PDH. The highly dispersed Co2+ species contribute to the catalytic activity by providing strong Lewis acid sites and efficient propane adsorption properties. In contrast, the catalyst calcinated in an air atmosphere contains bulk aggregated Co3O4 species, which exhibit much lower catalytic performance due to their instability and ease of reduction.

文档说明，采用无氧热处理气氛合成的抗还原钴物种，特别是二价钴（Co2+）物种，被整合到丝光沸石框架中。这些Co2+物种对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应表现出优异的性能负责。与在空气气氛下煅烧的催化剂相比，在无氧气氛（Ar、5%H2/Ar或真空）下煅烧的催化剂在PDH反应中的周转频率（TOF）提高了九倍。高度分散的Co2+物种通过替换丝光沸石的硅醇巢提供了催化活性，提供了强Lewis酸位点和有效的丙烷吸附特性。相比之下，空气气氛下煅烧的催化剂含有聚集体Co3O4物种，由于其不稳定性及其容易还原性导致催化性能显著降低。
