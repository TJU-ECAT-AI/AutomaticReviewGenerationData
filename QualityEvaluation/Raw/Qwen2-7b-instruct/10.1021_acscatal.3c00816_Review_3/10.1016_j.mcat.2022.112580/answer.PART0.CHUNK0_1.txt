[1] "The oxygen-free calcined catalysts Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air prepared by air calcination atmosphere in terms of TOFCo."
[2] "According to the systematic characterizations, it is found that mainly tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in Silicalite-1 framework over Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum, which shows high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, exhibiting superior catalytic activity for PDH."
[3] "While extra-framework Co3O4 species exist over Co/S-1-Air, which is extremely unstable and easily reduced, resulting in the low propane conversion and propylene selectivity."
[4] "The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species."

1. The Co species over Silicalite-1 via oxygen-free heat-treatment, specifically Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum, exhibits superior performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) compared to Co/S-1-Air prepared by air calcination atmosphere. Specifically, the turnover frequency (TOF) of Co-S-1-Ar for PDH is about nine times higher than that of Co/S-1-Air.

2. The high catalytic activity of the Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2, and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts is attributed to the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species within the Silicalite-1 framework. These Co2+ species have high Lewis acidity and a high capacity for propane adsorption, which leads to superior PDH performance.

3. In contrast to the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, which contains unstable Co3O4 species that are easily reduced, leading to low propane conversion and propylene selectivity, the Co2+ species in the oxygen-free calcined catalysts maintain their stability during the catalytic process.

4. The formation of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar occurs through a process in which Co precursors are driven by Ar gas to reach the silanol nests within the Silicalite-1 framework at high temperatures. Once there, the Co species are anchored by the silanol nests and incorporated into the framework, resulting in the formation of Co2+ species.

1. 通过无氧热处理制备的Co物种，特别是Co-S-1-Ar、Co-S-1-H2和Co-S-1-Vacuum，在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的性能优于采用空气气氛热处理制备的Co/S-1-Air催化剂。具体而言，Co-S-1-Ar的PDH转化频率（TOF）大约是Co/S-1-Air的九倍。

2. Co-S-1-Ar、Co-S-1-H2和Co-S-1-Vacuum催化剂表现出高催化活性的原因在于其SiO2-1框架中主要存在四面体配合态的Co2+物种。这些Co2+物种具有高路易斯酸性以及高丙烷吸附能力，这导致了PDH的优异性能。

3. 相对于含有不稳定Co3O4物种且易于还原，导致低丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的Co/S-1-Air催化剂，无氧气氛热处理催化剂中的Co2+物种在催化过程中保持稳定性。

4. Co2+物种在Co-S-1-Ar的形成过程是通过Co前驱体被Ar气体驱动至SiO2-1框架内的硅醇基团处，并在高温下分散。随后，Co物种被硅醇基团锚定并融入框架，最终形成了Co2+物种。
