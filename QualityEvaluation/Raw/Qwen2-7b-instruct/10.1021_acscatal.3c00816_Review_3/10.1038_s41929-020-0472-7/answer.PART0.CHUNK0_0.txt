[1] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[2] "The platinumtin clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters."
[3] "The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity."
[4] "We note that the number of Pt sites and their reactivity must remain high while Sn is incorporated to (selectively) modulate the Pt reactivity to avoid hydrogenolysis and coke formation reactions."
[5] "As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically."
[6] "The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction was analysed by thermogravimetrydifferential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 6671, the amount of coke in all the samples remained below 1wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke was found."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite frameworks, which subsequently facilitates the efficient confinement and stabilization of metal species at the nanoscale. This strategy ensures that metal clusters, such as PtSn, are formed and remain stable within the zeolite channels, enhancing their catalytic performance. Specifically, it allows for the creation of PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, where these clusters are stabilized and maintain their structure even at high temperatures, ensuring optimal catalytic performance. The incorporation of tin (Sn) into these clusters modulates the properties of platinum (Pt), thereby preventing unwanted reactions like hydrogenolysis and coke formation. The stability of the PtSn clusters, combined with their ability to selectively modulate Pt reactivity, leads to a significant decrease in deactivation rates during the propane dehydrogenation reaction, while maintaining high intrinsic catalytic activity. This is further evidenced by the consistent catalytic performance across different pre-reduction treatments, despite variations in the deactivation constant. Moreover, the analysis of coke formation after the reaction indicates that the amount of coke deposited on the PtSn clusters remains low, suggesting that the stability of the catalyst is not significantly correlated with the amount of coke produced, thus supporting the effectiveness of the PtSn clusters in mitigating coke formation during the propane conversion process.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使沸石骨架的快速形成，有效地解决了直接合成过程中封装金属时的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法允许在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石通道内快速形成沸石框架，从而有效地将纳米尺度的金属物种进行封装和稳定化。这确保了铂锡（PtSn）簇可以在沸石通道中形成并保持稳定，从而增强其催化性能。具体来说，它允许在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石内创建PtSn簇，这些簇在高温下仍能保持结构稳定，确保最佳的催化性能。通过在沸石通道中引入锡（Sn），可以调节铂（Pt）的性质，从而防止不需要的反应如氢解离和焦炭形成。这些PtSn簇的稳定性结合了它们选择性调节Pt活性的能力，导致在丙烷脱氢反应期间显著降低失活率，同时保持高内在催化活性。进一步的证据显示，在不同的预处理条件下，尽管去活常数存在差异，但不同预处理条件下的催化性能保持一致，这支持了在丙烷转化过程中PtSn簇有效抑制焦炭形成的有效性。此外，反应后对焦炭形成的分析表明，沉积在PtSn簇上的焦炭量保持在较低水平，这表明催化剂的稳定性与产生的焦炭量之间没有明显的相关性，从而进一步证实了PtSn簇在丙烷转换过程中的有效性。
