[1] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[2] "The platinumtin clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters."
[3] "The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity."
[4] "We note that the number of Pt sites and their reactivity must remain high while Sn is incorporated to (selectively) modulate the Pt reactivity to avoid hydrogenolysis and coke formation reactions."
[5] "As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically."
[6] "The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction was analysed by thermogravimetrydifferential scanning calorimetry. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 6671, the amount of coke in all the samples remained below 1wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke was found."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite frameworks, which subsequently facilitates the efficient confinement and stabilization of metal species at the nanoscale. This strategy ensures that metal clusters, such as PtSn, are formed and remain stable within the zeolite channels, enhancing their catalytic performance. Specifically, it allows for the creation of PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, where these clusters are stabilized and maintain their structure even at high temperatures, ensuring optimal catalytic performance. The incorporation of tin (Sn) into these clusters modulates the properties of platinum (Pt), thereby preventing unwanted reactions like hydrogenolysis and coke formation. The stability of the PtSn clusters, combined with their ability to selectively modulate Pt reactivity, leads to a significant decrease in deactivation rates during the propane dehydrogenation reaction, while maintaining high intrinsic catalytic activity. This is further evidenced by the consistent catalytic performance across different pre-reduction treatments, despite variations in the deactivation constant. Moreover, the analysis of coke formation after the reaction indicates that the amount of coke deposited on the PtSn clusters remains low, suggesting that the stability of the catalyst is not significantly correlated with the amount of coke produced, thus supporting the effectiveness of the PtSn clusters in mitigating coke formation during the propane conversion process.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使沸石骨架的快速形成，有效地解决了直接合成过程中封装金属时的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法允许在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石通道内快速形成沸石框架，从而有效地将纳米尺度的金属物种进行封装和稳定化。这确保了铂锡（PtSn）簇可以在沸石通道中形成并保持稳定，从而增强其催化性能。具体来说，它允许在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石内创建PtSn簇，这些簇在高温下仍能保持结构稳定，确保最佳的催化性能。通过在沸石通道中引入锡（Sn），可以调节铂（Pt）的性质，从而防止不需要的反应如氢解离和焦炭形成。这些PtSn簇的稳定性结合了它们选择性调节Pt活性的能力，导致在丙烷脱氢反应期间显著降低失活率，同时保持高内在催化活性。进一步的证据显示，在不同的预处理条件下，尽管去活常数存在差异，但不同预处理条件下的催化性能保持一致，这支持了在丙烷转化过程中PtSn簇有效抑制焦炭形成的有效性。此外，反应后对焦炭形成的分析表明，沉积在PtSn簇上的焦炭量保持在较低水平，这表明催化剂的稳定性与产生的焦炭量之间没有明显的相关性，从而进一步证实了PtSn簇在丙烷转换过程中的有效性。

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid generation and stabilization of metal species within the porous structures of zeolite crystallites. This strategy facilitates the formation of subnanometric PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, which are crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance in propane conversion reactions. The high Sn content and activation temperature favor the formation of alloyed structures that enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. The subtle changes in the structural features of the PtSn clusters significantly impact their performance for propane dehydrogenation. The direct measurement of PtSn clusters using quasi in situ TEM techniques reveals the spatial distribution of Pt and Sn species, indicating that as the reduction time increases, the percentage of bimetallic PtSn clusters also increases, reaching over 40% in the samples treated for 12 and 22 hours. The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species is confirmed by changes in the CO absorption bands, CO-IR spectra, and CO chemisorption results. The spectroscopic data collectively suggest that pre-reduction treatment leads to the reduction of Sn(IV) species and enables interactions between the reduced Sn species and subnanometric Pt clusters, which significantly affects the catalytic performance of the PtSn clusters in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The initial activity on a per mol Pt basis remains relatively constant across different pre-reduction treatments, while the deactivation constant varies drastically. This indicates that the optimization of the activation conditions leads to a significant decrease in the deactivation rate, resulting in enhanced stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters for propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, the analysis of coke formation and its physicochemical properties reveals that the amount of coke deposited on the PtSn clusters correlates with the stability of the catalysts, highlighting the importance of minimizing coke formation for maintaining the catalytic performance during propane dehydrogenation reactions.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使金属物种能够在沸石晶体结构中的多孔结构中快速生成和稳定化，解决了直接合成过程中时间尺度不匹配的挑战。该策略促进了在ZSM-5沸石中形成亚纳米级别的PtSn簇，这对于实现丙烷转化反应的最佳催化性能至关重要。高Sn含量和激活温度有利于形成合金结构，从而增强催化剂在脱氢反应中的选择性和稳定性。亚纳米级别的PtSn簇结构的细微变化显著影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。直接使用超快速透射电子显微镜技术测量PtSn簇揭示了Pt和Sn物种的空间分布，结果显示随着还原时间的增加，PtSn双金属簇的比例也增加，达到12小时和22小时处理后的超过40%。CO吸收带的变化、CO-IR光谱和CO化学吸附结果证实了部分还原Sn物种与亚纳米级别的Pt簇之间形成的Pt簇交互作用。集体光谱数据表明，预还原处理导致Sn(IV)物种的还原，并使Sn物种与亚纳米级别的Pt簇发生相互作用，这显著影响了PtSn簇在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能。每摩尔Pt基础的初始活性在不同的预还原处理中保持相对恒定，而脱活常数则变化显著。这表明优化激活条件可以显著降低脱活率，从而提高PtSn簇的稳定性和选择性。此外，对焦炭形成及其物理化学性质的分析显示，沉积在PtSn簇上的焦炭量与催化剂稳定性有关，强调了减少焦炭形成对于维持丙烷脱氢反应期间的催化性能的重要性。

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of ZSM-5 zeolites. This allows for the simultaneous encapsulation and stabilization of metal species within the zeolite structure. As a result, the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significantly influenced. Specifically, the PtSn clusters are stabilized within the sinusoidal 10R channels of the zeolite, which enhances their catalytic performance for propane conversion reactions. The strategic use of zeolite confinement leads to subnanometric PtSn clusters with optimized electronic and structural features, promoting high selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The ability to control the interaction between Pt and Sn species through the reduction process enables the tuning of the catalyst's performance, as evidenced by the drastic changes in deactivation rates observed with varying pre-reduction times. This strategy optimizes the balance between the catalytic activity and stability, leading to enhanced efficiency in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

This research demonstrates how the catalytic properties of subnanometric platinum clusters (0.50.6nm) confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite can be modulated upon introduction of partially reduced tin species that interact with the noble metal at the metal/support interface. The platinumtin clusters are stable in H2 over an extended period of time (>6h), even at high temperatures (for example, 600C), which is determined by only a few additional tin atoms added to the platinum clusters. The structural features of platinumtin clusters, which are not immediately visible by conventional characterization techniques but can be established after combination of in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and CO infrared data, are key to providing a one-order of magnitude lower deactivation rate in the propane dehydrogenation reaction while maintaining high intrinsic (initial) catalytic activity.

[5] "It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appearance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."
[6] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116)"
[7] "In summary, neither the Pt LIII-edge nor the Sn K-edge EXAFS spectra show evidence of any kind of bimetallic interactions in this series of samples, in contrast to literature reports in which the two metals form well-established alloys21,22,23."

[12] "As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics."
[13] "When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work17; see Fig. 7b), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to propylene increased to 93%."
[14] "The slower deactivation is associated with the reductive atmosphere, because thermal treatment in N2 at 600 C does not alleviate the deactivation (Supplementary Fig. 46)."

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures, which allows for the encapsulation of metals in a time-efficient manner. This method facilitates the creation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, enhancing their formation, structure, and catalytic performance. Specifically, the method ensures that the Pt and Sn species are precisely controlled and distributed within the zeolite framework, leading to optimized catalytic behavior for processes such as propane conversion.

2. The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites include the precise control of metal distribution, the stabilization of the PtSn clusters within the zeolite channels, and the modulation of their electronic structures and coordination environments. These factors contribute to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity for reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

3. The optimized activation conditions developed in the current work, which involve a long reduction treatment at 600°C, are crucial for forming subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species. These clusters exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The incorporation of Sn is critical in suppressing catalyst deactivation while maintaining dehydrogenation catalytic activity.

4. The role of Sn in improving the selectivity to propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation is confirmed through studies on the influence of Sn loading in the K-PtSn@MFI sample. The formation of bimetallic PtSn clusters is significantly favored when Pt and Sn are confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

5. The optimized PtSn clusters remain ultradispersed after various thermal treatments, indicating high structural robustness. The location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels is preserved even after propane dehydrogenation, further confirming their high stability.

6. Comparison with results reported in the literature demonstrates that the initial activity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample on a per mol Pt basis is amongst the highest, while the deactivation rate is amongst the lowest. This indicates the potential of the optimized PtSn clusters for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

7. The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction remains below 1 wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke is found. The high initial activity, very slow deactivation, and size of the subnanometric PtSn clusters are preserved for three reaction cycles, highlighting their outstanding performance.

8. The potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst, activated under optimized conditions, is demonstrated through testing under more industrially relevant conditions, showing an initial propane conversion of 20% at 550°C and a high initial selectivity to propylene (>97%) under a high weight hourly space velocity of 118 h⁻¹. After nearly 70 hours of time on stream, the propane conversion decreased very slowly from 20 to 17%, showcasing the outstanding performance of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

9. The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may differ from those of corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, leading to unique reactivity. This difference is attributed to the specific arrangement and interaction of Pt and Sn within the zeolite framework, which can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for specific reactions.

2. 这一策略对铂锡簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响包括对金属分布的精确控制、铂锡簇在沸石通道内的稳定化以及它们电子结构和配位环境的调节。这些因素有助于增强丙烷脱氢反应的催化活性和选择性。

3. 当前工作中开发的优化激活条件，涉及在600°C下进行长时间的预还原处理，对于形成尺寸为0.5-0.6nm的亚纳米铂锡簇至关重要。这些簇在600°C条件下经过预还原处理后，表现出高活性、高选择性和稳定性，用于丙烷脱氢反应。

4. 锡在提高丙烯选择性和抑制催化剂降解方面的作用得到确认，通过对K-PtSn@MFI样品中锡负载量的研究。当铂和锡被限制在MFI沸石的10R通道中时，双金属铂锡簇的形成得到了显著的促进，导致增强的催化性能。

5. 优化的铂锡簇在各种热处理后仍然保持超分散状态，表明其结构具有高度稳定性。铂锡簇在10R通道的位置在丙烷脱氢反应后也得以保留，进一步证实了它们的高度稳定性。

6. 将结果与文献中报告的结果进行比较显示，K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h样品每摩尔铂基的初始活性是最高的，而降解速率是最小的。这表明优化的铂锡簇对于高效的丙烷脱氢反应具有潜力。

7. K-PtSn@MFI样品在丙烷脱氢反应后的焦炭含量低于1%，但没有发现稳定性和沉积的焦炭量之间的相关性。高初始活性、非常缓慢的降解、以及在反应周期内尺寸为亚纳米级别的铂锡簇的保持，强调了K-PtSn@MFI催化剂的出色性能。

8. 在更工业化相关条件下测试的K-PtSn@MFI催化剂展示了在550°C下初始丙烷转化率为20%，以及在高质量小时空间速度（118 h⁻¹）下超过97%的初始丙烯选择性。在近70小时的流体停留时间后，丙烷转化率从20缓慢降至17%，显示出K-PtSn@MFI催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的出色性能。

9. 亚纳米尺寸的双金属簇在受限空间中的几何和电子结构可能与在开放结构载体上对应的纳米颗粒不同，导致独特的反应性。这种差异归因于铂和锡在沸石框架中特定排列和相互作用，可以增强特定反应的催化活性和选择性。
