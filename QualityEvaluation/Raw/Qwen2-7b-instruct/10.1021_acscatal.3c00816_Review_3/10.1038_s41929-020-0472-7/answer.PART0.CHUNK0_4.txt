[1] "Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."
[2] "By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity2,3,4."
[3] "Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream."
[4] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[5] "It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appearance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."
[6] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116)"
[7] "In summary, neither the Pt LIII-edge nor the Sn K-edge EXAFS spectra show evidence of any kind of bimetallic interactions in this series of samples, in contrast to literature reports in which the two metals form well-established alloys21,22,23."
[8] "To avoid the oxidation of PtSn clusters in air, TEM experiments were carried out using a vacuum transfer TEM holder when transferring the reduced sample into the microscope (see details in Supplementary Fig. 19)25,26."
[9] "For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduction into the microscope (see Fig. 3eh)."
[10] "The formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially reduced Sn species during the H2 treatment is also reflected in the changes in the CO absorption bands in the range 1,8501,650cm1."
[11] "According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters."
[12] "As can be seen in Fig. 7a, after a short pre-reduction treatment (K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-0h sample), the initial conversion was 50% (the thermodynamic conversion from propane to propylene and H2 is 70% at a theoretical 100% propylene selectivity) and the selectivity to propylene was 82%, giving 18% hydrogenolysis products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and a very small amount of aromatics."
[13] "When the starting K-PtSn@MFI sample was kept in H2 at 600C for 1h before the propane dehydrogenation reaction (using the activation conditions of our previous work17; see Fig. 7b), then the initial activity for the dehydrogenation decreased slightly, whereas the selectivity to propylene increased to 93%."
[14] "The slower deactivation is associated with the reductive atmosphere, because thermal treatment in N2 at 600 C does not alleviate the deactivation (Supplementary Fig. 46)."
[15] "Note that no H2 was introduced into the feed gas in any of the above catalytic tests."
[16] "The good performance of the Pt species confined in the 10R channels of MFI zeolite is also reflected by comparison of the initial reactivity for propane dehydrogenation with results reported in the literature."
[17] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles47, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst."
[18] "Finally, to show the potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst activated under the optimized conditions, we tested the catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI under more industrially relevant conditions (for example, no N2 dilution) for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[19] "Conclusions The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity."

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures, which allows for the encapsulation of metals in a time-efficient manner. This method facilitates the creation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, enhancing their formation, structure, and catalytic performance. Specifically, the method ensures that the Pt and Sn species are precisely controlled and distributed within the zeolite framework, leading to optimized catalytic behavior for processes such as propane conversion.

2. The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites include the precise control of metal distribution, the stabilization of the PtSn clusters within the zeolite channels, and the modulation of their electronic structures and coordination environments. These factors contribute to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity for reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

3. The optimized activation conditions developed in the current work, which involve a long reduction treatment at 600°C, are crucial for forming subnanometric Pt clusters modified with partially reduced SnOx species. These clusters exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability for propane dehydrogenation. The incorporation of Sn is critical in suppressing catalyst deactivation while maintaining dehydrogenation catalytic activity.

4. The role of Sn in improving the selectivity to propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation is confirmed through studies on the influence of Sn loading in the K-PtSn@MFI sample. The formation of bimetallic PtSn clusters is significantly favored when Pt and Sn are confined in the sinusoidal 10R channels of MFI zeolite, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

5. The optimized PtSn clusters remain ultradispersed after various thermal treatments, indicating high structural robustness. The location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels is preserved even after propane dehydrogenation, further confirming their high stability.

6. Comparison with results reported in the literature demonstrates that the initial activity of the K-PtSn@MFI-600H2-22h sample on a per mol Pt basis is amongst the highest, while the deactivation rate is amongst the lowest. This indicates the potential of the optimized PtSn clusters for efficient propane dehydrogenation.

7. The amount of coke in the K-PtSn@MFI samples after the propane dehydrogenation reaction remains below 1 wt%, but no correlation between stability and the amount of deposited coke is found. The high initial activity, very slow deactivation, and size of the subnanometric PtSn clusters are preserved for three reaction cycles, highlighting their outstanding performance.

8. The potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst, activated under optimized conditions, is demonstrated through testing under more industrially relevant conditions, showing an initial propane conversion of 20% at 550°C and a high initial selectivity to propylene (>97%) under a high weight hourly space velocity of 118 h⁻¹. After nearly 70 hours of time on stream, the propane conversion decreased very slowly from 20 to 17%, showcasing the outstanding performance of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

9. The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may differ from those of corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, leading to unique reactivity. This difference is attributed to the specific arrangement and interaction of Pt and Sn within the zeolite framework, which can enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for specific reactions.
