<p>Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream.</p>
<p>The structures of bimetallic PtM catalysts (M=Ga, Zn, In, Sn) have been studied by in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1.</p>
<p>Subnanometric Pt clusters seem to show a higher probability of interacting with subnanometric Sn species during long reduction times. Such a characteristic indicates that Pt clusters are probably reduced first by H2, consistent with previous work showing full Pt reduction at <200C (ref. 14), followed by reduction of the Sn(IV) species and subsequent migration to meet the Pt clusters, which is also consistent with the time-resolved Pt LIII-edge and Sn K-edge XANES spectra of the pristine K-PtSn@MFI in H2 reported here (Supplementary Figs. 44 and 45).</p>
<p>To demonstrate the implications of the structural changes occurring during H2 reduction, we tested various K-PtSn@MFI samples as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Fig. 7g,h, the initial activity on a per mol Pt basis is almost the same, regardless of the pre-reduction treatments from 0 to 22h, whereas the deactivation constant varies drastically.</p>

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of ZSM-5 zeolites. This allows for the simultaneous encapsulation and stabilization of metal species within the zeolite structure. As a result, the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significantly influenced. Specifically, the PtSn clusters are stabilized within the sinusoidal 10R channels of the zeolite, which enhances their catalytic performance for propane conversion reactions. The strategic use of zeolite confinement leads to subnanometric PtSn clusters with optimized electronic and structural features, promoting high selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The ability to control the interaction between Pt and Sn species through the reduction process enables the tuning of the catalyst's performance, as evidenced by the drastic changes in deactivation rates observed with varying pre-reduction times. This strategy optimizes the balance between the catalytic activity and stability, leading to enhanced efficiency in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过允许快速形成ZSM-5沸石，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这使得金属物种能够同时封装和稳定在沸石结构中。因此，铂锡簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能受到了显著影响。具体来说，这些簇被稳定在沸石的正弦通道中，从而提高了它们在丙烷裂解反应中催化裂解为丙烯的能力。利用沸石的限制作用，导致亚纳米级别的铂锡簇具有优化的电子和结构特性，促进了丙烷的高效裂解和丙烯的生成。通过控制铂和锡物种之间的相互作用，通过还原过程可以调整催化剂的性能，如通过不同预还原处理时间观察到的大幅度活性衰减率变化所证明的那样。这一策略优化了活性和稳定性之间的平衡，从而提高了丙烷裂解反应的效率。
