The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid generation and stabilization of metal species within the porous structures of zeolite crystallites. This strategy facilitates the formation of subnanometric PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, which are crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance in propane conversion reactions. The high Sn content and activation temperature favor the formation of alloyed structures that enhance the selectivity and stability of the catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. The subtle changes in the structural features of the PtSn clusters significantly impact their performance for propane dehydrogenation. The direct measurement of PtSn clusters using quasi in situ TEM techniques reveals the spatial distribution of Pt and Sn species, indicating that as the reduction time increases, the percentage of bimetallic PtSn clusters also increases, reaching over 40% in the samples treated for 12 and 22 hours. The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species is confirmed by changes in the CO absorption bands, CO-IR spectra, and CO chemisorption results. The spectroscopic data collectively suggest that pre-reduction treatment leads to the reduction of Sn(IV) species and enables interactions between the reduced Sn species and subnanometric Pt clusters, which significantly affects the catalytic performance of the PtSn clusters in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The initial activity on a per mol Pt basis remains relatively constant across different pre-reduction treatments, while the deactivation constant varies drastically. This indicates that the optimization of the activation conditions leads to a significant decrease in the deactivation rate, resulting in enhanced stability and selectivity of the PtSn clusters for propane dehydrogenation. Additionally, the analysis of coke formation and its physicochemical properties reveals that the amount of coke deposited on the PtSn clusters correlates with the stability of the catalysts, highlighting the importance of minimizing coke formation for maintaining the catalytic performance during propane dehydrogenation reactions.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使金属物种能够在沸石晶体结构中的多孔结构中快速生成和稳定化，解决了直接合成过程中时间尺度不匹配的挑战。该策略促进了在ZSM-5沸石中形成亚纳米级别的PtSn簇，这对于实现丙烷转化反应的最佳催化性能至关重要。高Sn含量和激活温度有利于形成合金结构，从而增强催化剂在脱氢反应中的选择性和稳定性。亚纳米级别的PtSn簇结构的细微变化显著影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。直接使用超快速透射电子显微镜技术测量PtSn簇揭示了Pt和Sn物种的空间分布，结果显示随着还原时间的增加，PtSn双金属簇的比例也增加，达到12小时和22小时处理后的超过40%。CO吸收带的变化、CO-IR光谱和CO化学吸附结果证实了部分还原Sn物种与亚纳米级别的Pt簇之间形成的Pt簇交互作用。集体光谱数据表明，预还原处理导致Sn(IV)物种的还原，并使Sn物种与亚纳米级别的Pt簇发生相互作用，这显著影响了PtSn簇在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能。每摩尔Pt基础的初始活性在不同的预还原处理中保持相对恒定，而脱活常数则变化显著。这表明优化激活条件可以显著降低脱活率，从而提高PtSn簇的稳定性和选择性。此外，对焦炭形成及其物理化学性质的分析显示，沉积在PtSn簇上的焦炭量与催化剂稳定性有关，强调了减少焦炭形成对于维持丙烷脱氢反应期间的催化性能的重要性。
