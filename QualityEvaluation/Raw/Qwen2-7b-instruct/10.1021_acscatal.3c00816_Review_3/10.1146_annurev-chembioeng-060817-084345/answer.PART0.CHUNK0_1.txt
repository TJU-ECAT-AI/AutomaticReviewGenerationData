The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the formation of the zeolite structure. This allows for the rapid creation of a stable matrix for metal clusters, such as PtSn, which can be encapsulated within the zeolite. The rapid crystallization facilitates the formation of PtSn clusters with a specific size and distribution within the ZSM-5 zeolite framework. This results in improved structure integrity and enhanced catalytic performance due to optimized interaction between the metal clusters and the zeolite surface. Specifically, in the context of propane conversion, the encapsulated PtSn clusters demonstrate higher activity and selectivity towards desired products compared to unsupported PtSn catalysts, owing to the protective and stabilizing properties of the zeolite matrix. The encapsulation also mitigates sintering and agglomeration issues commonly encountered with unsupported metal catalysts, leading to better long-term stability and efficiency in the conversion process.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速直接合成过程中的晶体形成，解决了金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这允许快速生成一个稳定的骨架，用于金属簇（如PtSn）的封装。快速结晶促进了ZSM-5沸石框架内PtSn簇的形成，具有特定的大小和分布。这导致结构完整性和催化性能的提升，因为金属簇与沸石表面之间得到了优化的相互作用。在丙烷转换的背景下，封装的PtSn簇显示出了更高的活性和选择性，与无支撑的PtSn催化剂相比，由于沸石骨架的保护和稳定性质。封装还缓解了无支撑金属催化剂常见的聚集和团聚问题，导致更好的长期稳定性和转化效率。
