The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. aims to address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling faster and more efficient crystallization of zeolites. This results in the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites that exhibit specific structures and enhanced catalytic performance, particularly in the context of propane conversion. The rapid crystallization allows for better control over the size and distribution of the PtSn clusters, leading to improved activity and selectivity in the conversion of propane to desired products. The precise mechanisms involve the accelerated nucleation and growth of zeolite crystals, which facilitates the encapsulation of PtSn nanoparticles in a well-defined manner, optimizing their catalytic properties for applications such as propane conversion.
