[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C."
[2] "This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species."
[3] "After an induction time of 1 h, the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (crystallized at 100 C) achieved the best performance giving a propene yield of 60%, equivalent to a STY of 15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 10)."
[4] "It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C."
[5] "Similar studies investigating V loading (120 wt%) and its effect on the surface V species present in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts reported a volcano plot-type trend between V loading and catalytic performance, with maximum activity being observed at 12 wt% V loading."

1. The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH) was used to synthesize mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, with the crystallization temperature varied between 25120 C.
2. The crystallization temperature affected the distribution of different surface V species.
3. The VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, crystallized at 100 C, achieved the best performance with a propene yield of 60% and a space time yield (STY) of 15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 after an induction time of 1 h.
4. The crystallization temperature directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts due to the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C.
5. Studies on V loading (120 wt%) showed a volcano plot-type trend between V loading and catalytic performance, with maximum activity observed at 12 wt% V loading.

1. 使用阳离子阴离子双水解方法（CADH）合成了具有高比表面积和纯γ-Al2O3相的介孔Al2O3，结晶温度在25至120 C之间变化。
2. 结晶温度影响了表面V物种的分布。
3. 在100 C结晶后的VOx/Al2O3催化剂，在诱导时间为1小时后，获得了60%的丙烯产率和每催化剂每小时15 molC3H6的时空产率（STY）。
4. 结晶温度直接影响了VOx/Al2O3催化剂的催化性能，随着结晶温度的增加至100 C，Lewis酸中心的数量增加。
5. 研究发现V负载（120 wt%）与催化性能之间存在火山图趋势，最大活性出现在12 wt% V负载下。
