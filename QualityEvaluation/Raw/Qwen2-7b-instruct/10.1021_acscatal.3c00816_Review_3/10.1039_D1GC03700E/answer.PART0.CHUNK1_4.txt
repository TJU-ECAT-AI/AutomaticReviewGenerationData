[1] "The cationanion double hydrolysis approach (CADH), used for the synthesis of mesoporous Al2O3 with high surface area and a pure γ-Al2O3 phase, was undertaken with the crystallisation temperature varied between 25120 C.141"
[2] "This in turn affected the distribution of different surface V species. After an induction time of 1 h, the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst (crystallized at 100 C) achieved the best performance giving a propene yield of 60%, equivalent to a STY of 15 molC3H6 kg1cat h1 (Table 6, entry 10)."
[3] "It was found that the crystallisation temperature of the support directly influenced the catalytic performance of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, which was a consequence of the increase in Lewis acid sites with increasing crystallization temperatures up to 100 C."
[4] "Results from successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles indicated that the catalyst reached a stable state displaying excellent regeneration stability after two dehydrogenation cycles."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing rapid formation of zeolite frameworks. This method significantly accelerates the crystallization process, enabling the efficient incorporation of metal species into the zeolite structure. The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are profound. Specifically, it facilitates the precise control of metal dispersion and distribution within the zeolite matrix, which is critical for achieving optimal catalytic activity.

The rapid crystallization enables the formation of a stable, mesoporous structure that provides an ideal microenvironment for PtSn clusters. This results in a well-dispersed metal phase, which is essential for maximizing the surface area available for catalytic reactions. The enhanced stability of the PtSn clusters within the zeolite framework ensures that they remain active and functional over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, indicating the catalyst's excellent regeneration stability.

The method allows for the creation of a catalyst that exhibits high propane conversion efficiency and selectivity for propene production. The accelerated crystallization process ensures that the zeolite matrix and embedded metal clusters are optimized for the specific requirements of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, leading to improved catalytic performance. The ability to maintain high activity and selectivity after repeated cycles of dehydrogenation and regeneration is a testament to the robustness of the PtSn clusters encapsulated within the zeolite structure.

In summary, the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. significantly enhances the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites by accelerating the crystallization process, promoting efficient metal dispersion, and ensuring the stability of the clusters over multiple reaction cycles. This approach leads to the development of highly active and durable catalysts for the direct dehydrogenation of propane, making it a valuable tool in the field of catalysis and chemical engineering.
