[1] "Yu et al. explored the influence of solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd) and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3 in tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "At 580 C, initial propene yields of 63.5% and 57.5% were observed for PtGa/Hd-Al2O3 and PtGa/Sg-Al2O3, respectively."
[3] "It was shown that AlV sites facilitate high dispersion of the active Pt and Ga ions, and result in strong metalsupport interactions."
[4] "Additionally, hydrogen spillover was more effective due to the increased dispersion, which aided the desorption of H2 from the catalyst."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by utilizing solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd), and commercially (C) obtained aluminum oxide. This method tunes the coordination structure of aluminum trivalent (Al3+) species in platinum gallium (PtGa)/aluminum oxide (Al2O3) catalysts. At 580°C, the initial propene yields for PtGa/hydrothermally synthesized (Hd)-Al2O3 and PtGa/solgel (Sg)-Al2O3 catalysts were observed to be 63.5% and 57.5%, respectively. The aluminum vanadium (AlV) sites facilitate the high dispersion of active platinum (Pt) and gallium (Ga) ions, leading to strong interactions between the metal and the support. The increased dispersion enhances hydrogen spillover, which aids in the more effective desorption of hydrogen (H2) from the catalyst, thereby improving its performance.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过利用溶胶（Sg）、水热合成（Hd）和商业购得的铝氧化物来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法调整了铂金镓（PtGa）/氧化铝（Al2O3）催化剂中铝三价（Al3+）物种的配位结构。在580°C下，对于水热合成（Hd）-Al2O3和溶胶（Sg）-Al2O3催化剂，初始丙烯产率分别观察到为63.5%和57.5%。铝五价（AlV）位点促进活性铂（Pt）和镓（Ga）离子的高度分散，并导致金属与支持之间的强相互作用。增加的分散度提高了氢扩散率，从而促进了催化剂上氢（H2）的有效脱附，进而改善了其性能。
