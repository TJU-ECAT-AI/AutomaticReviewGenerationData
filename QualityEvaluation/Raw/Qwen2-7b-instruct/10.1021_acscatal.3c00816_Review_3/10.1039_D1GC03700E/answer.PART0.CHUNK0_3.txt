[1] "Yu et al. investigated the influence of solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd) and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3 in tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "At 580 C, initial propene yields of 63.5% and 57.5% were observed for PtGa/Hd-Al2O3 and PtGa/Sg-Al2O3, respectively."
[3] "It was shown that AlV sites facilitate high dispersion of the active Pt and Ga ions, and result in strong metalsupport interactions."
[4] "Additionally, hydrogen spillover was more effective due to the increased dispersion, which aided the desorption of H2 from the catalyst."

Yu et al. explored the impact of different aluminum oxide preparations, including solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd), and commercially (C) sourced materials, on the coordination structure of Al3+ ions in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts. At 580°C, they achieved initial propene yields of 63.5% and 57.5% for catalysts prepared with hydrothermally synthesized (Hd) and solgel (Sg) aluminum oxide, respectively. The presence of AlV sites was instrumental in enhancing the dispersion of active Pt and Ga ions, strengthening the interaction between the metal and the support. Moreover, this increased dispersion facilitated more effective hydrogen spillover, which in turn promoted the desorption of hydrogen from the catalyst surface.

余等人研究了不同铝氧化物制备方法，包括溶胶（Sg）、水热合成（Hd）和商业（C）获得的材料，对PtGa/Al2O3催化剂中Al3+离子的配位结构的影响。在580°C下，他们分别使用水热合成（Hd）和溶胶（Sg）铝氧化物制备的催化剂，实现了63.5%和57.5%的初始丙烯产率。AlV位点促进了活性Pt和Ga离子的高度分散，并加强了金属与支持之间的相互作用。此外，这种增加的分散度使氢溢出更为有效，从而促进了氢从催化剂表面的脱附。
