[1] "The development of an active, selective and stable catalyst is essential for dehydrogenation to be considered as a viable process in the near- and long-term future."
[2] "Gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) is characterized by a high number and density of medium-strong acid sites, which can lead to undesired side reactions."
[3] "The importance of Al speciation in improving catalyst performance and stability was investigated by Shi et al. The effect of surface penta-coordinated (AlV), Al3+ sites on a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst was investigated and after a 24 h reaction, a 4.1% drop in propane conversion with 45% propene yield was observed, corresponding to a STY of 95 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1 (Table 3, entry 8)."
[4] "The authors postulated the main active site for CH activation was Ga3+ embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework."

1. The active, selective, and stable catalyst is crucial for dehydrogenation to be viable in the near and long term. 
2. Gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) has medium-strong acid sites that can lead to unwanted side reactions. 
3. The study by Shi et al. found that surface penta-coordinated (AlV), Al3+ sites on a PtSn/γ-Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst led to a 4.1% drop in propane conversion and 45% propene yield after 24 hours, resulting in a STY of 95 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1.
4. The main active site for CH activation was identified as Ga3+ embedded within the γ-Al2O3 framework.

1. 在近中期和长期中，活性、选择性和稳定的催化剂对于脱氢被认为是可行的。
2. 硼铝氧三元体（γ-Al2O3）具有中等强度的酸性位点，可能导致不希望的副反应。
3. 希等人的研究发现，在PtSn/γ-Al2O3纳米片催化剂的表面五配位（AlV）、Al3+位点上，24小时后的丙烷转化率下降了4.1%，丙烯产率为45%，对应于95 molC3H6 kgcat1 h1的时空产率（STY）。
4. 活动位点主要为嵌入γ-Al2O3框架中的Ga3+。
