[1] "The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. aims to address the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This is accomplished through the rapid growth of zeolite crystals in a controlled environment, allowing for the encapsulation of metal clusters in a short time frame."
[2] "This approach has significant effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The rapid crystallization process ensures that the metal clusters are evenly distributed within the zeolite framework, leading to enhanced uniformity and stability."
[3] "In the context of propane conversion, the PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit improved catalytic activity and selectivity. The rapid encapsulation process facilitates the formation of active sites that are optimized for the dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in increased propane conversion rates and higher yields of propene."
