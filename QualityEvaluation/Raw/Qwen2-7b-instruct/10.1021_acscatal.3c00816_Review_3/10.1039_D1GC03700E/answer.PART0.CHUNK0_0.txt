[1] "Yu et al. explored the influence of solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd) and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3 in tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts."
[2] "At 580 C, initial propene yields of 63.5% and 57.5% were observed for PtGa/Hd-Al2O3 and PtGa/Sg-Al2O3, respectively."
[3] "The enhanced performance was ascribed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects resulting in changes to the adsorption properties of Pt."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by utilizing solgel (Sg), hydrothermally synthesized (Hd), and commercially (C) obtained Al2O3. These materials were used to tune the coordination structure of Al3+ species in PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts. Specifically, at 580°C, initial propene yields of 63.5% and 57.5% were observed for PtGa/Hd-Al2O3 and PtGa/Sg-Al2O3, respectively. The enhanced performance was attributed to electron transfer and acid site modulation effects that changed the adsorption properties of Pt.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过利用溶胶（Sg）、水热合成（Hd）和商业（C）获得的Al2O3来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这些材料被用于调整PtGa/Al2O3催化剂中Al3+物种的配位结构。具体来说，在580°C时，对于PtGa/Hd-Al2O3和PtGa/Sg-Al2O3，初始丙烯产率分别为63.5%和57.5%。性能提升归因于电子转移和酸基修饰效应，这些效应改变了Pt的吸附性质。
