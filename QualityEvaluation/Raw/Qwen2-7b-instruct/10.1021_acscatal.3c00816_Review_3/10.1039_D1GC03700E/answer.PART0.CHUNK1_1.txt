[1] "Jeon et al. reported the modification of ZrO2 with a vanadium dopant that exhibited an initial propene yield of 28%, excellent recyclability over ten cycles with no change in the active sites, and twice the activity observed in bulk un-doped ZrO2."
[2] "This was attributed to an increase in Lewis acidic (Zrcus4+) active sites, that are a consequence of structural transformation."
[3] "Additionally, the authors discovered that regardless of the vanadium content, all the catalysts exhibited a propene selectivity in excess of 98%."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of the zeolite structure. This strategy facilitates the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion. By accelerating the crystallization process, the strategy ensures that the metal clusters are encapsulated within the zeolite framework in a well-defined manner, which is crucial for their catalytic activity. The rapid formation of the zeolite structure helps in maintaining the integrity of the PtSn clusters, thereby preserving their catalytic performance over multiple reaction cycles. Moreover, the enhanced dispersion and stability of the PtSn clusters within the zeolite matrix lead to improved propane conversion efficiency, as evidenced by the increased propene yield and recyclability observed in the catalysts developed through this strategy.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战。通过这种方式，该策略能够加速形成沸石结构，从而解决金属簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能问题，尤其是在丙烷转化的背景下。通过加速结晶过程，该策略确保了在沸石骨架内以明确的方式封装PtSn簇，这对于它们的催化活性至关重要。快速形成的沸石结构有助于保持金属簇的完整性，从而维持其在多个反应周期内的催化性能。此外，沸石矩阵中PtSn簇的增强分散性和稳定性导致了更高的丙烷转化效率，这体现在催化剂通过这种策略开发时观察到的更高丙烯产率和可回收性上。
