Chen et al. reported that nickel molybdates were active for ODH-O2 and in particular the α-NiMoO4 phase exhibited an enhanced yield compared to NiO and β-NiMoO4.224 Physical grinding of Mo and Ni precursors also led to the absence of NiO in α-NiMoO4 when compared to the analogous co-precipitation technique. It was shown that NiMoO4 had enhanced ODH-O2 performance when comparing mesoporous to bulk catalysts, but only due to the enhanced number of active sites related to the increased surface area, and not the improved mass transfer properties that usually accompany mesoporosity.225 The mesoporous catalysts had a lower specific productivity due to the loss of MoO3 from the surface of the catalysts during synthesis. This confirmed that MoO3 exhibits favourable activity to NiMoO4 for the ODH-O2 reaction (Table 10, entry 7).NiO has been found to be detrimental to ODH-O2 selectivity, favouring overoxidation products. Nb was found to be a superior dopant for NiO based catalysts, due to a reduction in the surface concentration of electrophilic O species and increased surface acidity. However, propene was still not the major product over NiO at around 10% conversion,226 suggesting that NiO-based catalysts are limited in their application for ODH-O2. In comparison to Nb-NiO catalysts, α-NiMoO4 showed a selectivity of 75% at roughly 10% conversion, with propene being the major product at similar conversions to Nb-NiO. The NiO-polyoxometalates have been shown to stabilise the adsorbed oxygen at the surface, which would limit overoxidation,227 leading to the conclusion that NiO oxygen is too labile to achieve a high selectivity. When undertaking surface polymeric phosphate modification of NiO nanoparticles (NiO-SPP), an increase in selectivity of 23 times for NiO-SPP's at isoconversion was shown (Table 10, entry 5).228 This is due to the polymeric phosphates weaker interaction with propene when compared to NiO nanoparticles, leading to a higher desorption rate and therefore higher selectivity.

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of ZSM-5 zeolites. This strategy accelerates the crystallization process, allowing for the incorporation of metal clusters, such as PtSn, within the zeolite framework. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, are significant. The mesoporous structure of the ZSM-5 zeolite provides a larger surface area, enhancing the number of active sites for the ODH-O2 reaction. However, the mesoporous catalysts exhibit lower specific productivity due to the loss of MoO3 from the surface during synthesis. This confirms that α-NiMoO4, with its enhanced surface area, is more active than bulk NiMoO4 for the ODH-O2 reaction. Nickel oxide (NiO) is found to be detrimental to ODH-O2 selectivity, favoring overoxidation products. Nickel niobate (Nb-NiO) catalysts are superior to pure NiO catalysts due to the reduction in surface concentration of electrophilic O species and increased surface acidity, leading to higher selectivity for propene. The α-NiMoO4 phase shows a selectivity of 75% at around 10% conversion, indicating its effectiveness in the ODH-O2 reaction. Surface polymeric phosphate modification of NiO nanoparticles (NiO-SPP) results in a significant increase in selectivity, approximately 23 times higher at isoconversion, due to the weaker interaction of polymeric phosphates with propene, facilitating a faster desorption rate and thus higher selectivity.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战，通过加速沸石晶化过程，实现了金属簇（如PtSn）在沸石骨架内的封装。这一策略对在沸石中形成、结构和催化性能具有重要意义，特别是丙烷转化的背景下。沸石的多孔结构提供了更大的表面积，增加了ODH-O2反应的活性位点数量。然而，多孔催化剂由于在合成过程中表面的MoO3损失，表现出较低的特定产率。这证实了α-NiMoO4，其表面积更大，对于ODH-O2反应更为活跃。NiO被发现对ODH-O2选择性不利，倾向于氧化产物。NiO掺杂铌（Nb-NiO）催化剂比纯NiO催化剂更优，因为表面电磷氧物种浓度降低和表面酸性增加，导致更高的丙烯选择性。α-NiMoO4相在约10%转化率时显示出75%的选择性，表明其在ODH-O2反应中的有效性。表面聚磷酸盐修饰的NiO纳米颗粒（NiO-SPP）导致选择性显著提高，大约是等转化率下的23倍，由于聚磷酸盐与丙烯较弱的相互作用，促进更快的脱附速率，从而实现更高的选择性。
