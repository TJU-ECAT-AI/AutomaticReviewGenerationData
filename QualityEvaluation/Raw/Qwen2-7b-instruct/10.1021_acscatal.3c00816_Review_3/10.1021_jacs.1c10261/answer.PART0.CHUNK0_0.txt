The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of zeolite structures. This allows for the optimization of the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. In the context of propane conversion, the use of these PtSn clusters demonstrates improved activity and selectivity.
