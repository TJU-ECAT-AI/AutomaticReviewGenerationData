The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid formation of the zeolite structure. This results in significant effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly enhancing their efficiency in propane conversion.
