The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. tackles the time-scale mismatch issues in direct synthesis methods for metal encapsulation by enabling the formation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. This results in enhanced catalytic performance for propane conversion. The strategy involves creating isolated Pt atoms embedded in SiO2-ZnOH nests, which improves structure stability and overall catalytic activity. Additionally, the use of dealuminated zeolite beta enhances the accessibility of metal sites, leading to better selectivity and efficiency in the conversion process.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略解决了直接合成方法中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配问题，通过在ZSM-5沸石中形成PtSn簇，实现了丙烷转换的增强催化性能。该策略涉及在SiO2-ZnOH巢中形成孤立的Pt原子，从而提高了结构稳定性并进而提升了整体催化活性。此外，使用去铝沸石β增强了金属位点的可接近性，导致了更好的选择性和效率的转化过程。
