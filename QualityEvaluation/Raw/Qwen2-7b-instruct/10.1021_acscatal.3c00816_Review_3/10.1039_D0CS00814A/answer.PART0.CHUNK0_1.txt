The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by accelerating the crystallization process. This allows for the rapid formation of zeolite frameworks, which is critical in the context of metal encapsulation within zeolites. The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are multifaceted. Firstly, it facilitates the precise control over the size and shape of the PtSn clusters, ensuring optimal distribution and activity within the zeolite matrix. Secondly, the rapid crystallization enables the formation of a more ordered and regular zeolite structure, which enhances the stability and reusability of the catalyst. Lastly, this technique improves the accessibility of the metal clusters to reactants, thereby boosting the catalytic performance in propane conversion reactions. Through these mechanisms, the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy significantly contributes to the development of more efficient and durable catalysts for direct synthesis applications.
