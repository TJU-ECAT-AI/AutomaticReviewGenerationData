The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials, air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs. The chromium/aluminum catalysts, whose components include chromium oxide with mass fractions greater than 18%, exhibit stable dehydrogenation performance, high conversion rates of alkanes and high propylene yields.

A heat generating material (HGM) is an innovative metal oxide-based material designed to significantly increase the selectivity and yield in the Catofin process. The HGM is loaded into the reactor bed together with the catalyst to undergo oxidation and reduction processes during the cycle operation, generating heat to drive the dehydrogenation reaction. It can not only increase propylene productivity, but also reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

1. The Catofin process utilizes counter-current flow technology to optimize the flow of reactive materials, enhancing product yield while conserving resources, which minimizes investment and operational costs. The catalysts, comprised of chromium oxide with a mass fraction exceeding 18%, demonstrate robust performance in alkane dehydrogenation, with notable propylene output.

2. The integration of a heat generating material (HGM) into the Catofin process, alongside the catalyst, introduces a cycle of oxidation and reduction. This process generates heat to propel the dehydrogenation reaction, thereby increasing propylene productivity. Moreover, it contributes to reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

1. 猫托宁过程采用逆流流动技术，改变反应物料的流向，使空气向下流动，烃类直接向上流动。这样可以以较少的原料获得更多的产品，从而降低投资和运营成本。催化剂包含氧化铬，其质量分数超过18%，在烷烃脱氢过程中表现出稳定的性能，并且具有较高的丙烯产率。

2. 将热生成材料（HGM）与催化剂一同加入到猫托宁过程的床层中，在循环操作期间进行氧化和还原过程。这个过程产生热量来驱动脱氢反应，从而增加丙烯产量。同时，它有助于减少能源消耗和二氧化碳排放。
