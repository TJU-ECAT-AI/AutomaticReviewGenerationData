[1] "In this section, we will summarize the current PDH catalysts and their application."
[2] "The Catofin process uses counter-current flow technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials, air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus reducing investments and operating costs."
[3] "The Oleflex process converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990."
[4] "The FBD-4 process developed by Snamprogetti of FBD technology is based on fluidized bed dehydrogenation, whose core technology is the reaction-regeneration system, which is operated in the fluidized bed."
[5] "The ADHO technology has the following characteristics, where raw materials do not need pretreatment and can be directly fed into the reactor without desulfurization, dearsenification and other complex technical processes."
[6] "The Oleflex process uses a fully recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst and has low production costs, high returns on investment and low environmental footprints, and can convert propane-rich liquefied petroleum gas (C3 LPG) feedstock into chemical or polymer-grade propylene products."
[7] "The ADHO technology is operated with a non-toxic, non-corrosive and non-noble metal oxide catalyst, in a highly efficient circulating fluidized bed reactor, and involves burning the catalyst to regeneration for continuous dehydrogenation reaction."
[8] "The Oleflex process is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."
[9] "In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity."
[10] "The active component of Pt-based catalysts is metal Pt cluster or nanocrystalline."

[15] "In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity, but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr1 h1 or 1 mol gcat1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1."
[16] "In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and suppressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts, with about 0.3 mol gV1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1."
[17] "However, the active sites of Ga have been debated and strongly affected by the types of supports, preparation methods, and loading amounts."
