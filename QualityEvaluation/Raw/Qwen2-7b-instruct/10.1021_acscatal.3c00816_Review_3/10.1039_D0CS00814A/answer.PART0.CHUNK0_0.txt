[1] "In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first CH bond of propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which determines the catalyst activity."
[2] "While propylene is more active and can more easily undergo complex side reactions, such as further dehydrogenation and cracking."
[3] "Based on the typical d band and acid-base theory, the unsaturated filling of d orbitals over transition metals and Lewis acid MO sites over metal oxides determine their PDH reactivity."
[4] "In the past several decades, a number of heterogeneous catalysts including metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts and non-oxide-based catalysts in Fig. 5 (such as Pt, CrOx, VOx, GaOx, ZrO2, carbides, nitrides, and carbon materials) have been exploited for direct PDH reaction due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage that have exhibited high performances."

2. In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, activating the first carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond of propane is recognized as the rate-limiting step that dictates catalyst activity. Propylene, being more active, tends to undergo more complex side reactions, including further dehydrogenation and cracking. According to the d band and acid-base theory, the unsaturated filling of d orbitals over transition metals and Lewis acid MO sites over metal oxides define their PDH reactivity. Over the last few decades, a variety of heterogeneous catalysts, including metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts, and non-oxide-based catalysts (such as Pt, CrOx, VOx, GaOx, ZrO2, carbides, nitrides, and carbon materials) have been utilized for direct PDH reactions due to their affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and low propensity for carbon-carbon (CC) bond cleavage, resulting in high performance.

2. 在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，激活丙烷中的第一个碳-氢(CH)键被认为是决定催化剂活性的关键步骤。丙烯更为活跃，更容易经历更复杂的副反应，如进一步脱氢和裂解。基于典型的d带和酸-碱理论，过渡金属中的未饱和d轨道填充以及金属氧化物中的Lewis酸MO位点决定了它们的PDH反应性。在过去的几十年里，包括金属基催化剂、金属氧化物基催化剂和非氧化物基催化剂（如Pt、CrOx、VOx、GaOx、ZrO2、碳化物、氮化物和碳材料）在内的多种异质催化剂被用于直接PDH反应，由于它们对烷基CH键的亲和力和对碳-碳(CC)键断裂的低活性，这些催化剂表现出高效率。

[1] "Among them, a PtSn bimetallic catalyst shows good selectivity and stability, and has received the most extensive attention."
[2] "Regarding the roles of Sn, researchers proposed the geometric effect and electronic effect."
[3] "On the one hand, some researchers indicated that Sn additives help separate larger Pt ensembles into smaller clusters, thus eliminating the sites for coke formation, which is a structure-sensitive side reaction."
[4] "On the other hand, researchers believed that there is a strong electron transfer between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich, which promotes the desorption of propylene and coke transfer from Pt sites to the support."

3. Among the Pt-based catalysts, a PtSn bimetallic catalyst exhibits excellent selectivity and stability, receiving the most attention. The roles of tin (Sn) in these catalysts are attributed to both geometric and electronic effects. On one hand, some researchers suggest that the addition of Sn aids in separating larger Pt aggregates into smaller clusters, thereby eliminating sites prone to coke formation, a structure-sensitive side reaction. On the other hand, it is believed that there is a strong electron transfer between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich. This enhances propylene desorption and facilitates the transfer of coke from Pt sites to the support.

3. 在Pt基催化剂中，PtSn双金属催化剂显示出良好的选择性和稳定性，并受到最广泛的关注。Sn在这些催化剂中的作用主要体现在几何效应和电子效应上。一方面，一些研究人员指出，Sn添加剂有助于将较大的Pt集合体分离成较小的簇，从而消除易于形成焦炭的反应位点，这是一种结构敏感的副反应。另一方面，人们认为Sn和Pt原子之间存在强烈的电子转移，使Pt原子更加富电子。这促进了丙烯的脱附并使得焦炭从Pt位点转移到支撑物上。
