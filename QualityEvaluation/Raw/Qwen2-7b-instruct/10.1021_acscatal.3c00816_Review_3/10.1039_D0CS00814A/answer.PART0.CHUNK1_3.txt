The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of metal-zeolite composite structures. This strategy facilitates the encapsulation of metals, such as Pt and Sn, within ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to the formation of PtSn clusters with specific structures. These clusters exhibit improved catalytic performance in the context of propane conversion due to their well-defined structures and enhanced activity.

The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant. The rapid crystallization process allows for the direct synthesis of metal-loaded zeolites, reducing the time required for the encapsulation of metals. This results in the formation of PtSn clusters with controlled sizes and compositions, which are crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in propane conversion reactions.

Furthermore, the strategy enables the stabilization of PtSn clusters within the zeolite framework, which helps to mitigate the sintering and reconstruction issues commonly encountered with Pt-based catalysts under reaction conditions. The resulting catalysts display improved selectivity and stability, making them more suitable for industrial applications in propane conversion.

In summary, the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. significantly advances the synthesis of metal-zeolite composites, particularly for the encapsulation of PtSn clusters. This approach not only addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges but also enhances the catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts in propane conversion reactions by facilitating the formation of well-defined and stable PtSn clusters within the zeolite framework.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略，通过使金属-沸石复合结构的快速形成来解决直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这一策略允许金属（如Pt和Sn）在CHA沸石中内嵌，导致形成具有特定结构的PtSn簇。这些簇在丙烷转化反应中表现出改进的催化性能，由于它们具有定义明确的结构和增强的活性。

这一策略对PtSn簇在CHA沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的。快速结晶过程允许直接合成金属负载的沸石，减少了金属封装所需的时间。这导致形成大小和组成控制良好的PtSn簇，这对于实现丙烷转化反应的高催化性能至关重要。

此外，该策略能够稳定地在沸石骨架中形成PtSn簇，有助于缓解在反应条件下Pt基催化剂常见的聚集和重构问题。由此产生的催化剂显示出了改善的选择性和稳定性，使其更适合工业应用在丙烷转化反应中。

综上所述，余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略显著推进了金属-沸石复合物的合成，特别是对于PtSn簇的封装。这种方法不仅解决了时间尺度不匹配的问题，而且还通过在沸石骨架中形成定义明确且稳定的PtSn簇来提升催化性能。
