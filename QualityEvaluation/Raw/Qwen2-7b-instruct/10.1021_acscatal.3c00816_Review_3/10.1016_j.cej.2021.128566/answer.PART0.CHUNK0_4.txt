[1] "The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in a tubular reactor at 200°C, allowing for the efficient induction of large amounts of uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity in just a few minutes."
[2] "The surfactant-templating process involves three distinctive steps: 1) the cleavage of Si-O-Si bonds, 2) the electrostatic attraction of the CTA+ cations by the Si-O- charges in the zeolite, and 3) rearrangement of crystal structure to accommodate the micelles."
[3] "When it comes to the catalytic applications of zeolites where heavy hydrocarbon molecules are involved, mass transport limitation not only restricts the access to the active sites but also leads to severe coke formation that further blocks the micropores."
[4] "The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in the tubular reactor that allowed fast heating to high temperature. We found that by judiciously adjusting both the CTAB/Si ratio and the NaOH concentration uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity could be obtained, whereas desilication took place in the absence of CTAB, causing significant damage to the zeolite structure as well as PSD."
[5] "The surfactant-templated *BEA zeolite retained much more of the original micropore volume and displayed a sharp N2 uptake at ca. P/P0 = 0.4, which revealed the formation of well-defined mesopores of a uniform size."
[6] "The surfactant-templating treatment of this zeolite generated strong acid sites, as shown in the NH3-TPD profile of BEA (L)-meso, which further validates the incorporation of octahedrally coordinated aluminium into the framework of zeolite."

The ultrafast surfactant-templating method enables the rapid generation of uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolites within minutes. By carefully adjusting the CTAB/Si ratio and NaOH concentration, it facilitates the formation of mesoporosity while preserving the zeolite's intrinsic properties. This process leads to an increased external surface area and enhanced intracrystalline diffusion properties, improving the catalytic performance in reactions involving large molecules, such as the cracking of polyethylene pyrolysis vapors. The surfactant-templated *BEA zeolite exhibits a narrow pore size distribution centered at 4 nm, along with well-defined mesopores, which contributes to the superior catalytic cracking performance.

超快速表面活性剂模板技术能够在几分钟内高效地在*BEA沸石中产生均匀的晶内介孔结构。通过精细调整CTAB/Si比例和NaOH浓度，可以促进孔隙的形成并保持沸石的基本特性。这一过程提高了外部表面积，并增强了晶内的扩散性质，改善了涉及大分子反应（如聚乙烯热解气的裂解）的催化性能。经过表面活性剂模板处理的*BEA沸石具有直径为4纳米的狭窄孔径分布，以及定义明确的微孔，这有助于提高催化裂解性能。
