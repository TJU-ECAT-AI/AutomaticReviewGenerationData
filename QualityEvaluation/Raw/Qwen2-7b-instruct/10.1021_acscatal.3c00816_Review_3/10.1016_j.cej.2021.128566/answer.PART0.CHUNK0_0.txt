The ultrafast surfactant-templating strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving the formation of *BEA zeolite in just 2 minutes. This is accomplished through ultrafast surfactant-templating in a tubular reactor at 200°C. The method ensures the formation of uniform mesoporosity while preserving the intrinsic properties of the zeolite, requiring careful adjustment of the treatment conditions, primarily the concentration of CTA+ and OH ions. 

For large crystal size *BEA zeolite (BEA(L)), the optimal conditions for ultrafast surfactant-templating involve a NaOH concentration of 1 mol L−1 and a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.08, leading to a narrow pore size distribution centered at 4 nm with a total pore volume of 0.54 cm3 g−1 and a mesopore volume of 0.31 cm3 g−1. This process maintains the zeolite's intrinsic properties without significant silicon leaching, unlike the desilication method which can cause substantial structural damage.

However, when applying identical conditions to small crystal size *BEA zeolite (BEA(S)), a broad pore size distribution is observed, featuring two peaks centered at 4 nm and 10 nm. This issue is resolved by adjusting the aluminum content through partial dealumination, enabling successful surfactant-templating of dealuminated BEA(S) to exhibit a single peak centered at 4 nm with significantly high total and mesopore volumes (Vmeso(max) = 0.46 cm3 g−1, Vt = 0.68 cm3 g−1, Sext = 650 m2 g−1).

The catalytic performance of *BEA zeolites, particularly BEA-meso, is superior in cracking the vapors from LDPE thermal pyrolysis. This is attributed to the enhanced accessibility and strength of active sites, along with the higher external surface and improved intracrystalline diffusion properties of BEA-meso catalysts, which reduce the selectivity of para-xylene and increase toluene production, while significantly reducing coke deposition compared to BEA-parent catalysts.

由余等人开发的超快速表面活性剂模板策略解决了直接合成方法在金属封装中的时间尺度不匹配挑战，仅通过2分钟即可实现*BEA沸石的形成。这得益于在200°C的管式反应器中进行的超快速表面活性剂模板化。该方法确保了均匀介孔结构的形成并保持了沸石的内在特性，需要精心调整处理条件，主要为CTA+和OH离子浓度。

对于大型晶粒尺寸的*BEA沸石（BEA(L)），超快速表面活性剂模板化的最佳条件为NaOH浓度1摩尔/升和CTAB/Si比值0.08，导致窄孔径分布中心位于4纳米，总孔体积为0.54立方厘米/克，微孔体积为0.31立方厘米/克。这一过程维持了沸石的内在特性，没有显著的硅流失，与脱硅方法可能造成的重大结构损害形成对比。

然而，当将相同条件应用于小型晶粒尺寸的*BEA沸石（BEA(S)）时，观察到宽的孔径分布，包含两个分别位于4纳米和10纳米的峰。这个问题通过调整铝含量并通过部分去铝化解决，成功实现了去铝化BEA(S)的表面活性剂模板化，表现出单个峰位于4纳米，具有显著高的总孔体积和微孔体积（Vmeso(max) = 0.46立方厘米/克，Vt = 0.68立方厘米/克，Sext = 650平方米/克）。

*BEA沸石，特别是BEA-meso的催化性能在从LDPE热裂解产生的蒸汽中裂解显示出优越性。这归因于增强的活性位点可接近性和强度，以及BEA-meso催化剂的更高外部表面和改进的晶体内部扩散性质，降低了对甲苯的选择性并增加了乙醇的生产，同时显著减少了焦炭沉积量，与BEA母体催化剂相比。
