[1] "The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in a matter of just 2 min, thanks to the use of ultrafast surfactant-templating in a tubular reactor at 200 C."
[2] "The formation of uniform mesoporosity whilst maintaining the intrinsic properties of the zeolite requires the careful adjustment of the treatment conditions, mainly of the CTA+ and OH concentrations."
[3] "A narrow PSD centred at 4 nm pore width (Vmeso = 0.31 cm3 g1, Vt = 0.54 cm3 g1) for large crystal size *BEA zeolite, labelled as BEA (L), was obtained at a NaOH concentration of 1 mol L-1 and a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.08."
[4] "When using the identical conditions for the surfactant-templating of a small crystal size *BEA zeolite (<100 nm-agglomerated), a broad PSD was observed."
[5] "More specifically, two distinctive peaks centred at 4 nm and 10 nm were present in its PSD."
[6] "This problem was overcome by simply adjusting the aluminium content in the zeolite through partial dealumination."
[7] "Dealuminated BEA(S) was successfully surfactant-templated, exhibiting only one peak centred at 4 nm in its PSD."
[8] "Both the total and the mesopore volumes obtained after the ultrafast surfactant-templating treatment were very high (Vmeso(max) = 0.46 cm3 g1, Vt = 0.68 cm3 g1, Sext = 650 m2 g1), while preserving the intrinsic properties of the zeolite."
[9] "The catalytic superiority of BEA-meso was demonstrated in the cracking of the vapours obtained from the thermal pyrolysis of LDPE."
[10] "Both the accessibility and the strength of active sites played a key role in the cracking performance of *BEA zeolites."
[11] "The higher external surface and enhanced intracrystalline diffusion properties of the BEA-meso catalysts reduced the selectivity of para-xylene and improved toluene production, as compared to the BEA-parent catalysts."
[12] "Moreover, coke deposition was remarkably reduced from 10.7 wt% over BEA (L)-parent to 6.3 wt% over BEA (L)-meso."

The ultrafast surfactant-templating strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving the formation of *BEA zeolite in just 2 minutes. This is accomplished through ultrafast surfactant-templating in a tubular reactor at 200°C. The method ensures the formation of uniform mesoporosity while preserving the intrinsic properties of the zeolite, requiring careful adjustment of the treatment conditions, primarily the concentration of CTA+ and OH ions. 

For large crystal size *BEA zeolite (BEA(L)), the optimal conditions for ultrafast surfactant-templating involve a NaOH concentration of 1 mol L−1 and a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.08, leading to a narrow pore size distribution centered at 4 nm with a total pore volume of 0.54 cm3 g−1 and a mesopore volume of 0.31 cm3 g−1. This process maintains the zeolite's intrinsic properties without significant silicon leaching, unlike the desilication method which can cause substantial structural damage.

However, when applying identical conditions to small crystal size *BEA zeolite (BEA(S)), a broad pore size distribution is observed, featuring two peaks centered at 4 nm and 10 nm. This issue is resolved by adjusting the aluminum content through partial dealumination, enabling successful surfactant-templating of dealuminated BEA(S) to exhibit a single peak centered at 4 nm with significantly high total and mesopore volumes (Vmeso(max) = 0.46 cm3 g−1, Vt = 0.68 cm3 g−1, Sext = 650 m2 g−1).

The catalytic performance of *BEA zeolites, particularly BEA-meso, is superior in cracking the vapors from LDPE thermal pyrolysis. This is attributed to the enhanced accessibility and strength of active sites, along with the higher external surface and improved intracrystalline diffusion properties of BEA-meso catalysts, which reduce the selectivity of para-xylene and increase toluene production, while significantly reducing coke deposition compared to BEA-parent catalysts.

由余等人开发的超快速表面活性剂模板策略解决了直接合成方法在金属封装中的时间尺度不匹配挑战，仅通过2分钟即可实现*BEA沸石的形成。这得益于在200°C的管式反应器中进行的超快速表面活性剂模板化。该方法确保了均匀介孔结构的形成并保持了沸石的内在特性，需要精心调整处理条件，主要为CTA+和OH离子浓度。

对于大型晶粒尺寸的*BEA沸石（BEA(L)），超快速表面活性剂模板化的最佳条件为NaOH浓度1摩尔/升和CTAB/Si比值0.08，导致窄孔径分布中心位于4纳米，总孔体积为0.54立方厘米/克，微孔体积为0.31立方厘米/克。这一过程维持了沸石的内在特性，没有显著的硅流失，与脱硅方法可能造成的重大结构损害形成对比。

然而，当将相同条件应用于小型晶粒尺寸的*BEA沸石（BEA(S)）时，观察到宽的孔径分布，包含两个分别位于4纳米和10纳米的峰。这个问题通过调整铝含量并通过部分去铝化解决，成功实现了去铝化BEA(S)的表面活性剂模板化，表现出单个峰位于4纳米，具有显著高的总孔体积和微孔体积（Vmeso(max) = 0.46立方厘米/克，Vt = 0.68立方厘米/克，Sext = 650平方米/克）。

*BEA沸石，特别是BEA-meso的催化性能在从LDPE热裂解产生的蒸汽中裂解显示出优越性。这归因于增强的活性位点可接近性和强度，以及BEA-meso催化剂的更高外部表面和改进的晶体内部扩散性质，降低了对甲苯的选择性并增加了乙醇的生产，同时显著减少了焦炭沉积量，与BEA母体催化剂相比。

[1] "The development of controlled intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolite is a challenging task. Complex intergrowth of two polymorphs (polymorphs A and B) in *BEA zeolite crystalline structure results in the relatively low stability of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium."
[2] "Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite: An efficient catalyst for the cracking of polyethylene pyrolysis vapours"

[4] "When it comes to the catalytic applications of zeolites where heavy hydrocarbon molecules are involved, mass transport limitation not only restricts the access to the active sites but also leads to severe coke formation that further blocks the micropores."

[9] "Both the improved accessibility provided by the generation of precisely controlled 4 nm mesopores and the strong acid sites found in the BEA (L)-meso contribute to improve the cracking performance of this zeolite."

Specifically, this technique allows for the efficient generation of uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolites within just a few minutes, thanks to the use of ultrafast surfactant-templating in a tubular reactor at high temperatures. This approach facilitates the introduction of large amounts of mesoporosity while preserving the intrinsic properties of the zeolite, including its Si/Al ratio, crystallinity, acidity, and morphology. By doing so, it significantly enhances the accessibility to the active sites, thereby improving the catalytic performance of the zeolites in various applications, particularly in the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules.

The ultrafast surfactant-templating method enables the rapid generation of uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolites within minutes. By carefully adjusting the CTAB/Si ratio and NaOH concentration, it facilitates the formation of mesoporosity while preserving the zeolite's intrinsic properties. This process leads to an increased external surface area and enhanced intracrystalline diffusion properties, improving the catalytic performance in reactions involving large molecules, such as the cracking of polyethylene pyrolysis vapors. The surfactant-templated *BEA zeolite exhibits a narrow pore size distribution centered at 4 nm, along with well-defined mesopores, which contributes to the superior catalytic cracking performance.
