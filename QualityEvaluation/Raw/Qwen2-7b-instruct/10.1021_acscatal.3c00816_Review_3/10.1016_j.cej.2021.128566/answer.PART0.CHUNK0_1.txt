[1] "The development of controlled intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolite is a challenging task. Complex intergrowth of two polymorphs (polymorphs A and B) in *BEA zeolite crystalline structure results in the relatively low stability of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium."
[2] "Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite: An efficient catalyst for the cracking of polyethylene pyrolysis vapours"
[3] "The surfactant-templating process involves three distinctive steps: 1) the cleavage of Si-O-Si bonds, 2) the electrostatic attraction of the CTA+ cations by the Si-O- charges in the zeolite, and 3) rearrangement of crystal structure to accommodate the micelles."
[4] "When it comes to the catalytic applications of zeolites where heavy hydrocarbon molecules are involved, mass transport limitation not only restricts the access to the active sites but also leads to severe coke formation that further blocks the micropores."
[5] "Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in the tubular reactor that allowed fast heating to high temperature."
[6] "The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in the tubular reactor that allowed fast heating to high temperature."
[7] "The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in the tubular reactor that allowed fast heating to high temperature."
[8] "The surfactant-templated *BEA zeolite contained one shoulder at 116 ppm, which is attributed to Q4 (0Al), but at different T sites."
[9] "Both the improved accessibility provided by the generation of precisely controlled 4 nm mesopores and the strong acid sites found in the BEA (L)-meso contribute to improve the cracking performance of this zeolite."

The ultrafast surfactant-templating strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling the rapid formation of mesoporous structures in zeolites. Specifically, this technique allows for the efficient generation of uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolites within just a few minutes, thanks to the use of ultrafast surfactant-templating in a tubular reactor at high temperatures. This approach facilitates the introduction of large amounts of mesoporosity while preserving the intrinsic properties of the zeolite, including its Si/Al ratio, crystallinity, acidity, and morphology. By doing so, it significantly enhances the accessibility to the active sites, thereby improving the catalytic performance of the zeolites in various applications, particularly in the cracking of heavy hydrocarbon molecules.

由余等人开发的超快速表面活性剂模板化策略，通过在高温下的管式反应器中进行快速模板化，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战，以实现金属封装。具体而言，这种方法能够高效地在几分钟内，在*BEA沸石晶体中引入大量的介晶孔结构，从而提高了沸石的催化性能。这一方法允许在保持沸石的内在性质，包括其硅/铝比、结晶性、酸性和形态的同时，有效生成均匀的介晶孔结构。通过这种方式，它显著增强了活性位点的可接近性，从而改善了沸石在各种应用中的催化性能，特别是在重烃分子裂解方面的性能。
