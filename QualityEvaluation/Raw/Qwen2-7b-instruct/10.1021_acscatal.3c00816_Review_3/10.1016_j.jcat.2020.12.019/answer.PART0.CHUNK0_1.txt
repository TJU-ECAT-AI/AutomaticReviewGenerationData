[1] "The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene."
[2] "The main drawback of Pt-based catalyst is its high cost and a rapid deactivation arising from the sintering of Pt particles."
[3] "The propane dehydrogenation over these Sn-Beta catalyst takes place via a parallel reaction pathway, which can be depicted in Scheme 1 ."
[4] "Indeed, the dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate which can be estimated from propylene selectivity (equals to SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)) in these samples can be correlated with L/B ratios measured from IR-Py characterization ( Fig. 10 )."
[5] "The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction."

1. The global propylene market has experienced significant growth over the past few decades, driven by the increasing demand for downstream products derived from propylene, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene.

2. One major challenge with platinum-based catalysts is their high cost and rapid deactivation, which is caused by the sintering of platinum particles.

3. The propane dehydrogenation reaction occurs in a parallel pathway on these Sn-Beta catalysts, as illustrated in Scheme 1.

4. The dehydrogenation rate to cracking rate, which can be calculated using propylene selectivity (SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)), is positively correlated with the Lewis to Bronsted acid ratio (L/B) in these samples, as shown in Fig. 10.

5. The creation of Lewis acid sites in Sn-Beta zeolite primarily stems from the incorporation of tin species into the zeolite framework, forming isolated tin atoms that are responsible for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

1. 近几十年来，全球丙烯市场持续增长，预计未来几年仍将继续增长，主要原因是下游产品（如聚丙烯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸、氧化醇、丙二醇和苯基）对丙烯的大量消耗。

2. 铂基催化剂的主要缺点是其高昂的成本以及由于铂颗粒的聚集导致的快速失活。

3. 这些Sn-Beta催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应通过并行途径发生，如方案1所示。

4. 从丙烯选择性（SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)）计算得到的脱氢速率与裂解速率，可以与这些样本中的Lewis酸与Bronsted酸比率（L/B）成正比，如图10所示。

5. Sn-Beta沸石中Lewis酸的形成主要归因于将锡物种引入到沸石框架中，形成孤立的锡原子，这些原子负责丙烷脱氢反应。
