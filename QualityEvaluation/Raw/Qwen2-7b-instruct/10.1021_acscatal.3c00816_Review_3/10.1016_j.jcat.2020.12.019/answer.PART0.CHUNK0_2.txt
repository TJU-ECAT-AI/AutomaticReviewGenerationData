<p>Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst [26] ,[28] , and the isolated metal species in zeolite display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the framework structure.</p>
<p>Theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrated that the direct pathway rather than the indirect pathway is kinetically more feasible for the dehydrogenation, and it seems that open sites are more reactive than closed one depending on the hydroxylation extents.</p>

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by incorporating metal species into the zeolite framework. This method allows for the formation of isolated metal species, such as PtSn clusters, within ZSM-5 zeolites. These clusters display enhanced stability due to the strong anchoring effect of the zeolite framework structure. In the context of propane conversion, the theoretical calculations in closed Sn-Beta demonstrate that the direct pathway for dehydrogenation is more feasible than the indirect pathway. Additionally, open sites seem to exhibit higher reactivity than closed sites depending on their hydroxylation extents.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过将金属物种引入沸石骨架中，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法允许在ZSM-5沸石中形成孤立的金属物种，如PtSn簇。这些簇由于骨架结构的强锚定效应而表现出增强的稳定性。在丙烷转化的背景下，闭合Sn-Beta中的理论计算表明，直接脱氢途径比间接途径更为可行。此外，根据羟基化程度的不同，开放位点的反应性似乎高于封闭位点。
