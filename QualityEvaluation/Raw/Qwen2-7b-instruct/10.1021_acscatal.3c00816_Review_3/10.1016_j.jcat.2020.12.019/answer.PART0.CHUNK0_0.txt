The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene [1] . The gap between supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly promoted the development of new technologies for the production of propylene [2] ,[3] . So far, the Olefin metathesis, methanol-to-olefins, and propane dehydrogenation emerge as the typical on-purpose technologies for the production of propylene [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] . Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas [8] ,[9] . Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process.

The market for propylene has seen steady growth over the past few decades, driven by the increased demand for downstream products derived from propylene. This has led to a widening gap between supply and demand, prompting the development of new technologies for propylene production. Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation stands out due to its potential for producing propylene from abundant shale gas, while also yielding valuable hydrogen as a by-product. High selectivity towards propylene can be achieved in the propane dehydrogenation process.
