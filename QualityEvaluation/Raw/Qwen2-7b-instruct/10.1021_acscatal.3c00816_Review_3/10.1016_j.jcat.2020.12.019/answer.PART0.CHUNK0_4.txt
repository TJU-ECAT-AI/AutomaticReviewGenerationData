<p>The incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure.</p>
<p>Based on XRD and IR analysis, it can be concluded that the incorporation of Sn species into Beta zeolite structure has no evident effect on its structure.</p>
<p>It should be noted that no evident particles or clusters relative SnO2 phase is detectable in TEM of Sn-Beta, which indirectly suggests that the Sn species is incorporated into Beta zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Further EDS analysis on a representative particle confirms the formation of SnO2 at the surface of Al-Beta.</p>
<p>As revealed in the study above, Sn-Beta-30 possessing the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L acid ratio exhibits the best performance in propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>These SnO2/Al-Beta zeolites are active in propane dehydrogenation, and the initial propane conversion is about 50% for SnO2/Al-Beta-30 and SnO2/Al-Beta-15 samples.</p>
<p>Compared the overall enthalpy barriers in both direct and indirect pathways, we could conclude that the propane dehydrogenation proceeds via the direct pathway through primary C3H7 motif bonded with Sn at closed Lewis Sn-Beta sites.</p>

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by reducing the crystallization time. This is achieved through the use of a seed-assisted growth method. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework structure results in the formation of isolated Sn single atoms, which act as the active site for propane dehydrogenation. The structure of these Sn-Beta zeolites is not significantly altered by the presence of Sn, as evidenced by XRD and IR analyses. The catalytic performance of these zeolites is influenced by the Lewis acid present in the structure, which facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction, while the Brnsted acid is responsible for the cracking reaction. The presence of open Sn(OH)2 sites enhances the activity for propane dehydrogenation compared to closed sites, depending on the hydroxylation extents. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid density and the lowest Brnsted to Lewis acid ratio, demonstrates the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过减少结晶时间解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。通过种子辅助生长方法实现了这一目标。将Sn物种引入到沸石骨架结构中，形成了孤立的Sn单原子，这些原子作为丙烷脱氢反应的活性位点。这些Sn-Beta沸石的结构在Sn的存在下没有显著改变，这可以通过X射线衍射和红外光谱分析得出结论。这些沸石的催化性能受其结构中的Lewis酸影响，该酸促进脱氢反应，而Brnsted酸负责裂解反应。具有开放Sn(OH)2位点的沸石比封闭位点更有利于丙烷脱氢，具体取决于羟基化程度。具有最高Lewis酸密度和最低Brnsted到Lewis酸比率的Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出最佳性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。
