[1] "Recently, the propane dehydrogenation over single-site catalysts has received considerable interest, and the well-defined structure in the single-site catalysts allows to easily elucidate the reaction pathway."
[2] "Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "Interestingly, in this study we discover that Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework will definitely change the acid property of Beta zeolite and thus create some Lewis acid sites."
[5] "A general trend can be observed that the amount of Lewis acid in H-Beta, Sn-Beta, and Na-Sn-Beta are identical, but the amount of Brnsted acid follows a sequence of H-Beta > Sn-Beta > Na-Sn-Beta."
[6] "By contrast, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The catalytic performance of Sn-Beta is essentially related to the nature of acidity in its structure, and therefore pyridine was then employed as a probe molecule to acquire detailed information on the amount and strength of different acid sites in Sn-Beta samples."
[8] "It is found that the Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction."
[9] "The Na-Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."
