The global propylene market has increased steadily in the last few decades, and is estimated to still grow in the coming years due to a large consumption of the downstream products (such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, oxo-alcohols, propylene oxide, and cumene) derived from propylene [1] . The gap between supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly promoted the development of new technologies for the production of propylene [2] ,[3] . So far, the Olefin metathesis, methanol-to-olefins, and propane dehydrogenation emerge as the typical on-purpose technologies for the production of propylene [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] . Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas [8] ,[9] . Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process.

The market for propylene has seen steady growth over the past few decades, driven by the increased demand for downstream products derived from propylene. This has led to a widening gap between supply and demand, prompting the development of new technologies for propylene production. Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation stands out due to its potential for producing propylene from abundant shale gas, while also yielding valuable hydrogen as a by-product. High selectivity towards propylene can be achieved in the propane dehydrogenation process.

[4] "Indeed, the dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate which can be estimated from propylene selectivity (equals to SC3H6/(1- SC3H6)) in these samples can be correlated with L/B ratios measured from IR-Py characterization ( Fig. 10 )."
[5] "The formation of Lewis acid in Sn-Beta zeolite is mainly attributed to the incorporation of Sn species into the zeolitic framework to create single-site Sn, and the isolated Sn atoms are responsible for propane dehydrogenation reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by reducing the crystallization time. This is achieved through the use of a seed-assisted growth method. The incorporation of Sn species into the zeolite framework structure results in the formation of isolated Sn single atoms, which act as the active site for propane dehydrogenation. The structure of these Sn-Beta zeolites is not significantly altered by the presence of Sn, as evidenced by XRD and IR analyses. The catalytic performance of these zeolites is influenced by the Lewis acid present in the structure, which facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction, while the Brnsted acid is responsible for the cracking reaction. The presence of open Sn(OH)2 sites enhances the activity for propane dehydrogenation compared to closed sites, depending on the hydroxylation extents. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, which has the highest Lewis acid density and the lowest Brnsted to Lewis acid ratio, demonstrates the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, achieving a propane conversion of 40% and a propylene selectivity of 92%.
