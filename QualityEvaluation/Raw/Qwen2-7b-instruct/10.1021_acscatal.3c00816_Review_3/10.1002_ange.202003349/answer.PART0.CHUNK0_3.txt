Answer: The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by employing a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method. This method allows for the efficient encapsulation of subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters inside silicalite-1 zeolites, leading to the formation of PtZn clusters with improved stability and enhanced catalytic performance for propane conversion. The introduction of Zn species significantly boosts the stability of the Pt clusters, enabling a high propylene selectivity of 99.3% and a specific activity of propylene formation of 65.5 mol gPt1h1 (at WHSV=108h1) at 550°C. The catalyst shows remarkable stability, with no obvious deactivation even after 13000 min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), exhibiting an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200 times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions.

回答：余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过采用配体保护的直接氢还原方法，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法能够有效地将亚纳米双金属PtZn簇封装在硅铝酸盐1型沸石中，形成了具有增强稳定性和催化性能的PtZn簇，特别适用于丙烷转化。引入Zn物种显著提高了Pt簇的稳定性，使丙烯选择性达到99.3%，并实现了在550°C时重量小时空间速度（WHSV）为108h1的特定丙烯生成活性为65.5mol/gPt/h1。催化剂表现出极佳的稳定性，在13000分钟的连续运行（WHSV=3.6h1）后未观察到明显的失活现象，其失活常数仅为0.001h1，是相同条件下PtZn4/Al2O3对照样品的200倍。
