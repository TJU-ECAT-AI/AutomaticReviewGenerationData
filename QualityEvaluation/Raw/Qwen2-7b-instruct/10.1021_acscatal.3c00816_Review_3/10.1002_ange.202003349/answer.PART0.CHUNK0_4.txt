[1] "Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters."
[2] "Significantly, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability, and the catalytic activity of the catalyst kept unchanged after four continuous cycles."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by employing a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method. This approach allows for the encapsulation of subnanometer PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 zeolites during direct hydrothermal crystallization. By doing so, it prevents the sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, leading to the formation of subnanometer metal clusters. Additionally, the incorporation of Cs+ ions into the zeolite enhances the catalyst's regeneration stability, ensuring that the catalytic activity remains unchanged even after multiple cycles of regeneration.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过采用配体保护的直接氢还原方法，解决了直接合成过程中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法允许在直接水热结晶过程中将亚纳米PtZn簇封装到硅铝酸盐-1沸石中。通过这种方式，它可以在常规煅烧-还原过程期间防止金属纳米簇的聚集，从而形成亚纳米金属簇。此外，向沸石中引入Cs+离子可以提高催化剂的再生稳定性，确保即使经过多次再生循环后，催化活性也保持不变。
