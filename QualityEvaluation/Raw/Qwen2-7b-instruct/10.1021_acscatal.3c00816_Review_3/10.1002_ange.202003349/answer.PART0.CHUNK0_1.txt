[1] "Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters."
[2] "The resulting PtZn@S-1 catalysts are superefficient for PDH conversions. The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C, and 40.4% propane conversion was retained even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2."
[3] "In contrast, the propane conversion over mono-metallic Pt@S-1-H and Pt@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination/reduction process) sharply declined to 19.8% and 2% within 2900 and 340min on stream, respectively."
[4] "Significantly, the deactivation constant of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst was as low as 0.001h1, which was 200 times lower than that of Pt-Zn/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions."
[5] "The design of supported bimetallic catalysts by alloying Pt with various metallic elements, such as Sn,8 Ga,2d, 4c,  Cu,2b Fe,2f and Zn,2g, 2h is also considered an effective strategy to enhance the stability of Pt species and propylene selectivity in PDH conversions, but the stability and catalytic efficiency of these catalysts remain to be improved."

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by employing a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method. This approach allows for the encapsulation of subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolites through direct hydrothermal crystallization, effectively preventing the sintering of metal nanoclusters during conventional calcination-reduction processes. This results in the formation of subnanometer metal clusters that are highly stable and exhibit superior catalytic performance for propane conversion.

2. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst, produced through this method, demonstrates exceptionally high catalytic performance. It exhibits a specific activity of propylene formation up to 65.5 mol gPt1h1 at a WHSV of 108 h1, and it maintains a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at a WHSV of 3.654 h1. Remarkably, the catalyst retains 40.4% propane conversion even after 13000 min on stream at a WHSV of 3.6 h1 without co-feeding H2.

3. In comparison, mono-metallic Pt@S-1-H and Pt@S-1-C catalysts, which undergo conventional calcination-reduction processes, show significantly reduced propane conversion. Within 2900 min on stream, the propane conversion for Pt@S-1-H drops to 19.8%, and within 340 min, it declines to 2% for Pt@S-1-C.

4. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst displays an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001 h1, which is 200 times lower than that of the Pt-Zn/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions, showcasing its remarkable stability and efficiency.

5. The strategy of alloying Pt with various metallic elements, including Sn, Ga, Cu, Fe, and Zn, is considered an effective approach to enhance the stability of Pt species and propylene selectivity in PDH conversions. However, the stability and catalytic efficiency of these catalysts still require further improvement.

1. 针对直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战，由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过采用配体保护的直接氢还原方法解决了金属封装问题。这种方法允许通过直接水热结晶在硅铝酸盐-1沸石中封装亚纳米级别的PtZn簇，有效地防止了常规煅烧还原过程中金属纳米簇的聚集，从而形成亚纳米尺度的金属簇。这些簇具有高度稳定性，并表现出优异的丙烷转化性能。

2. PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂通过此方法产生，显示出极高的催化性能。它在108 h1的WHSV下具有高达65.5 mol gPt1h1的丙烯生成特定活性，在3.654 h1的WHSV下保持99.3%的丙烯选择性。值得注意的是，在不添加H2的情况下，即使在3.6 h1的WHSV下运行13000分钟后，该催化剂仍能保留40.4%的丙烷转化率。

3. 相比之下，通过常规煅烧还原过程制备的单金属Pt@S-1-H和Pt@S-1-C催化剂显示出显著降低的丙烷转化率。在2900分钟后，Pt@S-1-H的丙烷转化率降至19.8%，在340分钟后，Pt@S-1-C的丙烷转化率下降至2%。

4. PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂的脱活常数仅为0.001 h1，是相同条件下Pt-Zn/Al2O3对的200倍，显示出了其出色的稳定性和效率。

5. 将Pt与各种金属元素（如Sn、Ga、Cu、Fe和Zn）合金化被认为是一种有效的方法来增强Pt物种和丙烯选择性的稳定性在PDH转化中。然而，这些催化剂的稳定性和催化效率仍然需要进一步改进。
