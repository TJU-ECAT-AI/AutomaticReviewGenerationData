[1] "Herein we develop a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encaging subnanometer PtZn clusters into silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) subject to direct hydrothermal crystallization; such an approach could effectively prevent from sintering of metal nanoclusters during the conventional calcination-reduction process, thus producing subnanometer metal clusters."
[2] "The introduction of Zn species could remarkably enhance the stability of the subnanometer Pt clusters, and the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited extremely high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.654h1 and specific activity of propylene formation (up to 65.5mol gPt1h1, WHSV=108h1) at 550C, and 40.4% propane conversion was retained even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2."
[3] "Significantly, the deactivation constant of PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst was as low as 0.001h1, which was 200 times lower than that of Pt-Zn/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions."
[4] "In contrast, the propane conversion over mono-metallic Pt@S-1-H and Pt@S-1-C (treated by conventional calcination/reduction process) sharply declined to 19.8% and 2% within 2900 and 340min on stream, respectively."
[5] "Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1), affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, which is 200times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by employing a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method. This approach allows for the encapsulation of subnanometer bimetallic PtZn clusters within silicalite-1 zeolites without the need for conventional calcination-reduction processes, which can cause sintering of metal nanoclusters. By doing so, the formation of subnanometer metal clusters is facilitated, leading to enhanced stability and catalytic performance. Specifically, the PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst demonstrates an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550C. Importantly, the catalyst retains high propane conversion (40.4%) and high propylene selectivity (99.2%) even after 13000min on stream (WHSV=3.6h1) without co-feeding H2. This translates to an exceptionally low deactivation constant of 0.001h1, 200 times lower than that of the PtZn4/Al2O3 counterpart under the same conditions. Additionally, the introduction of Cs+ ions into the zeolite can improve the regeneration stability of catalysts, allowing the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after four successive regeneration cycles.

由余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使用配体保护的直接氢还原方法解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法允许将亚纳米尺寸的双金属铂锌簇封装到硅酸铝1型沸石中，而无需传统的煅烧还原过程，这可以防止金属纳米簇在过程中结块。因此，促进了形成亚纳米尺寸的金属簇，并提高了稳定性和催化性能。具体而言，PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂在550°C时显示了极高的丙烯生成特定活性（65.5mol gPt1h1）和WHSV为108h1以及99.3%的丙烯选择性。重要的是，在不补充氢的情况下，催化剂在13000分钟的运行时间（WHSV=3.6h1）后仍然保持高丙烷转化率（40.4%）和高丙烯选择性（99.2%）。这对应于极低的失活常数0.001h1，比相同条件下PtZn4/Al2O3对的值低200倍。此外，引入Cs+离子到沸石中可以改善催化剂的再生稳定性，使得催化剂活动在四个连续再生循环后保持不变。
