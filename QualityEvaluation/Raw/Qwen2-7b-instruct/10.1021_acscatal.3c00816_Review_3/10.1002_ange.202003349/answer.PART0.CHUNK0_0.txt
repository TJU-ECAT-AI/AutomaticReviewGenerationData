[1] "We developed a facile ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method for encaging subnanometer and even atomically dispersed bimetallic PtZn species into silicalite-1 zeolites."
[2] "The introduction of Zn species can remarkably promote the catalytic activity and stability of Pt clusters through to the formation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy clusters."
[3] "The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibited an extremely high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5mol gPt1h1) with a WHSV of 108h1 and propylene selectivity (99.3%, WHSV=3.654h1) at 550C."
[4] "Significantly, no obvious deactivation was observed even after 13000 on stream without co-feeding H2 (WHSV=3.6h1), the highest stability to date among all state-of-the-art Pt-based heterogeneous catalysts for the PDH reaction."
[5] "We also found that the introduction of Cs+ ions can significantly improve the regeneration performance and the catalytic activity remained stable after four successive regeneration cycles."

1. Yu et al.'s developed method uses ultrafast zeolite crystallization to address the time-scale mismatch in direct synthesis for metal encapsulation, allowing for the formation of subnanometer and atomically dispersed bimetallic PtZn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites.
2. Introducing zinc species significantly enhances the catalytic activity and stability of the Pt clusters, leading to the formation of ultra-small PtZn alloy clusters.
3. The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst shows exceptional performance, with a high specific activity of propylene formation (65.5 mol/g Pt/h) and a propylene selectivity of 99.3% at 550°C.
4. Remarkably, the catalyst maintains high stability over 13,000 hours without co-feeding hydrogen (WHSV = 3.6h⁻¹), demonstrating unparalleled stability compared to other Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
5. The incorporation of Cs+ ions leads to improved catalyst regeneration stability, preserving the initial catalytic activity even after four consecutive regeneration cycles.

1. 杨等人开发的方法利用超快速沸石结晶来解决直接合成中金属封装的时间尺度不匹配问题，能够在ZSM-5沸石中形成亚纳米甚至原子级分散的双金属PtZn簇。
2. 引入锌物种显著提高了铂簇的催化活性和稳定性，导致超小的PtZn合金簇的形成。
3. PtZn4@S-1-H催化剂表现出优异性能，具有高丙烯生成的特定活性（65.5 mol/g Pt/h）和99.3%的丙烯选择性在550°C下。
4. 催化剂在不补充氢气的情况下保持高稳定性长达13,000小时（WHSV为3.6h⁻¹），显示出迄今为止在丙烷脱氢反应中所有先进异质催化剂中的最高稳定性。
5. 引入Cs+离子导致催化剂再生稳定性提高，即使在连续四次再生循环后，初始催化活性仍然保持不变。
