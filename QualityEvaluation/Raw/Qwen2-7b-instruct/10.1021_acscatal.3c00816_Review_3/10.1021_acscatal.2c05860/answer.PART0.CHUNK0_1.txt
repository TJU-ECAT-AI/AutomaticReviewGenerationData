The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy, developed by Yu et al., addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation. This strategy enhances the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, especially in the context of propane conversion.
