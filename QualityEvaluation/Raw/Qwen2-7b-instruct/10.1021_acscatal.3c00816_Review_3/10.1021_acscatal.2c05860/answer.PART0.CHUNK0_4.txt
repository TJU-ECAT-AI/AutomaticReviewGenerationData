1.Yu et al.'s ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy tackles the time-scale mismatch issues in direct synthesis for metal encapsulation. This method accelerates the formation of metal clusters within zeolite frameworks, leading to enhanced formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites. In the context of propane conversion, these catalysts exhibit superior selectivity and activity compared to traditional synthesis techniques.
