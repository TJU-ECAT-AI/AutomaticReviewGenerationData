The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling precise control over the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of metal clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. This leads to enhanced selectivity and efficiency in propane conversion.
