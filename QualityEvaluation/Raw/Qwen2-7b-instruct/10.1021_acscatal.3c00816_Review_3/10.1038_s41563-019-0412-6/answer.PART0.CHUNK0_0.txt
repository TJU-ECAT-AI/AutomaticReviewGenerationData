<p>Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids.</p>
<p>The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719cm1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters.</p>
<p>According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended.</p>
<p>For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.</p>

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite. This leads to the formation of Pt clusters of about 0.5nm, which is the diameter of the 10MR channels, providing high stability against Ostwald ripening sintering even at high temperatures.

2. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, are significant. By using a one-pot synthesis strategy, Pt species can be encapsulated into ZSM-5 zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4wt%. The presence of K+ influences the size of the encapsulated Pt species, leading to the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7nm in the K-Pt@MFI sample. These clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for the propane dehydrogenation reaction, maintaining high selectivity and activity even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. The combination of potassium (K) and tin (Sn) in the catalyst significantly enhances the reactivity and stability of the Pt component. The K-PtSn@MFI sample exhibits high reactivity with an initial propylene selectivity of 90%, offering an extended lifetime of the catalyst. The size and spatial location of the subnanometric Pt clusters are preserved after oxidation-reduction treatments, confirming the stability of the catalyst under varying conditions.

4. The regioselective localization of extraframework metal species, demonstrated in this work, can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including metal-organic frameworks and zeolites. The use of two complementary STEM-based techniques, HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC, provides a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at the atomic level.

1. 余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石中高度偏好性地定位高稳定性亚纳米级Pt和PtSn簇，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这导致形成直径为10MR通道的约0.5nm大小的Pt簇，提供高的抗奥斯特瓦尔德细化热稳定性，即使在高温（>550°C）还原气氛下也是如此。

2. 在ZSM-5沸石内形成PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能影响显著。通过一锅法合成策略，可以将Pt物种封装到ZSM-5沸石中，Pt负载量约为0.4wt%。K+的存在影响封装的Pt物种的尺寸，导致K-Pt@MFI样品中形成约0.4-0.7nm的亚纳米级Pt簇。这些簇对于丙烷脱氢反应表现出更高的活性，保持高选择性和活性，即使在多个反应再生周期后也能保持。

3. 锂和锡（Sn）的结合显著增强了Pt成分的活性和稳定性。K-PtSn@MFI样品展现出高活性，初始丙烯选择性为90%，提供催化剂的长期使用寿命。氧化-还原处理后，亚纳米级Pt簇的大小和空间位置得以保持，证实催化剂在不同条件下具有稳定性。
