<p>It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18. However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regenerationreaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions.</p>

One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4. For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects. For instance, attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)5,6,7. However, when functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 12nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11. As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribution within the zeolite crystallites.

例如，在使用孔或腔体尺寸不同的沸石时，选择性地在特定类型的孔或腔体内定位活性位点是其催化应用的重要挑战。例如，有人尝试优先将骨架Al原子定位在交联位点或ZSM-5（MFI型沸石）的10MR通道内5,6,7。然而，当通过在合成过程中引入金属前体或通过互沸石转化引入功能金属如Pt或Pd时，会在MFI沸石中得到12nm的纳米颗粒而不是亚纳米金属物种（单个原子或簇）。据我们所知，金属颗粒在沸石晶粒内呈随机分布。

<p>Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>

Remarkably, potassium ions (+K) within the synthesis mixture significantly affect the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As illustrated in Figures 1c and d, Pt predominantly appears as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Figure 2), whereas subnanometric Pt clusters around 0.40.7nm are the primary species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Figure 3).
