<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere.</p>
<p>This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes.</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids.</p>
<p>The low white-line intensity in the Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum of the K-Pt@MFI sample (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence of metallic Pt after the H2 reduction treatment.</p>
<p>Considering the structure of MFI zeolite, one can expect that subnanometric encapsulated Pt clusters may distribute in different locations (including the straight channels, intersectional voids and sinusoidal channels).</p>
<p>According to the XANES results (Fig. 2a), Pt species also exist in the metallic state in the PtSn@MFI and K-PtSn@MFI samples.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 4af, K, Sn and Pt are homogeneously distributed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample according to the X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) mapping.</p>
<p>As displayed in Fig. 5a, Pt@MFI was initially active but a fast deactivation was observed.</p>
<p>When Sn was introduced as a promotor, the resultant PtSn@MFI showed a significantly enhanced activity and selectivity (Fig. 5b), in consistence with previous works on supported PtSn catalysts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 5254, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcination-reduction treatment, and the subnanometric Pt clusters remain stable during these processes.</p>
<p>According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced.</p>
<p>For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm.</p>
<p>The concept of regioselective localization of extraframework metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including both metalorganic frameworks and zeolites.</p>
<p>Methods One-pot synthesis of MFI zeolites with encapsulation of Pt Synthesis of Pt@MFI material (Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in purely siliceous MFI) Pt nanoparticles encapsulated in MFI zeolite were prepared by a one-pot synthesis.</p>
<p>After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60C.</p>

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite. This stabilization strategy enables the formation of metal clusters with a diameter of about 0.5nm, which is highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The effect on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, involves the following aspects:

1. Achieving a regular distribution of metal clusters within the zeolite structure leads to enhanced stability and improved catalytic activity for the activation of alkanes.
2. The preferential location of Pt atoms in the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure results in a stable and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
3. The introduction of Sn as a promoter enhances the reactivity and selectivity of the Pt clusters, leading to high initial activity and selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
4. The use of K to stabilize the Pt clusters during the calcination process prevents sintering and maintains the subnanometric size of the Pt clusters, even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.
5. The combination of K and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst leads to enhanced reactivity and stability, with the reactivity being maintained for at least three cycles of reaction-regeneration without significant deactivation.
6. The enhanced stability and selectivity of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst are attributed to the regioselective localization of subnanometric Pt clusters in the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, which provides a highly stable and selective environment for the dehydrogenation of propane.
7. The concept of regioselective localization of metal species can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, potentially opening new possibilities for catalytic applications beyond ZSM-5 zeolites.
8. The one-pot synthesis method allows for the encapsulation of Pt species in MFI zeolite with controlled particle size and distribution, leading to enhanced catalytic performance for alkane activation and dehydrogenation reactions.

In summary, the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy, combined with the one-pot synthesis method, facilitates the formation of subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters within MFI zeolite, resulting in enhanced stability, selectivity, and catalytic performance for the activation of alkanes and dehydrogenation reactions. The regioselective localization of these metal clusters within the zeolite structure plays a crucial role in maintaining their stability and enhancing their catalytic activity.
