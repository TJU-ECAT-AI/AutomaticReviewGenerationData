<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere.</p>
<p>This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position.

<p>Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species.</p>
<p>After the hydrothermal process, the solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried at 60C. Then the solid sample was calcined under an air flow at 560C for 8h and then at 600C for 2h.</p>
<p>As displayed in Fig. 5a, Pt@MFI was initially active but a fast deactivation was observed.</p>
<p>However, when Sn was introduced as a promotor, the resultant PtSn@MFI showed a significantly enhanced activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figs. 5254, the reactivity of the deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered by at least three cycles of calcinationreduction treatment.</p>
<p>For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation.</p>

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by aiming to achieve a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm, matching the diameter of the 10MR channels in the zeolite structure. This results in highly stable metal clusters even at high temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. This material opens new possibilities for catalytic applications, including alkane activation.

2. Subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. 

3. The one-pot synthesis strategy involves encapsulating Pt species within the MFI zeolite framework. The hypothesis is that template molecules (TPA+OH) occupy the intersectional voids, limiting the access of Pt species to these positions. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels compared to straight channels, Pt species preferentially locate in the sinusoidal channels.

4. All the Pt-zeolite materials with different chemical compositions exhibit typical X-ray diffraction patterns of MFI zeolite.

5. The presence of K+ in the synthesis mixture significantly affects the size of encapsulated Pt species.

6. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product undergoes isolation, washing, drying, and calcination under specific conditions to stabilize the Pt clusters.

7. Pt@MFI catalysts show initial activity but experience fast deactivation. 

8. Introducing Sn as a promoter enhances the activity and selectivity of Pt clusters in the PtSn@MFI catalyst.

9. The deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered through calcination-reduction treatment cycles, preserving the subnanometric Pt clusters.

10. A reference K-PtSn/MFI catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation exhibits fast deactivation and large Pt nanoparticles after multiple catalytic cycles.

11. The regioselective localization of metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials like metalorganic frameworks and zeolites.

1. 邱等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过旨在实现金属簇的非常规则分布，即与沸石结构中的10MR通道直径相匹配的大约0.5nm，来解决直接合成过程中时间尺度不匹配的挑战。这导致在高温度和还原气氛下具有高度稳定的金属簇。这种材料为催化应用打开了新的可能性，包括烷烃激活。
