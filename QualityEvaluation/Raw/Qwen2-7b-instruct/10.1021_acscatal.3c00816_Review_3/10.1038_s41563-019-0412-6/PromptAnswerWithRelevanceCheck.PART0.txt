<p>Main One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>
<p>As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, by correlating the HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC images, it can be deduced that most Pt atoms are located in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite structure, whereas a far smaller number are found in the straight pore channels or at the intersectional voids.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the presence of K+ within the synthesis mixture has significantly influenced the size of the encapsulated Pt species. As shown in Fig. 1c,d, Pt mainly exists as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), while subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.40.7nm are the dominant species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Fig. 3).</p>

<p>The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719cm1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn@MFI sample, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters.</p>
<p>According to the above results, by the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended.</p>
<p>For comparison, a reference K-PtSn/MFI sample with the same chemical composition as the K-PtSn@MFI sample was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation (Supplementary Fig. 66), containing well dispersed Pt particles of 0.41.2nm.</p>
<p>Moreover, the use of two complementary STEM-based techniques (HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC) can be a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at atomic level.</p>

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite. This leads to the formation of Pt clusters of about 0.5nm, which is the diameter of the 10MR channels, providing high stability against Ostwald ripening sintering even at high temperatures.

2. The effects on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, are significant. By using a one-pot synthesis strategy, Pt species can be encapsulated into ZSM-5 zeolite with a Pt loading of about 0.4wt%. The presence of K+ influences the size of the encapsulated Pt species, leading to the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters of about 0.4-0.7nm in the K-Pt@MFI sample. These clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for the propane dehydrogenation reaction, maintaining high selectivity and activity even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. The combination of potassium (K) and tin (Sn) in the catalyst significantly enhances the reactivity and stability of the Pt component. The K-PtSn@MFI sample exhibits high reactivity with an initial propylene selectivity of 90%, offering an extended lifetime of the catalyst. The size and spatial location of the subnanometric Pt clusters are preserved after oxidation-reduction treatments, confirming the stability of the catalyst under varying conditions.

4. The regioselective localization of extraframework metal species, demonstrated in this work, can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, including metal-organic frameworks and zeolites. The use of two complementary STEM-based techniques, HR HAADF-STEM and iDPC, provides a general approach for studying the position of metal species in heterogeneous metal catalysts at the atomic level.

1. 余等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过在纯硅酸盐MFI沸石中高度偏好性地定位高稳定性亚纳米级Pt和PtSn簇，解决了直接合成过程中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这导致形成直径为10MR通道的约0.5nm大小的Pt簇，提供高的抗奥斯特瓦尔德细化热稳定性，即使在高温（>550°C）还原气氛下也是如此。

2. 在ZSM-5沸石内形成PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能影响显著。通过一锅法合成策略，可以将Pt物种封装到ZSM-5沸石中，Pt负载量约为0.4wt%。K+的存在影响封装的Pt物种的尺寸，导致K-Pt@MFI样品中形成约0.4-0.7nm的亚纳米级Pt簇。这些簇对于丙烷脱氢反应表现出更高的活性，保持高选择性和活性，即使在多个反应再生周期后也能保持。

3. 锂和锡（Sn）的结合显著增强了Pt成分的活性和稳定性。K-PtSn@MFI样品展现出高活性，初始丙烯选择性为90%，提供催化剂的长期使用寿命。氧化-还原处理后，亚纳米级Pt簇的大小和空间位置得以保持，证实催化剂在不同条件下具有稳定性。

4. 本工作中展示的额外框架金属物种的区域选择性定位概念可以扩展到其他晶体多孔材料，包括金属有机框架和沸石。使用两种互补的STEM技术，HR HAADF-STEM和iDPC，提供了一种研究异质金属催化剂中金属物种在原子水平上的位置的一般方法。

<p>It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18. However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regenerationreaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions.</p>

One frontier in the synthesis of zeolites, and microporous materials more generally, consists in locating active sites in the desired framework or extraframework position1,2,3,4. For instance, in the case of zeolites containing pores and/or cavities of different dimensions, it is clear that locating the active sites selectively in one specific type of pore or cavity is a fundamental challenge with important implications for their catalytic application, due to differences in geometric and confinement effects. For instance, attempts have been reported to preferentially locate framework Al atoms in the intersectional sites or within the 10MR channels of ZSM-5 (MFI-type zeolite)5,6,7. However, when functional metals, such as Pt or Pd, have been introduced by including the metal precursor during the synthesis or through interzeolite transformations, nanoparticles of 12nm instead of subnanometric metal species (single atoms or clusters) have been obtained within the MFI zeolite8,9,10,11. As far as we know, the metal particles show random distribution within the zeolite crystallites.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
例如，在使用孔或腔体尺寸不同的沸石时，选择性地在特定类型的孔或腔体内定位活性位点是其催化应用的重要挑战。例如，有人尝试优先将骨架Al原子定位在交联位点或ZSM-5（MFI型沸石）的10MR通道内5,6,7。然而，当通过在合成过程中引入金属前体或通过互沸石转化引入功能金属如Pt或Pd时，会在MFI沸石中得到12nm的纳米颗粒而不是亚纳米金属物种（单个原子或簇）。据我们所知，金属颗粒在沸石晶粒内呈随机分布。

As illustrated in Figures 1c and d, Pt predominantly appears as nanoparticles of 35nm in the K-free Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Figure 2), whereas subnanometric Pt clusters around 0.40.7nm are the primary species in the K-Pt@MFI sample (Supplementary Figure 3).

To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels. A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species19,20,21. Finally, atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electronically modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
为了实现这一目标，我们进行了Pt-MFI材料的一锅法合成。起始假设是模板分子（TPA+OH）将占据交联空穴，因此限制了Pt物种到达此位置的机会。考虑到波状通道与直通道的空间大小差异，Pt物种可能优先位于波状通道中。引入可控量的K+来补偿硅醇基团，并稳定亚纳米级的Pt物种19,20,21。最后，引入原子分散的Sn物种可以电子地修改Pt簇，以增加丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性。

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite. This stabilization strategy enables the formation of metal clusters with a diameter of about 0.5nm, which is highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The effect on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly in the context of propane conversion, involves the following aspects:

1. Achieving a regular distribution of metal clusters within the zeolite structure leads to enhanced stability and improved catalytic activity for the activation of alkanes.
2. The preferential location of Pt atoms in the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure results in a stable and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
3. The introduction of Sn as a promoter enhances the reactivity and selectivity of the Pt clusters, leading to high initial activity and selectivity in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
4. The use of K to stabilize the Pt clusters during the calcination process prevents sintering and maintains the subnanometric size of the Pt clusters, even after multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.
5. The combination of K and Sn in the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst leads to enhanced reactivity and stability, with the reactivity being maintained for at least three cycles of reaction-regeneration without significant deactivation.
6. The enhanced stability and selectivity of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst are attributed to the regioselective localization of subnanometric Pt clusters in the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, which provides a highly stable and selective environment for the dehydrogenation of propane.
7. The concept of regioselective localization of metal species can be extended to other crystalline porous materials, potentially opening new possibilities for catalytic applications beyond ZSM-5 zeolites.
8. The one-pot synthesis method allows for the encapsulation of Pt species in MFI zeolite with controlled particle size and distribution, leading to enhanced catalytic performance for alkane activation and dehydrogenation reactions.

In summary, the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy, combined with the one-pot synthesis method, facilitates the formation of subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters within MFI zeolite, resulting in enhanced stability, selectivity, and catalytic performance for the activation of alkanes and dehydrogenation reactions. The regioselective localization of these metal clusters within the zeolite structure plays a crucial role in maintaining their stability and enhancing their catalytic activity.

1. The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by aiming to achieve a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm, matching the diameter of the 10MR channels in the zeolite structure. This results in highly stable metal clusters even at high temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. This material opens new possibilities for catalytic applications, including alkane activation.

2. Subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. 

3. The one-pot synthesis strategy involves encapsulating Pt species within the MFI zeolite framework. The hypothesis is that template molecules (TPA+OH) occupy the intersectional voids, limiting the access of Pt species to these positions. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels compared to straight channels, Pt species preferentially locate in the sinusoidal channels.

4. All the Pt-zeolite materials with different chemical compositions exhibit typical X-ray diffraction patterns of MFI zeolite.

5. The presence of K+ in the synthesis mixture significantly affects the size of encapsulated Pt species.

6. After the hydrothermal process, the solid product undergoes isolation, washing, drying, and calcination under specific conditions to stabilize the Pt clusters.

7. Pt@MFI catalysts show initial activity but experience fast deactivation. 

8. Introducing Sn as a promoter enhances the activity and selectivity of Pt clusters in the PtSn@MFI catalyst.

9. The deactivated K-Pt@MFI catalyst can be fully recovered through calcination-reduction treatment cycles, preserving the subnanometric Pt clusters.

10. A reference K-PtSn/MFI catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation exhibits fast deactivation and large Pt nanoparticles after multiple catalytic cycles.

11. The regioselective localization of metal species demonstrated in this work can be extended to other crystalline porous materials like metalorganic frameworks and zeolites.

1. 邱等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过旨在实现金属簇的非常规则分布，即与沸石结构中的10MR通道直径相匹配的大约0.5nm，来解决直接合成过程中时间尺度不匹配的挑战。这导致在高温度和还原气氛下具有高度稳定的金属簇。这种材料为催化应用打开了新的可能性，包括烷烃激活。

2. 子纳米尺寸的Pt簇对于丙烷脱氢反应显示出更高的活性。

3. 一锅法合成策略涉及将Pt物种封装在MFI沸石框架中。假设模板分子（TPA+OH）占据交叉空腔，限制Pt物种进入这些位置的能力。考虑到直通道与正弦通道之间的较大空间，Pt物种倾向于定位在正弦通道中。

4. 所有不同化学组成的Pt-沸石材料都显示典型的MFI沸石衍射模式。

5. 合成混合物中的K+显著影响封装的Pt物种大小。

6. 经过水热过程后，固体产物进行过滤、洗涤、干燥和在特定条件下煅烧以稳定Pt簇。

7. Pt@MFI催化剂表现出初始活性，但很快出现失活现象。

8. 引入Sn作为促进剂可以显著增强Pt簇在PtSn@MFI催化剂中的活性和选择性。

9. 失活的K-Pt@MFI催化剂可以通过至少三个煅烧-还原处理周期完全恢复，同时保持子纳米尺寸的Pt簇。

10. 通过传统的浸渍法制备的参考K-PtSn/MFI催化剂在多个催化循环后表现出快速失活和形成大量Pt纳米颗粒。

11. 在沸石和MOFs等其他晶体孔材料中展示的金属物种的区域选择性定位可以扩展到其他晶体孔材料。
