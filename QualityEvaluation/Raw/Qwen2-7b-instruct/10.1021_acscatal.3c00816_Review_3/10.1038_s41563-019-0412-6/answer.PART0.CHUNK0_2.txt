<p>It has been demonstrated that subnanometric Pt clusters show higher reactivity than Pt nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation reaction18. However, when Pt clusters are supported on solid carriers with open structures, these Pt clusters may suffer fast deactivation, and the subsequent regenerationreaction cycles will lead to severe sintering of Pt. Therefore, if regular Pt clusters can be regioselectively generated within the 10MR channels of a purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the resultant catalyst should present not only high activity, but also an improved stability when working under high-temperature conditions.</p>

To achieve this goal, we have carried out one-pot synthesis of Pt-MFI materials. The starting hypothesis was that the template molecules (TPA+OH) will occupy the intersectional voids, hence limiting the access of Pt species to this position. Considering the larger space in the sinusoidal channels versus the straight channels, Pt species may preferentially be located in the sinusoidal channels. A controllable amount of K+ is introduced to compensate the silanol groups, and to stabilize the subnanometric Pt species19,20,21. Finally, atomically dispersed Sn species can also be introduced to electronically modify the Pt clusters to increase propylene selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

为了实现这一目标，我们进行了Pt-MFI材料的一锅法合成。起始假设是模板分子（TPA+OH）将占据交联空穴，因此限制了Pt物种到达此位置的机会。考虑到波状通道与直通道的空间大小差异，Pt物种可能优先位于波状通道中。引入可控量的K+来补偿硅醇基团，并稳定亚纳米级的Pt物种19,20,21。最后，引入原子分散的Sn物种可以电子地修改Pt簇，以增加丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性。

The interaction between Pt and Sn in the K-PtSn sample has been investigated by CO infrared spectroscopy. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 36, the CO adsorption bands at 1,887 and 1,719 cm−1 can only be observed in the K-PtSn sample, indicating that the introduction of Sn can modulate the electronic structure of Pt clusters. These bands are probably related to the formation of bimetallic PtSn species31.

通过CO红外光谱研究了K-PtSn样本中Pt和Sn之间的相互作用。如补充图36所示，在K-PtSn样本中仅能观察到吸附在1,887和1,719 cm−1的CO吸收带，这表明引入Sn可以调节Pt簇的电子结构。这些带可能是双金属PtSn物种形成的标志31。

<p>Note that if these three objectives were achieved a very regular distribution of metal clusters of about 0.5nm would be obtained, that is with the diameter of the 10MR channels, which would be highly stable against Ostwald ripening sintering, even at high temperature (>550C) under a reductive atmosphere12,13. This type of material should open new possibilities for a number of catalytic applications, including the very relevant activation of alkanes14,15,16,17.</p>

By the combination of K and Sn, the reactivity and stability of Pt should be enhanced. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended. It should be noted that the K-Sn sample without Pt is not active for this reaction, indicating that Sn only modulates the reactivity of Pt.

通过组合K和Sn，Pt的活性和稳定性应该得到增强。确实，如图5d所示，在之前使用的相同反应条件下，K-PtSn样品表现出很高的活性。更重要的是，初始阶段对丙烯的选择性已经相当高（90%），催化剂的寿命显著延长。应该注意的是，不含Pt的K-Sn样本对此反应无活性，这表明Sn仅调节了Pt的活性。

The reactivity and recyclability of different Pt-zeolite catalysts has been compared in terms of initial turnover frequency, mass activity and deactivation rate (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figs. 64 and 65). These results clearly demonstrate that subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in the 10MR channels are a highly stable and selective catalyst for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
