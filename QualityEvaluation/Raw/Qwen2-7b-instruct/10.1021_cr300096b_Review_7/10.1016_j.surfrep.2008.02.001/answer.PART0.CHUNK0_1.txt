[1] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its multiple reaction pathways. Its multiple reaction pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The different structures of bimetallic surfaces, such as surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, and intermixed bimetallic surfaces, lead to significant differences in the modification of the surface d-band center. This, in turn, affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalysts.
