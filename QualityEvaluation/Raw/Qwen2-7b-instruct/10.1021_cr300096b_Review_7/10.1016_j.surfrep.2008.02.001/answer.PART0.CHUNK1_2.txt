Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. Its unique interaction with the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, characterized by a much weaker interaction compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111), enables the onset of a self-hydrogenation pathway. This pathway, facilitated by the subsurface structure's weaker binding energy towards cyclohexene, provides insights into the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The DFT calculations further confirm that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more effective for hydrogenation due to its weaker bonding towards cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The trend of decreasing hydrogenation yield on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces, which bond weaker to cyclohexene than PtNiPt(111), illustrates the volcano relationship between hydrogenation activity and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. By studying cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

Cyclohexene's unique reactivity on PtNiPt(111) is crucial for hydrogenation reactions as it enables a self-hydrogenation pathway, which is not observed on Pt(111) or Ni(111). The weaker interaction between cyclohexene and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer is due to the modification of the surface d-band center, which shifts away from the Fermi level. This shift facilitates the hydrogenation of cyclohexene by weakening the binding of both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen to the surface. The trend of decreasing hydrogenation activity on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces, which have stronger interactions with cyclohexene, suggests a volcano relationship between hydrogenation activity and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. By studying cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways, researchers can gain insights into optimizing hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因其能够在双金属催化剂上表现出多种反应途径。在PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层结构上的特殊相互作用，其与Pt(111)或Ni(111)相比具有更弱的相互作用，能够引发自我氢化路径。这一路径由亚表面结构对环己烯较弱的结合能所促进，为催化剂的氢化活性和选择性提供了见解。通过密度泛函理论计算进一步证实，PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构在氢化环己烯方面更为有效，这是由于它对环己烯和原子氢的较弱结合力。在PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)表面上氢化活性的降低趋势，表明了氢化活性与双金属表面的能带中心之间存在火山关系。通过研究环己烯的多种反应途径，研究人员可以深入了解双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中的氢化活性和选择性。

在PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层结构上的独特反应性对于氢化反应至关重要，因为它允许自我氢化路径的产生，该路径在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上不存在。PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层结构与环己烯之间较弱的相互作用归因于表面能带中心的修改，该中心向费米能级偏移。这种偏移通过削弱环己烯和原子氢在表面的结合力来促进环己烯的氢化。在PtCoPt(111)和PtFePt(111)表面上氢化活性降低的趋势表明了氢化活性与双金属表面的能带中心之间的火山关系。通过研究环己烯的多种反应途径，研究人员可以深入了解优化工业过程中氢化活性和选择性的方法。
