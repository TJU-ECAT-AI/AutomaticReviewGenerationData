[2] "One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability."

[3] "Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy [15] ,[16] . Therefore, the formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."

[4] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."

[5] "The dissociative adsorption and desorption of hydrogen will be used to reveal the correlation between the hydrogen binding energy and the surface d-band center for various bimetallic surfaces."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, which can provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. These pathways can reveal the effectiveness of different catalysts in converting cyclohexene into various products, thereby highlighting the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic ones. The electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, particularly the position of the surface d-band center, can significantly affect the hydrogen binding energy and, consequently, the hydrogenation activity and selectivity. DFT modeling and experimental studies have shown a clear correlation between the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy of hydrogen, enabling the prediction of catalyst structures with desired chemical properties. By analyzing the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the role of bimetallic catalysts in industrial processes, optimizing them for improved efficiency and selectivity.
