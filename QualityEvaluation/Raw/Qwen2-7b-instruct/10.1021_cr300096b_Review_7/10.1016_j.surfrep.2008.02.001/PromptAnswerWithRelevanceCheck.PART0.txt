Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces, providing insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Its unique properties, such as being a cyclic hydrocarbon, allow for the exploration of how different surface terminations affect the stability and reactivity of the molecule. The ability to switch between weakly and strongly π-bonded forms on various surfaces enables the examination of how the electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts impact the hydrogenation process. This, in turn, can guide the rational design of catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for specific hydrogenation reactions.

When studying hydrogenation reactions using cyclohexene, the multiple reaction pathways observed on different surfaces offer valuable information on the balance between hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes. By analyzing the formation of various products, researchers can gain insights into the factors affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the hydrogenation catalyst. For instance, the self-hydrogenation pathway, where adsorbed cyclohexene undergoes decomposition to produce hydrogen, followed by subsequent hydrogenation, highlights the importance of surface properties in facilitating this process. Understanding these pathways can help in identifying bimetallic surfaces that promote hydrogenation while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Moreover, the volcano-type relationship between the activity/selectivity and the magnitude of the d-band center shift, as demonstrated by the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene, suggests that there is a specific range of electronic properties that optimizes hydrogenation efficiency. By correlating the electronic structure modifications introduced by bimetallic surfaces with the reaction outcomes, it becomes possible to tailor catalysts with desired activity and selectivity for specific industrial processes. This knowledge can significantly contribute to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly hydrogenation technologies.

In summary, cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces provide a comprehensive framework for exploring the complex interplay between electronic properties and catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions. This understanding can drive the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity, ultimately leading to advancements in various industrial applications such as chemical synthesis, fuel production, and environmental remediation.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. Its unique interaction with the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer, characterized by a much weaker interaction compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111), enables the onset of a self-hydrogenation pathway. This pathway, facilitated by the subsurface structure's weaker binding energy towards cyclohexene, provides insights into the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalyst. The DFT calculations further confirm that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more effective for hydrogenation due to its weaker bonding towards cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen. The trend of decreasing hydrogenation yield on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces, which bond weaker to cyclohexene than PtNiPt(111), illustrates the volcano relationship between hydrogenation activity and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. By studying cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

Cyclohexene's unique reactivity on PtNiPt(111) is crucial for hydrogenation reactions as it enables a self-hydrogenation pathway, which is not observed on Pt(111) or Ni(111). The weaker interaction between cyclohexene and the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer is due to the modification of the surface d-band center, which shifts away from the Fermi level. This shift facilitates the hydrogenation of cyclohexene by weakening the binding of both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen to the surface. The trend of decreasing hydrogenation activity on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces, which have stronger interactions with cyclohexene, suggests a volcano relationship between hydrogenation activity and the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces. By studying cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways, researchers can gain insights into optimizing hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

To serve as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions, cyclohexene can undergo multiple reaction pathways that are influenced by the type of bimetallic catalyst used. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene hydrogenation can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts impact hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. For instance, the presence of two catalyst metals can lead to the formation of different active sites for hydrogenation, allowing for a broader range of reaction outcomes. The electronic and structural properties of the bimetallic catalyst, such as the coordination geometry and electronic density of states, can dictate the preferential hydrogenation pathways of cyclohexene, leading to the formation of cis- or trans-cyclohexene or even cyclohexane. The DFT modeling and experimental results suggest that the position of the surface d-band center in the bimetallic catalyst correlates with the adsorption energy of hydrogen and cyclohexene, providing a basis for predicting catalyst activity and selectivity. Therefore, by studying the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on different bimetallic catalysts, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how the catalyst structure affects reaction outcomes and optimize catalyst design for enhanced performance in industrial processes.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways. Its unique interaction with the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer structure, as evidenced by distinct vibrational spectra and hydrogenation pathways, allows for the investigation of hydrogenation activity and selectivity influenced by the presence of bimetallic catalysts. The hydrogenation of benzene, on the other hand, does not occur under ultra-high vacuum conditions, despite its potential to provide insights into the hydrogenation activity of aromatic compounds.

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. The presence of weakly bonded cyclohexene on the surface indicates that the catalyst can efficiently hydrogenate the molecule. The ability to observe both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways provides insights into the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

2. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene is influenced by the bimetallic catalyst's surface properties. The subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more effective in hydrogenation than the surface NiPt(111) structure, as evidenced by higher hydrogenation yields and the ability to produce benzene from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene. This suggests that the d-band center plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions.

3. The confirmation of weakly π -bonded cyclohexene on NiW(110) highlights the importance of the surface d-band center in controlling the reaction pathway. Catalysts with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level tend to favor hydrogenation reactions, whereas those with a d-band center further from the Fermi level may promote dehydrogenation.

4. The use of cyclohexene as a probe molecule for studying the chemical activities of Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), and NiRu(0001) surfaces allows researchers to correlate the surface d-band center with the catalyst's performance in hydrogenation reactions. By observing the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene, scientists can identify surfaces with optimized hydrogenation activity.

5. The adsorption of cyclohexene on the surface of the catalyst needs to be balanced with the hydrogenation process. A volcano-type relationship exists between the adsorption strength of cyclohexene and the catalyst's hydrogenation activity, indicating that catalysts with an intermediate adsorption strength are most effective for hydrogenation reactions.

[2] "One of the main goals of the catalysis industry is to develop new materials that have novel catalytic properties. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinctly different from those of the parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity and stability."

[3] "Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy [15] ,[16] . Therefore, the formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."

[4] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."

[5] "The dissociative adsorption and desorption of hydrogen will be used to reveal the correlation between the hydrogen binding energy and the surface d-band center for various bimetallic surfaces."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, which can provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. These pathways can reveal the effectiveness of different catalysts in converting cyclohexene into various products, thereby highlighting the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic ones. The electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, particularly the position of the surface d-band center, can significantly affect the hydrogen binding energy and, consequently, the hydrogenation activity and selectivity. DFT modeling and experimental studies have shown a clear correlation between the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy of hydrogen, enabling the prediction of catalyst structures with desired chemical properties. By analyzing the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the role of bimetallic catalysts in industrial processes, optimizing them for improved efficiency and selectivity.
