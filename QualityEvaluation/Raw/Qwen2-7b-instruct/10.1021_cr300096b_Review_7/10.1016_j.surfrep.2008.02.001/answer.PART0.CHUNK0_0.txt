[1] "In the past few years there have been significant efforts in experimental and DFT modeling of MBS. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the top-most surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results clearly indicated that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures."

[2] "The dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(111) and Pt(111) is not an activated process."

[3] "H2 desorbs from the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure at a lower temperature than that from Pt(111) and Ni(111), while the desorption from the NiPt(111) surface structure occurs at a higher temperature than that of either parent metal surfaces."

[4] "DFT modeling is performed to understand the origin of the different hydrogen binding energy (HBE) from the four surfaces."

1. Depending on experimental conditions, monolayer admetal interacts with the host metal substrate in one of three structures: surface monolayer, subsurface monolayer, or inter-mixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling reveals that the modification on the surface d-band center varies significantly among these structures.

2. The dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ni(111) and Pt(111) is not an activated process, implying that the desorption temperatures are indicative of the respective metalH bond strengths.

3. H2 desorbs at a lower temperature from the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure than from Pt(111) or Ni(111), whereas it desorbs at a higher temperature from the surface NiPt(111) structure compared to the parent metals.

4. DFT modeling elucidates the reasons behind the distinct hydrogen binding energies observed on the four surfaces.

1. 根据实验条件，单层吸附金属可以与宿主金属基底形成三种结构之一：占据最顶部表面位点产生表面单层、扩散进入亚表面区域形成亚表面单层，或者与表面合金化形成混合二元合金表面。DFT模型结果清楚地表明，这三种类型的二元合金结构中表面d带中心的修改显著不同。

2. 小部件（Ni）(111)和铂（Pt）(111)上的氢解离吸附不是一个激活过程，这意味着脱附温度反映了相应的金属H键强度。

3. 从亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构脱附的H2温度低于从Pt(111)或Ni(111)脱附的温度，而从表面NiPt(111)结构脱附的H2温度高于两种母金属表面的脱附温度。

4. DFT模型解释了四个表面上观察到的不同氢结合能的原因。
