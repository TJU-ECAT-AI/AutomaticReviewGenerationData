[1] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143], as shown in Fig. 39. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."
[2] "Based on the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of linear and cyclic alkenes on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures, it is natural to explore whether the hydrogenation of benzene also occurs on these surfaces."
[3] "Unlike linear and cyclic alkenes, the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur under UHV conditions [141]. This was not unexpected, however, due to the nature of benzene being an aromatic molecule and therefore thermodynamically more stable as compared to the alkenes."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways. Its unique interaction with the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer structure, as evidenced by distinct vibrational spectra and hydrogenation pathways, allows for the investigation of hydrogenation activity and selectivity influenced by the presence of bimetallic catalysts. The hydrogenation of benzene, on the other hand, does not occur under ultra-high vacuum conditions, despite its potential to provide insights into the hydrogenation activity of aromatic compounds. This is expected due to the inherent thermodynamic stability of benzene, which contrasts with the less stable nature of alkenes and cyclic alkenes.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因其具有多个反应途径。环己烯与PtNiPt(111)亚表面单层结构的独特相互作用，通过其独特的振动谱和氢化途径，允许我们研究双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性的影响。苯的氢化在超高真空条件下并未发生，这与预期相符，因为苯的热力学稳定性使其与不饱和化合物相比更为稳定。尽管如此，这仍为探索芳香化合物的氢化活性提供了可能。
