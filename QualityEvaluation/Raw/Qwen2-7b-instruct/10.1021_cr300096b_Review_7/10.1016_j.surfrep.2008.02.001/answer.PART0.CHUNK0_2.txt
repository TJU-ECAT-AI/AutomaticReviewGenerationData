[1] "Monolayer bimetallic surfaces: Experimental and theoretical studies of trends in electronic and chemical properties Abstract The current review focuses on the general trends in the electronic and chemical properties of monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS)."
[2] "Depending on the deposition temperature and reaction environment, the admetal in MBS can be in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "In the current review we will use one the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, surface and subsurface Ni monolayer on Pt(111), as a model system to introduce the synthesis, characterization, and DFT modeling of MBS structures."
[4] "Specifically, a shift in the d-band center away from the Fermi level results in a weaker binding energy."
[5] "Therefore, the formation of a bimetallic bond in MBS can lead to a shift in the surface d-band, resulting in a decrease or increase in the adsorbate binding energy."
[6] "The modification of the structural and electronic properties of MBS can also lead to new reaction pathways of catalytically important reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cyclotrimerization."
[7] "For example, the faceting surface of Pd, obtained by depositing one monolayer Pd on W(211), showed a substantial enhancement in the activity towards the cyclotrimerization pathway than that on either Pd(110) or W(211) surfaces."
[8] "In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results revealed a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various MBS structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties."

To serve as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions, cyclohexene can undergo multiple reaction pathways that are influenced by the type of bimetallic catalyst used. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene hydrogenation can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts impact hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. For instance, the presence of two catalyst metals can lead to the formation of different active sites for hydrogenation, allowing for a broader range of reaction outcomes. The electronic and structural properties of the bimetallic catalyst, such as the coordination geometry and electronic density of states, can dictate the preferential hydrogenation pathways of cyclohexene, leading to the formation of cis- or trans-cyclohexene or even cyclohexane. The DFT modeling and experimental results suggest that the position of the surface d-band center in the bimetallic catalyst correlates with the adsorption energy of hydrogen and cyclohexene, providing a basis for predicting catalyst activity and selectivity. Therefore, by studying the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on different bimetallic catalysts, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how the catalyst structure affects reaction outcomes and optimize catalyst design for enhanced performance in industrial processes.
