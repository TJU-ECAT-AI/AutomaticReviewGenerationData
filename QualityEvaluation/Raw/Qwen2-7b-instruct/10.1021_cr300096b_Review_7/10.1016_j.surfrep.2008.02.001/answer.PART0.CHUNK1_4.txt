[1] "The results shown earlier in Fig. 31 already reveal that the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene does not occur on Ni(111), due mainly to the strong bonding of cyclohexene."
[2] "The weaker interaction of ethylene on PtNiPt(111), as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111), was confirmed by DFT calculations of ethylene binding energy on these surfaces [139]."
[3] "The presence of weakly π -bonded cyclohexene on NiW(110) is also confirmed using HREELS measurements [144]."
[4] "The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center."
[5] "The weaker binding energy of cyclohexene might favor the hydrogenation, the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to occur."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic catalysts. The presence of weakly bonded cyclohexene on the surface indicates that the catalyst can efficiently hydrogenate the molecule. The ability to observe both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways provides insights into the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalyst.

2. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene is influenced by the bimetallic catalyst's surface properties. The subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is more effective in hydrogenation than the surface NiPt(111) structure, as evidenced by higher hydrogenation yields and the ability to produce benzene from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene. This suggests that the d-band center plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions.

3. The confirmation of weakly π -bonded cyclohexene on NiW(110) highlights the importance of the surface d-band center in controlling the reaction pathway. Catalysts with a d-band center closer to the Fermi level tend to favor hydrogenation reactions, whereas those with a d-band center further from the Fermi level may promote dehydrogenation.

4. The use of cyclohexene as a probe molecule for studying the chemical activities of Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), and NiRu(0001) surfaces allows researchers to correlate the surface d-band center with the catalyst's performance in hydrogenation reactions. By observing the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene, scientists can identify surfaces with optimized hydrogenation activity.

5. The adsorption of cyclohexene on the surface of the catalyst needs to be balanced with the hydrogenation process. A volcano-type relationship exists between the adsorption strength of cyclohexene and the catalyst's hydrogenation activity, indicating that catalysts with an intermediate adsorption strength are most effective for hydrogenation reactions.

1. 异环己烷作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，因为它可以在双金属催化剂上表现出多种反应途径。表面上的弱键合异环己烷表明催化剂可以高效地加氢该分子。观察到的氢化和脱氢途径提供了关于催化剂加氢活性和选择性的见解。

2. 异环己烷的加氢受到双金属催化剂表面性质的影响。在 PtNiPt(111) 下表面结构比 NiPt(111) 表面结构更有效，因为氢化产物的产率更高，并且能够从异环己烯的脱氢产生苯。这表明费米能级附近的表面d带中心对氢化反应具有关键作用。

3. 异环己烷在 NiW(110) 上的确认为弱π键合异环己烷强调了表面d带中心在控制反应路径中的重要性。费米能级附近的表面d带中心倾向于促进加氢反应，而远离费米能级的表面d带中心可能促进脱氢反应。

4. 使用异环己烷作为探针分子来研究 Ni 单层、NiPt(111)、NiW(110) 和 NiRu(0001) 表面的化学活性允许研究人员将表面d带中心与加氢反应的催化剂性能相关联。通过观察异环己烷的自加氢，科学家可以识别出具有优化加氢活性的表面。

5. 需要在催化剂表面上平衡异环己烷的吸附强度与氢化过程。存在吸附强度与催化剂加氢活性之间的火山型关系，表明具有中间吸附强度的催化剂最有效于加氢反应。
