[1] "The low-temperature self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni /Pt(111) are among the earliest examples that demonstrate the novel reaction pathways that are not present on parent metals."
[2] "In this section we will use the self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to correlate the hydrogenation activity with the surface d-band center of bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "Similar to the trends observed for linear and cyclic alkenes described earlier, benzene adsorb more weakly on the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures than on Pt(111) or the corresponding 3d-Pt(111) surface structures."
[4] "For the Ni /Pt bimetallic system, the surface NiPt(111) structure is preferred for the reforming of methanol due to its stronger bonding to methanol and to the reforming intermediates and products."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its unique reaction pathways on bimetallic surfaces that differ from those on parent metals. These pathways, such as self-hydrogenation and hydrogenation, can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. For instance, the weak bonding of cyclohexene to subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures compared to parent metals highlights the importance of the surface d-band center in determining hydrogenation activity. The selectivity towards hydrogenation of cyclohexene can also be influenced by the d-band center, demonstrating the volcano-type relationship between activity and the magnitude of d-band center shift.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它在双金属表面表现出与母金属不同的独特反应路径。这些路径，如自氢化和氢化，可以提供有关双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中氢化活性和选择性的见解。例如，环己烯与子表面Pt-3d-Pt(111)结构之间的弱结合比母金属更能突出表面d带中心在决定氢化活性中的重要性。环己烯的氢化选择性也可以受到d带中心的影响，这表明了活性与d带中心偏移量之间的火山型关系。
