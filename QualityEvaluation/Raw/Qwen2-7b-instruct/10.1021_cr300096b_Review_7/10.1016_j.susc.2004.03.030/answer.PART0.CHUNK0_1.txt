1. NO2 adsorbs on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. No N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K. Under certain conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states.

2. The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML. Heating to 900 K leaves θO = 0.2 ML at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species exhibiting a (4 × 4) LEED pattern. Oxidation of the alloy can be increased by dosing NO2 on the surface held at 600 K, which keeps the surface free of coadsorbed NO and provides thermal energy for activated NO2 dissociation.

3. NO2 is a weaker oxidant than ozone (O3), as observed in the experiments. Saliba et al. observed a Pt AES shift of 0.8 eV after the adsorption of 2 ML of oxygen atoms using ozone (O3) exposures on Pt(1 1 1) at 300 K. This, along with a sharp, intense peak near 800 K in subsequent O2 TPD spectra, attributed to Pt oxidation. By contrast, Parker et al. noted no Pt AES shift for the adsorption of up to 0.75 ML of oxygen adatoms and no sharp O2 TPD peak resulting from NO2 exposures on Pt(1 1 1).

1.NO2在120 K温度下在（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上吸附为N,N共价键二聚体N2O4，通过单个氧原子与表面相互作用，在垂直但倾斜的几何形状中。没有N2O4或NO2以分子形式从单层状态脱附。该二聚体在300 K时完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O在300至400 K之间。在某些条件下，吸附的氧以三个清晰的脱附状态释放为O2。

2. 加热N2O4单层后获得的最大氧覆盖度约为θO=0.4 ML。加热到900 K后，表面保留有0.2 ML与氧化Sn物种相关的氧，对应于具有（4×4）LEED图案的有序Sn1.5O薄膜。通过在600 K的表面施加NO2并保持表面免受共吸附NO的影响，可以增加合金的氧化程度，并提供激活NO2分解所需的热能。

3.NO2是比臭氧（O3）弱得多的氧化剂，在实验中观察到这一点。Saliba等人在300 K时观察到在Pt(1 1 1)上使用臭氧（O3）暴露吸附2 ML氧原子后，Pt AES偏移了0.8 eV。这，以及随后在O2 TPD光谱中的接近800 K的尖锐、强烈的峰值，归因于Pt氧化。相比之下，Parker等人在Pt(1 1 1)上注意到没有Pt AES偏移，也没有从NO2暴露产生的显著的O2 TPD峰值，对于吸附至多0.75 ML的氧原子吸附。
