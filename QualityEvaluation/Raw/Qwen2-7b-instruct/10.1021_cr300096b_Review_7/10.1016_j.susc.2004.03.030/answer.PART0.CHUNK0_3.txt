[1] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry."
[3] "However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state."
[4] "The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface."
[5] "Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K."
[6] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[7] "Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation."

NO2 adsorbs on the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, at 120 K. This dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. NO2 does not desorb molecularly from the monolayer state until it dissociates completely at 300 K. Upon dissociation, NO2 further breaks down into coadsorbed NO and O at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 K. Adsorbed oxygen then desorbs as O2 in three distinct states: from Pt sites and the decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx.

在120 K时，NO2以N,N共价键二聚体N2O4的形式吸附到（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上。该二聚体通过单个氧原子与表面形成倾斜的直立几何结构相互作用。NO2不会从单层状态分子地脱附，直到在300 K完全分解。分解后，NO2进一步分解为共吸附的NO和O在300至400 K之间。吸附的氧随后以三种不同状态脱附为O2：从Pt位点脱附以及还原锡氧化物相（SnOx）的分解。
