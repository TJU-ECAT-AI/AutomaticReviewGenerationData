[1] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry."
[3] "However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state."
[4] "The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface."
[5] "Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K."
[6] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[7] "Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation."
[8] "The maximum oxygen atom coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML, but this can be increased to θO=1.1 ML by NO2 dosing on the alloy surface at 600 K to remove inhibition by coadsorbed NO."
[9] "This is also a higher coverage than reported by Saliba et al. of θO=0.87 ML after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K."

1. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is adsorbed as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy at 120 K. This dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. At this temperature, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state. 
2. The N2O4 dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Further heating to 300400 K causes adsorbed NO2 to dissociate into coadsorbed NO and O.
3. Heating the N2O4 monolayer can increase the maximum oxygen atom coverage from about 0.4 ML to 1.1 ML by removing inhibition from coadsorbed NO through NO2 dosing on the alloy surface at 600 K.
4. The oxygen atom coverage is higher than what was reported by Saliba et al. after O3 exposures on the 3 alloy at 300 K.

1.NO2在120 K时以N,N共价键二聚体N2O4的形式吸附到（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上。这个二聚体通过单个氧原子与表面形成倾斜但直立的相互作用。在这个温度下，没有N2O4或NO2从单层状态分子地脱附。
2.N2O4二聚体在300 K时完全分解，留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O在表面上。进一步加热到300至400 K导致吸附的NO2分解成共吸附的NO和O。
3.通过在600 K时向合金表面施加NO2并移除由共吸附的NO引起的抑制，加热N2O4单层可以将最大氧原子覆盖度从约0.4 ML增加到1.1 ML。
4.这种氧原子覆盖度高于Saliba等人在300 K时对3合金进行O3暴露后报道的结果。
