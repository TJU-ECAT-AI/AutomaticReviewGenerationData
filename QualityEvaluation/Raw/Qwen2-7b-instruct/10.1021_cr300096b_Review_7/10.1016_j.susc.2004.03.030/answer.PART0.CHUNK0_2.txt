[1] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry."
[3] "However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state."
[4] "The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface."
[5] "Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K."
[6] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."

NO2 adsorbs on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, at 120 K. This dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. NO2 does not desorb molecularly from the monolayer state until the dimer completely dissociates at 300 K. This dissociation leaves coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Further heating causes adsorbed NO2 to dissociate into NO and O at temperatures between 300 and 400 K. The adsorbed oxygen then desorbs as O2 in three distinct desorption states, including desorption from Pt sites and decomposition of reduced tin oxide phases, SnOx.

在120 K时，NO2以N,N共价键二聚体N2O4的形式吸附到(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上。这个二聚体通过单个氧原子与表面呈直立但倾斜的几何形状相互作用。NO2不会从单层状态分子地脱附，直到该二聚体在300 K完全分解。分解后，在表面上留下共吸附的NO2、NO和O。进一步加热导致吸附的NO2在300至400 K之间分解成NO和O。吸附的氧随后以三种不同的脱附状态脱附为O2，包括从Pt位点的脱附以及还原锡氧化物相（SnOx）的分解。
