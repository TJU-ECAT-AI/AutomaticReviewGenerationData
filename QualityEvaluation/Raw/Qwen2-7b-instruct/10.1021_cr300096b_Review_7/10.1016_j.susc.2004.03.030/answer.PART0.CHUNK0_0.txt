[1] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed molecularly as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry."
[3] "However, no N2O4 or NO2 desorbs molecularly from the monolayer state."
[4] "The dimer completely dissociates at 300 K, leaving coadsorbed NO2, NO, and O on the surface."
[5] "Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to coadsorbed NO and O at 300400 K."
[6] "Under these latter conditions, adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states, the lowest of which is associated with O2 desorption from Pt sites and the other two are from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx."
[7] "Shifts in Sn AES peaks were used to follow Sn oxidation."

Adsorption of NO2 on the (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy occurs at 120 K as a N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, interacting with the surface through a single oxygen atom. This dimer does not desorb molecularly at this coverage. It completely dissociates at 300 K, releasing NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Further heating causes NO2 to dissociate into NO and O at 300-400 K. Adsorbed oxygen desorbs as O2 in three clear desorption states: from Pt sites, and from decomposition of reduced tin oxide phase(s), SnOx. AES shifts were observed to track Sn oxidation.

在120 K时，NO2在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附以N,N-键合二聚体N2O4的形式发生，通过单个氧原子与表面相互作用。此二聚体在该覆盖率下不会分子化脱附。它在300 K完全解离，释放NO2、NO和O到表面上。进一步加热导致NO2分解为NO和O在300-400 K之间。吸附的氧以三个清晰的脱附状态脱附为O2：从Pt位点脱附，以及从还原锡氧化物相（SnOx）的分解中脱附。通过AES峰的变化跟踪了Sn的氧化。
