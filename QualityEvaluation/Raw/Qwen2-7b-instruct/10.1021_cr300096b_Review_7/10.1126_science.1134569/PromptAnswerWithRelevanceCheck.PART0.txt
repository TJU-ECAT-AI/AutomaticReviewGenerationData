How does the stabilization of Pt oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts using gold clusters contribute to the advancement of fuel cell technology, particularly in addressing the issue of Pt dissolution under potential cycling?

The stabilization of Pt oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts using gold clusters addresses a critical challenge in fuel cell technology, specifically the instability of Pt electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. This issue becomes particularly problematic in vehicle applications where continuous potential cycling is required. By modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold clusters, the behavior of the catalyst is stabilized against dissolution under oxidizing conditions and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts over 30,000 cycles. The Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, preventing significant changes in the activity and surface area of the modified Pt catalyst compared to the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. This stabilization ensures the continued efficiency and longevity of the catalyst, which is crucial for the development of more reliable and efficient fuel cells.

The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined through an accelerated stability test involving continuous linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V. This test simulates the potential cycling regime experienced by fuel cells in real-world applications. Voltammetry was utilized to measure the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes before and after potential cycling, providing evidence of the lack of surface area loss in the Au/Pt/C catalyst. This finding highlights the potential of Au clusters to enhance the stability and performance of Pt-based electrocatalysts in fuel cells, paving the way for advancements in fuel cell technology and their practical applications, especially in transportation.

In summary, the use of gold clusters as a modifier for Pt oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts significantly contributes to the stability and longevity of fuel cell technology by mitigating the issue of Pt dissolution under potential cycling, which is essential for the widespread adoption and reliability of fuel cells in automotive and other energy sectors.

如何通过使用金簇对铂氧还原电催化剂的稳定化，为燃料电池技术的进步做出贡献，尤其是解决铂溶解问题下的潜力循环问题？

通过将金簇添加到铂纳米粒子中，解决了燃料电池技术中的关键挑战，特别是铂电催化剂在氧还原反应（ORR）中的不稳定性问题。在车辆应用中连续进行的潜力循环是这一问题的关键。在氧化条件下以及在0.6至1.1伏特之间进行的持续的潜力扫描下，铂氧还原电催化剂的稳定性得到了提高，经过超过30,000次周期循环后，铂的氧化潜能被提高，从而防止了纯铂催化剂在相同条件下活动性和表面面积的显著变化。这种稳定化确保了催化剂的持续效率和持久性，对于开发更可靠和高效的燃料电池至关重要。

通过连续线性潜力扫面从0.6至1.1伏特的加速稳定性测试，确定了铂的稳定性效应。这种测试模拟了燃料电池在实际应用中的潜在循环环境。通过在Au/Pt/C和Pt/C电极上进行的电压扫描前后的氢吸附来测量铂表面面积，提供了Au/Pt/C催化剂缺乏表面面积损失的证据。这一发现强调了金簇增强铂基电催化剂稳定性的潜力，为燃料电池技术的发展铺平了道路，并且对于汽车和其他能源领域的大规模采用和可靠性具有重要意义。

总之，通过使用金簇作为铂氧还原电催化剂的修改剂，显着地提高了燃料电池技术的稳定性和持久性，通过缓解铂溶解问题下的潜力循环问题，这对于燃料电池技术的广泛应用和可靠性至关重要。

The Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles are significantly smaller compared to those on a Pt(111) surface. These Au clusters stabilize the Pt nanoparticles under oxidizing conditions, maintaining their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity without affecting the ORR kinetics. Voltammetry measurements confirm the Pt surface area before and after potential cycling, showing no significant loss for the Au/Pt/C catalyst. The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt is attributed to a decreased oxidation of Pt nanoparticles, which is crucial for the ORR activity in fuel cells. This phenomenon has potential applications beyond fuel cells, offering a promising approach to synthesize improved ORR catalysts and stabilize Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.

碳支持的铂纳米颗粒上的金簇比在 Pt(111) 表面上的要小得多。这些金簇在氧化条件下稳定铂纳米颗粒，保持其氧还原反应（ORR）活性，而不会影响ORR动力学。伏安法测量证实，在潜在循环前后，Au/Pt/C催化剂的Pt表面积没有显著损失。Au簇对Pt的稳定效果归因于Pt纳米颗粒的氧化程度降低，这对于燃料电池中的ORR活性至关重要。这种现象在燃料电池之外具有潜在的应用，为合成改进的ORR催化剂和稳定Pt及其其他Pt族金属在氧化条件下提供了有希望的方法。

The study demonstrates that adding gold clusters to platinum nanoparticles can stabilize them against dissolution when subjected to potential cycling conditions, particularly those related to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. This stabilization allows the platinum catalyst to maintain its activity and surface area even after extensive cycling, unlike pure platinum catalysts which experience significant losses in activity and surface area under the same conditions.
