[1] "Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans."
[2] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."
[3] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."
[4] "For the Pt/C catalyst (11.9 μgPt/cm2), the measured degradation of the half-wave potential (E1/2) after 30,000 cycles (at room temperature) was 39 mV."

The study demonstrates that adding gold clusters to platinum nanoparticles can stabilize them against dissolution when subjected to potential cycling conditions, particularly those related to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. This stabilization allows the platinum catalyst to maintain its activity and surface area even after extensive cycling, unlike pure platinum catalysts which experience significant losses in activity and surface area under the same conditions.

研究表明，在铂纳米颗粒中添加金簇可以稳定它们，使其在涉及燃料电池中氧还原反应（ORR）的电位循环条件下不易溶解。这种稳定化使得铂催化剂即使在大量循环后仍能保持其活性和表面积，而纯铂催化剂在相同的条件下会经历显著的活性和表面积损失。
