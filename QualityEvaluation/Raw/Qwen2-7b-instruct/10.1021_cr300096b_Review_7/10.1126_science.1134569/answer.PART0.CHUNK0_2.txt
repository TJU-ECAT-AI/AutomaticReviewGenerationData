[1] "The Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles were generated using the same method. Because the size of the Pt nanoparticles is about 3 nm, the Au clusters on Au/Pt/C are clearly much smaller than those on Au/Pt(111)."
[2] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."
[3] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling."
[4] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters and lack of ORR inhibition, despite blockage of approximately one-third of the Pt sites on Au/Pt/C by Au, are intriguing phenomena that may have additional applications beyond fuel cells."
[5] "The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters."

The Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles are significantly smaller compared to those on a Pt(111) surface. These Au clusters stabilize the Pt nanoparticles under oxidizing conditions, maintaining their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity without affecting the ORR kinetics. Voltammetry measurements confirm the Pt surface area before and after potential cycling, showing no significant loss for the Au/Pt/C catalyst. The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt is attributed to a decreased oxidation of Pt nanoparticles, which is crucial for the ORR activity in fuel cells. This phenomenon has potential applications beyond fuel cells, offering a promising approach to synthesize improved ORR catalysts and stabilize Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions.

碳支持的铂纳米颗粒上的金簇比在 Pt(111) 表面上的要小得多。这些金簇在氧化条件下稳定铂纳米颗粒，保持其氧还原反应（ORR）活性，而不会影响ORR动力学。伏安法测量证实，在潜在循环前后，Au/Pt/C催化剂的Pt表面积没有显著损失。Au簇对Pt的稳定效果归因于Pt纳米颗粒的氧化程度降低，这对于燃料电池中的ORR活性至关重要。这种现象在燃料电池之外具有潜在的应用，为合成改进的ORR催化剂和稳定Pt及其其他Pt族金属在氧化条件下提供了有希望的方法。
