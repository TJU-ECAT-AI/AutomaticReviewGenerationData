[1] "Our results show promise toward resolving this impediment."
[2] "Recent work recorded a substantial loss of the Pt surface area over time in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) (11) during the stop-and-go driving of an electric car; this depletion exceeded the Pt dissolution rates observed upon holding at constant potentials (12) for extended time spans."
[3] "The Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles were generated using the same method. Because the size of the Pt nanoparticles is about 3 nm, the Au clusters on Au/Pt/C are clearly much smaller than those on Au/Pt(111)."
[4] "The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."
[5] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling."
[6] "The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters."

How does the stabilization of Pt oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts using gold clusters contribute to the advancement of fuel cell technology, particularly in addressing the issue of Pt dissolution under potential cycling?

The stabilization of Pt oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts using gold clusters addresses a critical challenge in fuel cell technology, specifically the instability of Pt electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. This issue becomes particularly problematic in vehicle applications where continuous potential cycling is required. By modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold clusters, the behavior of the catalyst is stabilized against dissolution under oxidizing conditions and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts over 30,000 cycles. The Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, preventing significant changes in the activity and surface area of the modified Pt catalyst compared to the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. This stabilization ensures the continued efficiency and longevity of the catalyst, which is crucial for the development of more reliable and efficient fuel cells.

The stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined through an accelerated stability test involving continuous linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V. This test simulates the potential cycling regime experienced by fuel cells in real-world applications. Voltammetry was utilized to measure the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes before and after potential cycling, providing evidence of the lack of surface area loss in the Au/Pt/C catalyst. This finding highlights the potential of Au clusters to enhance the stability and performance of Pt-based electrocatalysts in fuel cells, paving the way for advancements in fuel cell technology and their practical applications, especially in transportation.

In summary, the use of gold clusters as a modifier for Pt oxygen-reduction electrocatalysts significantly contributes to the stability and longevity of fuel cell technology by mitigating the issue of Pt dissolution under potential cycling, which is essential for the widespread adoption and reliability of fuel cells in automotive and other energy sectors.
