[1] "Our results show promise toward resolving this impediment."
[2] "We conducted the test by applying potential sweeps at the rate of 50 mV/s to a thin-layer rotating disk electrode in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at room temperature."
[3] "Voltammetry was used to determine the Pt surface area of the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C electrodes by measuring H adsorption before and after potential cycling."
[4] "The high Pt oxidation potential of the Au/Pt/C electrocatalyst (that is, the lower extent of Pt oxidation) is clearly the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters."

The document demonstrates that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This behavior was observed under oxidizing conditions of the O2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. The Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential, which is the major mechanism for the stabilization effect of Au clusters on Pt.

文献表明，通过在铂（Pt）氧还原燃料电池电催化剂的纳米粒子中引入金（Au）簇，可以实现对溶解的稳定化，在持续运行过程中解决了一个问题。这种行为是在氧化条件下观察到的，即氧气还原反应，并在0.6至1.1伏特之间进行的电压循环超过30,000次。Au簇通过提高Pt氧化电位提供稳定性，这是Au簇稳定Pt的主要机制。
