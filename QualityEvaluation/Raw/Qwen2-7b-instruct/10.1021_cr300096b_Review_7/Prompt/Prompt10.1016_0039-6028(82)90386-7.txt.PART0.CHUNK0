Three Pt-Ni alloys with 20, 40 and 70 at% Ni were studied by Auger and photoelectron spectroscopies.
The clean surfaces were found to be enriched in platinum in an amount increasing with increasing platinum concentration in the bulk. On the contrary oxidation treatments resulted in a nickel surface segregation which was only slightly offset after reduction.
Chemical shifts characteristic of oxidation were observed on XPS peaks of both platinum and nickel under experimental conditions where pure platinum could not be oxidized.
1. Introduction
Among the different classes of binary alloy systems which are particularly interesting are those in which both elements are catalytically active, especially if their selectivities are widely different.
For example,platinum is well known as a good catalyst for isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons,while nickel is strongly active for cracking.
One may expect interesting trends in the be- haviour of their alloys, and indeed Renouprez et al. [l] found energetic effects in neopentane reaction conversions.
The problem of a possible surface segregation in these alloys is not yet resolved.
It has long been accepted that a surface enrichment would occur if one refers to current theories based on the regular solution model [2] or the strain energy [3], but attempts to find any failed [4]. Abraham et al. [5] compared theoretical predictions,based on calculations taking into account both bond and strain energy effects, with experimental findings compiled in the literature for over thirty alloys. The agreement was good except for three alloys including Pt-Ni.
We report here on an AES, XPS and UPS study of three Pt-Ni alloy surfaces and their modifications due to oxygen and hydrogen interactions. * Permanent address: Institute of Chemical Process Fundamentals, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Suchdol2,16502 Prague 6, Czechoslovakia. 0039-6028/82/0000-0000/$02.75 0 1982 North-Holland 542

2. Experimental
The apparatuses have already been described [6]. Briefly the experiments were done either in an UHV chamber with a Varian cylindrical mirror analyser as Auger detector or in a Vacuum Generators ESCA III spectrometer with a hemispherical analyser.
The X-ray source was the unmonochromatized Al-Key radiation.
The alloys were prepared by melting at high temperature Johnson-Matthey specpure mixtures of the elements.
The bulk compositions and homogeneity were checked by X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe.
Three alloys with nominal compositions 20, 40 and 70 at%Ni were studied.
In another paper [7] we thoroughly develop a layer-by-layer calculation of the concentrations.
We have limited ourselves here to a rough estimation based on an already discussed relationship [6]; for an alloy AB, if IA and I, are the intensities of two chosen transitions in the Auger or XPS spectrum of the alloy and (*a the ratio of the same transitions for the pure elements A and B, the surface concentration of the constituent A is given by:
C, =Z*/(Z*
+%,rIZa).
For both techniques we have measured
(Y
by recording the spectra of pure platinum and nickel under identical conditions.
3. Results
3.1. AES
The samples were decontaminated by ion bombardments,oxygen exposures (1000 K, 10 -6 Torr) and annealing treatments.
After the cleaning procedure,the samples were heated for hours under ultra high vacuum to ensure that equilibrium was reached at the surface.
The temperature necessary for equi- libration after ion bombardment was at least 1250 K.
The clean samples were then submitted successively to oxygen and reduc- tion treatments under the following conditions:2 Torr of oxygen,573 K, 1 h;2 Torr of hydrogen,573 K, 1 h.
The mean composition of the clean,oxygen-treated and reduced samples was calculated in two ways. The more accurate result may be obtained by using for each element transitions corresponding to the same escape depth, as low as possible.
This was the case using the N,N,N,(168 eV) transition of Pt and the M,W transition of Ni. The latter involves valence electrons and exhibits rather a low intensity,which may lead to some uncertainty.
The MsW transition of Ni could not be used because of its interference with the N6,W transition of Pt. The only other transition of nickel available was the L,VV transition at 848 eV. The escape depth is then larger (1.2- 1.5 nm), so that the

We give in fig. 1 the mean nickel concentrations at the surface as a function of the bulk composition calculated using the M,W nickel transition which is really surface representative.
For all three samples (20, 40 and 70 at% nickel) after equilibration,the surface was enriched with platinum.
The higher the platinum concentration in the bulk, the hiher the platinum surface enrichment.
Calculations using the L,W nickel transition gave results closer to the bulk composition,but we expect the nickel concentration to be enhanced in this case. This may explain why previous authors could not detect any segregation for this type of alloy [4]. However,both calculations show platinum enrich- ment for the 20 at%Ni alloy. The L,W transition of nickel remained detecta- ble but not the M,W one, hence we deduce that the surface was 100 at% platinum.
The results of the oxygen treatments show that the surface was then enriched with nickel for the 40 and 70 at% nickel samples.
The greater the nickel concentration in the bulk, the greater the nickel enrichment.
This can be seen in fig. 1. Surprisingly,the composition of the 20 at% nickel sample was not affected by this treatment.
After interaction with hydrogen the nickel enrichment was slightly reduced but the nickel concentration remained larger than at equilirium.
3.2. XPS
In order to confirm the results of the preceding study and to obtain details on the chemical state of the components of the alloys during the treatments,similar experiments were reproduced in the photoemission system. 544

alloys 545 The clean samples were submitted to oxidation at 573 K as previously,and also at 773 K. For the two Ni-rich samples,the oxygen pressure was 0.1 Torr.
For the 20 at% Ni sample,this pressure was judged too low to obtain enrichment,so we used here an atmospheric pressure of oxygen.
In all cases,the 773 K treatment was followed by a reduction treatment at 573 K.
The results obtained for each alloy are reproduced in tables 1, 2 and 3. To calculate the concentrations,the Pt 4f peaks and Ni 2s, peak were selected for their high intensity.
Of course the corresponding escape depths are rather different and Pt will be enhanced in this calculation.
Moreover,the surface sensitivity of the XPS signals is not so good as in Auger studies.
For this reason,we indicate the concentration calculated from two different spectra:one obtained from the maximum signal of each component (a) and one obtained by recording the low take-off electrons (b) [6]. In the former case the angle between the sample surface and the photoelectrons path was approxi- mately 75 while in the latter it was only 20, which increases the surface sensitivity by a factor of nearly three as can be shown by a simple calculation.
In either case the calibration was made using the spectra of the pure elements recorded in the same apparatus under the same experimental conditions.
The results for clean samples always showed a platinum concentration higher than the bulk concentration and higher in (b) calculations than in (a) calculations.
However these values were always lower than those obtained in the Auger study, which can be expected from the larger escape depth of the signal chosen. The same conclusions are valid for the oxidation and reduction treatments.
So these treatments confirm qualitatively our previous conclusions.
As seen by Auger spectroscopy,the 70 .at% Ni sample was already com- pletely surface enriched in Ni by the 573 K oxidation.
The XPS results show that the thickness of the Ni film formed was more important after the 773 K oxidation.
On the 40 at% Ni sample,this temperature was necessary to obtain a 100% Ni surface. The 20 at% Ni sample was insensitive to oxidation by 0.1 Torr of oxygen at 573 K. With atmospheric pressure of oxygen,a 33% and 67% Ni surface composition was obtained at 573 and 773 K, respectively.
Let us now examine the oxidation states of the elements.
For the 40 and 70 at% Ni samples,one can see from tables 1 and 2 that the Pt 4f peaks were always at the same position.
The only change was their intensity.
Ni was obviously splitted from 852.8 eV into two peaks at 854.6 and 856.4 eV. Kim and Winograd [8] studied by XPS the oxidation of Ni in rather comparable conditions.
They attributed the two transitions at 854.5 and 856.3 eV to the formation of NiO.
For the 20 at% Ni sample the situation seems rather different.
In the 573 K experiment the Pt peaks were affected only in their intensity.
The Ni 2p J,z peak was detected at 852.5 eV and principally at 855.5 eV. The first peak was obviously ascribed to the metal. The second peak may be attributed to Ni,O,according to [8]. In the 773 K experiment the Ni peak showed the formation of NiO. The most surprising result was the appearance 546

et ul. / Studies on Pt-Ni ulloys of the third peak in the Pt 4f region. This is shown on fig. 2. The 77.6 eV peak cannot be attributed to a Ni 3p satellite because it would be detected in the other expriments where NiO was formed.
One must also outline that the Pt 4f

This could be attributed to PtO,, the shift of which was recorded by various authors from 2.4 to 3.4 eV depending on the nature of the phase formed [9].

band results Figs. 3 and 4 show the evolution of the alloy valence band upon changing the bulk composition recorded using He, (hv = 21.2 eV) and Hen (hv = 40.8 eV) radiations.
In the first analysis,these pictures can be used as finger-punts.
An example of this use is presented on fig. 5. The spectrum was obtained on the 70 at% Ni alloy,with He, radiation,by recording the low take-off electrons only.
By comparison with fig. 3, we can see easily that the spectrum of fig. 5 looked like a Pt rich spectrum.
This is in good agreement with our quantitative Auger results. This shows also that the UPS techniques are sensitive to the concentra- tion gradient near the surface,e.g. with UPS the sample should be viewed as rather nonhomogeneous.
This conclusion must be kept in mind for further analysis.
From this point of view, the XPS spectra of the valence band should be more representative of the bulk density of states. Those results are presented on fig, 6. One can easily see that in no case the valence band of the alloy could be accounted for by a simple convolution of the pure Pt and Ni bands,particularly in the 2eV region.
It is interesting to compare these results with

One can see the results obtained by XPS in this case on fig. 7. The band showed then a pronounced Ni character as expected, but the situation was completely different from fig. 6. The results of fig. 7 could be obtained by a convolution of Pt and Ni bands in proper weighing. For example, curve (a) can be drawn with about 60% of Pt band and 40% of Ni band. This is not surprising, because we have for this sample a Ni-rich surface film above a Pt-rich bulk. As it has been largely shown already [lo], the rigid-band model cannot be applied for the equilibrated alloys.
4. General discussion
It is first important to make sure of the validity of our calculated concentra- tions. We have neglected two important effects, namely back-scattering and matrix effects. The role played by those two factors has been discussed by Hall and Morabito [ 121. Their results are valid in the limit of diluted alloys. They obtained for the Ni or Pt rich alloys a correction factor close to one. In these cases they concluded that the linear relationship must be valid for all the concentrations. 550
J. SedlZek
et 01. / Studies on Pt-Ni rrlloys They also showed that in this case corrections do not significantly change the calculated concentration.
Anyway,in our study,the effects detected are relatively large with respect to the matrix and back-scattering effects.
So we can conclude that rather crude calculations remain largely valid.
Another point to discuss is the agreement between our experimental results and theoretical predictions.
In our study the clean surfaces always exhibited a surface enrichment in platinum,increasing from Ni-rich to Pt-rich alloys. The regular solution model would predict an enrichment in nickel for the whole range of concentration if one considers the thermodynamic properties of these elements:for example the heat of vaporization of platinum is 565 kJ/mole (135 kcal/mole),while the value for nickel is only 430 kJ/mole (103 kcal/mole).
But one must realize that the atomic radii are also substantially different:
0.124
nm for nickel and
0.138 nm
for platinum.
One must therefore expect a significant strain energy effect for this system. In the Ni-rich region, these two effects should compensate or almost compensate since, following Ollis [ 121, the corresponding heats of segregation are quite close. This may explain why we observe little segregation in this area of concentration.On the contrary,in the Pt-rich region, both effects should add and lead to a nickel surface enrichment.Actually one may forget in this range of concentration the strain energy effect if one considers with Tsai et al. [ 131 that, if the atomic radius of the solute is less than the one of the solvent,no segregation will occur. Still the bond breaking effect remains which should lead to nickel enrichment.The contradiction with our results is difficult to explain.One may imagine,as suggested by others [5], that electronic effects, which are much more difficult to deal with, play an important role in the particular case of platinum:it may not be a coincidence if, in the compilation of Abraham et al. [5], the only three alloys, out of 31, for which a discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental findings occur, are all platinum-based alloys.The result of oxygen treatment was always a Ni enrichment at the surface where NiO was generally obtained.These results can be easily explained by the following reasons:- the probability to oxidize a Ni atom at the surface is greater than for a platinum atom;_ the Ni oxide must be stable at temperatures where the Ni diffusion in the matrix of the alloy is noticeable;- the bulk diffusion of the Ni oxide formed at the surface must be low in the same conditions.In these conditions,the Ni atom present on the surface after its bulk diffusion reacts with oxygen and becomes stable at the surface so that platinum is progressively substituted by Ni oxide.However,our reduction treatments show that the Ni diffusion from the surface towards the bulk of the alloy must be low since surface enrichment is largely conserved after them. So it is necessary to admit that Ni diffusion is easier on oxidation than on reduction.This is even more evident in Pd-Au [6] and Pd-Pt [ 141 alloys where
J. Sedl&ek
et al. / Studies on Pi-Ni alloys 551 reduction by H, does not modify at all the surface composition obtained after oxidation.
By application of Le Chateliers law it is obvious that the oxidation of Ni destroys equilibrium between the bulk and the surface concentrations,so that the diffusion of Ni towards the surface must be favoured.
Some particular results must also be discussed.
In the 573 K experiment with the 20 at% Ni sample, we obtained together oxidation of Pt and Ni. These results are surprising since we have already shown that in similar conditions,a pure Pt sample cannot be oxidized [ 151. So it is necessary to admit that Pt may be influenced by alloying with Ni in such a way that it changes its chemical properties.It could be expected that the change of Pt properties would become more important in Ni-rich alloys. In fact, when the Ni concentration increased,its oxidation reaction became important,so that Pt was readily pushed back to the bulk by Ni surface enrichment.This seems to indicate that the reactivity of platinum does not increase with Ni concentration.On the contrary,as seen on other alloy systems [6,14], it seems that there is a minimum of Ni concentration necessary to change the platinum properties.It is also surprising that when Pt is oxidized,the Ni oxide formed seems to be Ni,O,.We have just seen that in order to obtain Pt oxidation,it was necessary that the NiO growth was not too quick. This is possible in the 20 at% Ni sample since the Ni concentration is rather low, especially at the surface (calculated to be close to 100% of platinum).Under these conditions the few surface Ni atoms do not compete with each other to get oxidized,so that they can readily reach the Ni,O,state.To add a point to the change of Pt properties induced by Ni, we believe that this result is in qualitative agreement with the photoelectron results.We have seen that the valence band of the clean alloy is far from the rigid-band model.This shows that on alloying the components lose partly their identity and thus their reactivity is modified.
5. Conclusion
We have shown that the surface of clean platinum-nickel alloys is always enriched with platinum in an amount which increases with platinum con- centration.
This can be reversed to a Ni enrichment on submitting the sample to oxidation treatments.
This enrichment is largely maintained after reduction treatments restoring a metallic surface.
On alloying,the components change their chemical properties.
This implies that alloys may be considered to have their own reactivity.
In particular,we can expect that these findings may have a great importance for the catalytic properties of bimetallic and alloys cata- lysts, either by changing the surface composition of the grains,or from their own activity and reactvity at equilibrium. 552
