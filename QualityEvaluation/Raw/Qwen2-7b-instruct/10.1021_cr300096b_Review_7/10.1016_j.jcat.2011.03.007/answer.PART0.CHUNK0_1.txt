[1] "The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface."
[2] "Previous studies on Ni-modified Pt(1 1 1) have identified the formation of a PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure that binds atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[3] "In the current study, we will use the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations, surface science measurements on single crystal and polycrystalline substrates, and reactor evaluations over supported catalysts."
[4] "It is well established that bimetallic catalysts often show enhanced catalytic properties when compared to those of the corresponding monometallic materials [15]."
[5] "The main objective of the current study is to determine whether the unique hydrogenation pathway is also present on the corresponding polycrystalline Ni/Pt surfaces, using a combination of surface science experiments and DFT calculations."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can adopt multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces. These pathways reveal the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide insights into how the surface chemistry, including the strength of hydrogen and alkene adsorption, affects the hydrogenation process. This information is crucial for understanding and optimizing hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes, where selectivity and efficiency are paramount.
