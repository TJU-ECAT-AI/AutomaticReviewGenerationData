[1] "The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface."
[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane."
[3] "On the other hand, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."
[4] "The hydrogenation activity of a thick Ni film on the Pt foil is also studied as a reference. This surface promotes similar reactions as does the unmodified Pt foil surface."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it exhibits multiple reaction pathways on different bimetallic catalyst surfaces. Its strong binding on NiPtPt(1 1 1) leads to complete decomposition, indicating a highly selective catalyst. On PtNiPt(1 1 1), the weaker binding of hydrogen and cyclohexene results in a hydrogenation pathway, producing gas-phase cyclohexane. This contrasts with a thick Ni film, which shows similar decomposition activity but not the hydrogenation pathway. These insights highlight the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

How does cyclohexene serve as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions, and what insights can its multiple reaction pathways provide about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes?

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it binds strongly on the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface, leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. This provides insights into the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst. On the other hand, on the NiPtPt(1 0 0) surface, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene adsorb weakly, facilitating the hydrogenation pathway. This suggests that the presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and cyclohexene is crucial for achieving low-temperature hydrogenation. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene offer a means to understand how the structure of the bimetallic catalyst influences hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's reaction pathways can help in designing catalysts with enhanced low-temperature hydrogenation properties. The presence of weakly bonded hydrogen and cyclohexene is essential for the low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. The polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, with its NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets, is also active towards hydrogenation, which is linked to the DFT prediction and experimental verification. This suggests that supported Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts, containing PtNiPt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 0 0), and possibly NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets, may also exhibit enhanced low-temperature hydrogenation properties. The correlation between single crystal, polycrystalline, and supported bimetallic catalysts indicates that DFT calculations and UHV studies on single crystal surfaces provide useful guidance in selecting novel bimetallic catalytic materials for hydrogenation reactions.

如何将环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，并且其多种反应路径能提供关于双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性影响的见解，在工业过程中？

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它在NiPtPt(1 1 1)表面结合牢固，导致完全分解而不产生气态苯或环己烷。这为理解催化剂的氢化活性提供了见解。另一方面，在NiPtPt(1 0 0)表面上，无论是原子氢还是环己烯都吸附得较弱，从而促进了氢化路径。这表明弱吸附的氢和环己烯对于实现低温氢化至关重要。环己烯的多种反应路径为其提供了了解催化剂结构如何影响氢化活性和选择性的途径。

通过环己烯的反应路径所提供的见解，可以帮助设计具有增强低温氢化性质的催化剂。存在弱吸附的氢和环己烯是低温氢化路径的关键。多晶Ni/Pt双金属表面，特别是其NiPtPt(1 0 0)晶面，也表现出氢化的活性，这与密度泛函理论预测和实验验证有关。这表明，包含PtNiPt(1 1 1)，PtNiPt(1 0 0)，甚至可能包含NiPtPt(1 0 0)晶面的负载型Ni/Pt双金属催化剂也可能表现出增强的低温氢化性质。单晶、多晶和负载型双金属催化剂之间的相关性表明，单晶表面的密度泛函理论计算和UHV研究为选择新型双金属催化材料进行氢化反应提供了有用的指导。

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because its ability to form multiple reaction pathways provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts, such as Ni/Pt, influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Its decomposition pathway on a clean Pt foil highlights the role of surface chemistry in determining the efficiency of hydrogenation. The presence of the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, identified through previous studies, demonstrates that the interaction between Ni and Pt modifies the binding energy of cyclohexene, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on either pure metal surface. The polycrystalline Ni/Pt surfaces, when modified with Ni, exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity towards cyclohexene, showcasing the potential for bimetallic catalysts to optimize the selectivity of hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes. The thermodynamic preference for the PtNiPt structure under reducing conditions and with adsorbed hydrogen, as indicated by recent DFT calculations, further underscores the importance of understanding the surface chemistry of bimetallic catalysts in designing efficient hydrogenation catalysts.
