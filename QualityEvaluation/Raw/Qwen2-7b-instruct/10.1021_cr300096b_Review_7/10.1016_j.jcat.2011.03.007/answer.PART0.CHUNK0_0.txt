[1] "The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface."
[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane."
[3] "On the other hand, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."
[4] "The hydrogenation activity of a thick Ni film on the Pt foil is also studied as a reference. This surface promotes similar reactions as does the unmodified Pt foil surface."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it exhibits multiple reaction pathways on different bimetallic catalyst surfaces. Its strong binding on NiPtPt(1 1 1) leads to complete decomposition, indicating a highly selective catalyst. On PtNiPt(1 1 1), the weaker binding of hydrogen and cyclohexene results in a hydrogenation pathway, producing gas-phase cyclohexane. This contrasts with a thick Ni film, which shows similar decomposition activity but not the hydrogenation pathway. These insights highlight the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，环己烯因其在不同双金属催化剂表面表现出多种反应途径而被广泛使用。它在NiPtPt(1 1 1)上的强结合导致完全分解，这表明了高度选择性的催化剂特性。而在PtNiPt(1 1 1)上，氢和环己烯较弱的结合导致了氢化途径，产生气态环己烷。与厚Ni薄膜相比，后者显示出相似的分解活性，但没有氢化途径。这些见解揭示了双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性的影响，在工业过程中具有重要意义。
