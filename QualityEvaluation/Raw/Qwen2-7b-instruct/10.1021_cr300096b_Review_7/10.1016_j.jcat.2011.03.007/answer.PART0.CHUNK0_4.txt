[1] "Previous studies on Ni-modified Pt(1 1 1) have identified the formation of a PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure that binds atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."
[2] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) sub- surface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on this surface."
[3] "On a clean Pt foil, the primary reaction pathway is decomposition, as evidenced by a post-TPD C (275 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio of 0.76, which is indicative of a surface almost entirely covered with carbon."
[4] "Modification of Pt foil with 1 ML of Ni results in a significant change in the reaction pathways, with the most obvious difference being a large yield of cyclohexane from both the PtNiPt and Ni PtPt polycrystalline surfaces."
[5] "The findings from the TPD results are consistent with the HREEL results in Figs. 3 and 4, which were recorded after the adsorption of cyclohexene on hydrogen pre-dosed surfaces of Pt, PtNiPt and NiPtPt polycrystalline surfaces."
[6] "Recent DFT calculations [30] indicate that the subsurface PtNiPt structure is thermodynamically preferred under reducing conditions and in the presence of adsorbed hydro- gen."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because its ability to form multiple reaction pathways provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts, such as Ni/Pt, influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Its decomposition pathway on a clean Pt foil highlights the role of surface chemistry in determining the efficiency of hydrogenation. The presence of the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, identified through previous studies, demonstrates that the interaction between Ni and Pt modifies the binding energy of cyclohexene, leading to a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on either pure metal surface. The polycrystalline Ni/Pt surfaces, when modified with Ni, exhibit enhanced hydrogenation activity towards cyclohexene, showcasing the potential for bimetallic catalysts to optimize the selectivity of hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes. The thermodynamic preference for the PtNiPt structure under reducing conditions and with adsorbed hydrogen, as indicated by recent DFT calculations, further underscores the importance of understanding the surface chemistry of bimetallic catalysts in designing efficient hydrogenation catalysts.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它形成的多个反应途径提供了如何通过双金属催化剂如Ni/Pt影响氢化活性和选择性的洞察。其在纯铂箔上的分解途径突出了表面化学在确定氢化效率中的作用。通过先前的研究识别到的PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构表明，Ni和Pt之间的相互作用改变了环己烯的结合能，导致在任何单一金属表面不存在的低温氢化路径。当改性为Ni的多晶Ni/Pt表面显示出对环己烯氢化的增强活性，这展示了双金属催化剂优化氢化反应选择性的潜力。最近的密度泛函理论计算进一步表明，在还原条件下和吸附氢气时，PtNiPt结构具有热力学优势，进一步强调了理解双金属催化剂表面化学在设计高效氢化催化剂中的重要性。
