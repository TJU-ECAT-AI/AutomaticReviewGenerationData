[1] "The current work utilizes the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "In previous studies, the reaction cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to compare the different properties of Pt(1 1 1), surface NiPtPt(1 1 1), and subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) [14]."
[3] "Modification of Pt foil with 1 ML of Ni results in a significant change in the reaction pathways, with the most obvious difference being a large yield of cyclohexane from both the PtNiPt and Ni PtPt polycrystalline surfaces."
[4] "On a clean Pt foil, the primary reaction pathway is decomposition, as evidenced by a post-TPD C (275 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio of 0.76, which is indicative of a surface almost entirely covered with carbon."
[5] "The findings from the TPD results are consistent with the HREEL results in Figs. 3 and 4, which were recorded after the adsorption of cyclohexene on hydrogen pre-dosed surfaces of Pt, PtNiPt and NiPtPt polycrystalline surfaces."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it allows researchers to analyze the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Its multiple reaction pathways can provide insights into how different catalysts interact with hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In particular, the ability of cyclohexene to undergo hydrogenation on various bimetallic surfaces helps determine the effectiveness of these catalysts in industrial processes. The results obtained using cyclohexene as a probe can guide the design and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.
