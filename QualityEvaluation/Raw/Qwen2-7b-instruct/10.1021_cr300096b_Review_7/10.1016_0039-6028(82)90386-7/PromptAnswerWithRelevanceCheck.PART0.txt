[1] "Among the different classes of binary alloy systems which are particularly interesting are those in which both elements are catalytically active, especially if their selectivities are widely different."
[2] "For example,platinum is well known as a good catalyst for isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons,while nickel is strongly active for cracking."
[3] "We have seen that on alloying the components change their chemical properties."
[4] "This implies that alloys may be considered to have their own reactivity."

In studying hydrogenation reactions, cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule because it undergoes multiple reaction pathways. This allows researchers to gain insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The versatility of cyclohexene enables the examination of different catalytic behaviors and the effects of varying metal combinations, providing a comprehensive understanding of hydrogenation mechanisms and optimization strategies.

The influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity can be explored through the examination of cyclohexene's transformation pathways. By analyzing the outcomes of hydrogenation on cyclohexene, scientists can determine the optimal conditions and catalyst compositions for desired product yields and purity. This knowledge is crucial for the development of efficient and selective hydrogenation processes in industries such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.

The chemical properties of components within alloys change upon alloying, indicating that alloys possess their own unique reactivity. This characteristic makes alloys valuable in catalysis, as they can offer distinct activities and reactivities compared to their individual components. The ability to tailor the surface composition of catalysts through alloying can lead to enhanced performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability, contributing to advancements in catalytic technology and industrial applications.

The study focuses on understanding the surface composition and interaction of Pt-Ni alloys with oxygen and hydrogen through Auger and photoelectron spectroscopies. The research indicates that the clean surfaces of these alloys are enriched in platinum, with the amount increasing with the platinum concentration in the bulk. Oxidation treatments result in a nickel surface segregation, which is slightly offset after reduction. The alloys exhibit chemical shifts characteristic of oxidation on XPS peaks of both platinum and nickel under certain experimental conditions. The results suggest that the surface of clean Pt-Ni alloys is enriched with platinum, and this can be reversed by oxidation treatments leading to a nickel enrichment. The enrichment is largely maintained after reduction treatments, restoring a metallic surface. The study concludes that the findings have great importance for the catalytic properties of bimetallic and alloy catalysts, potentially influencing surface composition, activity, and selectivity in industrial processes.

研究主要通过原子发射光谱法和光电离光谱法探讨了Pt-Ni合金与氧气和氢气的相互作用，以及这些合金的表面组成。研究表明，这些合金清洁表面中的铂含量增加，且随着合金中铂含量的增加而增加。氧化处理导致镍表面富集，但在还原处理后，这种富集程度有所降低。合金在特定实验条件下显示出氧化特征在XPS峰上的化学变化。结果表明，清洁的Pt-Ni合金表面富含铂，可以通过氧化处理逆转为镍富集。在还原处理后，这种富集程度仍然保持，恢复了金属表面。研究得出结论，这些发现对双金属和合金催化剂的催化性质具有重要意义，可能影响颗粒表面组成、活性和选择性，从而影响工业过程。

[1] "The clean surfaces were found to be enriched in platinum in an amount increasing with increasing platinum concentration in the bulk."
[2] "The problem of a possible surface segregation in these alloys is not yet resolved."
[3] "The only other transition of nickel available was the L,VV transition at 848 eV. The escape depth is then larger (1.2- 1.5 nm), so that the calculations using it may enhance the nickel concentration."

The clean surfaces of Pt-Ni alloys were found to be enriched in platinum, with the amount of enrichment increasing with the increasing concentration of platinum in the bulk. There is still an unresolved issue regarding possible surface segregation in these alloys. Using the L,VV transition of nickel (at 848 eV) for calculations may enhance the calculated nickel concentration due to its larger escape depth (1.2-1.5 nm). Surprisingly, the composition of the 20 at% nickel sample was unaffected by oxygen treatments. Detailed results for each alloy are provided in Tables 1-3. When studying the 20 at% Ni sample, oxidation of both Pt and Ni occurred simultaneously.

清洁的Pt-Ni合金表面被发现富含铂，富集量随合金中铂含量的增加而增加。这些合金中可能存在的表面分层问题尚未解决。使用镍的L,VV过渡（在848 eV）进行计算可能会增强镍浓度的计算，因为其逃逸深度较大（1.2-1.5 nm）。令人惊讶的是，20 at%镍样品在氧化处理后未受影响。对于每个合金的详细结果分别在表1-3中列出。在研究20 at% Ni样品时，同时发生了Pt和Ni的氧化。
