[1] "Among the different classes of binary alloy systems which are particularly interesting are those in which both elements are catalytically active, especially if their selectivities are widely different."
[2] "The problem of a possible surface segregation in these alloys is not yet resolved."
[3] "For example,platinum is well known as a good catalyst for isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons,while nickel is strongly active for cracking."
[4] "We have seen that on alloying the components change their chemical properties."
[5] "This enrichment is largely maintained after reduction treatments restoring a metallic surface."
[6] "We can expect that these findings may have a great importance for the catalytic properties of bimetallic and alloys catalysts, either by changing the surface composition of the grains,or from their own activity and reactvity at equilibrium."

The study focuses on understanding the surface composition and interaction of Pt-Ni alloys with oxygen and hydrogen through Auger and photoelectron spectroscopies. The research indicates that the clean surfaces of these alloys are enriched in platinum, with the amount increasing with the platinum concentration in the bulk. Oxidation treatments result in a nickel surface segregation, which is slightly offset after reduction. The alloys exhibit chemical shifts characteristic of oxidation on XPS peaks of both platinum and nickel under certain experimental conditions. The results suggest that the surface of clean Pt-Ni alloys is enriched with platinum, and this can be reversed by oxidation treatments leading to a nickel enrichment. The enrichment is largely maintained after reduction treatments, restoring a metallic surface. The study concludes that the findings have great importance for the catalytic properties of bimetallic and alloy catalysts, potentially influencing surface composition, activity, and selectivity in industrial processes.

研究主要通过原子发射光谱法和光电离光谱法探讨了Pt-Ni合金与氧气和氢气的相互作用，以及这些合金的表面组成。研究表明，这些合金清洁表面中的铂含量增加，且随着合金中铂含量的增加而增加。氧化处理导致镍表面富集，但在还原处理后，这种富集程度有所降低。合金在特定实验条件下显示出氧化特征在XPS峰上的化学变化。结果表明，清洁的Pt-Ni合金表面富含铂，可以通过氧化处理逆转为镍富集。在还原处理后，这种富集程度仍然保持，恢复了金属表面。研究得出结论，这些发现对双金属和合金催化剂的催化性质具有重要意义，可能影响颗粒表面组成、活性和选择性，从而影响工业过程。
