[1] "Among the different classes of binary alloy systems which are particularly interesting are those in which both elements are catalytically active, especially if their selectivities are widely different."
[2] "For example,platinum is well known as a good catalyst for isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons,while nickel is strongly active for cracking."
[3] "Indeed Renouprez et al. [l] found energetic effects in neopentane reaction conversions."
[4] "We report here on an AES, XPS and UPS study of three Pt-Ni alloy surfaces and their modifications due to oxygen and hydrogen interactions."

The study focuses on the surface composition and interaction of Pt-Ni alloys with oxygen and hydrogen. The alloys studied are characterized by their catalytic properties, with platinum being effective for isomerization and nickel for cracking. The research aims to understand the behavior of these alloys through Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Ultra-Violet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) methods.
