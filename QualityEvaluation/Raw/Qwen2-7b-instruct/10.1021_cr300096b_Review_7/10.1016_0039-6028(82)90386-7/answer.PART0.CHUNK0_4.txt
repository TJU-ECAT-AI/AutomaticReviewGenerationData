[1] "Among the different classes of binary alloy systems which are particularly interesting are those in which both elements are catalytically active, especially if their selectivities are widely different."
[2] "For example,platinum is well known as a good catalyst for isomerization of saturated hydrocarbons,while nickel is strongly active for cracking."
[3] "One may expect interesting trends in the be- haviour of their alloys, and indeed Renouprez et al. [l] found energetic effects in neopentane reaction conversions."
[4] "We have limited ourselves here to a rough estimation based on an already discussed relationship [6]; for an alloy AB, if IA and I, are the intensities of two chosen transitions in the Auger or XPS spectrum of the alloy and (*a the ratio of the same transitions for the pure elements A and B, the surface concentration of the constituent A is given by:"
[5] "The clean surfaces were found to be enriched in platinum in an amount increasing with increasing platinum concentration in the bulk."
