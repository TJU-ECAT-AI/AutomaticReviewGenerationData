The clean surfaces of Pt-Ni alloys were found to be enriched in platinum, with the amount of enrichment increasing with the increasing concentration of platinum in the bulk. There is still an unresolved issue regarding possible surface segregation in these alloys. Using the L,VV transition of nickel (at 848 eV) for calculations may enhance the calculated nickel concentration due to its larger escape depth (1.2-1.5 nm). Surprisingly, the composition of the 20 at% nickel sample was unaffected by oxygen treatments. Detailed results for each alloy are provided in Tables 1-3. When studying the 20 at% Ni sample, oxidation of both Pt and Ni occurred simultaneously.

清洁的Pt-Ni合金表面被发现富含铂，富集量随合金中铂含量的增加而增加。这些合金中可能存在的表面分层问题尚未解决。使用镍的L,VV过渡（在848 eV）进行计算可能会增强镍浓度的计算，因为其逃逸深度较大（1.2-1.5 nm）。令人惊讶的是，20 at%镍样品在氧化处理后未受影响。对于每个合金的详细结果分别在表1-3中列出。在研究20 at% Ni样品时，同时发生了Pt和Ni的氧化。
