[1] "The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence."
[2] "The primary objectives of the current paper are two-fold. The first is to extend surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts. The second objective is to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds."
[3] "As shown in Fig. 4 a, for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the conversion of cyclohexene reached 100% after 60 min."
[4] "In comparison, the physical and chemical probes described above demonstrate that the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is much less for the catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni)."
[5] "The disproportionation of cyclohexene on 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 shows a higher conversion rate than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it undergoes multiple reaction pathways under different conditions. These pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By monitoring the conversion of cyclohexene, researchers can evaluate how the bimetallic catalysts affect the efficiency and selectivity of hydrogenation reactions.

2. The primary objectives of the study are twofold. The first is to expand surface science research on Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts. The second is to investigate how the sequence of metal impregnation impacts the formation of bimetallic bonds within these catalysts. This investigation aims to understand how the impregnation sequence affects the catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts.

3. The 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts demonstrated a high conversion rate of cyclohexene reaching 100% after 60 minutes. This indicates that both catalysts are highly effective in the disproportionation reaction of cyclohexene.

4. The impregnation sequence has a significant impact on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni). However, the effect diminishes for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). This suggests that there is a threshold of Ni loading required for the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, beyond which the impregnation sequence no longer significantly influences the formation of these bonds.

5. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that the sequence of impregnation affects the catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts, with the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showing superior performance.

1. 作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，环己烯能够经历多种反应路径。这些路径提供了关于双金属催化剂在工业过程中的氢化活性和选择性的影响的洞察。通过监测环己烯的转化，研究人员可以评估双金属催化剂对氢化反应效率和选择性的影响。

2. 研究的主要目标有两个。第一个是将表面科学研究从Pt/Ni双金属系统扩展到支持的双金属催化剂。第二个是确定浸渍顺序对形成双金属键的影响。这一调查旨在理解浸渍顺序如何影响双金属催化剂的催化特性。

3. 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 和 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 催化剂在60分钟后实现了环己烯的完全转化率。这表明这两种催化剂在环己烯的失重反应中非常有效。

4. 对于低Ni负载（0.5 wt.% Ni）的催化剂，浸渍顺序对形成PtNi双金属键有显著影响。然而，对于更高Ni负载（1.5 wt.% Ni）的催化剂，这种影响减小。这表明存在一个Ni负载阈值，超过该阈值后，浸渍顺序不再显著影响形成这些键。

5. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 催化剂在环己烯失重反应中的转化率高于1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3和1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这表明浸渍顺序影响双金属催化剂的活性，其中1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂表现出更好的性能。
