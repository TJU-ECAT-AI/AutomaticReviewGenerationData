1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule because it exhibits multiple reaction pathways that can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By studying the disproportionation of cyclohexene, researchers can understand how different catalyst compositions affect the efficiency of the reaction.

2. The bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts showed significantly higher activity towards the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to pure Pt or Ni catalysts. This indicates that the presence of both metals enhances the catalytic performance for this specific reaction.

3. For a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, the catalyst with Pt impregnated first (1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3) exhibited higher activity than the one with Ni impregnated first (1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3). This suggests that the sequence of impregnation affects the formation of the Pt/Ni alloy, impacting the catalyst's performance.

4. Kinetic analysis revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for the catalyst with Pt impregnated first (1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3). This indicates that the impregnation sequence can modify the catalyst's ability to selectively hydrogenate acetylene in the presence of ethylene.

5. The catalyst with Pt impregnated first (1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3) showed a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and a higher selectivity for hydrogenating acetylene compared to the catalyst with Ni impregnated first (1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3).

6. At a higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.%) while maintaining the same Pt loading, the sequence of impregnation had minimal impact on the disproportionation activity of cyclohexene. This suggests that there might be a threshold for Ni loading beyond which the sequence of impregnation becomes less significant.

7. The catalytic properties of the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were altered compared to the monometallic catalysts, as evidenced by changes in the rate constants for cyclohexene conversion and the equilibrium constant for acetylene adsorption. These modifications indicate that the bimetallic composition influences the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

1. 环己烯作为理想的探针分子，因为它表现出多种反应途径，可以提供有关双金属催化剂如何影响氢化活性和选择性的见解。通过研究环己烯的自氢化反应，研究人员可以理解不同催化剂组成如何影响反应效率。

2. Pt/Ni双金属催化剂在环己烯自氢化反应中的活性显著高于纯Pt或Ni催化剂。这表明两种金属的存在增强了特定反应的催化性能。

3. 对于3/1的Pt/Ni原子比，先浸渍Pt（1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3）的催化剂比先浸渍Ni（1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3）的催化剂活性更高。这表明浸渍顺序会影响Pt/Ni合金的形成，进而影响催化剂的性能。

4. 动力学分析揭示了先浸渍Pt的催化剂（1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3）中乙炔氢化选择性增加。这表明浸渍顺序可以修改催化剂对乙炔在乙烯存在的条件下的选择性氢化能力。

5. 先浸渍Pt的催化剂（1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3）显示了环己烯自氢化速率更快以及对乙炔氢化的更高选择性，与先浸渍Ni的催化剂（1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3）相比。

6. 在保持相同Pt负载的同时，较高Ni负载（1.5 wt.％）下，浸渍顺序对环己烯自氢化活性的影响较小。这表明可能存在一个Ni负载阈值，在此阈值之上，浸渍顺序的影响变得不那么重要。

7. 与单金属催化剂相比，1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂的催化性质发生了改变，表现为环己烯转化率的速率常数和乙炔吸附平衡常数的变化。这些修改表明双金属组成影响催化剂的活性和选择性。
