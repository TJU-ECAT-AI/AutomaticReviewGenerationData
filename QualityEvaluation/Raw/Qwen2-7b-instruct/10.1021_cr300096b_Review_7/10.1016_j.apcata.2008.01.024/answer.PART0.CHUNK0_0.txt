[1] "The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence."
[2] "The primary objectives of the current paper are two-fold. The first is to extend surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts. The second objective is to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds."
[3] "Cyclohexene consumption reached 100% after 60 min on the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, whereas the monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts showed significantly lower rates for the conversion of cyclohexene."
[4] "The conversion of cyclohexene on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was significantly faster than the one on 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3."
[5] "The selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetylene on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was higher than that on the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts."
[6] "The impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the γ-Al2O3 support for a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1 (5 wt.% Pt, 0.5 wt.% Ni)."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because its multiple reaction pathways can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. Specifically, its disproportionation activity can reveal the effectiveness of catalysts in hydrogenating cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene, while the hydrogenation selectivity for acetylene in the presence of ethylene can highlight the ability of catalysts to selectively convert acetylene over ethylene.

2. The primary goals of the study were twofold: to extend the understanding of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems from surface science to supported catalysts, and to investigate the impact of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. This was pursued by synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with specific Pt/Ni ratios through sequential impregnation methods and evaluating their catalytic properties using cyclohexene disproportionation and acetylene hydrogenation as probes.

3. The 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed significantly higher efficiency in converting cyclohexene compared to monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. This indicates that the bimetallic nature of these catalysts enhances their activity in hydrogenation reactions.

4. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited notably faster conversion of cyclohexene than the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, suggesting that the impregnation sequence affects the catalytic performance of the Pt/Ni bimetallic system.

5. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated a higher selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene compared to the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving desired product distributions in complex industrial processes.

6. For a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, the impregnation sequence significantly influenced the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the γ-Al2O3 support. The Pt-first impregnation led to higher catalytic activity and selectivity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and hydrogenation of acetylene, respectively, compared to the Ni-first impregnation. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of Pt and Ni atoms on the catalyst surface plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic behavior.

1. 异构化环己烯和乙烯中乙炔的氢化选择性作为探针反应，可以揭示双金属催化剂在工业过程中对氢化活性和选择性的影响。特别是异构化环己烯的活性可以揭示催化剂在将环己烯氢化为环己烷和苯的效率，而乙炔在乙烯存在的氢化选择性则可以突出催化剂选择性地将乙炔转化为乙烷的能力。

2. 研究的主要目标是两个方面：一是将Pt/Ni双金属系统从表面科学扩展到支持型双金属催化剂的研究，二是确定浸渍顺序对双金属键形成的影响。通过顺序浸渍方法合成具有特定Pt/Ni比率的双金属催化剂，并利用环己烯异构化和乙炔氢化作为探针反应来评估其催化性能。

3. 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂与单金属Pt和Ni催化剂相比，在环己烯转化方面的效率显著更高。这表明这些双金属催化剂在氢化反应中的活性得到增强。

4. 与1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂相比，1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂在环己烯转化方面的速度明显更快，这表明浸渍顺序会影响Pt/Ni双金属系统的催化性能。

5. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂在乙炔存在下对乙炔的氢化选择性高于1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3和1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这突出了双金属催化剂在复杂工业过程中实现所需产物分布的潜力。

6. 对于3/1的Pt/Ni原子比，浸渍顺序显著影响了γ-Al2O3支持上的PtNi双金属键的形成。当先浸渍Pt时，其对环己烯异构化和乙炔氢化的催化活性和选择性均高于先浸渍Ni的情况。这表明Pt和Ni原子在催化剂表面的空间排列对催化行为起着关键作用。
