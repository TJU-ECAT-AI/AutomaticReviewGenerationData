1. The disproportionation of cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule because its multiple reaction pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The sensitivity of this process to the termination of the surface by either Pt or Ni makes it a suitable test for comparing the effects of impregnation sequence on catalyst performance.

2. The selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetylene depends on the order at which the metal precursors are impregnated on the support, as demonstrated by the higher selectivity observed on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst compared to the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

3. The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene is significantly influenced by the impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni on the γ-Al2O3 support, especially when the Pt/Ni atomic ratio is 3/1. The presence of PtNi bimetallic bonds enhances the activity, particularly on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

4. The catalytic properties of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts are modified, leading to an increase in the rate constant for cyclohexene conversion and the equilibrium constant for acetylene adsorption, even though the modifications are less pronounced compared to the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

5. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, affecting the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene.

6. For a higher Ni loading at the same Pt loading (1.5 wt.% Ni) in the bimetallic catalysts, the sequence of the impregnation does not seem to play a significant role in the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene, as indicated by similar disproportionation activities on both catalysts.

1. 异丙醇的分解是一个理想的探针分子，因为它提供了关于双金属催化剂在工业过程中对氢化活性和选择性影响的洞察。该过程对表面是否由Pt或Ni终止的敏感性使其成为比较不同浸渍顺序对催化剂性能影响的合适测试。

2. 醋酸盐在存在乙烯时的选择性氢化取决于支持物上金属前体的浸渍顺序，因为1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的醋酸盐氢化选择性高于1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂，主要原因是K1/K2的相对比值增加。

3. 当Pt/Ni原子比为3/1时，γ-Al2O3支持上的Pt和Ni的浸渍顺序显著影响环己烯的异丙醇化活性，特别是1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的活性增强，这归因于PtNi双金属键的存在。

4. Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的催化性质被修改，导致环己烯转化率的增加速率常数和乙酸盐吸附的平衡常数，尽管这些修改不如1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂那么明显。

5. 对于Pt/Ni原子比为3/1的情况，γ-Al2O3支持上的Pt和Ni的浸渍顺序对环己烯的异丙醇化活性和乙酸盐在乙烯存在的条件下氢化的选择性有显著影响，尤其是对于1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂。

6. 对于相同Pt负载下较高Ni负载（1.5 wt.% Ni）的双金属催化剂，浸渍顺序似乎对环己烯的异丙醇化活性没有显著影响，因为两个催化剂显示出相似的异丙醇化活性。
