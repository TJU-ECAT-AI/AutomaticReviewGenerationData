1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because its multiple reaction pathways can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. Specifically, its disproportionation activity can reveal the effectiveness of catalysts in hydrogenating cyclohexene to cyclohexane and benzene, while the hydrogenation selectivity for acetylene in the presence of ethylene can highlight the ability of catalysts to selectively convert acetylene over ethylene.

2. The primary goals of the study were twofold: to extend the understanding of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems from surface science to supported catalysts, and to investigate the impact of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. This was pursued by synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with specific Pt/Ni ratios through sequential impregnation methods and evaluating their catalytic properties using cyclohexene disproportionation and acetylene hydrogenation as probes.

3. The 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts showed significantly higher efficiency in converting cyclohexene compared to monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts. This indicates that the bimetallic nature of these catalysts enhances their activity in hydrogenation reactions.

4. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited notably faster conversion of cyclohexene than the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, suggesting that the impregnation sequence affects the catalytic performance of the Pt/Ni bimetallic system.

5. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated a higher selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetylene in the presence of ethylene compared to the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This highlights the potential of bimetallic catalysts in achieving desired product distributions in complex industrial processes.

6. For a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, the impregnation sequence significantly influenced the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds on the γ-Al2O3 support. The Pt-first impregnation led to higher catalytic activity and selectivity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and hydrogenation of acetylene, respectively, compared to the Ni-first impregnation. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of Pt and Ni atoms on the catalyst surface plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic behavior.

1. 异构化环己烯和乙烯中乙炔的氢化选择性作为探针反应，可以揭示双金属催化剂在工业过程中对氢化活性和选择性的影响。特别是异构化环己烯的活性可以揭示催化剂在将环己烯氢化为环己烷和苯的效率，而乙炔在乙烯存在的氢化选择性则可以突出催化剂选择性地将乙炔转化为乙烷的能力。

2. 研究的主要目标是两个方面：一是将Pt/Ni双金属系统从表面科学扩展到支持型双金属催化剂的研究，二是确定浸渍顺序对双金属键形成的影响。通过顺序浸渍方法合成具有特定Pt/Ni比率的双金属催化剂，并利用环己烯异构化和乙炔氢化作为探针反应来评估其催化性能。

3. 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂与单金属Pt和Ni催化剂相比，在环己烯转化方面的效率显著更高。这表明这些双金属催化剂在氢化反应中的活性得到增强。

4. 与1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂相比，1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂在环己烯转化方面的速度明显更快，这表明浸渍顺序会影响Pt/Ni双金属系统的催化性能。

5. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂在乙炔存在下对乙炔的氢化选择性高于1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3和1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这突出了双金属催化剂在复杂工业过程中实现所需产物分布的潜力。

6. 对于3/1的Pt/Ni原子比，浸渍顺序显著影响了γ-Al2O3支持上的PtNi双金属键的形成。当先浸渍Pt时，其对环己烯异构化和乙炔氢化的催化活性和选择性均高于先浸渍Ni的情况。这表明Pt和Ni原子在催化剂表面的空间排列对催化行为起着关键作用。

1. The disproportionation of cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule because its multiple reaction pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The sensitivity of this process to the termination of the surface by either Pt or Ni makes it a suitable test for comparing the effects of impregnation sequence on catalyst performance.

2. The selectivity in the hydrogenation of acetylene depends on the order at which the metal precursors are impregnated on the support, as demonstrated by the higher selectivity observed on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst compared to the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

3. The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene is significantly influenced by the impregnation sequence of Pt and Ni on the γ-Al2O3 support, especially when the Pt/Ni atomic ratio is 3/1. The presence of PtNi bimetallic bonds enhances the activity, particularly on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

4. The catalytic properties of the Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts are modified, leading to an increase in the rate constant for cyclohexene conversion and the equilibrium constant for acetylene adsorption, even though the modifications are less pronounced compared to the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

5. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, affecting the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene.

6. For a higher Ni loading at the same Pt loading (1.5 wt.% Ni) in the bimetallic catalysts, the sequence of the impregnation does not seem to play a significant role in the catalytic activity for the disproportionation of cyclohexene, as indicated by similar disproportionation activities on both catalysts.

1. 异丙醇的分解是一个理想的探针分子，因为它提供了关于双金属催化剂在工业过程中对氢化活性和选择性影响的洞察。该过程对表面是否由Pt或Ni终止的敏感性使其成为比较不同浸渍顺序对催化剂性能影响的合适测试。

2. 醋酸盐在存在乙烯时的选择性氢化取决于支持物上金属前体的浸渍顺序，因为1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的醋酸盐氢化选择性高于1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂，主要原因是K1/K2的相对比值增加。

3. 当Pt/Ni原子比为3/1时，γ-Al2O3支持上的Pt和Ni的浸渍顺序显著影响环己烯的异丙醇化活性，特别是1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的活性增强，这归因于PtNi双金属键的存在。

4. Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的催化性质被修改，导致环己烯转化率的增加速率常数和乙酸盐吸附的平衡常数，尽管这些修改不如1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂那么明显。

5. 对于Pt/Ni原子比为3/1的情况，γ-Al2O3支持上的Pt和Ni的浸渍顺序对环己烯的异丙醇化活性和乙酸盐在乙烯存在的条件下氢化的选择性有显著影响，尤其是对于1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂。

6. 对于相同Pt负载下较高Ni负载（1.5 wt.% Ni）的双金属催化剂，浸渍顺序似乎对环己烯的异丙醇化活性没有显著影响，因为两个催化剂显示出相似的异丙醇化活性。

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule because it exhibits multiple reaction pathways that can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By studying the disproportionation of cyclohexene, researchers can understand how different catalyst compositions affect the efficiency of the reaction.

2. The bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts showed significantly higher activity towards the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to pure Pt or Ni catalysts. This indicates that the presence of both metals enhances the catalytic performance for this specific reaction.

3. For a Pt/Ni atomic ratio of 3/1, the catalyst with Pt impregnated first (1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3) exhibited higher activity than the one with Ni impregnated first (1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3). This suggests that the sequence of impregnation affects the formation of the Pt/Ni alloy, impacting the catalyst's performance.

4. Kinetic analysis revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for the catalyst with Pt impregnated first (1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3). This indicates that the impregnation sequence can modify the catalyst's ability to selectively hydrogenate acetylene in the presence of ethylene.

5. The catalyst with Pt impregnated first (1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3) showed a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene and a higher selectivity for hydrogenating acetylene compared to the catalyst with Ni impregnated first (1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3).

6. At a higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.%) while maintaining the same Pt loading, the sequence of impregnation had minimal impact on the disproportionation activity of cyclohexene. This suggests that there might be a threshold for Ni loading beyond which the sequence of impregnation becomes less significant.

7. The catalytic properties of the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were altered compared to the monometallic catalysts, as evidenced by changes in the rate constants for cyclohexene conversion and the equilibrium constant for acetylene adsorption. These modifications indicate that the bimetallic composition influences the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

1. 环己烯作为理想的探针分子，因为它表现出多种反应途径，可以提供有关双金属催化剂如何影响氢化活性和选择性的见解。通过研究环己烯的自氢化反应，研究人员可以理解不同催化剂组成如何影响反应效率。

2. Pt/Ni双金属催化剂在环己烯自氢化反应中的活性显著高于纯Pt或Ni催化剂。这表明两种金属的存在增强了特定反应的催化性能。

3. 对于3/1的Pt/Ni原子比，先浸渍Pt（1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3）的催化剂比先浸渍Ni（1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3）的催化剂活性更高。这表明浸渍顺序会影响Pt/Ni合金的形成，进而影响催化剂的性能。

4. 动力学分析揭示了先浸渍Pt的催化剂（1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3）中乙炔氢化选择性增加。这表明浸渍顺序可以修改催化剂对乙炔在乙烯存在的条件下的选择性氢化能力。

5. 先浸渍Pt的催化剂（1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3）显示了环己烯自氢化速率更快以及对乙炔氢化的更高选择性，与先浸渍Ni的催化剂（1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3）相比。

6. 在保持相同Pt负载的同时，较高Ni负载（1.5 wt.％）下，浸渍顺序对环己烯自氢化活性的影响较小。这表明可能存在一个Ni负载阈值，在此阈值之上，浸渍顺序的影响变得不那么重要。

7. 与单金属催化剂相比，1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂的催化性质发生了改变，表现为环己烯转化率的速率常数和乙炔吸附平衡常数的变化。这些修改表明双金属组成影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it undergoes multiple reaction pathways under different conditions. These pathways provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By monitoring the conversion of cyclohexene, researchers can evaluate how the bimetallic catalysts affect the efficiency and selectivity of hydrogenation reactions.

2. The primary objectives of the study are twofold. The first is to expand surface science research on Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts. The second is to investigate how the sequence of metal impregnation impacts the formation of bimetallic bonds within these catalysts. This investigation aims to understand how the impregnation sequence affects the catalytic properties of the bimetallic catalysts.

3. The 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts demonstrated a high conversion rate of cyclohexene reaching 100% after 60 minutes. This indicates that both catalysts are highly effective in the disproportionation reaction of cyclohexene.

4. The impregnation sequence has a significant impact on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni). However, the effect diminishes for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). This suggests that there is a threshold of Ni loading required for the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, beyond which the impregnation sequence no longer significantly influences the formation of these bonds.

5. The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to the 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. This indicates that the sequence of impregnation affects the catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts, with the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst showing superior performance.

2. 研究的主要目标有两个。第一个是将表面科学研究从Pt/Ni双金属系统扩展到支持的双金属催化剂。第二个是确定浸渍顺序对形成双金属键的影响。这一调查旨在理解浸渍顺序如何影响双金属催化剂的催化特性。

3. 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 和 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 催化剂在60分钟后实现了环己烯的完全转化率。这表明这两种催化剂在环己烯的失重反应中非常有效。

4. 对于低Ni负载（0.5 wt.% Ni）的催化剂，浸渍顺序对形成PtNi双金属键有显著影响。然而，对于更高Ni负载（1.5 wt.% Ni）的催化剂，这种影响减小。这表明存在一个Ni负载阈值，超过该阈值后，浸渍顺序不再显著影响形成这些键。

5. 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 催化剂在环己烯失重反应中的转化率高于1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3和1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂。这表明浸渍顺序影响双金属催化剂的活性，其中1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂表现出更好的性能。

The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence. The bimetallic Pt/Ni catalysts showed significantly higher activity toward the disproportionation of cyclohexene than either Pt/γ-Al2O3 or Ni/γ-Al2O3. For catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the Pt-first catalyst, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, showed higher activity than the Ni-first catalyst, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The effect of impregnation sequence was not as significant for catalysts with the Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1. In addition, kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 as compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Pt LIII edge indicated that PtNi bimetallic bonds were formed in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The PtNi bonds were formed for the 1/1 ratio catalysts with both impregnation sequences. Overall, our results indicate that, at low Ni loadings, the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, which in turn lead to different catalytic behavior for both the disproportionation of cyclohexene and the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene.

The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene serves as an indicator of the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. Its multiple reaction pathways help understand how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The high activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts towards the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to monometallic catalysts provides insights into the synergistic effects of Pt and Ni. The hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene, another probe reaction, further elucidates the impact of the impregnation sequence on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds and subsequent catalytic performance.
