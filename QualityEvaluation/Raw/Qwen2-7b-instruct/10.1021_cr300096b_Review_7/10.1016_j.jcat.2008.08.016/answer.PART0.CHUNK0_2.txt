[1] "Cyclohexene was the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography."
[2] "The PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."
[3] "In comparison, the 1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the initial conversion of benzene increased to 50%. In summary, PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed much higher activities than Co, Ni, Pt monometallic and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation."

How does cyclohexene serve as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions, and what insights can its multiple reaction pathways provide about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes?

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways, providing insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Specifically, the different reactivity of cyclohexene towards PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts allows researchers to understand the unique catalytic properties of these materials. By comparing the performance of cyclohexene hydrogenation over PtCo, PtNi, and monometallic Co, Ni, and Pt catalysts, scientists can gain valuable information on the synergistic effects of alloying Pt with Co or Ni, which can lead to enhanced hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing industrial processes that rely on hydrogenation reactions, such as the production of chemicals and fuels.
