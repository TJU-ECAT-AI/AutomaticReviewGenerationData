[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces [42] ,[47] , was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."
[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."
[3] "Overall, the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts and exhibited distinct hydrogenation activities for benzene and cyclohexene, supporting the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that these bimetallic catalysts would have unique catalytic properties."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it allows for the investigation of multiple reaction pathways. These pathways provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

2. The PtNi bimetallic catalyst demonstrated superior performance in cyclohexene hydrogenation compared to the PtCo catalyst. This outcome aligns with the H2 chemisorption results, which revealed that the PtNi catalyst possessed a higher number of metallic active sites.

3. The PtCo and PtNi bimetallic catalysts showcased higher hydrogenation activities than their monometallic counterparts. Moreover, they exhibited distinct activities for benzene and cyclohexene hydrogenation, confirming the theoretical predictions about the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.
