[1] "For each experiment, 0.040 g of unreduced catalyst was used for the catalytic evaluation under atmospheric pressure at 273 K."
[2] "In order to correlate with previous surface science studies [47], the hydrogenation of cyclohexene was also used as a probe reaction in the same flow reactor."
[3] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces [42],[47], was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."
[4] "Cyclohexane was the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography."
[5] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo."
[6] "More importantly, the results in Fig. 3 clearly showed that the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts were more active than Pt, in agreement with previous studies on single crystal surfaces [47]."
[7] "In comparison, the 1.2%Pt10%Co catalyst showed a much higher conversion of 30%."
[8] "In particular, for the 1.2%Pt30%Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the initial conversion of benzene increased to 50%."
[9] "In summary, PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed much higher activities than Co, Ni, Pt monometallic and PtNi bimetallic catalysts for benzene hydrogenation."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it allows researchers to investigate the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Its multiple reaction pathways provide insights into how different catalyst components interact and affect the efficiency of hydrogenation processes. The results from the hydrogenation of cyclohexene can be correlated with surface science studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanisms involved. This approach helps in optimizing industrial processes, particularly in refining and petrochemical industries where the hydrogenation of complex molecules like cyclohexene is crucial for product purification and yield enhancement.
