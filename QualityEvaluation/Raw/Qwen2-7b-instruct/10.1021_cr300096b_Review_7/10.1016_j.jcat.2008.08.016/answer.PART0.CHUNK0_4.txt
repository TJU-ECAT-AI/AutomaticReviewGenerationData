[1] "For each experiment, 0.040 g of unreduced catalyst was used for the catalytic evaluation under atmospheric pressure at 273 K."
[2] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces [42] ,[47] , was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."
[3] "Cyclohexane was the only reaction product detected by online gas chromatography."
[4] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene over 10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was also tested and the catalytic activity was nearly zero, which was not shown in Fig. 3 ."
[5] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."
[6] "The catalytic activity of the three catalysts shows the following trend: 1.2%Pt10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 > 1.2%Pt10%Co/γ-Al2O3 > 1.2%Pt/γ-Al2O3, which is consistent with the trend from flow reactor studies shown earlier in Fig. 3 ."
[7] "The rate of cyclohexane production over the bimetallic catalysts was greater than that of the monometallic Pt catalyst and that the PtNi catalyst was more active than PtCo."
[8] "It was determined that the PtCo catalyst was far more active for the hydrogenation of benzene when compared to the PtNi bimetallic and Pt monometallic catalysts."
[9] "For benzene hydrogenation, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher activity than PtNi, as illustrated in the rate constants from batch reactor studies and the apparent activation energies from flow reactor studies."
