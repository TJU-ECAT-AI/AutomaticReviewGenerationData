[1] "For each experiment, 0.040 g of unreduced catalyst was used for the catalytic evaluation under atmospheric pressure at 273 K."
[2] "As shown in Fig. 3, the hydrogenation of cyclohexene over 10%Co/γ-Al2O3 and 10%Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was nearly zero."
[3] "In comparison, the 1.2%Pt10%Co catalyst showed a much higher conversion of 30%."
[4] "The enhanced activities could be attributed to the increased reducibility of Co(Ni) oxides by the addition of Pt, and more importantly, to the formation of the PtCo and PtNi bimetallic alloys."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its multiple reaction pathways. These pathways provide insights into how the influence of bimetallic catalysts affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. Specifically, the different reactivity patterns of cyclohexene towards various catalysts reveal the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts in terms of their ability to enhance or alter the hydrogenation processes.

The insights gained from studying cyclohexene's hydrogenation over different catalysts can help optimize industrial processes. For instance, understanding the factors that lead to increased activity or selectivity can guide the design of more efficient catalysts for specific applications, such as the production of valuable chemical intermediates or the upgrading of hydrocarbons. Moreover, the knowledge derived from these studies can contribute to the development of sustainable technologies that reduce energy consumption and minimize waste generation.

The presence of cyclohexene in industrial processes makes it a crucial molecule to study. Its use as a probe molecule allows researchers to investigate the complex interactions between catalysts and reactants, providing a foundation for advancing hydrogenation technology and improving the efficiency of existing industrial processes.
