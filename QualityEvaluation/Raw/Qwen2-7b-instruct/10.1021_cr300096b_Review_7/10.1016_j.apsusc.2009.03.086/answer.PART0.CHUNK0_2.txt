[1] "Reversible surface structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles during oxidation and reduction cycles Rentao Mu, Qiang Fu * Hongyang Liu, Dali Tan, Runsheng Zhai, Xinhe Bao *"
[2] "Under- standing and controlling the surface state of the bimetallic catalysts is of great importance for many industrial reactions."
[3] "The results illustrate that the surface structure of bimetallic catalysts can be tuned via treatments in various gases."
[4] "Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles."
[5] "Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic."
[6] "The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems."
