<p>The dynamic behaviors in heterogeneous catalyst systems are closely correlated with reaction gas composition.</p>
<p>Oxidizing and reducing atmospheres are the most frequently encountered reaction environments in many industrial reaction processes, such as partial oxidation reactions and hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the bimetallic catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres.</p>
<p>Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles.</p>
<p>Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance, 300 8C), both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures.</p>
<p>The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems.</p>

The cyclohexene molecule serves as an ideal probe for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways under different conditions. This provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence the activity and selectivity of hydrogenation processes in industrial settings. Specifically, the reversible changes in the surface structure and composition of Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles, such as PtNi, PtCu, and PtCo, when exposed to alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres, reveal the dynamic nature of these catalysts. These changes, driven by the encapsulation of Ni by NiO upon oxidation and the segregation of Pt to the particle surfaces under reduction, highlight the importance of surface state tuning for optimizing catalytic performance in real-world applications.
