[1] "Reversible structural changes in Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles have been observed when annealing the catalysts in alternating H2 and O2 atmospheres."
[2] "Upon oxidation in O2 (0.1 MPa) at 300 8C, Ni becomes oxidized and the formed NiO encapsulates the bimetallic particles."
[3] "Under reduction conditions (20% H2 with Ar balance,300 8C) both Pt and Ni stay as metallic. Pt segregates onto the particle surfaces and Ni diffuses to subsurface region, which results in the formation of Pt-skin structures."
[4] "The reversible mass transport processes in response to changes between O2 and H2 contribute to the oscillations in surface structure and composition at PtNi nanoparticle systems."

The cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways. This allows for a detailed understanding of how different catalysts influence the hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The insights gained from these pathways can reveal the specific mechanisms by which catalysts interact with the molecule, leading to improved catalyst design and optimization for specific applications.
