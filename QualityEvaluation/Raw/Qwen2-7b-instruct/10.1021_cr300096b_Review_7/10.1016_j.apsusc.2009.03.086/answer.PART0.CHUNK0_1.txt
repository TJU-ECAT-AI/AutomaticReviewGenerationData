The cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it exhibits multiple reaction pathways. These pathways provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The study reveals that when subjected to alternating hydrogen and oxygen atmospheres, Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticles undergo reversible structural changes. Specifically, during oxidation in oxygen, nickel in these nanoparticles is oxidized, leading to the formation of nickel oxide which encapsulates the particles. Conversely, under reduction conditions, both platinum and nickel remain in their metallic states. Platinum tends to segregate onto the particle surfaces, while nickel diffuses to the subsurface region, forming a platinum skin structure. These reversible mass transport processes, triggered by changes between oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres, lead to oscillations in the surface structure and composition of the nanoparticles. Similar reversible dynamic behaviors are observed in PtCu and PtCo nanoparticle catalysts, further highlighting the significance of these processes in real catalytic reactions.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它表现出多种反应途径。这些途径为了解双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中氢化活性和选择性提供了见解。研究表明，在交替氢气和氧气气氛下，基于铂的双金属纳米粒子会发生可逆结构变化。具体来说，在氧气氧化过程中，这些纳米粒子中的镍会被氧化，形成镍氧化物，将其封装起来。相反，在还原条件下，铂和镍都保持在金属状态。铂倾向于聚集到粒子表面，而镍则扩散到亚表面区域，形成铂皮结构。这些由氧气和氢气气氛变化触发的可逆质量传输过程导致纳米粒子表面结构和组成的振荡。在PtCu和PtCo纳米颗粒催化剂中也观察到了类似可逆动态行为，进一步强调了这些过程在实际催化反应中的重要性。
