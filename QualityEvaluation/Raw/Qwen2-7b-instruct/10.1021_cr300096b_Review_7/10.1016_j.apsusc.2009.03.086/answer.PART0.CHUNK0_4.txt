<p>The dynamic behaviors in heterogeneous catalyst systems are closely correlated with reaction gas composition. Oxidizing and reducing atmospheres are the most frequently encountered reaction environments in many industrial reaction processes, such as partial oxidation reactions and hydrogenation reactions.</p>
<p>In an intelligent catalyst LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3, Pd reversibly moves into and out of the perovskite oxide lattice as the catalyst is cycled between oxidative and reductive atmospheres. High-Pd dispersion is retained in long-term automotive emission control process, preventing the aggregation of Pd catalysts and deteriora- tion of the catalyst activity [1,2].</p>
<p>Strong metalsupport interaction (SMSI) effect often occurs in metal/oxide catalyst systems owing to encapsulation of metal catalysts by oxide supports [713]. The SMSI effect or the encapsulation process has been found to be reversible. Catalysts in the SMSI state formed under reduction conditions can be regenerated via oxidation treatments [9,14].</p>
<p>Oxide catalysts also demonstrate reversible dynamic changes at reaction gases. For example, Netzer et al. reported the morphology and structure oscillations of vanadium oxide surface phase grown on Pd(1 1 1) upon oxida- tionreduction in O2 and H2 [15]. These dynamic behaviors at catalyst surfaces indicate that the surface state of catalytic materials varies sensitively with the redox potential of the reaction gases.</p>
<p>The surface states of supported PtNi nanoparticles treated at alternating O2 and H2 atmosphere were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Reversible structural changes at the surfaces of the supported PtNi nanoparticles in response to reaction gases were observed, showing NiO-rich surface in oxidizing gases and Pt-rich surface in reducing gases. The dynamic behaviors can be attributed to two opposite gas-driven mass transport processes at bimetallic particle surfaces, including surface segregation of Pt at the bimetallic particles in H2 and encapsulation of the particles by NiO in O2.</p>
<p>The similar surface structural changes can be observed in other bimetallic catalyst systems, as exemplified in supported PtCu and PtCo nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The as-prepared PtNi/HOPG samples were mildly reduced (20% H2 with Ar balance, 200 8C, 2 h) to decompose the precursor salts and remove any adsorbates from the catalysts. XPS measurement shows that both Pt and Ni have been completely reduced and no more Cl and N signals were detected. The clean PtNi catalysts were then treated in alternating O2 (0.1 MPa) and H2 (0.1 MPa, 20% H2 with Ar balance) atmospheres at 300 8C for 1 h, and XPS measurement was performed in between.</p>
<p>After the first oxidation (O2(1) as noted in Fig. 1a and b), the main peak of XPS Pt 4f still locates at 71.2 eV, being characteristic of the metallic Pt. However, the Pt 4f spectrum becomes asymmetric with a small shoulder peak at higher binding energy (BE). Deconvolution of the spectrum results in a new small component at 72.4 eV, which is due to appearance of Pt2+. The main peak of Ni 2p3/2 is at 853.9 eV and a strong shake-up feature at 860.9 eV appears, which suggest the formation of NiO at the oxidation atmosphere [21]. Subsequent reduction in H2 (H2(1) in Fig. 1a and b) shifts the Ni 2p3/2 peak down to 852.6 eV for the metallic Ni state. The Pt 4f peak position remains unchanged but the line shape becomes narrow. On the other hand, the intensity of the Pt 4f and Ni 2p signals varies largely with the annealing treatments.</p>
<p>It is known that wetting and/or dewetting may take place when annealing supported metal particles in gases [36], which could cause variation in XPS signal intensity. To study this effect, a Pt/ HOPG sample was cycled with the same oxidation and reduction treatments. Pt 4f spectra were acquired after each annealing step. As displayed in Fig. 2, the Pt 4f intensity almost keeps unchanged in the three oxidation-reduction cycles, which is in stark contrast to the case of PtNi catalyst systems (see Fig. 1a).</p>
<p>Furthermore, structural information of the supported PtNi particles was given through TEM investigations. The PtNi particles supported on CB present size ranging from 5 to 20 nm. HRTEM imaging of individual particles indicates the formation of PtNi alloy phase.</p>
<p>Based on the above results and discussions, we suggest that the observed changes in XPS Pt and Ni signals from the PtNi particles during oxidation and reduction cycles should be attributed to certain surface processes at the bimetallic particles. Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces.</p>
<p>Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface. The surface segregation of Pt has been found in Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtCu [24], PtNi [17,2528], PtFe [29,30], and PtCo [29,31]. The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process. Since hydrogen bonds weakly to most 3d transition metals, presence of H2 will not change the thermodynamic driving force for the surface segrega- tion process.</p>
<p>The stability of PtM catalysts may change significantly when the atmosphere is switched from H2 to O2. Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on Pt M catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]. Moreover, the 3d transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environments. Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2) [35 37], the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces (surface energy of Pt: 1.95 J/m2 [38]). As we have seen that Ni was oxidized to NiO in case of oxidation of the PtNi catalyst at 300 8C (Fig. 1b). Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed</p>

1. The dynamic behaviors in heterogeneous catalyst systems are closely correlated with reaction gas composition, and bimetallic catalysts exhibit reversible structural changes in response to cycling between oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. For instance, in a LaFe0.57Co0.38Pd0.05O3 catalyst, Pd moves reversibly between the perovskite oxide lattice and the surface during oxidation and reduction cycles, maintaining high dispersion and preventing catalyst aggregation and degradation.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, such as PtNi, PtCu, and PtCo, can undergo reversible shape changes in response to reaction gas environments.
