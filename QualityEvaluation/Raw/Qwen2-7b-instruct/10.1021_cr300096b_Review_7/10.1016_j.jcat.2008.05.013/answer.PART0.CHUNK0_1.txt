<p>The study used a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to determine trends in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on several bimetallic surfaces prepared by modifying Pt(111) with 3d transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu).</p>
<p>The hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) sandwich structures was significantly lower than that on the corresponding 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface structures and monometallic parent metal surfaces.</p>
<p>The binding of cyclohexene on these surfaces followed the same trend as that of HBE.</p>
<p>The weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) led to a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that did not occur on either 3d-Pt-Pt(111) or the corresponding parent metal surfaces.</p>
<p>Pt-Ni-Pt(111) had the highest hydrogenation activity among the surfaces studied, with 0.030 molecules of cyclohexene converted to cyclohexane per surface metal atom.</p>
<p>This activity was maximized on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, which had an intermediate cyclohexene binding energy, leading to a volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy.</p>
<p>The subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures have the most interesting hydrogenation and dehydrogenation properties.</p>

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Its multiple reaction pathways provide insights into how different bimetallic catalysts affect hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By examining the binding energies of hydrogen and cyclohexene on various surfaces, researchers can determine which bimetallic catalysts are most effective at promoting hydrogenation reactions while minimizing unwanted side reactions. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications, such as the production of chemicals and fuels.

环己烯是一个理想的探针分子，用于研究氢化反应，因为它可以经历分解、脱氢和自身氢化（异构化）反应，以及在吸附原子氢共存下进行氢化。其多种反应途径为不同双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性的影响提供了见解。通过分析氢和环己烯在各种表面的结合能，研究人员可以确定哪些双金属催化剂最有效地促进氢化反应同时最小化副反应。这方面的理解可以指导开发更高效和选择性的催化剂，用于工业应用，如化学品和燃料的生产。
