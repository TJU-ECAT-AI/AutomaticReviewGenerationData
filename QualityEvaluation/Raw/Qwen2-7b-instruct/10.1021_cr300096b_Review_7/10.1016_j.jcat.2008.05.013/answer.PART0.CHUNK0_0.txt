[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."
[3] "The absence of the hydrogenation pathway on these surfaces is most likely due to the strong bonding of hydrogen and cyclohexene, as predicted by DFT in Fig. 4 and Table 1 , respectively."
[4] "A volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. Its competitive nature across these pathways allows for comparisons of the chemical properties of various bimetallic surfaces. On Pt(111), cyclohexene typically undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition, but when the surface is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can change significantly. The strong bonding of hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces prevents the hydrogenation pathway from occurring. A volcano-type relationship exists between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity.

1. 异环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它能够经历多种反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、自氢化和在共吸附原子氢存在下的氢化。由于这些反应途径的竞争性，它允许对各种双金属催化剂表面的化学性质进行比较。在Pt(111)表面上，异环己烯通常经历脱氢和分解，但当表面用另一种金属修改时，主导的反应途径会发生显著变化。这些表面上氢和异环己烯的强烈结合阻止了氢化途径的发生。氢化活性与异环己烯的结合能之间存在火山型关系，其中Pt-Ni-Pt(111)表现出最高的活性。
