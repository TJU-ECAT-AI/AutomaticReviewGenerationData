[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."
[3] "The absence of the hydrogenation pathway on these surfaces is most likely due to the strong bonding of hydrogen and cyclohexene, as predicted by DFT in Fig. 4 and Table 1 , respectively."
[4] "A volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. Its competitive nature across these pathways allows for comparisons of the chemical properties of various bimetallic surfaces. On Pt(111), cyclohexene typically undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition, but when the surface is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can change significantly. The strong bonding of hydrogen and cyclohexene on these surfaces prevents the hydrogenation pathway from occurring. A volcano-type relationship exists between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity.

<p>The study used a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to determine trends in the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on several bimetallic surfaces prepared by modifying Pt(111) with 3d transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu).</p>
<p>The hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) sandwich structures was significantly lower than that on the corresponding 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface structures and monometallic parent metal surfaces.</p>
<p>The binding of cyclohexene on these surfaces followed the same trend as that of HBE.</p>
<p>The weaker binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) led to a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that did not occur on either 3d-Pt-Pt(111) or the corresponding parent metal surfaces.</p>
<p>Pt-Ni-Pt(111) had the highest hydrogenation activity among the surfaces studied, with 0.030 molecules of cyclohexene converted to cyclohexane per surface metal atom.</p>
<p>This activity was maximized on the Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surface, which had an intermediate cyclohexene binding energy, leading to a volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy.</p>
<p>The subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures have the most interesting hydrogenation and dehydrogenation properties.</p>

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo various reactions, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. These diverse reaction pathways allow researchers to compare the general trends in the chemical properties of different bimetallic surfaces. 

2. When the surface chemistry of Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways for cyclohexene can significantly change. This variability provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

3. On the unmodified Pt(111) surface, cyclohexene tends to undergo dehydrogenation and decomposition. However, when Pt(111) is modified with additional metals, the nature of the primary reaction pathways can shift, reflecting altered catalytic properties.

4. The absence of a hydrogenation pathway on certain surfaces is attributed to the strong bonding between hydrogen and cyclohexene, as predicted by computational methods. This observation highlights the importance of considering both hydrogen and cyclohexene binding energies in evaluating hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways. These pathways offer insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. Specifically, the pathways demonstrate how the presence of a second metal can alter the energetics of hydrogenation, potentially leading to improved selectivity or activity.

2. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. For instance, the dehydrogenation pathway can limit the formation of certain products, while the hydrogenation pathway can favor others. By monitoring the relative contributions of these pathways, researchers can understand how different bimetallic catalysts affect the efficiency and specificity of hydrogenation reactions.

3. The absence of the hydrogenation pathway on surfaces is attributed to the strong bonding of hydrogen and cyclohexene. This indicates that for hydrogenation to occur, the bonds between the reactants must be sufficiently weakened. The study demonstrates that by tuning the surface properties, such as the d-band center and hydrogen binding energy, the reactivity and selectivity of hydrogenation reactions can be optimized.

4. The quantification of hydrogenation activity using TPD peak area ratios reveals correlations with hydrogen binding energy. This suggests that lowering the hydrogen binding energy can enhance the hydrogenation activity of the catalyst. The data provides guidance for designing catalysts that balance hydrogen binding strength to achieve optimal hydrogenation performance.

5. The volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy highlights the importance of finding an intermediate binding strength for maximizing activity. This relationship underscores the need for a delicate balance between the strength of the adsorbate-metals interactions and the overall reactivity of the catalyst, indicating that catalysts with intermediate hydrogen binding energies tend to exhibit the highest activity in hydrogenation reactions.
