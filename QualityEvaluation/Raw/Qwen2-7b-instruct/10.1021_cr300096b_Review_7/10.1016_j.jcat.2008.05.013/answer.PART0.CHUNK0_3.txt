1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its ability to undergo various reactions, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. These diverse reaction pathways allow researchers to compare the general trends in the chemical properties of different bimetallic surfaces. 

2. When the surface chemistry of Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways for cyclohexene can significantly change. This variability provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

3. On the unmodified Pt(111) surface, cyclohexene tends to undergo dehydrogenation and decomposition. However, when Pt(111) is modified with additional metals, the nature of the primary reaction pathways can shift, reflecting altered catalytic properties.

4. The absence of a hydrogenation pathway on certain surfaces is attributed to the strong bonding between hydrogen and cyclohexene, as predicted by computational methods. This observation highlights the importance of considering both hydrogen and cyclohexene binding energies in evaluating hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

1. 环己烯因其能够进行分解、脱氢、自氢化以及在吸附的原子氢存在下氢化等反应，成为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子。这些多样的反应途径允许研究人员比较不同双金属催化剂表面的一般化学性质趋势。

2. 当改变Pt(111)表面的化学性质时，环己烯的主要反应路径会显著变化。这种变化提供了双金属催化剂如何影响氢化活性和选择性的见解，在工业过程中尤为重要。

3. 在未修改的Pt(111)表面上，环己烯倾向于经历脱氢和分解。然而，当对Pt(111)表面进行额外金属的修饰时，环己烯的主要反应路径会发生变化，反映出催化性质的改变。

4. 某些表面缺乏氢化途径的原因是氢和环己烯之间强烈的结合，这与计算方法预测的结果相吻合。这一观察结果强调了在评估氢化活性和选择性时同时考虑氢和环己烯结合能的重要性。
