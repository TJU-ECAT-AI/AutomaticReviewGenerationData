[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."
[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition [7] ,[30] ; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway. Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway [28] ,[31] ,[32] ."
[3] "The activity toward the formation of benzene on Pt-3d-Pt(111) is calculated. The activity for cyclohexane formation is determined in exactly the same way, but using cyclohexane peak area ratios."
[4] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, which can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By examining the competitive nature of pathways such as decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation, researchers can compare the chemical properties of various bimetallic surfaces. For instance, on Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition, but when the surface is modified with other metals, the dominant pathways change. Studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) surfaces have revealed that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. The volcano-type relationship between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity, highlights the importance of cyclohexene in understanding catalyst performance.
