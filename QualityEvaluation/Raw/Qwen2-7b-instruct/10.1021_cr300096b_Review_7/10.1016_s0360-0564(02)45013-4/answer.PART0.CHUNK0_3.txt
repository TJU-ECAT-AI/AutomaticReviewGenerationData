[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
[2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
[3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because of its multiple reaction pathways, which can provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The theoretical surface science and catalysis calculations using density functional theory allow understanding the variations in reactivity across different transition metals, the impact of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates on reactivity. These concepts can be applied to both transition metal surfaces and sulfide and oxide catalysts, offering a comprehensive framework for optimizing industrial processes involving hydrogenation reactions.
