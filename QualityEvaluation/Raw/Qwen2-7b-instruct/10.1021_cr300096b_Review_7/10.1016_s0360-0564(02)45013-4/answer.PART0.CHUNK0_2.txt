[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
[2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbateadsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
[3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, which provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This is because the detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the reactivity trends can be achieved through computational methods based on density functional theory. These calculations can help predict how different catalyst structures and compositions affect the hydrogenation process, leading to improved industrial catalysts with higher efficiency and selectivity.
