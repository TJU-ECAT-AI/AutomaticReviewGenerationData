The application of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions. This methodology allows for understanding and predicting variations in reactivity across different transition metals, the impact of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates on reactivity. While the focus is primarily on transition metal surfaces, the computational approach and conceptual framework developed to elucidate reactivity trends in metals can also be applied to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, which provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This is because the detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the reactivity trends can be achieved through computational methods based on density functional theory. These calculations can help predict how different catalyst structures and compositions affect the hydrogenation process, leading to improved industrial catalysts with higher efficiency and selectivity.
