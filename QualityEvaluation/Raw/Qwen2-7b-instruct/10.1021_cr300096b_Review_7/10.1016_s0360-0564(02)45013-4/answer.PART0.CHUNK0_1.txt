[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
[2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
[3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

The application of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions. This methodology allows for understanding and predicting variations in reactivity across different transition metals, the impact of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates on reactivity. While the focus is primarily on transition metal surfaces, the computational approach and conceptual framework developed to elucidate reactivity trends in metals can also be applied to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

密度泛函理论（DFT）的应用被回顾，用于计算表面化学反应的吸附性质、反应途径和活化能。这种方法允许理解和预测从一种过渡金属到另一种过渡金属的反应性变化，以及合金化、表面结构和吸附剂之间的相互作用对反应性的影响。虽然重点主要放在过渡金属表面上，但计算方法和用于理解金属中反应性趋势的概念框架也可以应用于硫化物和氧化物催化剂。
