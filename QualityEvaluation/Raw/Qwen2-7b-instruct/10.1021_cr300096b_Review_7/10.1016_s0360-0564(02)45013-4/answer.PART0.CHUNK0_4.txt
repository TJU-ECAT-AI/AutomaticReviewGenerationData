[1] "The application of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reac- tion pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions is reviewed."
[2] "Particular emphasis is placed on developing concepts that can be used to understand and predict variations in reactivity from one transition metal to the next or the effects of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the reactivity."
[3] "Most examples discussed are concerned with the catalytic properties of transition metal surfaces, but it is shown that the calculational approach and the concepts developed to understand trends in reactivity for metals can also be used for sulfide and oxide catalysts."

The review discusses the use of density functional theory to calculate adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions, particularly focusing on transition metal surfaces. This approach helps in understanding and predicting variations in reactivity across different metals, influenced by factors such as alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates. The concepts developed are applicable not only to transition metal catalysts but also to sulfide and oxide catalysts.
