"Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni( ) bimetallic surfaces Abstract The reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). Hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces at temperatures approximately 4050 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface."
"Cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition to produce benzene (c-C6H6), atomic C(a) and H2(g) on Ni(1 1 1). HREELS results also reveal that cyclohexene (c-C6H10) is strongly bonded to the Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface at coverages from 0.5 to 3 ML, a fraction of the cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane (c-C6H12) at 237 K."
"When Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1)."

Answer: 
Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces. Its ability to dehydrogenate, decompose, and hydrogenate under various conditions allows researchers to analyze the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By observing how cyclohexene reacts on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces versus clean Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, scientists can gain insights into how the addition of Pt affects the catalytic properties, particularly in terms of introducing a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. The weak bonding of cyclohexene to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface compared to Ni(1 1 1) surface suggests that the presence of Pt leads to altered reactivity profiles, which can be crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in industrial applications.

作为化学探针，环己烯可用于研究低温氢化活性。它能经历多种反应途径，这使得研究人员能够分析双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性的影响。通过观察环己烯在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面与清洁的Ni(1 1 1)表面之间的反应差异，科学家可以了解添加Pt如何改变催化性质，特别是引入低温氢化途径。Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面与Ni(1 1 1)表面相比，环己烯与其之间的较弱结合表明Pt的存在导致了不同的反应特性，这对于优化工业应用中的催化过程至关重要。
