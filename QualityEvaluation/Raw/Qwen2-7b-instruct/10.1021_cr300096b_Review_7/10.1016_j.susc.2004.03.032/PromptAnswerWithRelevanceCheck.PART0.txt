Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces. These pathways provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Specifically, on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface, cyclohexene decomposes to atomic carbon (C(a)) and hydrogen gas (H2), or it dehydrogenates to produce benzene (C6H6). However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced. A fraction of cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane (C6H12) at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS results also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1). Pre-adsorption of hydrogen on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity, with the onset temperature of cyclohexane desorption reduced to 180 K.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它能够在其不同的表面上经历多种反应途径。这些途径提供了有关双金属催化剂如何影响氢化活性和选择性的见解。具体来说，在干净的Ni（1 1 1）表面上，环己烯分解为原子碳（C（a））和氢气（H2），或者它脱氢生成苯（C6H6）。然而，当将Pt添加到Ni（1 1 1）表面上时，在Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面上，引入了一个低温氢化途径。在覆盖率为0.5 ML Pt和更高时，Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面的一部分环己烯自氢化产生环己烷（C6H12）在237 K。HREELS结果还表明，环己烯与Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面的结合强度比与Ni（1 1 1）表面的结合强度弱。在1 ML Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面上预吸附氢增强了氢化活性，环己烷的脱附起始温度降低至180 K。

Answer: 
Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces. Its ability to dehydrogenate, decompose, and hydrogenate under various conditions allows researchers to analyze the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By observing how cyclohexene reacts on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces versus clean Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, scientists can gain insights into how the addition of Pt affects the catalytic properties, particularly in terms of introducing a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. The weak bonding of cyclohexene to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface compared to Ni(1 1 1) surface suggests that the presence of Pt leads to altered reactivity profiles, which can be crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in industrial applications.

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways under different conditions. Its dehydrogenation to benzene and decomposition to carbon and hydrogen on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface contrasts with the introduction of a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface. This provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

2. The insights gained from cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic surfaces can help optimize industrial processes. By understanding how the presence of Pt modifies the reaction pathways, researchers can tailor catalysts for more efficient hydrogenation reactions. This can lead to improvements in the production of chemicals and fuels, potentially reducing costs and enhancing sustainability.

The introduction of Pt onto the Ni(1 1 1) surface introduces a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway for cyclohexene. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with a coverage of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene binds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1). This weak bonding is one reason for the enhanced low-temperature hydrogenation activity of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.

在添加Pt到Ni(1 1 1)表面上后，引入了一个低温氢化途径来处理环己烯。当Pt的覆盖度达到0.5 ML及以上时，在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上生成环己烷的温度为237 K。高分辨率电子能量损失谱(HREELS)显示，环己烯在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上的结合力比在Ni(1 1 1)表面上弱。这种较弱的结合力是Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面具有增强的低温氢化活性的原因之一。
