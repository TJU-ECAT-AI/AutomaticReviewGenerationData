Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple reaction pathways on different surfaces. These pathways provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Specifically, on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface, cyclohexene decomposes to atomic carbon (C(a)) and hydrogen gas (H2), or it dehydrogenates to produce benzene (C6H6). However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced. A fraction of cyclohexene undergoes self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane (C6H12) at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS results also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1). Pre-adsorption of hydrogen on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity, with the onset temperature of cyclohexane desorption reduced to 180 K.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它能够在其不同的表面上经历多种反应途径。这些途径提供了有关双金属催化剂如何影响氢化活性和选择性的见解。具体来说，在干净的Ni（1 1 1）表面上，环己烯分解为原子碳（C（a））和氢气（H2），或者它脱氢生成苯（C6H6）。然而，当将Pt添加到Ni（1 1 1）表面上时，在Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面上，引入了一个低温氢化途径。在覆盖率为0.5 ML Pt和更高时，Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面的一部分环己烯自氢化产生环己烷（C6H12）在237 K。HREELS结果还表明，环己烯与Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面的结合强度比与Ni（1 1 1）表面的结合强度弱。在1 ML Pt/Ni（1 1 1）表面上预吸附氢增强了氢化活性，环己烷的脱附起始温度降低至180 K。
