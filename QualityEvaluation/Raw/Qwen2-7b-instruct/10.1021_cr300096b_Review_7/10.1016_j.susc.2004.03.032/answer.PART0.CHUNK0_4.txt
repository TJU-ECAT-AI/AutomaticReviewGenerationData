"Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni( ) bimetallic surfaces Abstract The reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). Hydrogen desorbs from Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces at temperatures approximately 4050 K lower than the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. The reaction pathways of cyclohexene are also significantly modified on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it allows researchers to understand the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Its multiple reaction pathways, such as dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition, provide insights into how different catalyst compositions affect the catalytic processes. The unique behavior of cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, compared to its behavior on pure Ni(1 1 1) surfaces, highlights the role of the Pt component in enhancing the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalyst.

The introduction of Pt onto the Ni(1 1 1) surface introduces a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway for cyclohexene. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with a coverage of 0.5 ML Pt and higher. HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene binds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1). This weak bonding is one reason for the enhanced low-temperature hydrogenation activity of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces.

在添加Pt到Ni(1 1 1)表面上后，引入了一个低温氢化途径来处理环己烯。当Pt的覆盖度达到0.5 ML及以上时，在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上生成环己烷的温度为237 K。高分辨率电子能量损失谱(HREELS)显示，环己烯在Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面上的结合力比在Ni(1 1 1)表面上弱。这种较弱的结合力是Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面具有增强的低温氢化活性的原因之一。
