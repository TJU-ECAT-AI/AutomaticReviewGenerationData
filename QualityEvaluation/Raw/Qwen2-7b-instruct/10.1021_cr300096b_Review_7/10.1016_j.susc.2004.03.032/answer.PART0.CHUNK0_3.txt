"Cyclohexene as a chemical probe of the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni( ) bimetallic surfaces Abstract The reactions of H2 and cyclohexene on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS)."
"Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced. Cyclohexane is produced at 237 K on Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces with coverages of 0.5 ML Pt and higher."
"HREELS also reveal that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface than to Ni(1 1 1)."
"In addition, the pre-adsorption of H2 on the 1 ML Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface enhances the hydrogenation activity."

1. Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways under different conditions. Its dehydrogenation to benzene and decomposition to carbon and hydrogen on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface contrasts with the introduction of a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface. This provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

2. The insights gained from cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways on bimetallic surfaces can help optimize industrial processes. By understanding how the presence of Pt modifies the reaction pathways, researchers can tailor catalysts for more efficient hydrogenation reactions. This can lead to improvements in the production of chemicals and fuels, potentially reducing costs and enhancing sustainability.

1. 柔环己烯作为氢化反应的化学探针，具有在不同条件下进行多种反应路径的能力。它在清洁的Ni(1 1 1)表面上分解为碳和氢或脱氢为苯，而在添加Pt到Ni(1 1 1)表面上，则引入了一个低温氢化途径。这为如何通过双金属催化剂影响氢化活性和选择性提供了见解。

2. 从柔环己烯在双金属表面的多个反应路径中获得的见解可以有助于优化工业过程。通过理解Pt的存在如何改变反应路径，研究人员可以定制催化剂以实现更高效的氢化反应。这可能导致化学和燃料生产的改进，可能降低成本并提高可持续性。
