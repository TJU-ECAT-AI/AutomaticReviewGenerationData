Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "Role of Strain and Ligand Effects in the Modification of the Electronic and Chemical Properties of Bimetallic Surfaces"
[2] "The electronic structure and chemical reactivity of bimetallic surfaces can be significantly influenced by strain and ligand effects."
[3] "Strain can lead to changes in the lattice parameters, altering the bond lengths and angles, which in turn affects the electronic properties of the surface."
[4] "Ligands can modify the coordination environment around the metal atoms, impacting their electronic states and thus influencing the chemical reactivity of the surface."
[5] "These modifications can affect the adsorption energies of molecules, the catalytic activities, and the selectivities in hydrogenation reactions."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of strain and ligand effects in the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is significant in understanding how these factors influence the behavior of surfaces. Strain can alter the lattice parameters, changing bond lengths and angles, which impacts the electronic properties. Ligands can modify the coordination environment around metal atoms, affecting their electronic states and chemical reactivity. These modifications can impact the adsorption energies of molecules, catalytic activities, and selectivities in hydrogenation reactions.

在理解这些因素如何影响表面行为时，双金属表面的电子和化学性质的修改由应变和配体效应的作用至关重要。应变可以改变晶格参数，改变键长和角度，从而影响表面的电子性质。配体可以改变围绕金属原子的配位环境，影响它们的电子状态和化学活性。这些修改可以影响分子的吸附能，催化活性以及氢化反应的选择性。
