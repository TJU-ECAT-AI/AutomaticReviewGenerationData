[1] "Role of Strain and Ligand Effects in the Modification of the Electronic and Chemical Properties of Bimetallic Surfaces"
[2] "The electronic structure and chemical reactivity of bimetallic surfaces can be significantly influenced by strain and ligand effects."
[3] "Strain can lead to changes in the lattice parameters, altering the bond lengths and angles, which in turn affects the electronic properties of the surface."
[4] "Ligands can modify the coordination environment around the metal atoms, impacting their electronic states and thus influencing the chemical reactivity of the surface."
[5] "These modifications can affect the adsorption energies of molecules, the catalytic activities, and the selectivities in hydrogenation reactions."

The role of strain and ligand effects in the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is significant in understanding how these factors influence the behavior of surfaces. Strain can alter the lattice parameters, changing bond lengths and angles, which impacts the electronic properties. Ligands can modify the coordination environment around metal atoms, affecting their electronic states and chemical reactivity. These modifications can impact the adsorption energies of molecules, catalytic activities, and selectivities in hydrogenation reactions.
