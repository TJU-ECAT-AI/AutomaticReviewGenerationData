The study investigates the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals within Pt3dPt (111) and Pt3dPt (100) bimetallic structures. It uses the density functional theory method to analyze the predicted stability of subsurface 3d metals in Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces upon oxygen exposure. Additionally, the research demonstrates the preparation of PtNiPt and PtCoPt subsurface structures on a Pt foil and assesses their stability under oxygen conditions.
