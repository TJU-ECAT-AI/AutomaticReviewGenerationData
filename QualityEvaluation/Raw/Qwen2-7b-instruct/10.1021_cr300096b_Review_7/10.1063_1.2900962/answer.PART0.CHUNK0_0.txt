<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study focuses on the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in specific bimetallic structures, namely Pt3dPt(111) and Pt3dPt(100). The research delves into the impact of crystal planes on both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface regions within these structures when exposed to oxygen.
