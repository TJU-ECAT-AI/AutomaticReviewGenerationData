The document focuses on the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3 d metals in platinum bimetallic structures, specifically Pt(111) and Pt(100). It employs density functional theory methods to predict the stability of subsurface 3 d metals within these structures under oxygen exposure. The study also explores how the crystal plane affects the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the stability of the subsurface regions. These findings could contribute to the understanding of catalyst behavior and improve the design of more efficient bimetallic catalysts for industrial processes.
