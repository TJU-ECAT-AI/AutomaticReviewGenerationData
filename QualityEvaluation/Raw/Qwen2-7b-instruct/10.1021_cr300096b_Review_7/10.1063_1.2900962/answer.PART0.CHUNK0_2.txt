The study focused on understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in bimetallic structures composed of platinum (Pt) and other 3d metals. The researchers employed the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method for theoretical calculations to predict the stability of the subsurface 3d metal within Pt(111) and Pt(100) structures. They also conducted experimental studies to examine the exposure of PtNiPt and PtCoPt structures to oxygen, assessing how different crystal planes affect the stability and activity of these structures in oxygen-related reactions.
