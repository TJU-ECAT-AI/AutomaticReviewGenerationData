For catalysts with a Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the Pt-first catalyst, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, demonstrated higher activity than the Ni-first catalyst, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The effect of the impregnation sequence was less significant for catalysts with a Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1. Kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene showed an increased selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. EXAFS measurements of the Pt LIII edge confirmed the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. For the 1/1 ratio catalysts, PtNi bonds were formed regardless of the impregnation sequence.
