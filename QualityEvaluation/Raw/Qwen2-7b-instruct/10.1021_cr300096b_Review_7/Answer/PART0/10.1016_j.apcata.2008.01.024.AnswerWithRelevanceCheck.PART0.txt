          [1] "The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene were used as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence."
          [2] "The primary objectives of the current paper are two-fold. The first is to extend surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts. The second objective is to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds."
          [3] "As shown in Fig. 4 a, for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the conversion of cyclohexene reached 100% after 60 min."
          [4] "In comparison, the physical and chemical probes described above demonstrate that the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is much less for the catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni)."
          [5] "The disproportionation of cyclohexene on 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 shows a higher conversion rate than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3."

          The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene serve as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence on bimetallic catalysts. The primary objectives include extending surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts and determining the impact of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. The conversion of cyclohexene reaches 100% after 60 minutes for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is less pronounced for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to the other catalysts.

          异构化环己烯和乙炔在乙烯中的氢化选择性作为探针反应，用于比较浸渍顺序对双金属催化剂的影响。主要目标包括将Pt/Ni双金属系统的研究扩展到支持的双金属催化剂，并确定浸渍顺序对双金属键形成的影响。60分钟后，1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3和1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3催化剂的环己烯转化率达到100%。对于低Ni负载（0.5 wt.% Ni）的催化剂，浸渍顺序对形成PtNi双金属键有显著影响，而对于更高Ni负载（1.5 wt.% Ni）的催化剂，这种影响较弱。1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂在环己烯异构化反应中的转化率高于其他催化剂。

          [10] "Kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene revealed an increase in the acetylene hydrogenation selectivity for 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 as compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3."
          [11] "Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements of the Pt LIII edge indicated that PtNi bimetallic bonds were formed in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3."
          [12] "The PtNi bonds were formed for the 1/1 ratio catalysts with both impregnation sequences."

          For catalysts with a Pt/Ni ratio of 3/1, the Pt-first catalyst, 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3, demonstrated higher activity than the Ni-first catalyst, 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. The effect of the impregnation sequence was less significant for catalysts with a Pt/Ni ratio of 1/1. Kinetic analysis of the selective hydrogenation of acetylene in ethylene showed an increased selectivity for acetylene hydrogenation on the 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst compared to both 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 and monometallic 1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. EXAFS measurements of the Pt LIII edge confirmed the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds in 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 but not in 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3. For the 1/1 ratio catalysts, PtNi bonds were formed regardless of the impregnation sequence.

          对于Pt/Ni比例为3/1的催化剂，先浸渍Pt的催化剂1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3的活性高于先浸渍Ni的催化剂1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3。对于Pt/Ni比例为1/1的催化剂，浸渍顺序的影响较小。乙炔在乙烯中的选择性氢化动力学分析表明，与1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3和单金属1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂相比，1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂上的乙炔氢化选择性有所增加。对Pt LIII边缘的EXAFS测量证实了1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3中形成了PtNi双金属键，但1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3中未形成。对于1/1比例的催化剂，无论浸渍顺序如何，都形成了PtNi键。
