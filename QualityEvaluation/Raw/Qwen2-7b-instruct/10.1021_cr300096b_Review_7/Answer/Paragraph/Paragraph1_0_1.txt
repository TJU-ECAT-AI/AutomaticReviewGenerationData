The versatility of cyclohexene as a probe molecule for hydrogenation reactions, enabled by its unique structural properties, facilitates the exploration of various reaction pathways, critical for understanding the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. The use of cyclohexene as a probe molecule allows researchers to gain insights into how bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt/Ni systems, affect the rate of hydrogen absorption, product distribution, and overall efficiency in industrial settings. The role of strain and ligand effects in modifying the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is significant, impacting the surface's behavior through changes in lattice parameters and coordination environments, which in turn affect adsorption energies, catalytic activities, and selectivities in hydrogenation reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) provides a powerful tool for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies, offering insights into the reactivity trends across different transition metals and their applications in sulfide and oxide catalysts.

            The utilization of cyclohexene as an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions, with emphasis on its industrial relevance, multiple reaction pathways, and its role in elucidating the effects of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity, opens avenues for optimizing industrial processes and advancing catalysis technology. The findings underscore the importance of considering factors such as impregnation sequence, bimetallic bond formation, and the influence of metal loading on catalyst performance.
