Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/s0169-4332(01)00540-2\], \[10.1103/physrevlett.93.156801\], and \[10.1016/s0360-0564(02)45013-4\]. Cyclohexene, a versatile molecule, serves as an ideal probe for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its unique structural properties. It enables the investigation of various reaction pathways, allowing researchers to explore the influence of different factors, including bimetallic catalysts, on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By examining the outcomes of hydrogenation reactions on cyclohexene, scientists can gain insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect the rate of hydrogen absorption, product distribution, and overall efficiency in industrial processes. 

        The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene serve as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence on bimetallic catalysts. The primary objectives include extending surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts and determining the impact of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. For catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), the impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds, whereas this effect is less pronounced for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to the other catalysts, highlighting the importance of the impregnation sequence and Ni loading on the catalyst's performance.

        The role of strain and ligand effects in the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is significant. Strain can alter the lattice parameters, changing bond lengths and angles, which impacts the electronic properties of the surface. Ligands can modify the coordination environment around metal atoms, affecting their electronic states and chemical reactivity. These modifications can impact the adsorption energies of molecules, catalytic activities, and selectivities in hydrogenation reactions.

        The application of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions. This methodology allows for understanding and predicting variations in reactivity across different transition metals, the impact of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates on reactivity. While the focus is primarily on transition metal surfaces, the computational approach and conceptual framework developed to elucidate reactivity trends in metals can also be applied to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

        The utilization of cyclohexene as an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions, with emphasis on its industrial relevance, multiple reaction pathways, and its role in elucidating the effects of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity, provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies that leverage the insights gained from the study of cyclohexene and bimetallic catalysts to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of industrial hydrogenation processes.
        
        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research might delve into the development of novel bimetallic catalysts with enhanced selectivity and activity through optimized impregnation sequences. Additionally, leveraging the principles of strain and ligand effects could lead to the design of surfaces with tailored electronic properties, further improving hydrogenation efficiency. Furthermore, the integration of DFT calculations with experimental methods could provide a more holistic approach to understanding the complex interplay between catalyst structure, reactivity, and product distribution. Future studies might also aim to apply these insights to the optimization of industrial processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, towards more sustainable and efficient energy production methods.

Cyclohexene, due to its unique structural properties, acts as an ideal probe for studying hydrogenation reactions, providing insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts such as Pt and Ni on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The multiple reaction pathways available for cyclohexene under hydrogenation conditions enable researchers to explore the effects of various factors, including the impregnation sequence, on the formation of bimetallic bonds. As shown in Fig. 4a, the conversion of cyclohexene reaches 100% after 60 minutes for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is less pronounced for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni).
