Ligands can modify the coordination environment around the metal atoms, impacting their electronic states and thus influencing the chemical reactivity of the surface. These modifications can affect the adsorption energies of molecules, the catalytic activities, and the selectivities in hydrogenation reactions.

            The application of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions. This methodology allows for understanding and predicting variations in reactivity across different transition metals, the impact of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates on reactivity. While the focus is primarily on transition metal surfaces, the computational approach and conceptual framework developed to elucidate reactivity trends in metals can also be applied to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

            The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene serve as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence on bimetallic catalysts. The primary objectives include extending surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts and determining the impact of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. The conversion of cyclohexene reaches 100% after 60 minutes for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is less pronounced for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to the other catalysts.

            In conclusion, the utilization of cyclohexene as an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions provides profound insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, such as the integration of advanced computational tools and the optimization of catalyst design to enhance hydrogenation efficiency and selectivity in industrial processes.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/s0169-4332(01)00540-2\] and \[10.1103/physrevlett.93.156801\]. The application of density functional theory (DFT) as a tool for understanding adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies in surface chemical reactions is reviewed in reference \[10.1016/s0360-0564(02)45013-4\], with a particular emphasis on how this approach can elucidate trends in reactivity across different transition metals and the impact of alloying, surface structure, and adsorbate interactions on catalytic activity.

            The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene serve as critical probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence on bimetallic catalysts. The primary objectives of the current paper, as outlined in reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\], are to extend surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts and to determine the effect of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds.

            As shown in Fig. 4a, for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, the conversion of cyclohexene reached 100% after 60 minutes, highlighting the effectiveness of these catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of the PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is much less pronounced for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). This finding underscores the importance of impregnation sequence in the synthesis of efficient bimetallic catalysts.

            The disproportionation of cyclohexene on 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 shows a higher conversion rate than either 1Pt-1/3Ni/γ-Al2O3 or 1Pt/γ-Al2O3, suggesting that the synergy between the two metals plays a crucial role in enhancing hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

            By examining the outcomes of hydrogenation reactions on cyclohexene, scientists can gain insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect the rate of hydrogen absorption, product distribution, and overall efficiency in industrial processes, as detailed in references \[10.1016/s0169-4332(01)00540-2\] and \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\].

            The role of strain and ligand effects in the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is significant in understanding how these factors influence the behavior of surfaces, as explored in reference \[10.1103/physrevlett.93.156801\]. Strain can alter the lattice parameters, changing bond lengths and angles, which impacts the electronic properties. Ligands can modify the coordination environment around metal atoms, affecting their electronic states and chemical reactivity. These modifications can impact the adsorption energies of molecules, catalytic activities, and selectivities in hydrogenation reactions.

            The application of DFT is reviewed for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions, providing a powerful tool for predicting reactivity trends and understanding the complex interactions in bimetallic catalysts. While the focus is primarily on transition metal surfaces, the computational approach and conceptual framework developed to elucidate reactivity trends in metals can also be applied to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

            The integration of these findings offers a comprehensive understanding of how cyclohexene can serve as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions, with emphasis on its industrial relevance, multiple reaction pathways, and its role in elucidating the effects of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This knowledge paves the way for the development of more efficient and selective hydrogenation catalysts, which are essential for the optimization of industrial processes.
