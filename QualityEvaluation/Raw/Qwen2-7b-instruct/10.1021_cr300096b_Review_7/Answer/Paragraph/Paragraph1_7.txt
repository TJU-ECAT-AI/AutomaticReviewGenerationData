            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2008.01.024\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/s0169-4332(01)00540-2\], \[10.1103/physrevlett.93.156801\], and \[10.1016/s0360-0564(02)45013-4\]. Cyclohexene, as a versatile molecule, acts as an ideal probe for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its unique structural properties. The multiple reaction pathways available for cyclohexene under hydrogenation conditions allow researchers to explore the influence of different factors, including bimetallic catalysts, on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By examining the outcomes of hydrogenation reactions on cyclohexene, scientists can gain insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect the rate of hydrogen absorption, product distribution, and overall efficiency in industrial processes.

            The electronic structure and chemical reactivity of bimetallic surfaces can be significantly influenced by strain and ligand effects. Strain can lead to changes in the lattice parameters, altering the bond lengths and angles, which in turn affects the electronic properties of the surface. Ligands can modify the coordination environment around the metal atoms, impacting their electronic states and thus influencing the chemical reactivity of the surface. These modifications can affect the adsorption energies of molecules, the catalytic activities, and the selectivities in hydrogenation reactions.

            The application of density functional theory (DFT) is reviewed for calculating adsorption properties, reaction pathways, and activation energies for surface chemical reactions. This methodology allows for understanding and predicting variations in reactivity across different transition metals, the impact of alloying, surface structure, and interactions between adsorbates on reactivity. While the focus is primarily on transition metal surfaces, the computational approach and conceptual framework developed to elucidate reactivity trends in metals can also be applied to sulfide and oxide catalysts.

            The disproportionation activity of cyclohexene and the hydrogenation selectivity of acetylene in ethylene serve as probe reactions to compare the effect of the impregnation sequence on bimetallic catalysts. The primary objectives include extending surface science studies of Pt/Ni bimetallic systems to supported bimetallic catalysts and determining the impact of impregnation sequence on the formation of bimetallic bonds. The conversion of cyclohexene reaches 100% after 60 minutes for the 1Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 1Pt-1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The impregnation sequence has a significant effect on the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds for catalysts with low Ni loading (0.5 wt.% Ni), while the effect is less pronounced for catalysts with higher Ni loading (1.5 wt.% Ni). The 1/3Ni-1Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher conversion rate for the disproportionation of cyclohexene compared to the other catalysts.

            In conclusion, the utilization of cyclohexene as an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions provides profound insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, such as the integration of advanced computational tools and the optimization of catalyst design to enhance hydrogenation efficiency and selectivity in industrial processes.

            双金属表面的电子结构和化学反应性可以显著受到应力和配体效应的影响。应力可以导致晶格参数的变化，改变键长和角度，进而影响表面的电子性质。配体可以修改金属原子周围的配位环境，影响它们的电子状态，从而影响表面的化学反应性。这些修改可以影响分子的吸附能、催化活性和氢化反应的选择性。

            密度泛函理论（DFT）被用于计算表面化学反应的吸附性质、反应途径和活化能。这种方法允许理解和预测不同过渡金属的反应性变化，以及合金化、表面结构和吸附剂之间相互作用对反应性的影响。虽然主要关注的是过渡金属表面，但计算方法和阐述金属反应性趋势的概念框架也可以应用于硫化物和氧化物催化剂。

            总之，使用环己烯作为理想探针分子来研究氢化反应，为理解双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性的影响提供了深刻的见解。未来的研究努力可能集中在探索新兴领域和创新方法，如高级计算工具的整合和催化剂设计优化，以提高工业过程中的氢化效率和选择性。
