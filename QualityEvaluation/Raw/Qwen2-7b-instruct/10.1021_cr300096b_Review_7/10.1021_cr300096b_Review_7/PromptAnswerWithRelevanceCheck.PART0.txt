"Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."
"DFT calculations were performed to estimate the values of hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on several 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces."
"The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE."
"In general, the addition of a 3d metal surface layer on Pt(111) moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level compared to that of the bulk 3d metals."
"Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on a Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."
"The hydrogenation rate constants were determined to be 1.7, 21, and 24 min1 for Pt/γ-Al2O3, PtCo/γ-Al2O3, and PtNi/γ-Al2O3, respectively."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it is a cyclic hydrocarbon that acts as an important reaction intermediate in various industrial processes and is used as a building block for many chemical products. Its multiple reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts affect hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) of cyclohexene typically follows the same trend as the HBE of other molecules on different surfaces. The addition of a 3d metal layer on a Pt(111) surface tends to move the d-band center closer to the Fermi level compared to bulk 3d metals. By depositing monolayer Ni on a Pt foil and annealing it to higher temperatures, a PtNiPt subsurface structure can be created. The rate constants for hydrogenating cyclohexene over supported catalysts follow a consistent pattern: PtNi > PtCo > Pt, which is consistent with the volcano curve for hydrogenation activity.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它在许多炼油和石油化工过程中作为重要反应中间体，并且是许多化学产品中的构建块。它的多个反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、过氧化和氢化，提供了关于双金属催化剂如何影响氢化活性和选择性的见解。环己烯的氢结合能（HBE）通常与不同表面其他分子的HBE遵循相同的趋势。在Pt(111)表面上添加3d金属层往往会将d带中心推向费米能级附近，与块状3d金属相比。通过在Pt箔上沉积单层Ni并在较高温度下退火，可以创建PtNiPt亚表面结构。在支持催化剂上氢化环己烯的速率常数遵循一致的模式：PtNi > PtCo > Pt，这与氢化活性的火山曲线一致。

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it acts as an important reaction intermediate in various industrial processes and is a building block for numerous chemicals. Its multiple reaction pathways offer insights into how the formation of bimetallic bonds influences hydrogenation activity and selectivity. DFT calculations have been utilized to estimate hydrogen-binding energy values on different surfaces, revealing that cyclohexene binds more weakly on Pt3dPt(111) surfaces compared to Pt(111) surfaces. This trend in binding energy is consistent across various surfaces, indicating the potential of subsurface structures for enhancing hydrogenation activity at lower temperatures.
