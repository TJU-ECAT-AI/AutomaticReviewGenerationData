Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it acts as an important reaction intermediate in various industrial processes and is a building block for numerous chemicals. Its multiple reaction pathways offer insights into how the formation of bimetallic bonds influences hydrogenation activity and selectivity. DFT calculations have been utilized to estimate hydrogen-binding energy values on different surfaces, revealing that cyclohexene binds more weakly on Pt3dPt(111) surfaces compared to Pt(111) surfaces. This trend in binding energy is consistent across various surfaces, indicating the potential of subsurface structures for enhancing hydrogenation activity at lower temperatures.
