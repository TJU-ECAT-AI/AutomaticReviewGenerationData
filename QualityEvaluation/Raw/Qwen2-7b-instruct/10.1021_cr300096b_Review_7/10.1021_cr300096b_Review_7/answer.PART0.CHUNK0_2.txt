4.1.1.1 Example: Cyclohexene Hydrogenation on Pt3d Catalysts
"Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."
"DFT and UHV Studies on Single-Crystal 3d/Pt(111) Surfaces"
"To facilitate the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene, one hypothesis is that an effective catalyst should bond relatively weakly to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene."
