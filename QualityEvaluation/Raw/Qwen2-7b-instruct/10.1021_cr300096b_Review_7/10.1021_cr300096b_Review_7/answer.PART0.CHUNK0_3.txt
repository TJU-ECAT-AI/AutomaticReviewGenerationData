"Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."
"DFT calculations were performed to estimate the values of hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on several 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces."
"The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE."
"As shown in Figure 10b, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding 3dPtPt(111) surface structures."
"Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on a Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure."
"Characterization of the catalysts by a variety of techniques, including EXAFS, confirms the formation of Pt3d bimetallic bonds."
"The hydrogenation rate constants were determined to be 1.7, 21, and 24 min1 for Pt/γ-Al2O3, PtCo/γ-Al2O3, and PtNi/γ-Al2O3, respectively."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it is an important reaction intermediate in refinery and petrochemical processes and acts as a building block for various chemicals. Its multiple reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, offer insights into how bimetallic catalysts impact hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Comparative studies of these pathways allow researchers to determine the influence of bimetallic bonds on the efficiency and specificity of hydrogenation processes.
