[1] "The morphology of the surface following Ag deposition on a Pt(1 0 0)-hex substrate is described and discussed below."
[2] "The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction."
[3] "This is in good agreement with STM images if one assumes that Pt is imaged darker."
[4] "Furthermore, the island shape implies that Ag adatoms are less likely to attach themselves to the edges of the islands as long the underlying substrate is reconstructed."
[5] "Anisotropic diffusion of adatoms along diffusion channels parallel to the adislands may enhance their anistropic shape."
[6] "However, the surfaces shown in Fig. 5 exhibit depressions that often have an elongated shape and are separated by monatomic steps."
[7] "We explain the shape of these structures as a consequence of the spreading and alloying of Ag from the adislands described above."
[8] "For low initial Ag coverages, no significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating that there is no substantial Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures."
[9] "This process is reversible upon cooling of the sample."
[10] "Consequently, Ag diffuses into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal and the Ag AES-signal decreases with increasing temperature."

1. The surface morphology following silver deposition on a Pt(1 0 0)-hex substrate is described in detail, highlighting the anisotropic shapes of the islands, which are elongated along the rows of the hex-reconstruction.
2. The islands' strong anisotropic shapes are further explained, suggesting that the attachment of silver adatoms is less likely at the edges when the underlying substrate is reconstructed.
3. The elongated shape of the structures seen in Figure 5 is explained as a result of the spreading and alloying of silver from the islands onto the substrate.
4. At low initial silver coverages, there is no significant change in the Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) signal, indicating that silver does not diffuse into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.
5. The process of silver diffusion into the subsurface region of the Pt crystal, causing a decrease in the AES signal, is reversible upon cooling.

1. 在沉积银后，Pt(1 0 0)-hex基底上的表面形态被详细描述，突出岛屿的各向异性形状，这些形状沿着六边形重构的行呈长条状。
2. 岛屿的强烈各向异性形状进一步解释为，银原子附着在重构基底边缘的可能性较小。
3. 图5中显示结构的长条状形状被解释为银从岛屿扩散到基底的结果。
4. 对于低初始银覆盖度，AES信号没有显著变化，表明即使在高温下，银也不会扩散到基底的亚表面区域。
5. 随着温度升高，银扩散到Pt晶体的亚表面区域并导致AES信号降低的过程是可逆的，在冷却后可以恢复。
