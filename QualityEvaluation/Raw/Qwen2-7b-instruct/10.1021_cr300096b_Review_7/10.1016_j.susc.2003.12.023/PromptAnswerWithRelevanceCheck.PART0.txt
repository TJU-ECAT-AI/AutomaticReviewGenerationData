[1] "Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction."
[2] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."
[3] "Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region."

1. The initial growth of silver on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface at room temperature is significantly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. The growth forms elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction.

2. When the sample is annealed above 600 K, a nanophasic AgPt alloy forms. This process begins at the edge of the silver islands and spreads across the surface by exchanging silver from the islands with platinum from the lower terraces.

3. Two diffusion processes are suggested to explain the change in the AES signal when the sample temperature is altered: (i) a reversible site exchange between silver and platinum in the first and second layers, respectively, and (ii) bulk diffusion of silver through vacancies in the subsurface region.

<p>Experiments were performed in an UHV chamber that was equipped with a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, rear-view low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), homebuilt single-piezo-tube STM, ion-gun for sample cleaning, resistively heated Ag-evaporation source, and precision-leak valves for gas dosing [22] .</p>
<p>The Pt(1 0 0) single crystal was cleaned by standard procedures consisting of cycles of 500-eV Ar+-ion sputtering and annealing to 1200 K followed by annealing at 1000 K in 5 × 107-Torr O2 to remove carbon, and finally, annealing to 1200 K in vacuum.</p>
<p>STM images after the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface reveal extended 2D islands, as shown in Fig. 1 . These islands are separated by the hex-reconstructed Pt substrate. The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the islands preferentially terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Once islands are nucleated, they grow relatively easily along the rows of the reconstruction. Anisotropic diffusion of adatoms along diffusion channels parallel to the adislands may enhance their anistropic shape. If these diffusion channels, defined by the reconstruction of the substrate, are too far away from the edges of the adislands lateral sticking of adatoms to the islands is prevented.</p>
<p>Annealing of submonolayer-Ag deposits on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface to 600 K for 10 s results in a change of the surface morphology compared to that obtained following deposition. STM images characterizing such annealed surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3 . The islands are still clearly visible, however, the island edges are no longer as straight as they were after room temperature growth.</p>
<p>We explain the shape of these structures as a consequence of the spreading and alloying of Ag from the adislands described above. Although Ag from the adislands is used up to form an alloy on the Pt terraces, the adislands do not decrease in size, because Ag atoms from the islands are replaced by Pt that was expelled out of the substrate upon alloy formation.</p>
<p>For 1-ML Ag coverage, the Ag-AES signal was temperature dependent and changed almost reversibly with heating and cooling of the sample. This and the faster diffusion at 800 K compared to 600 K can be explained by proposing two processes. We propose that Ag and Pt in the first and second layers can undergo place exchange at relatively low temperatures, and this may be a fast process so that the surface adjusts to a new equilibrium composition quickly after a temperature change and does not change significantly with time if the temperature is constant.</p>

The experiments utilized various instruments including AES, LEED optics, TPD, STM, ion guns, and precision leak valves. The Pt(1 0 0) crystal was cleaned through a series of steps involving ion sputtering and annealing. STM images revealed that Ag deposition led to the formation of 2D islands with anisotropic shapes along the hex-reconstruction. The islands tended to terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction. Annealing at 600 K caused the islands' edges to lose their straightness and spread across the surface, forming a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The AES signal was temperature-dependent, indicating that Ag and Pt underwent place exchange at low temperatures, adjusting the surface composition quickly upon temperature changes. This process was reversible upon cooling, and diffusion deeper into the bulk occurred at higher temperatures.

实验使用了包括AES、LEED光学、TPD、STM、离子枪和精密漏气阀在内的各种仪器。对Pt(1 0 0)晶体进行了系列清洁步骤，包括离子溅射和退火。STM图像显示，Ag沉积导致形成沿着六边形重建的具有各向异性的二维岛屿形状。岛屿倾向于终止在重建的凹槽上。在600 K下退火使岛屿边缘失去直度，并在整个表面上扩散，形成纳米相的AgPt合金。AES信号随温度变化而变化，表明在低温下Ag和Pt进行了位交换，快速调整表面组成以适应温度变化，并且在温度保持恒定时不会发生显著变化。这个过程在冷却时可逆，而在较高温度下，Ag向基体内部的扩散则发生。

The growth of silver on the Pt(1 0 0) surface at room temperature leads to the formation of elongated 2D islands with a stoichiometry of Ag80Pt20. This is due to the expulsion of Pt atoms from the surface as the hex-reconstruction is lifted by the growing Ag islands. The islands grow along the rows of the hex-reconstruction, indicating an anisotropic stability of the reconstruction. At higher temperatures, annealing causes the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy that spreads across the surface, leading to a uniform stoichiometry. AES studies suggest that there is mixing of Ag with the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.
