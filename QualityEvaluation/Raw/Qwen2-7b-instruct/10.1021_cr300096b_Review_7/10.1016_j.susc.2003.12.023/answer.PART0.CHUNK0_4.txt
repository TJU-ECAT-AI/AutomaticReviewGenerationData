1. At 300 K, the formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed, which is governed by the amount of Pt expelled due to the removal of the hex-reconstruction of the clean Pt(1 0 0) surface by the growing Ag adislands.
2. The shape of the islands can be explained by the anisotropic stability of the reconstruction, with the row pattern of the reconstruction serving as a template for island growth.
3. When the sample is annealed above 600 K, more extensive alloying begins at the perimeter of the Ag adislands through AgPt exchange, leading to the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer.
4. There is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.

1. 在300K时，观察到形成具有Ag80Pt20组成的延伸二维岛屿，这种岛屿组成由生长的Ag岛屿排出的Pt量决定。
2. 岛屿形状可以解释为重构的各向异性稳定性，重构的行模式作为岛屿生长的模板。
3. 当样品在高于600K的温度下退火时，在Ag岛屿边缘处开始更广泛的合金化，通过AgPt交换形成局限于表面层的纳米相态AgPt合金。
4. 在较高温度下存在Ag与基体Pt的一些混合。
