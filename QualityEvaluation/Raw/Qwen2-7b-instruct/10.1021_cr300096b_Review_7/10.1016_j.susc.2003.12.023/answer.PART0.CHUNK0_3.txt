<p>At 300 K, formation of elongated 2D-adislands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 was observed. This island stoichiometry is dictated by the amount of Pt expelled due to removal of the hex-reconstruction of the clean Pt(1 0 0) surface by the growing Ag adislands.</p>
<p>The island shape can be explained by an anisotropic stability of the reconstruction, with the row pattern of the reconstruction acting as a template for island growth.</p>
<p>Annealing of the sample above 600 K causes more extensive alloying starting at the perimeter of the Ag adislands by AgPt exchange and formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy confined to the surface layer.</p>
<p>With sufficient Ag, this alloy spreads across the surface until a uniform stoichiometry is established over the entire surface.</p>
<p>Temperature-dependent AES studies indicate that there is some mixing of Ag with bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.</p>

The growth of silver on the Pt(1 0 0) surface at room temperature leads to the formation of elongated 2D islands with a stoichiometry of Ag80Pt20. This is due to the expulsion of Pt atoms from the surface as the hex-reconstruction is lifted by the growing Ag islands. The islands grow along the rows of the hex-reconstruction, indicating an anisotropic stability of the reconstruction. At higher temperatures, annealing causes the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy that spreads across the surface, leading to a uniform stoichiometry. AES studies suggest that there is mixing of Ag with the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures.

在室温下，银在Pt(1 0 0)表面的生长导致形成沿六边形重建行排列的长2D岛屿，其组成比例为Ag80Pt20。这是由于随着银岛屿的生长，六边形重建被从表面上排出的Pt原子所提升。岛屿沿着重建的行生长，表明重建的各向异性稳定性。在较高温度下，退火会导致形成一种纳米相态的AgPt合金，在表面层内扩散，最终在整个表面形成均匀的组成。AES研究显示，在较高温度下，Ag与基体Pt之间存在混合。
