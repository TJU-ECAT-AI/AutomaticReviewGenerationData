[1] "Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction."
[2] "Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces."
[3] "Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region."

1. The initial growth of silver on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface at room temperature is significantly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. The growth forms elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction.

2. When the sample is annealed above 600 K, a nanophasic AgPt alloy forms. This process begins at the edge of the silver islands and spreads across the surface by exchanging silver from the islands with platinum from the lower terraces.

3. Two diffusion processes are suggested to explain the change in the AES signal when the sample temperature is altered: (i) a reversible site exchange between silver and platinum in the first and second layers, respectively, and (ii) bulk diffusion of silver through vacancies in the subsurface region.

1. 在室温下，银在Pt(1 0 0)-hex表面的初始生长明显受到Pt晶体表面重构的影响。生长形成沿着六边形重构行的长条结构。

2. 当样本被加热到高于600 K时，会形成一种纳米相态的AgPt合金。此过程从银岛的边缘开始，并在整个表面上通过将岛上的银与相邻较低台阶上的铂交换而扩散。

3. 提出了两种解释样本温度改变时AES信号变化的过程：（i）银和铂在第一和第二层之间的可逆位点交换，分别；（ii）通过空位在亚表面区域中扩散银的高能激活过程。
