1. The intermetallic compound PdZn exists in two forms: a tetragonal CuAu-type at low temperatures and a cubic CsCl-type at high temperatures. 
2. Calculations of the total energy indicate that the cubic structure is excluded at the equiatomic composition in the Zn-Pd system. 
3. The chemical bonding analysis using electron localizability supports the formula ZnPd over PdZn, highlighting charge transfer from zinc to palladium.
4. In cubic ZnPd, the direct PdPd bonding in the (001) plane is identified as the primary cause for the tetragonal distortion.
5. The tetragonal structure in ZnPd is characterized by significant structuring of the penultimate shell of palladium in the (001) plane, which contrasts with weaker structuring in the (100) plane.

1.PdZn的相变在低温下为四角CuAu型，在高温下为立方CsCl型。
2. 总能量计算表明，在Zn-Pd系统中，等原子比下的立方结构被排除在外。
3. 使用电子局部化分析化学键，支持ZnPd而非PdZn的公式，强调锌到钯的电荷转移。
4. 在立方ZnPd中，(001)平面内的直接PdPd键是导致立方结构四角扭曲的主要原因。
5.ZnPd中的四角结构在钯的(001)平面中显著地结构化其末尾壳层，而(100)平面中的结构则较弱。
