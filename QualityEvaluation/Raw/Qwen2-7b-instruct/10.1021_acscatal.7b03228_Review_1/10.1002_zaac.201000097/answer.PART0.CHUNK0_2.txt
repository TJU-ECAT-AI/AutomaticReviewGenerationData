[1] "The existence of the cubic high-temperature phase of equia- tomic composition in the binary system Pd-Zn could not be proven experimentally and remains uncertain."
[2] "Analysis of the chemical bonding applying the electron localizability approach revealed the charge transfer from zinc to palladium, thus justifying the formula ZnPd instead of PdZn."

1. The cubic high-temperature phase at the equiatomic composition in the binary system Pd-Zn cannot be confirmed experimentally, and its existence remains uncertain.
2. By applying the electron localizability approach, it was found that charge transfer occurs from zinc to palladium, validating the formula ZnPd over PdZn.
3. Direct interactions between palladium atoms in the (001) plane are identified as the primary cause for the tetragonal distortion in cubic ZnPd.

1. 在二元体系Pd-Zn中，等原子组成下的立方高温相的实验验证尚未成功，其存在性仍存在疑问。
2. 通过应用电子局部化方法分析化学键，发现锌向钯的电荷转移，这证实了ZnPd的化学式而非PdZn。
3. 在立方ZnPd中，钯原子在（001）平面内的直接相互作用被确认为导致四面体畸变的主要原因。
