<p>The tetragonal distortion of the CsCl type of structure towards the CuAu type of structure has been subject of debate over several decades.</p>
<p>Johansson and Linde were the first to explain the tetragonal lattice of CuAu by ascribing the distortion to the different atomic radii of copper and gold.</p>
<p>Schu bert showed that the ratio of the atomic radii does not linearly correlate with the ratio of the axes.</p>
<p>The argument, that the tetragonal lattice is formed due to favored heteroatomic interactions like in tetragonal NiZn (one nickel atom is surrounded by eight zinc atoms, but only by four nickel atoms), was rejected by comparison to PtCu. The latter is not distorted tetragonally, it is slightly rhombohedral; every atom is surrounded by six atoms of each kind.</p>
<p>Dehlinger suggested another driving force for the distortion. The tetragonal lattice results in new Brillouin zones leading to additional Bragg reflections. Since these allow accommodating electrons in an energetically favorable way, the Fermi energy is decreased by the distortion.</p>
<p>Analysis of the chemical bonding applying the electron localizability approach reveals charge transfer from zinc to palladium and proves direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane to be the main reason for the tetragonal distortion of the cubic CsCl-type structural pattern for ZnPd.</p>
<p>In tetragonal ZnPd, this local peak close to the Fermi energy splits into two smaller peaks at 1 eV and +0.5 eV, respectively. This change in the electronic structure suggests a Peierls-like distortion stabilizing the tetragonal structure in ZnPd.</p>
<p>For both structures, the distribution of ELI-D in the inner shells (especially the penultimate one) around the zinc nuclei is very close to spherical. The basins of the ELI attractors in the valence region are multi-synaptic implying multi-center ZnPd bonding interactions.</p>
<p>In contrast to zinc, in the tetragonal structure the penultimate shell of palladium is significantly structured in the (001) plane compared to weaker structuring in the (100) plane.</p>
<p>In cubic ZnPd, the structuring is less pronounced as illustrated by the structuring index (the difference between the highest ELI-D value in the examined shell and the ELI-D value at which the localization domain is without a hole).</p>

The tetragonal distortion of the cubic crystal structure is primarily driven by charge transfer from zinc to palladium and direct PdPd bonding interactions in the (001) plane. These interactions lead to a stabilization of the tetragonal structure in ZnPd, rather than the more isotropic CsCl-type structure. The Fermi energy is decreased due to the additional Bragg reflections and the formation of new Brillouin zones caused by the tetragonal lattice. The electron localizability indicator (ELI) analysis reveals the importance of these interactions in the formation of the tetragonal structure in ZnPd.

在ZnPd中，四角畸变主要是由锌到钯的电荷转移和钯钯在（001）平面内的直接键合相互作用驱动的。这些相互作用导致ZnPd的四角结构稳定化，而不是更各向同性的CsCl型结构。费米能级由于四角晶格中额外的布拉格反射和形成的新的布里渊区而降低。电子局部化指标（ELI）分析揭示了这些相互作用在ZnPd形成四角结构中的重要性。
