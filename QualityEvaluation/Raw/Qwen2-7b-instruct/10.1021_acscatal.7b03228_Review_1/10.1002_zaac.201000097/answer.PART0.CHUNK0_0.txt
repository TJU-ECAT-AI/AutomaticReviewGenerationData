1. The intermetallic compound PdZn exists in two forms: a tetragonal CuAu-type phase at lower temperatures and a cubic CsCl-type phase at higher temperatures. The cubic phase at equiatomic composition has not been proven experimentally. 
2. The tetragonal distortion of the cubic CsCl-type structure in ZnPd is primarily driven by the charge transfer from zinc to palladium and direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane.
3. The electron localizability indicator analysis provides insight into the tetragonal distortion mechanisms in ZnPd, highlighting the importance of zinc-palladium interactions and PdPd bonding.

1. 铂锌合金化合物在低温下以四方的库尔特型相态存在，在高温下则为立方的CsCl型相态。在等原子组成下的立方相态未能通过实验验证。
2. 在ZnPd的立方CsCl型结构中，四面体扭曲的主要原因是锌到铂的电荷转移以及（001）平面内的直接铂-铂相互作用。
3. 电子局部化指标分析揭示了ZnPd中四面体扭曲的机制，强调了锌-铂相互作用和铂-铂键的重要性。
