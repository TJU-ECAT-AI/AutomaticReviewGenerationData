The intermetallic compound PdZn was studied for its tetragonal distortion from the cubic CsCl structure to resemble the CuAu structure. The existence of the cubic high-temperature phase at the equiatomic composition was not experimentally proven. Through calculations of total energy, it was found that the minimum energy occurred at a c/a ratio of 1.155, clearly excluding the cubic structure at the equiatomic composition. Analysis of chemical bonding using the electron localizability approach showed charge transfer from zinc to palladium, supporting the formula ZnPd instead of PdZn. The direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane were identified as the primary reason for the tetragonal distortion of cubic ZnPd.

对PdZn相变的争论持续了几十年，从立方CsCl结构向CuAu结构的四面体畸变。无法在实验上证明等原子组成下的立方高温相存在。通过总能量计算发现，最小能量发生在c/a比率为1.155时，清楚地排除了等原子组成下的立方结构。通过使用电子局部化方法分析化学键，发现锌向钯的电荷转移，支持使用ZnPd而不是PdZn的公式。在立方ZnPd中，直接PdPd相互作用在（001）平面内被确定为主要原因导致四面体畸变。
