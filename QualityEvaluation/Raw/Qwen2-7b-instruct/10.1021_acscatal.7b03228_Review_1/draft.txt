1. Single-atom alloys as a geometric approach for enhanced catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions: design principles, advantages, and applications

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/acscatal.7b00482]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/jp5001418], [10.1021/cs300031d], and [10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b01357]. The development of single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, has led to improved catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic structure and precise atom distribution. When designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, it is crucial to optimize reaction conditions, choose suitable metal properties, and ensure that these catalysts offer specific advantages over traditional catalysts. This includes their capability to surpass conventional scaling rules and enhance selectivity in a wide range of catalyst systems. The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds; instead, gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals due to the unique properties related to the filling of antibonding states and the degree of orbital overlap with adsorbates. Such changes in adsorbate configuration can have profound effects on what reactions may occur, including weakening the binding energy of adsorbates to promote desorption before further dehydrogenation, thus breaking from conventional scaling rules and allowing for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include maintaining mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion, avoiding reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can exploit the unique geometric sites created by the SAA. Modifiers must be thermally stable and robust to air/water to ensure optimal performance. This approach often leads to increased selectivity and improved performance across various catalyst systems. In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. deposited 0.01 ML (monolayer) and 0.1 ML of Pd on a Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into a Cu (111) surface, demonstrating the critical ensemble size for a given adsorption or reaction event.
