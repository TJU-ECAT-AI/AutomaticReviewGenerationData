[1] "The use of gold catalysts for hydrogenation reactions has encountered a growing interest in the recent past years. The high selectivity to partially hydrogenated products attested by gold cat- alysts in the hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes is indeed remarkable [1] and reference therein."
[2] "We had also previously reported that 100% selectivity in partial hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene to p- chloroaniline could be obtained using similar AuPd/Al2O3 catalysts with high Au/Pd atomic ratio (P20)."
[3] "The DPU method appeared more efficient than the IES method to obtain reproducible and homogeneous bimetallic and small nanoparticles."
[4] "Note that the determination of the bimetallic character of particles containing atomic metal ra- tios far from 1 is not facile. EDX or XAFS is hardly usable."
[5] "The spectra can be divided into two carbonyl regions, at high frequency (2150 2000 cm1) and low frequency (20001800 cm1)."
[6] "Indeed, the spectra of DP and PVAAuPd(20)/Al2O3 evolve with time on CO/He stream (Fig. 6a and b) (the same trend was also observed for the THPC AuPd/Al2O3 sample); the band of CO adsorbed on gold decreases in intensity, whereas the ones of linear and bridging CO (not visible on the PVA sample) adsorbed on Pd increase."
[7] "As for the monometallic gold samples, the PVAAuPd/Al2O3 catalyst, which possesses the largest particles, is the least active one,"
[8] "The absence of influence of alumina and titania supports on the catalytic results can be correlated to the DRIFT spectra,which are also comparable for the two types of samples (Fig. 7II)."
[9] "The larger particles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts,"
[10] "DRIFTS also showed that the surface composition of the AuPd metal particles evolved during CO exposure, attesting particle restructuring with a gradual surface enrichment by palladium whatever the preparation meth- od; the most drastic changes were observed for the DPU samples that possess the smallest metal particles."

The literature discusses how single-atom alloys, particularly palladium (Pd) atoms embedded in copper (Cu) surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. Essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include understanding the reaction conditions, metal properties, and the specific advantages over traditional catalysts. SAA catalysts can break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems. The key points are:

1. Gold catalysts demonstrate remarkable selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, such as the partial hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes.
2. High selectivity in the partial hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene to p-chloroaniline has been achieved using gold-palladium (AuPd) catalysts with a high atomic ratio of Au to Pd.
3. The depositionprecipitation with urea (DPU) method is more efficient for obtaining reproducible and homogeneous bimetallic nanoparticles compared to other methods.
4. Determining the bimetallic character of particles with atomic ratios far from 1 can be challenging, and techniques like electron dispersive X-ray (EDX) or X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) are not always suitable.
5. The DRIFTS technique, combined with CO adsorption, reveals the bimetallic nature of AuPd particles and the distribution of Pd on the particle surface.
6. Palladium atoms migrate towards the surface of the particles under CO exposure, leading to a gradual enrichment of palladium on the surface.
7. The PVAAuPd catalyst, with larger particles, exhibits lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to DPU and THPC catalysts.
8. The absence of influence of alumina and titania supports on the catalytic results correlates with the comparable DRIFTS spectra for the two types of samples.
9. Larger particles obtained through the PVA method result in lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation, yet they maintain a similar level of selectivity.
10. The evolution of the surface composition of AuPd metal particles during CO exposure, as evidenced by DRIFTS, indicates particle restructuring with a gradual surface enrichment of palladium, regardless of the preparation method. The DPU samples with the smallest metal particles exhibit the most significant changes.

文献讨论了单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜（Cu）表面的钯（Pd）原子，在选择性氢化反应中增强催化性能的方式。设计成功单原子合金（SAA）催化剂的关键标准包括理解反应条件、金属性质以及与传统催化剂相比的特定优势。SAA催化剂可以打破缩放规则并提高各种催化剂系统的选择性。关键点如下：

1. 金催化剂在氢化反应中表现出显著的可选择性，如烷基和二烯烃的部分氢化。
2. 高可选择性已通过金-钯（AuPd）催化剂实现，其Au与Pd的原子比高，用于部分氢化p-氯硝基苯为p-氯苯胺。
3. 用尿素沉积沉淀（DPU）方法比其他方法更高效地获得可重复的均一双金属纳米粒子。
4. 确定原子比例远非1的粒子的双金属特性可能具有挑战性，并且EDX或X射线吸收精细结构（XAFS）等技术可能不总是适用。
5. 结合CO吸附的DRIFTS技术揭示了AuPd颗粒的双金属特性和Pd在粒子表面的分布。
6. 在CO暴露下，Pd原子向粒子表面迁移，导致表面Pd的逐渐富集。
7. PVAAuPd催化剂，具有较大颗粒，显示出较低的丁二烯氢化活性，与DPU和THPC催化剂相比。
8. 粘土和二氧化钛支持对催化结果的无影响与两种类型样品的相似DRIFTS谱相关联。
9. 通过PVA方法获得的大颗粒导致丁二烯氢化活性降低，但保持了类似水平的选择性。
10. 结合CO暴露的DRIFTS证据表明，AuPd金属颗粒表面重组期间的表面组成逐渐富集Pd，无论制备方法如何。DPU样品中的最小金属颗粒显示了最显著的变化。
