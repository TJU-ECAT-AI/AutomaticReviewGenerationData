[1] "Activity of gold-based catalysts in selective hydrogenation of butadiene was improved by the addition of small amount of Pd using three different procedures."
[2] "Total conversion of butadiene can be achieved at temperature 690 C, that is, at much lower temperature than monometallic gold, while preserving low alkanes formation at T100%, with catalysts containing Au/Pd atomic ratio P15."
[3] "The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting from THPC decomposition seems to have an additional beneficial effect on the activity of both Au and AuPd catalysts."
[4] "The larger particles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts, but the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high temperature."
[5] "Moreover, this is the only method, which allows the control of the deposition of both metals."
[6] "According to the DRIFTS study coupled with CO adsorption, the PVA method leads to the most homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of the bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio and favours the formation of isolated Pd sites."
[7] "The absence of Pd ensembles, such as dimers, appears to be the condition to limit the undesired hydrogenation of alkenes (butenes and propene) into alkanes."
[8] "DRIFTS also showed that the surface composition of the AuPd metal particles evolved during CO exposure, attesting particle restructuring with a gradual surface enrichment by palladium whatever the preparation method; the most drastic changes were observed for the DPU samples that possess the smallest metal particles."

1. The addition of small amounts of palladium to gold-based catalysts enhances their activity in the selective hydrogenation of butadiene, enabling complete conversion at temperatures significantly lower than those required for monometallic gold catalysts, while maintaining low alkane formation at the point of total conversion (T100%).

2. Using the Palladium/Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) method, catalysts with an atomic ratio of Au/Pd of 15 or higher can achieve total butadiene conversion at 690°C, with minimal formation of alkanes.

3. Residual phosphorous (700 ppm) from the decomposition of the tetra-kis (hydroxypropyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) additive seems to positively impact the activity of both gold and the AuPd catalysts.

4. The Palladium/Alcohol (PVA) method results in larger particles that, despite lower catalytic activity, maintain a low formation of alkanes even at high temperatures.

5. This method enables better control over the deposition of both metals compared to other techniques.

6. The Palladium/Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) method provides the most uniform distribution of palladium on the surface of bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio, favoring the formation of isolated palladium sites.

7. The absence of palladium ensembles, such as dimers, is crucial for limiting the undesired hydrogenation of alkenes into alkanes.

8. Dynamic Red-Infra-Red (DRIFTS) spectroscopy indicates that the surface composition of AuPd metal particles undergoes changes upon CO exposure, suggesting particle restructuring with a gradual surface enrichment in palladium. The most pronounced changes occur in the DPU samples with the smallest metal particles.

1. 向金基催化剂中添加少量钯可以增强其在丁二烯选择性氢化反应中的活性，使得完全转化可以在比单金属金催化剂所需的温度低得多的情况下实现，同时保持在完全转化点(T100%)时低烷烃形成。

2. 使用聚乙烯醇(PVA)方法，Au/Pd原子比为15或更高的催化剂可以在690°C下实现丁二烯的完全转化，同时形成极少量的烷烃。

3. 从四（羟丙基）磷鎓氯化物(THPC)分解产生的残留磷（700 ppm）似乎对金和AuPd催化剂的活性有正向影响。

4. PVA方法产生的较大颗粒，在保留较低的烷烃形成能力的同时，即使在高温下也能维持低的催化活性。

5. 相比其他技术，PVA方法能够更好地控制两种金属的沉积。

6. PVA方法提供了最均匀的钯分布，对于给定的Au/Pd原子比，这种分布有利于形成孤立的钯位点。

7. 缺乏钯簇，如二聚体，是限制烯烃（丁二烯和丙烯）氢化成烷烃的条件。

8. 动态红外光谱(DRIFTS)显示，AuPd金属颗粒的表面组成在CO暴露下会发生变化，这表明了颗粒的重构，伴随着表面钯的逐渐富集。在最小金属颗粒的DPU样品中，这些变化最为显著。
