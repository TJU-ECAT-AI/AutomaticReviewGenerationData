[1] "Activity of gold-based catalysts in selective hydrogenation of butadiene was improved by the addition of small amount of Pd using three different procedures."
[2] "Total conversion of butadiene can be achieved at temperature 690 C, that is, at much lower temperature than monometallic gold, while preserving low alkanes formation at T100%, with catalysts containing Au/Pd atomic ratio P15."
[3] "The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting from THPC decomposition seems to have an additional beneficial effect on the activity of both Au and AuPd catalysts."
[4] "The larger particles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts, but the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high temperature."
[5] "Moreover, this is the only method, which allows the control of the deposition of both metals."
[6] "According to the DRIFTS study coupled with CO adsorption, the PVA method leads to the most homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of the bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio and favours the formation of isolated Pd sites."

1. The addition of small amounts of palladium (Pd) to gold-based catalysts significantly improves their activity in selective hydrogenation of butadiene, enabling total conversion at temperatures as low as 690°C. This enhancement allows for the preservation of low alkane formation at the temperature where butadiene is fully converted, known as T100%.

2. Catalysts with an atomic ratio of Au/Pd of 15 or less enable the complete conversion of butadiene at temperatures lower than those required by monometallic gold catalysts, while maintaining low levels of alkane formation at the temperature of complete conversion (T100%).

3. The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting from the decomposition of the stabilizer tetra-kis (hydroxypropyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) seems to have a positive impact on the activity of both gold (Au) and bimetallic AuPd catalysts.

4. The PVA method, which yields larger particles, results in lower activity in the hydrogenation of butadiene compared to the DPU and THPC methods. However, the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high temperatures.

5. This PVA method is unique among the three in its capability to control the deposition of both metals, Au and Pd, in the catalyst system.

6. The DRIFTS study coupled with CO adsorption indicates that the PVA method facilitates the most homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio, promoting the formation of isolated Pd sites. This condition helps limit the undesired hydrogenation of alkenes (butenes and propene) into alkanes.

1. 向金基催化剂中添加少量钯（Pd）显著提高了其在丁二烯选择性氢化中的活性，使总转化率在690°C的较低温度下实现。这一增强允许在但二烯完全转化（T100%）的温度下保持低烷烃形成。

2. Au/Pd原子比为15或更少的催化剂能够在比单一金属金催化剂更低的温度下实现但二烯的完全转化，同时在T100%时保持低水平的烷烃形成。

3. 来自稳定剂四羟丙基磷鎓氯化物（THPC）分解的剩余磷（700 ppm）似乎对Au和AuPd双金属催化剂的活性有积极影响。

4. PVA方法产生的较大颗粒导致但二烯氢化活性较低，与DPU和THPC方法相比。然而，在高温下形成的烷烃量仍然很低。

5. 这种PVA方法是三种方法中唯一能够控制Au和Pd两种金属沉积的方法。

6. DRIFTS研究结合CO吸附表明，PVA方法为给定的Au/Pd原子比提供了最均匀的Pd分布于双金属粒子表面，促进孤立Pd位点的形成。这种条件有助于限制不希望的烯烃（但烯和丙烯）转化为烷烃。
