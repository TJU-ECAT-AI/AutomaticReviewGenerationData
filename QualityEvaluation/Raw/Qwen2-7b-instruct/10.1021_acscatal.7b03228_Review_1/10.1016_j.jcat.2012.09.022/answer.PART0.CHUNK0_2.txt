<EnglishVersionAnswer>
None of the quotes in the literature specifically address the questions about single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhancing catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions or the criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts. The document discusses AuPd catalysts for selective hydrogenation of butadiene, focusing on the influence of the preparation method on catalytic properties. It does not provide direct information on SAA catalysts or Pd atoms in Cu surfaces.

Answer: No relevant quotes.

文献中的引文没有具体讨论单原子合金，特别是Cu表面嵌入的Pd原子如何增强选择性氢化反应的催化性能，或者设计成功SAA催化剂的关键标准。文档主要讨论了AuPd催化剂用于丁二烯的选择性氢化，重点关注制备方法对催化性质的影响。它没有提供关于SAA催化剂或Cu表面中Pd原子的直接信息。

答案：没有相关引文。
