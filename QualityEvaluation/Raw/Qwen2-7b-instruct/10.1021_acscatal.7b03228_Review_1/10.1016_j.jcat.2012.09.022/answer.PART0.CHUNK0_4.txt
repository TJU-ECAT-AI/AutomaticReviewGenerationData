[1] "Activity of gold-based catalysts in selective hydrogenation of butadiene was improved by the addition of small amount of Pd using three different procedures."
[2] "Total conversion of butadiene can be achieved at temperature 690 C, that is, at much lower temperature than monometallic gold, while preserving low alkanes formation at T100%, with catalysts containing Au/Pd atomic ratio P15."
[3] "The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting from THPC decomposition seems to have an additional beneficial effect on the activity of both Au and AuPd catalysts."
[4] "The larger particles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts, but the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high temperature."
[5] "Moreover, this is the only method, which allows the control of the deposition of both metals."
[6] "According to the DRIFTS study coupled with CO adsorption, the PVA method leads to the most homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of the bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio and favours the formation of isolated Pd sites."

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by improving the activity of gold-based catalysts when added in small amounts. This is achieved through three distinct methods, enabling total butadiene conversion at lower temperatures compared to monometallic gold while maintaining low alkane formation at the complete conversion point (T100%).

2. The addition of Pd to gold catalysts can lead to activity improvements in selective hydrogenation reactions, allowing for butadiene conversion at temperatures as low as 690°C, which is significantly lower than the threshold for monometallic gold catalysts. This is accomplished with an atomic ratio of Au/Pd of 15, ensuring that the catalyst maintains a low level of alkane formation.

3. Residual phosphorous from the decomposition of THPC seems to have an additional positive impact on the activity of both the Au and AuPd catalysts, contributing to enhanced catalytic efficiency.

4. The PVA method yields larger particles in comparison to the DPU and THPC methods, which results in lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation. However, the method ensures that the formation of alkanes remains minimal, even at high temperatures.

5. Among the methods employed, the PVA method stands out as the one that allows for precise control over the deposition of both metals, offering an advantage over DPU and THPC techniques.

6. The DRIFTS study in conjunction with CO adsorption indicates that the PVA method facilitates a more uniform distribution of Pd on the surface of bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio, promoting the formation of isolated Pd sites. This characteristic is advantageous in minimizing the undesired hydrogenation of alkenes, such as butenes and propene, into alkanes.

1. 单原子合金，特别是嵌入Cu表面的Pd原子，通过在少量添加时提高金基催化剂的选择性氢化反应性能来增强催化性能。这种方法通过三种不同的途径实现，使得但烯的完全转化温度降低至690°C，相比单金属金催化剂而言，同时保持T100%点较低的烷烃形成量。

2. 向金催化剂中添加Pd可以提高选择性氢化反应的活性，允许但烯在690°C的温度下进行完全转化，这是金催化剂所无法达到的温度。这在Au/Pd原子比为15的情况下实现，并确保催化剂保持较低的烷烃形成量。

3. THPC分解后残留的磷似乎对Au和AuPd催化剂的活性有额外的正面影响，增加了催化剂的活性。

4. PVA方法产生的颗粒大于DPU和THPC方法，导致但烯氢化反应活性降低。然而，在高温下形成的烷烃量仍然很低。

5. 在所有方法中，PVA方法是唯一允许精确控制两种金属沉积的方法，相对于DPU和THPC技术具有优势。

6. DRIFTS研究结合CO吸附表明，PVA方法能够使给定的Au/Pd原子比下的双金属粒子表面更加均匀分布Pd，促进孤立Pd位点的形成。这一特性有利于限制不希望的烯烃氢化，如但烯和丙烯转化为烷烃。
