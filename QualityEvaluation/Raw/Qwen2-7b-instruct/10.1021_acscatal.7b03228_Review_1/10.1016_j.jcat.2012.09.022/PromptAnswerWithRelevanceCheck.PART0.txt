[1] "Activity of gold-based catalysts in selective hydrogenation of butadiene was improved by the addition of small amount of Pd using three different procedures."
[2] "Total conversion of butadiene can be achieved at temperature 690 C, that is, at much lower temperature than monometallic gold, while preserving low alkanes formation at T100%, with catalysts containing Au/Pd atomic ratio P15."
[3] "The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting from THPC decomposition seems to have an additional beneficial effect on the activity of both Au and AuPd catalysts."
[4] "The larger particles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts, but the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high temperature."
[5] "Moreover, this is the only method, which allows the control of the deposition of both metals."
[6] "According to the DRIFTS study coupled with CO adsorption, the PVA method leads to the most homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of the bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio and favours the formation of isolated Pd sites."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The addition of small amounts of palladium (Pd) to gold-based catalysts significantly improves their activity in selective hydrogenation of butadiene, enabling total conversion at temperatures as low as 690°C. This enhancement allows for the preservation of low alkane formation at the temperature where butadiene is fully converted, known as T100%.

2. Catalysts with an atomic ratio of Au/Pd of 15 or less enable the complete conversion of butadiene at temperatures lower than those required by monometallic gold catalysts, while maintaining low levels of alkane formation at the temperature of complete conversion (T100%).

3. The presence of residual phosphorous (700 ppm) resulting from the decomposition of the stabilizer tetra-kis (hydroxypropyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) seems to have a positive impact on the activity of both gold (Au) and bimetallic AuPd catalysts.

4. The PVA method, which yields larger particles, results in lower activity in the hydrogenation of butadiene compared to the DPU and THPC methods. However, the amount of alkanes formed remains low even at high temperatures.

5. This PVA method is unique among the three in its capability to control the deposition of both metals, Au and Pd, in the catalyst system.

6. The DRIFTS study coupled with CO adsorption indicates that the PVA method facilitates the most homogeneous distribution of Pd on the surface of bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio, promoting the formation of isolated Pd sites. This condition helps limit the undesired hydrogenation of alkenes (butenes and propene) into alkanes.

2. Au/Pd原子比为15或更少的催化剂能够在比单一金属金催化剂更低的温度下实现但二烯的完全转化，同时在T100%时保持低水平的烷烃形成。

3. 来自稳定剂四羟丙基磷鎓氯化物（THPC）分解的剩余磷（700 ppm）似乎对Au和AuPd双金属催化剂的活性有积极影响。

4. PVA方法产生的较大颗粒导致但二烯氢化活性较低，与DPU和THPC方法相比。然而，在高温下形成的烷烃量仍然很低。

5. 这种PVA方法是三种方法中唯一能够控制Au和Pd两种金属沉积的方法。

6. DRIFTS研究结合CO吸附表明，PVA方法为给定的Au/Pd原子比提供了最均匀的Pd分布于双金属粒子表面，促进孤立Pd位点的形成。这种条件有助于限制不希望的烯烃（但烯和丙烯）转化为烷烃。

[1] "The use of gold catalysts for hydrogenation reactions has encountered a growing interest in the recent past years. The high selectivity to partially hydrogenated products attested by gold cat- alysts in the hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes is indeed remarkable [1] and reference therein."
[2] "We had also previously reported that 100% selectivity in partial hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene to p- chloroaniline could be obtained using similar AuPd/Al2O3 catalysts with high Au/Pd atomic ratio (P20)."
[3] "The DPU method appeared more efficient than the IES method to obtain reproducible and homogeneous bimetallic and small nanoparticles."
[4] "Note that the determination of the bimetallic character of particles containing atomic metal ra- tios far from 1 is not facile. EDX or XAFS is hardly usable."
[5] "The spectra can be divided into two carbonyl regions, at high frequency (2150 2000 cm1) and low frequency (20001800 cm1)."
[6] "Indeed, the spectra of DP and PVAAuPd(20)/Al2O3 evolve with time on CO/He stream (Fig. 6a and b) (the same trend was also observed for the THPC AuPd/Al2O3 sample); the band of CO adsorbed on gold decreases in intensity, whereas the ones of linear and bridging CO (not visible on the PVA sample) adsorbed on Pd increase."
[7] "As for the monometallic gold samples, the PVAAuPd/Al2O3 catalyst, which possesses the largest particles, is the least active one,"
[8] "The absence of influence of alumina and titania supports on the catalytic results can be correlated to the DRIFT spectra,which are also comparable for the two types of samples (Fig. 7II)."
[9] "The larger particles obtained with the PVA method induce a lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to the DPU and THPC catalysts,"
[10] "DRIFTS also showed that the surface composition of the AuPd metal particles evolved during CO exposure, attesting particle restructuring with a gradual surface enrichment by palladium whatever the preparation meth- od; the most drastic changes were observed for the DPU samples that possess the smallest metal particles."

The literature discusses how single-atom alloys, particularly palladium (Pd) atoms embedded in copper (Cu) surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. Essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include understanding the reaction conditions, metal properties, and the specific advantages over traditional catalysts. SAA catalysts can break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems. The key points are:

1. Gold catalysts demonstrate remarkable selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, such as the partial hydrogenation of alkynes and alkadienes.
2. High selectivity in the partial hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene to p-chloroaniline has been achieved using gold-palladium (AuPd) catalysts with a high atomic ratio of Au to Pd.
3. The depositionprecipitation with urea (DPU) method is more efficient for obtaining reproducible and homogeneous bimetallic nanoparticles compared to other methods.
4. Determining the bimetallic character of particles with atomic ratios far from 1 can be challenging, and techniques like electron dispersive X-ray (EDX) or X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) are not always suitable.
5. The DRIFTS technique, combined with CO adsorption, reveals the bimetallic nature of AuPd particles and the distribution of Pd on the particle surface.
6. Palladium atoms migrate towards the surface of the particles under CO exposure, leading to a gradual enrichment of palladium on the surface.
7. The PVAAuPd catalyst, with larger particles, exhibits lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation compared to DPU and THPC catalysts.
8. The absence of influence of alumina and titania supports on the catalytic results correlates with the comparable DRIFTS spectra for the two types of samples.
9. Larger particles obtained through the PVA method result in lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation, yet they maintain a similar level of selectivity.
10. The evolution of the surface composition of AuPd metal particles during CO exposure, as evidenced by DRIFTS, indicates particle restructuring with a gradual surface enrichment of palladium, regardless of the preparation method. The DPU samples with the smallest metal particles exhibit the most significant changes.

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by improving the activity of gold-based catalysts when added in small amounts. This is achieved through three distinct methods, enabling total butadiene conversion at lower temperatures compared to monometallic gold while maintaining low alkane formation at the complete conversion point (T100%).

2. The addition of Pd to gold catalysts can lead to activity improvements in selective hydrogenation reactions, allowing for butadiene conversion at temperatures as low as 690°C, which is significantly lower than the threshold for monometallic gold catalysts. This is accomplished with an atomic ratio of Au/Pd of 15, ensuring that the catalyst maintains a low level of alkane formation.

3. Residual phosphorous from the decomposition of THPC seems to have an additional positive impact on the activity of both the Au and AuPd catalysts, contributing to enhanced catalytic efficiency.

4. The PVA method yields larger particles in comparison to the DPU and THPC methods, which results in lower activity in butadiene hydrogenation. However, the method ensures that the formation of alkanes remains minimal, even at high temperatures.

5. Among the methods employed, the PVA method stands out as the one that allows for precise control over the deposition of both metals, offering an advantage over DPU and THPC techniques.

6. The DRIFTS study in conjunction with CO adsorption indicates that the PVA method facilitates a more uniform distribution of Pd on the surface of bimetallic particles for a given Au/Pd atomic ratio, promoting the formation of isolated Pd sites. This characteristic is advantageous in minimizing the undesired hydrogenation of alkenes, such as butenes and propene, into alkanes.

2. 向金催化剂中添加Pd可以提高选择性氢化反应的活性，允许但烯在690°C的温度下进行完全转化，这是金催化剂所无法达到的温度。这在Au/Pd原子比为15的情况下实现，并确保催化剂保持较低的烷烃形成量。

3. THPC分解后残留的磷似乎对Au和AuPd催化剂的活性有额外的正面影响，增加了催化剂的活性。

4. PVA方法产生的颗粒大于DPU和THPC方法，导致但烯氢化反应活性降低。然而，在高温下形成的烷烃量仍然很低。

5. 在所有方法中，PVA方法是唯一允许精确控制两种金属沉积的方法，相对于DPU和THPC技术具有优势。

6. DRIFTS研究结合CO吸附表明，PVA方法能够使给定的Au/Pd原子比下的双金属粒子表面更加均匀分布Pd，促进孤立Pd位点的形成。这一特性有利于限制不希望的烯烃氢化，如但烯和丙烯转化为烷烃。
