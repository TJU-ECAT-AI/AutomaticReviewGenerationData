[1] "The quantification and duplication of reaction rates on metals is perhaps the most significant recent advance in heterogeneous catalysis, a field of chemical reactivity with an ingrained reputation for qualitative and h-reproducible results."
[2] "In a critical review, I have collected information pertaining to the effect on turnover frequency of three factors:first, the effect of particle size in the critical range and of crystallographic orientation for macroscopic single crystals; second, the effect of alloying an active Group VIII metal such as nickel with a less active Group Ib metal such as copper;and third, the effect of changing from one Group VIII metal to another of the same group."
[3] "Reactions have been classified into two groups. In Group I are reactions involving breaking (or making) of H-H, C-H, or O-H bonds, and in Group II are reactions involving breaking (or making) of C-C, N-N, or C-O bonds."
[4] "For instance, it predicts that reactions of Group II require a homogeneous transition metal catalyst containing more than one metal atom."
[5] "It suggests that dihydrogen may require only one surface atom for its dissociation, and not two adjacent ones as traditionally assumed."
[6] "Similarly, it favors formation of a z-complex between an alkene and a single metal atom rather than that of an eclipsed 1,2-diadsorbed alkane on two adjacent metal atoms."
[7] "Nevertheless, it would be foolhardy to claim that the proposed explanation of structure-insensitivity, if correct, is unique."
[8] "Much more surprising are the recent studies with metal-lic catalysts exhibiting structure-insensitivity."
[9] "Note that insensitivity does not mean invariance. There is a fuzzy area between insensitivity and sensitivity."
[10] "Differences in reactivity are magnified by operation at low temperatures and smoothed out at high temperatures."
[11] "Thus, in the more recent study of hydrogenation of cyclopropane on supported platinum, it is concluded that a factor of two in turnover frequency means structure-sensitivity."
[12] "While this is reasonable, another explanation can be suggested."
[13] "In excess hydrogen, a hydrogen-covered surface would remain unreconstructed."

The document highlights advancements in the quantification and duplication of reaction rates on metals, indicating significant progress in heterogeneous catalysis. Reactions are categorized into two groups based on the type of bonds they involve, and the document proposes explanations for the differences in sensitivity to structure among these reactions. It suggests that reactions involving C-C, N-N, or C-O bonds (Group II) may require more surface atoms than those involving H-H, C-H, or O-H bonds (Group I). The document also discusses the importance of particle size and crystallographic orientation in affecting turnover frequencies, with examples provided for the hydrogenation of cyclopropane on supported platinum. Alternative explanations for structure-insensitivity are mentioned, emphasizing the complexity and variability in catalytic behavior.
