The number of surface atoms is equal to the number of molecules of a chemisorptive gas, e.g. Hz, O2, CO, held to the metal and to the metal only (selective chemi-sorption) at a suitable temperature and pressure, multiplied by an empirical coefficient which takes into account possible dissociation of the adsorbed molecule, e.g. Hz into 2H, as well as the stoichiometry, i.e. the number of atoms or molecules bound per surface atom. The latter must be determined separately by chemisorption and physisorption or physical tools on samples used for calibration.

To determine the number of surface atoms on a metal, one can hold a chemisorptive gas like hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon monoxide to the metal at a suitable temperature and pressure, multiply the number of molecules adsorbed to the metal by an empirical coefficient that accounts for possible dissociation of the adsorbed molecule and the stoichiometry of the adsorption process. The stoichiometry must be determined separately through chemisorption and physisorption or physical methods on calibration samples.

为了确定金属表面原子的数量，可以在适当的温度和压力下将化学吸附气体如氢、氧或一氧化碳吸附到金属上，然后将吸附到金属上的分子数量乘以一个经验系数，该系数考虑了吸附分子可能的分解以及吸附过程的化学计量。必须通过在用于校准的样品上进行化学吸附和物理吸附或物理方法来单独确定吸附过程的化学计量。
