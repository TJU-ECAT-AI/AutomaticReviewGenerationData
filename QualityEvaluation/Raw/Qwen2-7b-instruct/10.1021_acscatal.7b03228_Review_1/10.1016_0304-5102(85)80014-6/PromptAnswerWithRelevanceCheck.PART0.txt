How do single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions, and what are the essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts in terms of reaction conditions, metal properties, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including their ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems?

<quotes>
The number of surface atoms is equal to the number of molecules of a chemisorptive gas, e.g. Hz, O2, CO, held to the metal and to the metal only (selective chemi-sorption) at a suitable temperature and pressure, multiplied by an empirical coefficient which takes into account possible dissociation of the adsorbed molecule, e.g. Hz into 2H, as well as the stoichiometry, i.e. the number of atoms or molecules bound per surface atom. The latter must be determined separately by chemisorption and physisorption or physical tools on samples used for calibration.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To determine the number of surface atoms on a metal, one can hold a chemisorptive gas like hydrogen, oxygen, or carbon monoxide to the metal at a suitable temperature and pressure, multiply the number of molecules adsorbed to the metal by an empirical coefficient that accounts for possible dissociation of the adsorbed molecule and the stoichiometry of the adsorption process. The stoichiometry must be determined separately through chemisorption and physisorption or physical methods on calibration samples.

为了确定金属表面原子的数量，可以在适当的温度和压力下将化学吸附气体如氢、氧或一氧化碳吸附到金属上，然后将吸附到金属上的分子数量乘以一个经验系数，该系数考虑了吸附分子可能的分解以及吸附过程的化学计量。必须通过在用于校准的样品上进行化学吸附和物理吸附或物理方法来单独确定吸附过程的化学计量。

<quotes>
[1] "The quantification and duplication of reaction rates on metals is perhaps the most significant recent advance in heterogeneous catalysis, a field of chemical reactivity with an ingrained reputation for qualitative and h-reproducible results."
[2] "In a critical review, I have collected information pertaining to the effect on turnover frequency of three factors:first, the effect of particle size in the critical range and of crystallographic orientation for macroscopic single crystals; second, the effect of alloying an active Group VIII metal such as nickel with a less active Group Ib metal such as copper;and third, the effect of changing from one Group VIII metal to another of the same group."
[3] "Reactions have been classified into two groups. In Group I are reactions involving breaking (or making) of H-H, C-H, or O-H bonds, and in Group II are reactions involving breaking (or making) of C-C, N-N, or C-O bonds."
[4] "For instance, it predicts that reactions of Group II require a homogeneous transition metal catalyst containing more than one metal atom."
[5] "It suggests that dihydrogen may require only one surface atom for its dissociation, and not two adjacent ones as traditionally assumed."
[6] "Similarly, it favors formation of a z-complex between an alkene and a single metal atom rather than that of an eclipsed 1,2-diadsorbed alkane on two adjacent metal atoms."
[7] "Nevertheless, it would be foolhardy to claim that the proposed explanation of structure-insensitivity, if correct, is unique."
[8] "Much more surprising are the recent studies with metal-lic catalysts exhibiting structure-insensitivity."
[9] "Note that insensitivity does not mean invariance. There is a fuzzy area between insensitivity and sensitivity."
[10] "Differences in reactivity are magnified by operation at low temperatures and smoothed out at high temperatures."
[11] "Thus, in the more recent study of hydrogenation of cyclopropane on supported platinum, it is concluded that a factor of two in turnover frequency means structure-sensitivity."
[12] "While this is reasonable, another explanation can be suggested."
[13] "In excess hydrogen, a hydrogen-covered surface would remain unreconstructed."

The document highlights advancements in the quantification and duplication of reaction rates on metals, indicating significant progress in heterogeneous catalysis. Reactions are categorized into two groups based on the type of bonds they involve, and the document proposes explanations for the differences in sensitivity to structure among these reactions. It suggests that reactions involving C-C, N-N, or C-O bonds (Group II) may require more surface atoms than those involving H-H, C-H, or O-H bonds (Group I). The document also discusses the importance of particle size and crystallographic orientation in affecting turnover frequencies, with examples provided for the hydrogenation of cyclopropane on supported platinum. Alternative explanations for structure-insensitivity are mentioned, emphasizing the complexity and variability in catalytic behavior.

文档强调了在金属上量化和复制反应速率的进步，表明在异相催化领域取得了显著进展。反应被分为两类，根据它们涉及的键类型，对这些反应的敏感性差异进行了讨论。文档提出，涉及C-C、N-N或C-O键（组II）的反应可能需要比涉及H-H、C-H或O-H键（组I）的反应更多的表面原子。文档还讨论了粒子大小和晶体学取向对周转频率的影响，并提供了支持铂上环丙烷氢化催化剂的示例。对于结构不敏感性的替代解释也被提及，强调了催化行为的复杂性和变化性。
