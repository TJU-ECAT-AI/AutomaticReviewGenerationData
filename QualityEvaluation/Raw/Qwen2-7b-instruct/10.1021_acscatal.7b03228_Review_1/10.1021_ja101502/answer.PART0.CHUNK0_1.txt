[1] "The RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles undergo reversible changes of surface composition and chemical state when the reactant gases change from oxidizing (NO or O2 at 300 C) to reducing (H2 or CO at 300 C) or catalytic (mixture of NO and CO at 300 C)."
[2] "The evolution of their structures and chemistry under oxidizing and reducing conditions was studied with ambient-pressure XPS (AP-XPS) in the Torr pressure range."
[3] "Both RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles undergo reversible changes in surface composition and chemical states when the reaction conditions are changed from oxidizing to reducing or catalytic."
[4] "The restructuring exhibited by bimetallic nanoparticles suggests a method for developing catalysts by controllably restructuring the surface structure of as-synthesized nanoparticles."
