The study examines the synthesis of RhxPd1x, RhxPt1x, and PdxPt1x bimetallic nanoparticles and their distribution of constituent elements. The researchers use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the depth profiles of these nanoparticles. They find that RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles have a coreshell structure, while PdxPt1x nanoparticles are more homogeneous. Under reaction conditions, the surface composition and chemical state of RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles change reversibly when the reactant gases switch from oxidizing to reducing or catalytic. In contrast, no significant change in the distribution of Pd and Pt atoms in PdxPt1x nanoparticles is observed. The differences in restructuring behavior among these three series of bimetallic nanoparticles are attributed to the surface free energy of the metals and the heat of formation of the metallic oxides. Under reducing conditions, RhOx is reduced to the metallic state, causing Pd and Pt to segregate to the surface because they have a lower surface free energy than Rh. The study also finds that Pt does not segregate to the surface under oxidizing conditions due to its higher surface free energy compared to Rh and Pd. The lack of change in the distribution of Pd and Pt in PdxPt1x nanoparticles under reaction conditions suggests that the structure of these nanoparticles remains relatively constant.

本研究考察了RhxPd1x、RhxPt1x和PdxPt1x双金属纳米粒子的合成及其组成元素分布。研究人员使用X射线光电子能谱(XPS)分析这些纳米粒子的深度剖面。他们发现，RhxPd1x和RhxPt1x纳米粒子具有核壳结构，而PdxPt1x纳米粒子则更为均匀。在反应条件下，当反应气体从氧化性转变为还原性或催化性时，RhxPd1x和RhxPt1x纳米粒子表面的组成和化学状态会发生可逆变化。相反，在任何情况下，PdxPt1x纳米粒子中Pd和Pt原子的分布均未观察到显著变化。这些三个系列的双金属纳米粒子之间的重组行为差异归因于金属的表面自由能和金属氧化物的形成热。在还原条件下，RhOx被还原为金属状态，导致Pd和Pt向表面聚集，因为它们的表面自由能低于Rh。研究还发现，在氧化条件下，由于Pt的表面自由能高于Rh和Pd，因此Pt不会向表面聚集。缺乏PdxPt1x纳米粒子中Pd和Pt原子分布的变化表明这些纳米粒子的结构在反应条件下保持相对稳定。
