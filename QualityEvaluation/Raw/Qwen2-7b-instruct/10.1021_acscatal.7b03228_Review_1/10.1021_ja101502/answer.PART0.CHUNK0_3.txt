[1] "The RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles undergo reversible changes of surface composition and chemical state when the reactant gases change from oxidizing (NO or O2 at 300 C) to reducing (H2 or CO at 300 C) or catalytic (mixture of NO and CO at 300 C)."
[2] "The difference in restructuring behavior under these reaction conditions in the three series of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts is correlated with the surface free energy of the metals and the heat of formation of the metallic oxides."
[3] "The observed reaction-driven changes in structure and chemistry of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts demonstrate the importance of in situ studies of catalysts for understanding catalytic mechanisms at an atomic level."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles experience reversible alterations in their surface composition and chemical state when the reacting gases switch from oxidizing (NO or O2) to reducing (H2 or CO) or catalytic (NO and CO mix) conditions at 300°C. These differences in restructuring behavior are linked to the surface energy of the metals and the enthalpy of formation of their metallic oxides. Studying these catalysts in situ highlights their significance for elucidating catalytic mechanisms at the atomic scale.

RhxPd1x和RhxPt1x纳米颗粒在300°C下，当反应气体从氧化剂（NO或O2）转变为还原剂（H2或CO），或者催化作用（NO和CO混合物）时，经历可逆的表面组成和化学状态变化。这些重整行为的不同与金属表面能和它们的金属氧化物形成热的联系紧密。对这些催化剂进行原位研究强调了理解原子尺度催化机制的重要性。
