The study examines the synthesis of RhxPd1x, RhxPt1x, and PdxPt1x bimetallic nanoparticles and their distribution of constituent elements. The researchers use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the depth profiles of these nanoparticles. They find that RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles have a coreshell structure, while PdxPt1x nanoparticles are more homogeneous. Under reaction conditions, the surface composition and chemical state of RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles change reversibly when the reactant gases switch from oxidizing to reducing or catalytic. In contrast, no significant change in the distribution of Pd and Pt atoms in PdxPt1x nanoparticles is observed. The differences in restructuring behavior among these three series of bimetallic nanoparticles are attributed to the surface free energy of the metals and the heat of formation of the metallic oxides. Under reducing conditions, RhOx is reduced to the metallic state, causing Pd and Pt to segregate to the surface because they have a lower surface free energy than Rh. The study also finds that Pt does not segregate to the surface under oxidizing conditions due to its higher surface free energy compared to Rh and Pd. The lack of change in the distribution of Pd and Pt in PdxPt1x nanoparticles under reaction conditions suggests that the structure of these nanoparticles remains relatively constant.

本研究考察了RhxPd1x、RhxPt1x和PdxPt1x双金属纳米粒子的合成及其组成元素分布。研究人员使用X射线光电子能谱(XPS)分析这些纳米粒子的深度剖面。他们发现，RhxPd1x和RhxPt1x纳米粒子具有核壳结构，而PdxPt1x纳米粒子则更为均匀。在反应条件下，当反应气体从氧化性转变为还原性或催化性时，RhxPd1x和RhxPt1x纳米粒子表面的组成和化学状态会发生可逆变化。相反，在任何情况下，PdxPt1x纳米粒子中Pd和Pt原子的分布均未观察到显著变化。这些三个系列的双金属纳米粒子之间的重组行为差异归因于金属的表面自由能和金属氧化物的形成热。在还原条件下，RhOx被还原为金属状态，导致Pd和Pt向表面聚集，因为它们的表面自由能低于Rh。研究还发现，在氧化条件下，由于Pt的表面自由能高于Rh和Pd，因此Pt不会向表面聚集。缺乏PdxPt1x纳米粒子中Pd和Pt原子分布的变化表明这些纳米粒子的结构在反应条件下保持相对稳定。

Answer: The study focused on synthesizing three series of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts: RhxPd1x, RhxPt1x, and PdxPt1x, with x values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. These catalysts were created through a one-step colloidal process. The researchers observed that RhxPd1x and PdxPt1x nanoparticles had a core-shell structure, while RhxPt1x alloys were more uniformly structured. Notably, RhxPd1x and RhxPt1x nanoparticles showed reversible changes in surface composition and chemical state when subjected to different reactant gases—oxiding (NO or O2), reducing (H2 or CO), or catalytic (mix of NO and CO) conditions at 300°C. Conversely, the distribution of Pd and Pt atoms in PdxPt1x nanoparticles remained largely unchanged under these conditions. The varying restructuring behaviors among the catalysts were attributed to differences in the surface energy of the metals and the enthalpy of formation of their metallic oxides.

研究集中在合成三系列双金属纳米颗粒催化剂：RhxPd1x、RhxPt1x和PdxPt1x，其中x值分别为0.2、0.5和0.8。这些催化剂通过一步胶体工艺制备。研究人员发现，RhxPd1x和PdxPt1x纳米颗粒具有核心壳结构，而RhxPt1x合金则结构更均匀。值得注意的是，在氧化（NO或O2）、还原（H2或CO）或催化（NO和CO混合）条件下的300°C下，RhxPd1x和RhxPt1x纳米颗粒显示出可逆的表面组成和化学状态变化。相反，PdxPt1x纳米颗粒中的Pd和Pt原子分布在这些条件下基本上保持不变。催化剂之间的不同重构行为归因于金属表面能和它们的金属氧化物形成焓的不同。
