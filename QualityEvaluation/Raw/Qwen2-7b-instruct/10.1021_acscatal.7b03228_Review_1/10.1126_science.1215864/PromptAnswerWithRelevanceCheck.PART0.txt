[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "We find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."
[5] "The Pd/Cu SAA surface displays a rather uncommon energetic landscape for the dissociation and chemisorption of hydrogen."
[6] "The situation, however, is drastically different on Pd/Cu SAA surfaces."
[7] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[8] "Implementation of the SAA approach to the design of real catalysts requires consideration of the effect of higher reaction temperature, which may cause the minority active element to segregate into the bulk of the more inert host and hence a loss in activity."

The document elucidates how single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, significantly enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. These alloys facilitate efficient and selective hydrogenation due to their unique properties. Key criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. **Facile Reactant Dissociation**: The alloys enable easy dissociation of reactants, which is crucial for catalytic efficiency.
2. **Weak Binding of Intermediates**: This allows for a balance between reactant activation and product release, enhancing selectivity.
3. **Selective Hydrogenation**: The alloys enable selective hydrogenation of molecules like styrene and acetylene, outperforming pure Cu or Pd metals.
4. **Energy Landscape**: The alloys exhibit an unusual energetic landscape for hydrogen dissociation and adsorption, promoting selective catalysis.
5. **Active Element Segregation**: The active Pd atoms are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the Cu host, preventing aggregation into bulk phases.
6. **Catalyst Design Considerations**: To implement SAA in practical catalysts, one must account for the potential segregation of the active element at high temperatures, which could diminish activity.

These criteria ensure that SAA catalysts can break traditional scaling rules and improve selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, offering a promising alternative to conventional catalysts.

The single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by facilitating facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates. This allows for efficient and selective hydrogenation of molecules like styrene and acetylene. Key criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:
1. Maintaining the minority active element (Pd) in an isolated state on the surface to ensure facile reactant dissociation and weak binding.
2. Utilizing a host metal (Cu) in a significant excess to provide a weak binding environment for the adsorbed reactants.
3. Considering the impact of higher reaction temperatures on the stability of the active metal (Pd) and its segregation into the bulk of the more inert host metal, which could lead to a loss in activity.
4. Ensuring that the SAA catalysts maintain selective catalytic activity, avoiding the extensive decomposition of reactants that occurs with higher Pd coverages.

The single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu. This allows for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene compared to pure Cu or Pd metal alone. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. **Reaction Conditions**: Using low-temperature conditions to facilitate hydrogen dissociation and weak binding.
2. **Metal Properties**: Ensuring the presence of Pd atoms in the surface layer at very low concentrations, which are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by Cu, preventing the formation of dimers or trimers.
3. **Specific Advantages Over Traditional Catalysts**:
   - **Breaking Scaling Rules**: The SAA catalysts use a small amount of precious metal, generating a cost-effective alternative to traditional bimetallic catalysts.
   - **Improving Selectivity**: The bifunctional surface of SAAs facilitates different steps in the reaction with distinct regions for hydrogen dissociation and hydrogenation.
   - **Selective Catalysis**: The catalysts allow for the efficient and selective hydrogenation of various molecules, such as styrene and acetylene, without significant decomposition of the reactants.

The SAA approach offers a unique strategy to tailor catalysts with precise control over metal distribution, enhancing their catalytic efficiency and selectivity in heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions.

The single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by facilitating facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates. This allows for selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include ensuring that the metal properties allow for efficient activation of hydrogen, weak binding to the substrate to facilitate hydrogen spillover, and that the minority active element remains stable on the surface. These catalysts break scaling rules by requiring only small quantities of precious metal, offering improved selectivity compared to traditional catalysts, and enabling bifunctional surfaces with distinct regions for different reaction steps. To implement the SAA approach in practical catalysts, consideration of factors such as reaction temperature and the potential for active elements to segregate into the bulk of the more inert host metal is necessary, although examples exist where adsorbates stabilize the active element at the surface.
