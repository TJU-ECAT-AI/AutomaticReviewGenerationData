The single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by facilitating facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates. This allows for selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include ensuring that the metal properties allow for efficient activation of hydrogen, weak binding to the substrate to facilitate hydrogen spillover, and that the minority active element remains stable on the surface. These catalysts break scaling rules by requiring only small quantities of precious metal, offering improved selectivity compared to traditional catalysts, and enabling bifunctional surfaces with distinct regions for different reaction steps. To implement the SAA approach in practical catalysts, consideration of factors such as reaction temperature and the potential for active elements to segregate into the bulk of the more inert host metal is necessary, although examples exist where adsorbates stabilize the active element at the surface.

单原子合金，特别是嵌入在Cu表面的Pd原子，通过促进反应物的易于解离和中间体的弱结合，提高了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。这使得苯乙烯和丙烯酸的氢化成为可能。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括确保金属特性能够有效激活氢气、与基底的弱结合以促进氢气溢出，并且少量活性元素保持在表面上的稳定性。这些催化剂打破了传统的规则，只需要少量贵重金属就能实现，提供比传统催化剂更好的选择性，并允许具有不同反应步骤的双功能表面。为了将SAA方法应用于实际催化剂中，需要考虑的因素包括反应温度以及活性元素可能向更惰性宿主金属内部聚集的可能性，尽管存在例子表明吸附剂可以稳定表面的活性元素，尽管在理想操作条件下，Cu/Pd系统的表面聚积效应较小（0.02 eV），与Pd相对于Cu增加的0.4 eV的氢吸附能相比。
