[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "However, these two variables are intimately linked in a way that does not generally allow the optimization of both properties simultaneously."
[3] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[4] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[5] "In the present case, the Cu(111) host surface, which is in overwhelming excess (99:1), binds Ha weakly."
[6] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[7] "Implementation of the SAA approach to the design of real catalysts requires consideration of the effect of higher reaction temperature, which may cause the minority active element to segregate into the bulk of the more inert host and hence a loss in activity."

The single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by facilitating facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates. This allows for efficient and selective hydrogenation of molecules like styrene and acetylene. Key criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:
1. Maintaining the minority active element (Pd) in an isolated state on the surface to ensure facile reactant dissociation and weak binding.
2. Utilizing a host metal (Cu) in a significant excess to provide a weak binding environment for the adsorbed reactants.
3. Considering the impact of higher reaction temperatures on the stability of the active metal (Pd) and its segregation into the bulk of the more inert host metal, which could lead to a loss in activity.
4. Ensuring that the SAA catalysts maintain selective catalytic activity, avoiding the extensive decomposition of reactants that occurs with higher Pd coverages.

单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，在选择性氢化反应中提高了催化性能，通过促进反应物的易于解离和中间体的弱结合。这使得像苯乙烯和乙炔这样的分子能够进行高效的氢化。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括：
1. 将活性较小的元素（钯）保持在表面孤立状态，以确保反应物的易于解离和弱结合。
2. 利用大量过剩的宿主金属（铜），提供对吸附反应物的弱结合环境。
3. 考虑到较高反应温度对活性金属（钯）稳定性和其向更惰性宿主金属内部的聚集的影响，这可能导致活性下降。
4. 确保SAA催化剂保持选择性的催化活性，避免高钯覆盖率下反应物的广泛分解。
