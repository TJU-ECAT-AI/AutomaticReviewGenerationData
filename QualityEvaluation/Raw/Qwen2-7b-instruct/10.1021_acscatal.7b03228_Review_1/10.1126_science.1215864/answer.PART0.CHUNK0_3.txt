[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy,we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "The small amounts of precious metal required to produce SAAs generates a very attractive alternative to most traditional bimetallic catalysts."

The single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by facilitating facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates. These conditions allow for efficient and selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene compared to pure Cu or Pd metal alone. The ability to isolate Pd atoms in a Cu surface creates a bifunctional surface with different regions for different steps in the reaction. The small amounts of precious metal used in these alloys make them an attractive alternative to traditional bimetallic catalysts, offering improved selectivity and efficiency.

单原子合金，尤其是Cu表面上嵌入的Pd原子，通过促进反应物的易于解离和中间体的弱结合，提高了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。这些条件使得苯乙烯和丙烯的高效选择性氢化与纯Cu或Pd金属相比更为有效。在Cu表面上孤立Pd原子的能力创建了一个具有不同区域用于反应不同步骤的双功能表面。这些合金中所使用的少量贵重金属使其成为传统双金属催化剂的有吸引力替代品，提供改进的选择性和效率。
