[1] "Facile dissociation of reactants and weak binding of intermediates are key requirements for efficient and selective catalysis."
[2] "By using desorption measurements in combination with high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we show that individual, isolated Pd atoms in a Cu surface substantially lower the energy barrier to both hydrogen uptake on and subsequent desorption from the Cu metal surface."
[3] "This facile hydrogen dissociation at Pd atom sites and weak binding to Cu allow for very selective hydrogenation of styrene and acetylene as compared with pure Cu or Pd metal alone."
[4] "We find that a small quantity of Pd atoms in the Cu surface makes the SAA active toward the uptake of H2, which can dissociate on the Pd monatomic entities and then spill over onto the bare Cu(111) terraces."
[5] "The Pd/Cu SAA surface displays a rather uncommon energetic landscape for the dissociation and chemisorption of hydrogen."
[6] "The situation, however, is drastically different on Pd/Cu SAA surfaces."
[7] "Our results demonstrate that very small quantities of individual, isolated catalytically active metal atoms can substantially influence the catalytic properties of less reactive metals."
[8] "Implementation of the SAA approach to the design of real catalysts requires consideration of the effect of higher reaction temperature, which may cause the minority active element to segregate into the bulk of the more inert host and hence a loss in activity."

The document elucidates how single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, significantly enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. These alloys facilitate efficient and selective hydrogenation due to their unique properties. Key criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include:

1. **Facile Reactant Dissociation**: The alloys enable easy dissociation of reactants, which is crucial for catalytic efficiency.
2. **Weak Binding of Intermediates**: This allows for a balance between reactant activation and product release, enhancing selectivity.
3. **Selective Hydrogenation**: The alloys enable selective hydrogenation of molecules like styrene and acetylene, outperforming pure Cu or Pd metals.
4. **Energy Landscape**: The alloys exhibit an unusual energetic landscape for hydrogen dissociation and adsorption, promoting selective catalysis.
5. **Active Element Segregation**: The active Pd atoms are thermodynamically more stable when surrounded by the Cu host, preventing aggregation into bulk phases.
6. **Catalyst Design Considerations**: To implement SAA in practical catalysts, one must account for the potential segregation of the active element at high temperatures, which could diminish activity.

These criteria ensure that SAA catalysts can break traditional scaling rules and improve selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, offering a promising alternative to conventional catalysts.

文档详细阐述了单原子合金，特别是嵌入铜表面的钯原子，在选择性氢化反应中显著提高催化性能的方法。这些合金通过其独特的属性实现了高效和选择性的氢化。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括：

1. **容易分解反应物**：合金允许反应物易于分解，这是催化效率的关键。
2. **中间体弱结合**：这允许在反应物激活和产物释放之间取得平衡，增强选择性。
3. **选择性氢化**：合金能够选择性地氢化分子如苯乙烯和丙烯，优于纯铜或钯金属。
4. **能量景观**：合金表现出氢解离和吸附的不寻常能量景观，促进选择性催化。
5. **活性元素分离**：活性钯原子在铜宿主中的稳定性更高，防止聚集到基质中。
6. **催化剂设计考虑**：在实施SAA以设计实际催化剂时，必须考虑到高温下活性元素可能向惰性宿主的基部聚集，从而降低活性的问题。

这些标准确保了SAA催化剂能够打破传统的缩放规则，并在氢化反应中提高选择性，为传统催化剂提供有前景的替代品。
