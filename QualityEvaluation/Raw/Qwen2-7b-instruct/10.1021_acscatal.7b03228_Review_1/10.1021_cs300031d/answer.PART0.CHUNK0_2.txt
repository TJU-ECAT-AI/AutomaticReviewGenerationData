The single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by offering unique electronic and structural properties. Successful design of SAA catalysts relies on controlling metal atom dispersion, coordination environment, and surface area. These catalysts often surpass traditional catalysts by maintaining high activity and selectivity across varied conditions, breaking scaling rules. The strong bonds formed between Pd atoms and reactants or intermediates contribute to improved selectivity.
