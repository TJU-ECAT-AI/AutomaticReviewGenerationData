1. Single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions due to their unique properties. These alloys break scaling rules and improve selectivity across different catalyst systems. The essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts involve careful consideration of reaction conditions, metal properties, and advantages over traditional catalysts.
