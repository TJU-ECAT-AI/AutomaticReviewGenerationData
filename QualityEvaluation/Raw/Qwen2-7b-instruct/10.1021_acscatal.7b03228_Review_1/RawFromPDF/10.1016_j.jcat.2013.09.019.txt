The structural and electronic properties of unsupported Pd2Ga were investigated after different
pre-treatments. Pd2Ga provides with respect to elemental Pd a signiﬁcantly modiﬁed electronic structure
with its d-band center being shifted away from the Fermi level. It was found that the electronic structure of
the surface depends strongly on its pre-treatment and on the chemical environment. We report a detailed
bulk and surface characterization of the intermetallic compound by means of XRD, DTA/TG/MS, SEM, XPS,
and HR-TEM. At moderate temperatures, the bulk of Pd2Ga is chemically resistant against H2 or O2
atmosphere and against mechanical load. Contrariwise its surface is highly sensitive against even traces
of oxidizing agents, leading quickly to a disparity between bulk and surface structure and composition.
The reversibility of this dynamic effect depends on the degree of decomposition and on the sample history.
An almost pure intermetallic surface can only be achieved in highly reducing atmospheres.

1. Introduction
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is applied in
hydro-reﬁning processes to remove impurities of acetylene or
methylacetylene in corresponding alkene streams [1] or in indus-
trial ﬁne chemical syntheses, e.g., Linalool, Vitamins A, E, and K,
or insect pheromones [2–4].
Pd-based catalysts provide an outstanding activity and selectiv-
ity for the hydrogenation of alkynes [5–8]. However, they can act in
selective as well as an unselective manner (for further discussion
see SI). In general, there are three main inﬂuences discussed, which
determine the desired selectivity of Pd towards the alkene. Firstly,
there is a geometric effect [9]: The isolation of active sites and the
presence of exclusively small ensembles of active atoms lead to the
suppression of reactions requiring larger ensembles, e.g., oligomer-
ization or the formation of strongly bound hydrogen deﬁcient spe-
cies [10], in general known as ensemble effect [11,12]. In
particular, the presence of only small ensembles reduces the avail-
ability of hydrogen [13] and hinders over-hydrogenation. Secondly,
Pd easily forms Pd hydrides [14]: Compared to dissociatively
bonded H atoms on the surface, the hydrogen incorporated into
the subsurface or in the bulk of Pd provides a higher reactivity
and lowers the selectivity towards the alkene due to enhanced al-
kene hydrogenation [15–18]. Thirdly, the selectivity could be in-
creased if an electronic effect enhances the barrier for alkene
hydrogenation and thus favoring alkene desorption [19].
Recently, it has been shown that the selective phase in an ini-
tially pure Pd catalyst during hydrogenation of C–C triple bonds
is not the pure Pd itself, but an in situ formed subsurface palla-
dium–carbon phase formed by a rapid decomposition of the sub-
strate as a ﬁrst step of the reaction [20,21]. The subsurface C
modiﬁes the electronic structure of Pd at the surface and slows
down diffusion of H through the Pd–C surface phase into the Pd lat-
tice. It weakens the adsorption strength of surface-bonded H and
thus further lowers the availability of H at the surface. As a result,
over-hydrogenation and the formation of the alkane are sup-
pressed on this modiﬁed surface. Unfortunately, the existence of
the Pd–C phase is highly dynamic and depends strongly on the
chemical potential of C and H [18]. High potentials of H or low
potentials of the acetylene lead to hydrogenation of the subsurface
C, and hence, Pd loses its selectivity.
Thus, less volatile additional modiﬁers are frequently added. In

optionally poisoned with organic nitrogen bases, is one of the most
common catalysts in liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions. Be-
sides the insights into the reaction mechanisms of acetylene
hydrogenation over Pd under typical low-pressure conditions, the
role of different modiﬁers and additives is still controversially dis-
cussed, and they are, as described brieﬂy by means of Pd–Ag alloys
and CO in the SI, not necessarily stable under reaction conditions.
This is likewise the case for Pd catalysts in liquid-phase hydrogena-
tions of alkynes. However, it is not always sufﬁciently stable and
selective [25], for instance, if H2O is used as solvent. Furthermore,
impregnated heavy metals can be subjected to a dynamic redox
chemistry and can leach, and C–N bonds of organic bases could
be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd [26]. Works
of Mallat and Baiker [27] and López and Vargas-Fuentes [28] high-
light the role of important modiﬁers. It is still necessary and a chal-
lenge to ﬁnd catalyst materials, which are not reliant on a complex
subsurface chemistry or additional modiﬁers. Recently, CeO2 was
found to be highly active in the gas-phase hydrogenation of meth-
ylacetylene [29] without the use of typical hydrogenation active
transition metals.
Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) like Pd3Pb [30] or NiZn [19]
were discussed as alternative catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation
with their well-ordered crystal structure and their modiﬁed elec-
tronic structure. The modiﬁcation of the electronic structure of Pd
and Ni IMCs is generally stronger compared to substitutional alloys
[11, 31] or for non-stoichiometric surface phases. This effect is more
pronounced with decreasing electronegativity of the second
metal [32,33]. In the last years, Pd–Ga intermetallic compounds
were
found
to
be
stable
and
selective
catalysts
for
the
semi-hydrogenation of acetylene [34–36]. It was shown that the or-
dered structure and the partially covalent bonds of these interme-
tallic compounds give rise to the intrinsically modiﬁed electronic
structure compared to elemental Pd. Detailed studies have been
carried out for PdGa where covalent interactions between Pd and
Ga lead to a shift of the Pd 4d band center away from the Fermi le-
vel, which has been conﬁrmed by XPS and NMR studies [37,38]. An
increasing d-band shift away from the Fermi level with increasing
gallium content was proven for Pd2Ga, PdGa and Pd3Ga7 by XP spec-
troscopy in the valence band region [40]. The partially covalent
chemical bonding in these materials leads to an enhanced struc-
tural stability suppressing a dynamic subsurface chemistry. PdGa
exhibits an ordered crystal structure where Pd atoms are fully sur-
rounded by Ga atoms resulting in expanded Pd–Pd distances com-
pared to elemental Pd [39]. Various bulk and surface sensitive
methods, applied ex situ and under reaction conditions, like XRD,
EXAFS, DTA, and XPS, supported the stability of PdGa and Pd3Ga7
and emphasized the similarity between bulk and surface [34–36].
Theoretical calculations supported the superior catalytic properties
of PdGa systems [19].
A signiﬁcant d-band shift is also observed for Pd2Ga [40] but,
different from PdGa, Pd2Ga does not show a perfect site isolation.
Pd2Ga crystallizes in the Co2Si-type structure (space group Pnma
No. 62, orthorhombic, see Fig. 1) [41]. For the stoichiometric com-
position two symmetrically nonequivalent positions of Pd are both
surrounded by eight Pd atoms with distances of 2.82–2.99 Å, which
is slightly enlarged compared to elemental Pd (2.75 Å) [42]. Five Ga
atoms with Pd–Ga distances between 2.54 and 2.84 Å complete the
ﬁrst coordination sphere. In addition, due to the existence of a
homogeneity range, a part of Ga atoms may be substituted by Pd.
Thus, there is only a partial isolation of Pd by Ga in the ﬁrst coor-
dination sphere, and triangular arrangements of Pd – similar to ele-
mental palladium – are still present. In contrast to PdGa and
Pd3Ga7, the homogeneity range of Pd2Ga is signiﬁcant homogene-
ity range (Pd2+xGa1x, 0.04 6 x 6 0.02 at 500 C). Wannek and
Harbrecht [43] draw up the structural relationship between
the Co2Si-type like Pd2+xGa1x and a fcc solid solution PdxGa1x.
However, a metallurgically prepared powdered Pd2Ga sample, pre-
pared by direct reaction of the elements, and without pre-treat-
ment prior to catalytic test also shows a high selectivity in the
hydrogenation of acetylene and provides the same long-term sta-
bility [44] as in the case of PdGa and Pd3Ga7. In contrast to the
more Ga-rich materials, one advantage of Pd2Ga is that it can be
obtained comparably easy way in a highly active nanostructured
form by co-reduction in Ga oxide supported Pd. For instance, a
Pd2Ga/MgO/MgGa2O4 catalyst was shown to maintain the higher
selectivity compared to monometallic Pd nanoparticles [45]. How-
ever, in the latter case, an unusual activation period of this catalyst
over 40 h has been observed before stable performance was
reached. Such dynamic behavior might be related to an in situ
change in the material surface. Haghofer et al. [46] found a poor
long-term stability of supported nanoparticulate Pd2Ga in metha-
nol steam reforming due to decomposition of the intermetallic sur-
face under these conditions. In a combined in situ XRD, in situ XAS,
and CO-FTIR study [47] under H2 and O2 atmosphere, the in situ
formation of hydrides could be excluded, but it was shown that
the surface undergoes oxidative decomposition in O2 forming Ga
oxides and elemental Pd or a Ga depleted Pd2Ga phase. Evidence
for the structural disturbance of the surface due to oxidative
decomposition was also reported in a HR-TEM study of unsup-
ported Pd2Ga nanoparticles [48]. The close structural relationship
between the compounds makes a straightforward distinction by
HR-TEM challenging. However, larger accumulations of elemental
Pd were not observed on the surface but an ordered and potentially
fcc structured, only slightly Pd-enriched Pd2Ga phase was sug-
gested. These observations induce doubts with respect to the pro-
nounced stability also of the unsupported bulk Pd-Ga intermetallic
compounds. The ﬁrst experiment to determine the catalytic
properties of powdered, unsupported Pd2Ga and PdGa in the li-
quid-phase hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, which were partly
already reported in [49], did not show signiﬁcant differences in
selectivity towards styrene compared to elemental Pd powder
(see Part II of this work [50]). This observation further suggests
that the modiﬁed catalytic properties of the intermetallic com-
pounds PdGa and Pd2Ga, whose surfaces were reported to be un-
changed before and during the gas-phase hydrogenation of
acetylene at high temperatures (T = 200 C), are not present under
the conditions of liquid-phase hydrogenation at room temperature
and provoked us to study in detail the stability of pure, metallurgi-
cally prepared Pd2Ga in different chemical environments.
Here, we address the question whether Pd2Ga with its strong
intrinsic modiﬁcation of the d-band can transform its properties
into chemical reactivity. In Part I of this work, several bulk and

surface sensitive methods were applied with special focus on the
resistance against oxidation, participation of subsurface chemistry,
and its mechanical stability. Therefore, metallurgically prepared
bulk samples of Pd2Ga in the absence of supports or modiﬁers have
been applied as model catalysts. This allowed studying the stability
of the intermetallic compound and the potential of its intrinsically
modiﬁed (electronic) structure for application. Part II [50] focuses
on the correlation of the surface structure with the catalytic prop-
erties in the selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene in the li-
quid phase.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Synthesis of Pd2Ga
Pd2Ga was synthesized by melting stoichiometric amounts of
Pd granules (Chempur, 99.95%) and Ga pellets (Chempur, 99.99%)
in a glassy carbon crucible in a high-frequency induction furnace
under Ar atmosphere in a glove box (O2 < 1 ppm, H2O < 1 ppm).
The obtained regulus was annealed at 800 C in an evacuated
quartz glass ampoule for three days. A metallographic specimen
was prepared by cutting 1-mm-thick cylinders from the regulus.
The slice was polished and stored under Ar. To obtain a ﬁne pow-
der of Pd2Ga, the material was either ground in air in an agate mor-
tar or the material was powdered in air in a swing mill (Retzsch,
MM 200, 4 ml WC pot with two WC balls, 25 Hz) two times for
30 min with a break of 20 min. The absence of any additional
phases was veriﬁed by X-ray powder diffraction and, in the case
of the metallographic specimen, by optical microscopy and scan-
ning electron microscopy.
2.2. X-ray powder diffraction
For ex situ X-ray powder diffraction, the sample was placed on a
3 lm Kapton foil covered with Vaseline. The measurement was ta-
ken on an image plate Guinier camera (G670, Huber, Cu Ka1 radi-
ation, k = 1.54056 Å, curved Ge monochromator, 3 < 2H < 100,
CCD detector). For determination of lattice parameters, the powder
was mixed with LaB6 as internal standard (a = 4.15695(6) Å) prior
to spreading on the Kapton foil. In situ X-ray powder diffraction
was performed on a on a STOE theta/theta X-ray diffractometer
(Cu Ka1+2 radiation, secondary graphite monochromator, scintilla-
tion counter) equipped with an Anton Paar XRK 900 in situ reactor
chamber. The gas feed was mixed by means of Bronkhorst mass-
ﬂow controllers, using helium as inert balance gas at a total ﬂow
rate of 100 ml/min. The efﬂuent gas composition was monitored
with a Pfeiffer OmniStar quadrupole mass spectrometer.
XRD data were evaluated by total pattern analysis using the TO-
PAS software [51]. The ﬁtting procedure was based on the Rietveld
method [52] using the Pd2Ga crystal structure model of Kovnir
et al. [41].
2.3. Metallography and scanning electron microscopy
For metallographic analysis, samples were embedded in a con-
ductive polymer (Polyfast, Struers), abraded with SiC paper and
subsequently
polished
with
diamond
paste
(minimum
size
0.25 lm). The single-phase nature of the material was conﬁrmed
by light microscopy (Axioplan 2, Zeiss) and scanning electron
microscopy (Cameca microprobe SX100). WDX analysis was per-
formed using a PdGa standard with known chemical composition
(determined by ICP-OES) as reference. The particle morphology
and homogeneity of the powdered samples were investigated by
scanning electron microscopy using a Hitachi S4800 equipped with
an EDAX Genesis 4000 detector.
2.4. Surface area characterization
The speciﬁc surface area was determined using Kr physisorp-
tion at 77 K in a Quantachrome AsiQ setup by multi-point BET.
Prior to the measurements, samples where pre-treated either for
19 h in vacuum at ambient temperature or for 5 h at 400 C in
5% H2/Ar.
2.5. Transmission electron microscopy
A Philips CM200FEG microscope operated at 200 kV and
equipped with a ﬁeld emission gun, Gatan imaging ﬁlter, and en-
ergy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer was used. The coefﬁcient of
spherical aberration was Cs = 1.35 mm, and the information limit
was better than 0.18 nm. High-resolution images with a pixel size
of 0.016 nm were taken at the magniﬁcation of 1.083.000 with a
CCD camera, and selected areas were processed to obtain the
power spectra (square of the Fourier transform of the image),
which were used for phase identiﬁcation by measuring interplanar
distances (±0.5%) and angles (±0.5).
2.6. In situ thermal analysis
In situ DTA/TG/MS measurements were performed with a Net-
zsch STA 449 Jupiter system connected to a Pfeiffer Omnistar 300
mass spectrometer. A total of 248 mg of milled Pd2Ga was
weighted under air and placed inside a corundum crucible. The
temperature program is described in the results and discussion
section. The total gas ﬂow during the measurement was either
40 ml/min He or a mixture of 5 ml/min H2 in 45 ml/min He.
2.7. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
Near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [53]
was performed at the ISISS beamline at Bessy II, Helmholtz-Zentrum
Berlin. The metallographic specimen was prepared under Ar and
transferred to the XPS chamber in a transport chamber without air
contact. Approximately 250 mg of powdered samples was prepared
by pressing the powder in air to a pellet with a diameter of 8 mm and
a thickness of about 1 mm. Pellets of as-prepared milled samples
were introduced with air contact to the XPS chamber, while pellets
of pre-reduced powder were annealed and reduced again for 1 h at
400 C in 5% H2/Ar and were subsequently transferred under Ar to
the chamber. XPS measurements were performed under UHV
(107 mbar) at temperatures between 25 C and 400 C or in situ in
different atmospheres (H2: Westfalengas, 99.999%; O2: Westfalen-
gas, 99.999%;) with a maximum total pressure of 1 mbar. Ga 3d, Pd
3d, and C 1s core levels as well as the valence band region were re-
corded. Spectra were taken with various excitation energies
corresponding to kinetic electron energies of 145 eV, 385 eV or
785 eV. Using 3 times the inelastic mean free path given for elemen-
tal Pd [54], these kinetic energies refer to an information depth of
1.3, 2.0, and 3.4 nm as a rough estimation. Analysis of the spectra
was performed by the software CASA XPS [55]. For details, concern-
ing the peak ﬁtting see Supporting Information. Quantiﬁcation was
performed using energy-dependent cross sections from Yeh and Lin-
dau [56]. The peak intensities are normalized to the incoming pho-
ton ﬂux.
3. Results and discussion
In the present study, three different kinds of Pd2Ga samples
were investigated: (1) a metallographic specimen, cut from com-
pact regulus, (2) milled powder, and (3) ground powder. The sur-
face of the metallographic specimen was polished before analysis

and handled exclusively under Ar atmosphere in a glove box. The
ground and the milled Pd2Ga samples were investigated in the
as-prepared state. Milled Pd2Ga was subsequently subjected to dif-
ferent pre-treatments.
3.1. Characterization and stability of the bulk of Pd2Ga
Single-phase Pd2Ga was successfully prepared from the ele-
ments, as proven by XRD analysis of the ground sample (Fig. 2).
Metallographic analysis of the cross section of the regulus further
veriﬁes the absence of any additional minority phases (see Fig. SI
1). Inhomogeneities were not detected for the polycrystalline
metallographic specimen in the SEM analysis. The composition of
the specimen according to WDX is Pd66.2(±0.4)Ga33.8(±0.1). The lattice
parameters of the ground Pd2Ga are a = 5.4809(2), b = 4.0556(1)
and c = 7.7895(1) Å, which is in good agreement with the reported
literature data [41]. To decrease the particles size and increase the
speciﬁc surface area, the material was milled in a swing mill. As
shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2d, the milled powder provides, com-
pared to the ground powder, signiﬁcantly broader reﬂections. This
is likely caused by the stress due to the harsh mechanical load dur-
ing milling as already reported earlier in the case of PdGa [35]. The
milled powder still remains single phase, which was also con-
ﬁrmed by a Rietveld reﬁnement (not shown), and the lattice
parameters show only marginal changes (Table 1). According to
the SEM images (Fig. SI 2), the particle size is in the range of 0.5–
40 lm, and smaller particles cover larger ones due to agglomera-
tion. As determined by Kr physisorption, the speciﬁc surface area
of the powder is 0.27 ± 0.01 m2 g1. Elemental mapping in the
SEM microscope reveals a homogeneous distribution of Pd and
Ga (Fig. SI 2b). The average composition of the powder according
to EDX is Pd68(±3)Ga32(±3) in reasonable agreement with the WDX
results obtained on the regulus. Small particles of tungsten carbide
were also detected in very low quantity originating from abrasion
during milling. After 4 h of temperature treatment at 400 C in
reducing atmosphere (5% H2/Ar, 100 ml/min), the XRD reﬂections
become sharp again reaching similar full width at half maximum
(FWHM) values as by crushing the sample (Fig. 2d). This is ex-
pected since the melting point of Pd2Ga is about 1200 C and
400 C lies above the Hüttig temperature where structural healing
becomes a fast process [57]. SEM images (Fig. SI 2c) reveal a some-
what lower amount of small particles, but no dramatic changes in
particle size and morphology. Also, the speciﬁc surface area
remains unchanged (0.28 ± 0.01 m2 g1). Kohlmann [58] studied
the structural stability of Pd2Ga against hydrogen by ex situ XRD
and in situ DTA under harsh conditions (pH2 = 375 bar, T = 250 C,
t = 60 h) and found no hints for the formation of hydrides. Also,
Haghofer et al. [47] found no hint for the formation of hydrides
by in situ EXAFS experiments for a Pd2Ga/Ga2O3 catalyst at room
temperature. Because the stability of hydrides is strongly depen-
dent on the temperature, we studied the in situ stability of the
milled Pd2Ga in H2 atmosphere by DTA/TG/MS (Fig. 3) under ele-
vated, but
comparably
mild
conditions.

panied by H2O formation due to surface oxide reduction. Bottom: No further phase
transformations were detected also during the long-time treatment of the powder

surface-adsorbed H2O at 200 C in pure He atmosphere, during the
second heating cycle in 10% H2/He (total pressure 1 bar), an exo-
thermic peak with an onset temperature at 180 C is observed,
which is accompanied by a mass loss of 310 lg and H2O formation.
We assign the water formation to the reduction in surface Ga
oxide, which is reduced to metallic Ga corresponding to 1% of
the total Ga content. Further signals could not be detected under
these conditions when heating to temperatures up to 500 C and
cooling under He atmosphere again. Also, a subsequent long-time
treatment in 10% H2/He with stepwise increased temperature from
50 C to 150 C, i.e., in a temperature range where hydride forma-
tion and decomposition on elemental Pd take place, revealed no
signiﬁcant thermal effects due to phase transformations. The bulk
stability was furthermore investigated by in situ XRD in 100% He,
25% H2/He, and 20% O2/He (details see Figs. SI 3 and 4). No hints
for phase transformations of the bulk in He and H2 were observed
during stepwise heating to 400 C and subsequent cooling in agree-
ment with the DTA/TG/MS measurement. Decomposition of the
bulk starts at approximately 300 C when treated in 20% O2/He
resulting in a mixture of Pd2Ga, Pd5Ga3, Pd, and PdO. Formed Ga
oxide is probably amorphous and not detectable by XRD.
In summary, the bulk of Pd2Ga provides a high mechanical as well
as chemical stability. Independent on the degree of mechanical load
(polishing < grinding < milling), no decomposition or segregation
could be observed. Milling induces a signiﬁcant increase in distur-
bance of the crystal structure which can be easily reversed by
annealing. Pd2Ga is inert in H2 atmosphere against the formation
of hydrides and starts to oxidize in 20% O2 atmosphere not below
300 C.
3.2. Characterization and stability of the surface
To investigate the surface of the Pd2Ga powder, XPS and
high-resolution TEM were applied. XPS is an integral method and
provides information about the electronic structure, the chemical
composition, and the oxidation state of the material in the
near-surface region. Using synchrotron radiation with variable pho-
ton energies allows measurements at different information depths.
On the other hand, HR-TEM gives a complementary and direct local
view on the micro- and nanostructure of the surface of the particles.
3.2.1. XPS investigation of the metallographic specimen
Fig. 4 represents the Pd 3d core-level XP spectra of the
as-prepared
metallographic
specimen
of
Pd2Ga,
which
was
recorded under UHV and ambient temperature as well as after
heating to 400 C. Additional reference spectra obtained from a
Pd foil are also shown. The ﬁts of the specimen heated to 400 C
and the Pd foil are shown in Fig. SI 5. An asymmetric Pd 3d5/2 peak
of elemental Pd located at a binding energy of 335.1 eV is observed
for the palladium foil in agreement with the literature [59]. On the
other hand, the Pd 3d5/2 peak of the Pd2Ga specimen, heated to
400 C, is signiﬁcantly shifted towards a higher binding energy of
336.0 eV (335.9 eV at EKin = 145 eV) accompanied by a loss of
asymmetry. The core-level shift is in agreement with previous re-
sults for supported Pd2Ga [45,46] but – remarkably – as high as re-
ported earlier for the more Ga-rich unsupported PdGa sample [34].
We attribute the slightly lower binding energy obtained at the low-
est excitation energy (highest surface sensitivity) to a further sur-
face core-level shift. The asymmetry of metallic core levels
originates from the probability of excitation of electron–hole pairs
at the Fermi level (ﬁnal state effects) [33,60] and is thus correlated
with the number of electronic states at the Fermi level. Fig. 5 com-
pares the observed valence bands (with the main contribution of
the Pd 4d states) and the Ga 3d core-level spectra for the different
samples at an excitation energy of 710 eV. Compared to elemental
Pd, the d-band center of Pd2Ga, heated to 400 C, is signiﬁcantly
shifted away from the Fermi level towards higher binding energies
resulting in a lower density of states at the Fermi edge, which is the
consequence of intermetallic compound formation and the associ-
ated ﬁlling of the 4d states of Pd as it was reported for PdGa [34].
The Ga 3d spectra of the Pd2Ga specimen, heated to 400 C, reveal a
doublet at approximately 18.4 and 18.8 eV, which can be assigned
to (inter)-metallic Ga [61]. A weak signal at 20.3–20.8 eV corre-
sponds to oxidized Ga, whose atomic proportion increases from
1% to 9% with decreasing information depth (see Table 2). The ra-
tios of Pd to metallic Ga are in the range of 2.3–1.6 depending on
the kinetic energy of the photons; thus, they are close to the stoi-
chiometric composition of 2:1, conﬁrming the presence of an al-
most clean intermetallic surface under these conditions. In this
respect, it has to be taken into account that the quantiﬁcation
using theoretical cross sections is not accurate enough to give a
precise absolute ratio of the elements in particular for very low
kinetic energies, while relative changes in element ratio of the
sample with different information depths or due to changes in
the conditions in the XPS chamber can be accurately determined.
The Pd 3d5/2 peak of the as-prepared metallographic specimen
(before heating) is still almost symmetric, but broader, and was ob-
served at a binding energy of 335.6–335.7 eV (see Fig. 4), as it was

reported earlier for unsupported Pd2Ga [40]. It is thus located be-
tween that obtained for elemental Pd and the clean intermetallic
surface. This difference is also reﬂected in the valence band
(Fig. 5), showing an intermediate structure with an increased den-
sity of states close to the Fermi edge. The Ga 3d spectra reveal a sig-
niﬁcant amount of Ga3+ (increasing from 21% to 60% with
increasing
surface
sensitivity,

2).
Lower

Gad+
(0 < d < 3) species were not observed. While the ratio of Pd to the to-
tal content of Ga is between 1.7 and 1.6, the ratios of Pd to metallicGa
increase from 2.2 to 4.0 with increasing surface sensitivity. This indi-
cates oxidative decomposition of the IMC resulting in oxidized Ga
species and a Pd-enriched metallic surface state, which must have
happened during preparation and/or storing of the sample under
Ar atmosphere due to the presence of traces of O2 and H2O. The nat-
ure of the excess Pd is unclear. In Fig. SI 6, we show in detail, that it is
not possible to describe the resulting Pd 3d5/2 peak by a linear com-
bination of the symmetric peak for clean Pd2Ga and the strongly
asymmetric signal for elemental bulk Pd. Additional ﬁt components
are necessary to describe the obtained spectra, whose implementa-
tion is subjected to a certain arbitrariness due to the peak overlap of
the components and the lack of a suitable reference for the unknown
structural nature of the formed Pd species. The peak ﬁtting (Fig. SI 6)
and the quantiﬁcation of C 1s (Table SI 1) exclude a Pd–C phase,
which would also show a Pd 3d peak between those of Pd2Ga and
elemental Pd. We will see in the following sections that this ‘‘inter-
mediate’’ electronic structure of (not too heavily decomposed) sam-
ples is variable and depends on the amount of excess Pd. It is
plausible that, deviating from the phase diagram [62], the (not nec-
essarily equilibrated) near-surface region of Pd2Ga is able to accom-
modate much more Pd, leading to smooth transitions in the
electronic and structural state between Pd2Ga and Pd. Furthermore,
it is likely that additional intensity in the Pd 3d spectra originates
from the presence of small elemental Pd particles or clusters, giving
rise to size-related core-level shift with similar extent as with Pd2Ga
[59]. We will thus restrict the discussion of the Pd 3d spectra in the
following on the position and the FWHM of the Pd 3d5/2 signal,
which is a measure of the degree of surface decomposition into oxi-
dized Ga and Ga-depleted Pd. The observed lines will not be ﬁtted
due to the questionable reliability of the derived structural data.
Heating of the specimen to 400 C in dynamic vacuum is sufﬁ-
cient for a reforming of an IMC-terminated surface. An explanation
for the high reducing potential of the dynamic vacuum at higher
temperatures can be given by analyzing the C 1s spectra (Fig. SI
7). Before heating, a broad peak at around 284.9 eV is observed
indicating the presence of hydrocarbons on the surface, which is
an unavoidable feature in our in situ XPS chamber. After heating
of the specimen, the C 1s signal is weaker and asymmetric, and
its peak shifts signiﬁcantly to a lower binding energy of about
284.2 eV, which is a clear evidence for dehydrogenation of hydro-
carbons [63]. Thus, the reduction in the surface Ga oxide in the XPS
chamber is likely related to this process.
3.2.2. XPS and HR-TEM investigations of milled Pd2Ga in the as-
prepared state
The Pd 3d XP spectrum of milled Pd2Ga is shown in Fig. 6. A
very broad and asymmetric peak indicates a decomposition of
the intermetallic compound at the surface to a large extent. The
asymmetric peak shape and the shift of the peak position to lower
binding energies with increasing surface sensitivity from 335.5 to
335.2 eV indicate that mainly elemental Pd is present at the
decomposed surface. In the most surface-sensitive Pd 3d spectrum,
a long tail of the peak to higher binding energies represents unde-
ﬁned species, which are probably due to oxidized Pd species [64]. It
is noted that also intermetallic Pd–Ga compounds with a higher Ga
content show peaks at similar positions, but these are unlikely to
coexist with oxidized Ga at the surface. Finally, charging effects
might additionally broaden the line shape, and residues of inter-
metallic Pd2Ga likely also contribute to the spectra as indicated
by the small contribution of (inter)-metallic Ga, visible in the Ga
3d spectra in Fig. 5. The total Pd:Ga ratio shows a vast excess of
Ga (Table 3), which probably origins from segregation of Ga due
to oxidation during the mechanical treatment. However, most of
the Ga is oxidized and the ratio between Pd and metallic Ga is by
far higher than the nominal composition 2:1, showing that the oxi-
dation of Ga species leaves a Ga-depleted Pd phase at the surface of
the Pd2Ga particles. Accordingly, the valence band (Fig. 5) of as-
prepared milled Pd2Ga clearly resembles that of elemental Pd
and not that of clean Pd2Ga recorded after heating of the metallo-
graphic specimen.
In contrast to the metallographic sample, for milled powder the
reducing potential in the XPS chamber or the amount of reducing
carbonaceous deposits is not sufﬁcient for a complete reduction
in the thick surface oxide layer to reform the intermetallic Pd2Ga.
The high temperature treatment at 400 C in dynamic vacuum
leads to a shift of the Pd 3d5/2 peak to 335.7 eV, which becomes
nearly symmetric but shows still an enhanced broadness. After
air exposure for 10 min the sample was measured again. The Ga
oxide content increases slightly without observing a shift of the
Pd 3d peaks. After storing the sample two months under air no

further changes in XP spectra of Ga 3d and Pd 3d could be ob-
served, indicating that the surface readily passivates without fur-
ther mechanical load and the associated energy input.
HR-TEM images of the Pd2Ga particles (Fig. 7) provide a closer
look on the local structure and morphology of the surface of the
particles. The bulk of the material consists of crystalline Pd2Ga par-
ticles, which is in agreement with the XRD result. The particles are
surrounded by a non-uniform amorphous over-layer, which –
according to XPS – mainly consists of oxidized Ga species. In this
over-layer, crystalline nanoparticles with a diameter of up to
5 nm are embedded, and in some case, elemental Pd as well as Pd2-
Ga could be unambiguously identiﬁed. However, Pd and Pd2Ga
cannot be easily distinguished by the diffraction pattern even in
atomic resolution TEM because of the close relation of the struc-
tures [43].
3.2.3. XPS and HR-TEM investigations of ex situ pre-reduced milled
Pd2Ga
Because the maximum H2 pressure in the XPS chamber is lim-
ited to 1 mbar and a full reduction in a thick oxide layer was
not possible under these conditions, two ex situ pre-reduced sam-
ples (5% H2/Ar, 1 bar total pressure, 4 h, 400 C) were transferred
under Ar into the XPS chamber. The reduction temperature was
clearly higher than the reduction peak observed in the DTA/TG/
MS measurement (Fig. 3) with an onset temperature of 180 C
which was assigned to the reduction in the surface oxide layer.
The higher temperature allows also a structural healing of the
intermetallic surface. One sample was cooled down in Ar after
reduction, and the other one was cooled down in 5% H2/Ar. In both
cases, the surface stoichiometry is close to the nominal composi-
tion of 2:1 (Table 4), which can be explained by the absence of
any mechanical treatment after high-temperature reduction and,
as will be shown below, by a mild passivation process. In the latter
sample, only about 20% Ga is in an oxidized state (on the most sur-
face sensitive XPS measurement, see Fig. 9 b) and the Pd 3d5/2 peak
is located at 335.85 eV. Apparently this thin passivation layer is
unavoidable if the environment falls below a certain reduction po-
tential. The reason therefore is likely the uncoordinated sites at the
outermost surface with reduced covalent stabilization, which are
extremely reactive towards oxygen impurities. In situ H2 treatment

of the sample, leading to the reduction in the surface Ga oxide (see
Table 4, Fig. 9), indicates no further shift or change in peak shape
and width of the Pd 3d peak and also the valence band structure
remain unaltered. This implies that the slightly lower binding en-
ergy (compared to 336.0 eV in the more bulk sensitive measure-
ments, compare Table 2) originates from a surface core-level
shift, rather than the inﬂuence of an overlapping Pd component.
However, the presence of 20% Ga oxide before in situ reduction
must involve a Ga-depletion of the remaining Pd near-surface spe-
cies. On the one hand, Pd2Ga provides a certain homogeneity range,
and the formed Ga oxide passivation layer could originate from
segregation from the subsurface or the bulk, and thus, the IMC
might balance this loss of metallic Ga. On the other hand, if Ga
from the outermost Pd2Ga layers is oxidized, this would leave be-
hind very small Pd accumulations. As already discussed, small Pd
clusters might provide a rather similar electronic structure com-
pared to Pd2Ga [59]. Furthermore, it is clearly visible in Fig. SI 6,
that also small concentrations of bulk Pd (1%) are hardly detect-
able by XPS in our case. Thus, small amounts of elemental Pd are
likely to be still present.
The surface is more decomposed, if the sample is cooled in the
absence of H2 under 100% Ar atmosphere (O2 and H2O concentra-
tion <100 ppb) after the ex situ pre-reduction. It results in a stron-
ger oxidation of about 75% of Ga (Fig. 9a), and a slightly
asymmetric Pd 3d5/2 peak is observed at 335.5 eV (see Fig. 10). This
intermediate core-level shift is lower than observed for the
as-prepared metallographic specimen or the milled sample heated
to 400 C. That lower core-level shift is consistent with the larger
excess of Pd compared to metallic Ga (7.5:1) but eludes again a
reference-based ﬁtting analysis. The difference of the electronic
structure is also clearly visible by the different valence band fea-
tures (see Fig. 8b and c). Cooling a pre-reduced sample in Ar, re-
sults already in a higher occupation of the d-band close to the
Fermi level. These differences strikingly clarify the sensitivity of
the intermetallic surface towards oxidative decomposition once
the temperature is high and the reducing potential of the environ-
ment is not sufﬁcient to outweigh the oxophilicity of the surface
Ga species even under condition where gas-phase O2 or H2O are
present only on a minimum impurity level.
The corresponding HR-TEM images (Fig. 11) of the pre-reduced
particles cooled down in 5% H2/Ar show again crystalline particles
consisting of Pd2Ga in the bulk which is surrounded by a thinner
and more uniform amorphous layer.
3.2.4. In situ H2 treatment of pre-reduced milled Pd2Ga and re-
oxidation
Treatment in 1 mbar H2 at 400 C in the XPS chamber allows
removing the oxide layers almost completely from both (cooled
in 5% H2/Ar and in 100% Ar) ex situ pre-reduced samples (Fig. 9c).
Henceforth, also the sample cooled down in 100% Ar provides the
electronic structure of Pd 3d core level (Fig. 10) and valence band
(Fig. 8e) of pure Pd2Ga at the surface. However, analyzing the ratio
between Pd and Ga both samples is subjected to variations in their
surface stoichiometry. The Ar-cooled sample shows an increase in

the Pd:Ga ratio to about 2.8 at 400 C in 1 mbar H2 and a pro-
nounced decrease to 0.9 when changing to 50 C in UHV. The H2-
cooled sample also shows a by far too low ratio of about 1.2, in this
case even at 400 C in 1 mbar H2 atmosphere. These changes are
not associated with variations in the Pd 3d peak proﬁle or position,
which
excludes
the
formation
of
more
Ga-rich
or
Ga-less
near-surface alloys. For the latter sample, the ratio between Pd
and the total content of Ga was much higher at 1.7 when the spec-
tra were recorded at higher kinetic energies of 375 or 785 eV. Be-
cause the binding energy of elemental, polycrystalline Ga is very
similar to intermetallic Ga [65], and the resolution of the Ga 3d
peaks is not sufﬁcient to distinguish between both, segregation
of elemental Ga to the surface is the most likely explanation. How-
ever, the ratio stays constant near 1:1 even after abrupt exposure
and store of 5 h in air. Since this phenomenon is only observed
after reduction in the XPS chamber under reduced pressure and
not after ex situ pre-reduction, we currently have no explanation
for this observation and speculate that this manifestation of dy-
namic behavior is caused by the special low-pressure conditions
in the XPS chamber.
The general sensitivity of the surface redox processes of Pd2Ga
on the exact conditions and the dependence of its reversible char-
acter on the sample history is also observed during re-oxidation. If
the sample without a protecting oxide layer is abruptly exposed to
air, the amount of oxidized Ga increases to more than 40% and the
peak shape of Pd 3d changes and loses its narrow and symmetric
proﬁle (Fig. 10). It is indeed the sole exception, where the observed
line proﬁle can approximately be described by a linear combina-
tion of 80% Pd2Ga and 20% bulk Pd (Fig. 6d) evidencing the forma-
tion of elemental Pd as it was already assumed by Haghofer et al.
[47]. The situation is different if the sample is carefully oxidized.
Slow in situ treatment with a stepwise increase in O2 and H2O (ra-
tio 1:1) partial pressure up to 0.6 mbar total pressure at 40 C
within some hours resulted in oxidation of only approximately
25% of Ga at the outermost surface, which is not accompanied with
a signiﬁcant d-band shift or increase in FWHM of the Pd3d peak
(Fig. 10), and a subsequent air exposure did not lead to further oxi-
dation, indicating the formation of a thin passivation layer by very
slow oxidation.
4. Summary
In this study, we investigated the bulk and the surface stability
of the intermetallic compound Pd2Ga. The bulk of Pd2Ga provides a
high chemical stability. Pd2Ga is inert against hydride formation at
low as well as at high temperatures. Oxidative decomposition of
the bulk is not observed before 300 C in 20% O2/Ar atmosphere.
The bulk material is furthermore highly resistant against mechan-
ical load and remains single-phase material even after milling. The
induced strain effects are easily reversible by a temperature treat-
ment at 400 C. These observations are in agreement with the re-
sults for PdGa and Pd3Ga7. However, the high stability of the
bulk of Pd2Ga cannot be transferred to the surface. The dynamics
of the surface are complex and depend on the pre-treatment and
the actual conditions, which is summarized in Fig. 12. A metallo-
graphic specimen was introduced as reference sample for the
XPS studies. The polishing and subsequent storage of this sample
under Ar atmosphere at room temperature is already sufﬁcient
for partial oxidative decomposition resulting in a Pd-enriched
metallic state partially covered by Ga oxide (Fig. 12A). According
to the XPS analysis, small Pd accumulations, rather than bulk Pd,
are present. These Pd particles likely act as nuclei for the reforma-
tion of the IMC at the surface by annealing of the specimen to
400 C in dynamic vacuum (Fig. 12B). The Ga oxide reduction is
likely assisted by a Pd-induced dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon
Fig. 11. HR-TEM of Pd2Ga powder after pre-reduction at 400 C. These particles consist of large domains and are surrounded only by a thin amorphous over-layer. Beside
possible contaminations in the microscope, according to the XP spectra Ga oxide contribute to the thin over-layer.

reduction and cooling under 100% Ar leads to signiﬁcant disruption of the surface
(blue curve) as well as the abrupt exposure to air of an freshly reduced sample
(green). (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the

surface impurities in the XPS chamber resulting in carbonaceous
species at the surface. Mechanical load during milling leads to en-
hanced surface segregation and oxidation of Ga. The surface of an
air-milled sample is nanostructured and consists of Pd, Pd oxide,
and Pd2Ga nanoparticles embedded in an inhomogeneous Ga oxide
layer (Fig. 12C). The annealing to 400 C in dynamic vacuum is not
sufﬁcient for a complete reformation of the IMC at the surface
(Fig. 12D), whereas under atmospheric pressure, the oxide over-
layer reduces at 180 C in 10% H2/He. The powder was thus (with re-
gard to its application in liquid-phasehydrogenation,see Part II [50])
ex situ pre-reduced at 400 C in 5% H2/Ar and, presumably, under
these conditions the surface is a clean termination of the bulk
(Fig. 12E). After cooling the sample under this reducing atmosphere
and careful handling under Ar, we observed the Pd 3d core level as
well as the valence band spectra compatible with that of the clean
intermetallic surface within the detection limit (Fig. 12F). However,
a thin passivation layer is unavoidable due to the structural destabi-
lization of Pd2Ga – likely a consequence of the uncoordinated Ga
sites of the termination layer. According to the previous literature
[47,48] and our observed activity in hydrogenation, presented in
Part II of this work [50], we suggest that the oxide layer is not homo-
geneous. It is possible that Pd2Ga tolerates some loss of the metallic
Ga, due to its homogeneity range, but traces of elemental Pd could
still be present. The situation is much clearer when the sample is
cooled under Ar after reduction (Fig. 12G): In absence of H2 at high
temperature, smallest traces of O2 or H2O are enough for strong
decomposition and segregation of the surface even in absence of
mechanical load. The in situ H2 treatment under low-pressure condi-
tions of these samples leads to dynamic enrichment of metallic Ga on
top of the surface, apparently without the formation of a more
Ga-rich IMC, e.g., PdGa (Fig. 12H). The mechanism of this process
is unclear, but possibly it is an equilibration of the IMC-terminated
surface. However, despite the Ga enrichment, different surfaces
were observed after oxidative treatments (Fig. 12I and J): If the
material is suddenly exposed to air, this resulted indeed in the par-
tial formation of metallic Pd. In the case of careful, slow oxidization
at room temperature under reduced pressure only a thin Ga oxide
layer is formed. This passivation layer does not grow after air expo-
sure. Within the detection limit, no further disturbance of the under-
lying IMC was observed.
The surface of Pd2Ga turned out to be highly dynamic. A passiv-
ation layer forms rapidly as soon as the environment loses a certain
reduction potential. The stability of the passivation layer and the
degree of disturbance of the (electronic) structure of the surface
strongly depend on the pre-treatment and the environment, i.e.,
mechanical load, partial pressure of oxidants, total pressure, and
temperature. Thus, the behavior of the intermetallic Ga in Pd2Ga
is comparable to pure elements with high oxophilicity like elemen-
tal Ga, Al, Zn, or Ti where a passivating layer is rapidly formed
without further attack of the bulk. In sharp contrast to the pure ele-
ments, the oxidized over-layer of Pd2Ga can be removed by reduc-
tion in hydrogen at relatively low temperatures, which is likely an
effect of the presence of ﬁnely dispersed excess Pd, which activates
H2 by dissociative chemisorption. The exact nature of the excess Pd
could in most instances not be clariﬁed in this study and depends
presumably
also
on
the
pre-treatment.
The
presence
of
Pd-enriched phases with intermediate electronic and structural
state between Pd and Pd2Ga could explain the observations. Fur-
thermore, it is likely that small Pd agglomerates with a small size
distribution are formed on the surface, which is partially embed-
ded in a Ga oxide matrix. Their spectroscopic motifs (core-level
shift, reduced density of states at the Fermi level) are compatible
with the observations and are unfortunately largely indistinguish-
able from Pd2Ga itself [59]. It can be assumed that the catalytic
properties of decomposed Pd2Ga surfaces are dominated by this
segregated Pd species rather than by the IMC itself.
5. Conclusion
Our study represents a detailed investigationof the surface stabil-
ity of the Pd2Ga, which shows high selectivity in the hydrogenation

areas) is always stable. Ga oxide is shown in yellow color. A layer of varying thickness at the interface of the bulk and the Ga oxide, shown in purple, marks slightly Pd-
enriched Pd2Ga due to Ga surface segregation. The gray cover visible in (H) should indicate the irreversible enrichment of metallic Ga on top of the surface during in situ H2
treatment in the XPS chamber. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

of acetylene in the gas phase as previously reported. Pd and Ga are
chemically very different metals, and the reaction between both re-
sults in the formation of covalent bonds. Contrariwise to alloys, the
covalent bonds strongly alter the crystal and the electronic structure.
Compared to elemental Pd, the valence band of Pd–Ga intermetallic
compounds possesses a structure comparable to a coinage metal
with a clear shift of the d-band center away from the Fermi level.
These covalent bonds between Pd and Ga, however, are not strong
enough to stabilize the material’s surface against oxidizing agents
and against mechanical load. If the reduction potential falls below
a certain value, a passivating over-layer forms and the surface be-
comes chemically different. The bulk, however, is protected against
further decomposition. The electronic structure of the surface is sub-
jected to a high dynamics with respect to the pre-treatment of the
material and the chemical environment. The reason for the revers-
ible character of these disturbances is the formation of metallic Pd
accessible to the surface with its ability to activate hydrogen. How-
ever, this shows that it is not sufﬁcient to determine the electronic
structure and the composition of a freshly prepared intermetallic
surface under clean or reducing conditions, since during sample
preparationbefore reaction or underreaction conditions,thissurface
can and will easily change. The termination of the surface may differ
substantially froma cut through bulk structure, even if bulk methods
still conﬁrm the presence of the intermetallic compound. The impact
of this issue for catalytic reactions will be addressed in Part II of this
study [50] by means of the liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenyl-
acetylene catalyzed by Pd2Ga. The discrepancy between surface
and bulk with a dynamic behavior that is dependent on the chemical
potential of the environment is a manifestation of the well-known
materials and pressure gaps that hinder straightforward correlation
of structural analysis obtained on model systems with catalytic per-
formance data. It is perspicuous that these difﬁculties, demonstrated
here by means of Pd2Ga, must be considered when investigating the
bulk and surface structure of other intermetallic compounds con-
taining less noble metals.
