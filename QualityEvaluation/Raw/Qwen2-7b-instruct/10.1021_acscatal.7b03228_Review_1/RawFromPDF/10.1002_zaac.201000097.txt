Abstract. The intermetallic compound PdZn was reported to have two
modifications, the tetragonal CuAu-type low-temperature phase and
the cubic CsCl-type high-temperature phase. The existence of the cubic
high-temperature phase at the equiatomic composition could not be
proven experimentally. Calculations of the total energy reveal a mini-
mum at c/a = 1.155, clearly excluding the cubic structure at the equi-
Introduction
The tetragonal distortion of the CsCl type of structure to-
wards the CuAu type of structure has been subject of debate
over several decades. Johansson and Linde were the first to
explain the tetragonal lattice of CuAu by ascribing the distor-
tion to the different atomic radii of copper and gold [1]. Schu-
bert showed that the ratio of the atomic radii does not linearly
correlate with the ratio of the axes [2]. Hence, the influence of
the atomic radii seemed not to be the only driving force for
the distortion. The argument, that the tetragonal lattice is
formed due to favored heteroatomic interactions like in tetrag-
onal NiZn [3] – one nickel atom is surrounded by eight zinc
atoms, but only by four nickel atoms – was rejected by com-
parison to PtCu. The latter is not distorted tetragonally, it is
slightly rhombohedral; every atom is surrounded by six atoms
of each kind [2]. Dehlinger suggested another driving force for
the distortion [4]. The tetragonal lattice results in new Brillouin
zones leading to additional Bragg reflections. Since these al-
low accommodating electrons in an energetically favorable
way, the Fermi energy is decreased by the distortion. Counter
arguments for this thesis are supported by the crystal structures
of NiZn, PdCd and PtHg, which do not show intense additional
reflections but still form the CuAu type of structure. Schubert’s
model of the Ortskorrelation [2] tried to explain the tetragonal
structure by the contribution of a certain number of valence
electrons of each atom to stabilize the crystal structure. Neu-
mann et al. analyzed several compounds with the CuAu struc-

atomic composition in the system Pd-Zn. Analysis of the chemical

ture concerning the influence of ionic bonding on the structure.
Results showed a correlation between the degree of tetragonal-
ity and the enthalpy of formation or degree of ionic bonding,
respectively [5]. However, this is contradictory since ionic in-
teractions should favor the more isotropic undistorted CsCl-
type. Experimental and quantum chemical investigations of
TiAl (CuAu type of structure) resulted in the description of
covalently bonded Ti 44 nets in the structure to which the te-
tragonal distortion was assigned [6, 7]. High-pressure experi-
ments on CuAu [8] revealed that the atomic size ratio plays
only a secondary role for the tetragonality in CuAu-type struc-
tures. More important are band structure effects, resulting in
an energetically favorable way to accommodate the electrons.
As already suggested by Schubert [2] and Neumann et al. [5],
a single aspect might not solely explain the tetragonal distor-
tion of the CuAu type.
The equiatomic phase in the binary system Pd-Zn is usually
described with the formula PdZn. The tetragonal structure of
the room temperature modification was first reported in 1950
by Nowotny et al. [9]. Later Nowotny et al. [10] and Köster et
al. [11] investigated the high temperature region at the compo-
sitions Pd2Zn and Pd2Zn3 both of which realize the cubic CsCl
structure type. The authors remained unsure, whether the phase
ranges of Pd2Zn and Pd2Zn3 merge at high temperatures or if
two separate phases exist. To our best knowledge, no experi-
mental evidence of the cubic CsCl-type crystal structure at
50 at.-% palladium at elevated temperatures has been reported
so far. The latest cumulative phase diagram in [12] is based on
earlier work of [13] where the high-temperature region is
shown as tentative.
Investigating chemical bonding by means of the electron-
localization approach has proven to be an efficient tool in ex-

ploring chemical stability and catalytic properties of interme-
tallic compounds [14, 15]. For example, the stability of PdGa
as a catalyst in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene
could be understood by analyzing the chemical bonding using
the electron localizability indicator [16, 17]. In this context it
is worth mentioning, that the intermetallic compound PdZn
(better to be described as ZnPd, see the bonding analysis be-
low) plays an important role as catalyst in the steam reforming
of methanol [18, 19]. The formation of the intermetallic com-
pound was detected in situ when applying Pd/ZnO as a cata-
lyst, accompanied with a huge increase in selectivity. The den-
sity of states of ZnPd and other compounds realizing the
CuAu- or CsCl-type of structures was used to draw conclu-
sions about their catalytic properties in the steam reforming of
methanol [20].
In this study, the chemical bonding in the tetragonal and cu-
bic structures of ZnPd is explored using quantum chemical
calculations through the electron localizability indicator (ELI).
Furthermore, new experimental data on the binary Pd–Zn
phases around 50 at.-% palladium are presented.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of Tetragonal ZnPd
All procedures were carried out in an argon-filled glove box with H2O
and O2 concentrations below 0.1 ppm. Elemental zinc (99.9999 %,
powder, ChemPur) and palladium (99.9 %, powder, Chempur) were
weighed with a composition Zn50Pd50. The mixture was filled in a
quartz glass ampoule. After evacuating and sealing the tube, the am-
poule was placed in a furnace, and the temperature was increased with
5 K·h–1 up to the melting point of Zn (693 K) and finally was raised
to 1123 K with 1 K·min–1, where it was held for 6 d. The ampoule
was cooled and the sintered product was ground, sealed into an evacu-
ated quartz glass ampoule again and annealed at 1173 K for 7 d. After
quenching in water, the powder was analyzed by X-ray powder diffrac-
tion (image plate Guinier camera G670, Huber, Cu-Kα1, λ = 1.54056 Å,
quartz monochromator, 3° < 2θ < 100°; internal standard LaB6, a =
4.15692 Å).
Investigation of the Homogeneity Range of Tetragonal ZnPd
Samples containing 46 at.-% and 64 at.-% Pd, respectively, were pre-
pared according to the above synthesis route. The samples were finally
annealed at 1173 K for 5 d. After quenching in water, powders were
analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction and WDX spectroscopy
(CAMECA SX 100, W filament, 25 kV).
Synthesis of Cubic ZnPd
To obtain the cubic (HT) modification of ZnPd, several quenching
attempts were made, all starting from a phase pure powder sample of
tetragonal ZnPd. The challenge is melting the compound while mini-
mizing loss of zinc due to evaporation. The first attempt consisted of
heating the sample in a thin-walled closed quartz glass ampoule to
1503 K, by referring to [11], followed by annealing for seven hours
and finally rapid quenching the ampoule in cold water. Another experi-
ment to obtain the HT modification started with inductive heating of
the initial compound inside an open glassy carbon crucible under inert

argon atmosphere to 1673 K. After reaching this temperature the cruci-
ble was turned upside down and the melt was poured onto a stainless
steel plate. Measuring the density of the quenched products by means
of a Helium pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics) was used to
obtain information about the composition of the products.
Quantum Chemical Calculations
The tight-binding linear-muffin-tin-orbital (TB-LMTO) program [21]
in the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) and all-electron full-poten-
tial local orbital (FPLO) scheme [22] were used for quantum chemical
calculations on tetragonal and cubic ZnPd. The issue of stability re-
garding the tetragonal and cubic crystal structures was addressed by
carrying out FPLO total energy calculations within local density
(LDA) and generalized gradient (GGA) approximations. For LDA Per-
dew–Wang [23] and for GGA Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof [24] parame-
trizations were used.
The following crystal structure model was used for tetragonal ZnPd:
space group P4/mmm (No. 123), Pd in Wyckoff position 1a at 0 0 0,
Zn in Wyckoff position 1d at 0.5 0.5 0.5 with cell parameters a =
2.8931(1) Å and c = 3.3426(2) Å as determined experimentally. Calcu-
lations on cubic ZnPd are based on the following structure model:
space group Pm3
¯m (No. 221), Pd in 1a at 0, 0, 0, Zn in 1b at 0.5, 0.5,
0.5. Since no experimental lattice parameter for cubic ZnPd is available
at 50 at.-% Pd, a = 3.0513 Å was calculated by linear interpolation of
the cell parameters of cubic Zn3Pd2 and cubic ZnPd2 [10]. For LMTO-
ASA calculations, no interstitial empty spheres were necessary in ei-
ther structure, because it was possible to reach the total unit cell vol-
umes by atomic spheres with acceptable overlap (≤14 %). The follow-
ing radii of the atomic spheres were applied for tetragonal ZnPd:
r(Pd) = 1.51 Å, r(Zn) = 1.48 Å. For cubic ZnPd, the applied radii of
the atomic spheres were r(Pd) = 1.52 Å, r(Zn) = 1.49 Å. The density
of states (DOS) was calculated using a grid of 553 k-points for tetrago-
nal ZnPd and 583 k-points for cubic ZnPd, respectively.
Chemical bonding analysis was based on the concept of electron local-
izability. The electron localizability indicator (ELI, Y) [25] was evalu-
ated in ELI-D representation according to [26, 27]. ELI could be calcu-
lated by both FPLO [28] and TB-LMTO methods. The topology of
ELI was analyzed using the program DGrid [29] with integration of
the electron density in ELI basins, a procedure similar to the treatment
of the electron density in the quantum theory of atoms in molecules
(QTAIM) proposed by Bader [30].
Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Tetragonal and Cubic ZnPd
Single phase material of tetragonal ZnPd was obtained after
annealing the pre-reacted powder at 1173 K as confirmed by
X-ray powder diffraction (Figure 1). The compound is hard
and brittle with silvery metallic lustre. Contrary to previously
reported synthesis routes, which always had to deal with evap-
orating zinc, this method is capable of preparing the compound
with the initial equiatomic Pd:Zn ratio. The cell parameters
were determined as a = 2.8931(1) Å and c = 3.3426(2) Å. The
samples for the homogeneity range determination consisted of
tetragonal ZnPd and cubic ZnPd2 or cubic Zn3Pd2, respec-
tively, in accordance with the published phase diagram. Unit
cell parameters as well as the composition of the phase ZnPd
in the two-phase samples are shown in Table 1.

The synthesis of cubic ZnPd in an open glassy carbon cruci-
ble, quenched from melt, only yielded zinc-poor samples with
compositions of Zn0.66Pd1.34 (according to the density measure-
ments) due to evaporation of zinc. The evaporation of zinc can
be avoided if the initial compound is placed inside a quartz
glass ampoule which then is quenched from 1503 K. Neverthe-
less, single phase material of tetragonal ZnPd was obtained
instead of cubic ZnPd. Hence, the existence of cubic ZnPd
(50 at.-% Pd) could not be proven experimentally using the
preparation procedures described.
On the Stability of the Cubic Structure
Since c/a = 1 in the tetragonal space group P4/mmm gives
the cubic structure, total energy calculations in that space
group were performed to compare the energies for different
c/a ratios at a given unit cell volume. The results obtained by
GGA at the experimental volume of the unit cell are shown in
Figure 2. The lowest total energy is obtained in the range of
the experimental c/a value at 1.155, whereas the energy of the
cubic structure (c/a = 1) is higher by ca. 10 meV/atom. To
determine the volume dependence of the c/a ratio, the c/a ra-
tios of the tetragonal structure are optimized for different unit
cell volumes by both LDA and GGA (Figure 2). In both cases,
c/a decreases monotonically with decreasing volume, but even
at a volume compression of 35 %, the c/a ratio is around 1.09,
far from the cubic limit of 1. These results suggest that at
larger volumes, which should be attained at elevated tempera-
tures due to thermal expansion, the lowest total energies will
be obtained at larger c/a values, which is in clear contradiction
to the assumption that the tetragonal structure will transform

to the cubic structure at higher temperatures. The theoretical
equilibrium volume obtained by GGA (LDA) is 3.8 % larger
(4.5 % smaller) than the experimental volume. Both results are
within the expected range of deviations for each functional.
Figure 2. (top) Total energy per atom vs. c/a ratio is obtained within
GGA for tetragonal ZnPd at the experimentally observed unit cell vol-
ume of 13.989 Å3. The minimum was observed at the experimental
c/a value of ~1.155, the cubic structure with c/a = 1 has a much higher
energy. (bottom) Axial ratio c/a vs. unit cell volume for GGA and
LDA calculations. The arrow marks the experimentally determined c/
a ratio and volume.
As would be expected for both compounds, the major contri-
butions in the DOS originate from the Zn-d and Pd-d states
(TB-LMTO-ASA results, Figure 3). The main difference in the
density of states is detected around the Fermi energy. In the
cubic structure a higher contribution by Pd-d states to the DOS
at the Fermi energy is observed, compared to the tetragonal
structure. The local peak in the density of states just below the
Fermi energy indicates a possible instability of the cubic crys-
tal structure in agreement with the total energy calculations. In
tetragonal ZnPd, this local peak close to the Fermi energy

splits into two smaller peaks at –1 eV and +0.5 eV, respec-
tively. This change in the electronic structure suggests a Pei-
erls-like distortion stabilizing the tetragonal structure in ZnPd.

type, top) and cubic ZnPd (CsCl-type, bottom) as obtained by TB-
LMTO-ASA.
The topology of the calculated electron density for the cubic
and the tetragonal structure reveals basins defined by the zero-
flux surfaces in the density gradient, the QTAIM atoms (Fig-
ure 4, top). The volume of the QTAIM Pd (16.65 Å3) is
smaller than the average value of 22.3 Å3 between the atomic
volumina of elemental palladium (29.4 Å3) and zinc (15.2 Å3).
The volume of QTAIM Zn (11.32 Å3) is even smaller than for
metallic zinc. In the chemically similar system Al-Pt [31] this
indicated atomic interactions between the components and for-
mation of platinum anions and aluminum cations. Indeed, inte-
gration of the electron density within the QTAIM reveals
charge transfer from zinc to palladium for both structures and
both calculation methods, in accordance with their electronega-
tivities after Pauling [32]. Following the IUPAC nomenclature,
we therefore suggest to describe the compound as ZnPd. Inte-
gration of the electron density obtained by the FPLO calcula-
tion yields Zn0.4+Pd0.4– and reveals the important role of the
charge transfer in the formation of the cubic and tetragonally

distorted body-centered-like structural patterns in the system
Zn/Pd.
Figure 4. Chemical bonding in ZnPd: (top) QTAIM basins of palla-
dium (blue) and zinc (green) in tetragonal ZnPd (FPLO calculation)
with the according electronic populations revealing the charge transfer
from zinc to palladium. (middle) ELI-D distribution in the (100), (010)
and (001) planes in tetragonal ZnPd shows strong structuring of the
penultimate shell of palladium in the (001) plane as well as small
ELI-D maxima between palladium atoms along [100]. (bottom) ELI-
D distribution in the (100), (010) and (001) planes in cubic ZnPd
shows weaker structuring of the penultimate shell of palladium in all
three planes.
The reasons for the tetragonal distortion are visualized by
the analysis of the electron localizability indicator for both
structural motifs (Figure 4, middle and bottom). For both
structures, the distribution of ELI-D in the inner shells (espe-
cially the penultimate one) around the zinc nuclei is very close
to spherical. The basins of the ELI attractors in the valence
region are multi-synaptic implying multi-center Zn–Pd bond-
ing interactions (not shown in the figure). In combination with
PdZn or ZnPd: Driving Force for the Tetragonal Distortion
the charge transfer, this suggests polar interaction between zinc
and palladium. In contrast to zinc, in the tetragonal structure
the penultimate shell of palladium is significantly structured in
the (001) plane compared to weaker structuring in the (100)
plane. Such a structuring proved to be a fingerprint for the
direct (covalent) interaction between the palladium atoms [33,
34]. This interaction is also reflected by small ELI-D maxima
between the palladium atoms along [100] (Figure 4, middle).
In cubic ZnPd, the structuring is less pronounced as illustrated
by the structuring index (the difference between the highest
ELI-D value in the examined shell and the ELI-D value at
which the localization domain is without a “hole” [34]), which
is 0.037 for the tetragonal structure and 0.012 for the cubic
one. Furthermore, no maxima in ELI-D were found between
the palladium atoms. Thus, the direct Pd–Pd bonding within
the 44 nets in the (001) plane is the main reason for the tetrago-
nal distortion of the cubic structure in case of ZnPd.
Conclusions
The existence of the cubic high-temperature phase of equia-
tomic composition in the binary system Pd-Zn could not be
proven experimentally and remains uncertain. Tetragonal ZnPd
has a homogeneity range of 13.8 at.-% at 1173 K.
Calculations of the total energy reveal a minimum at c/a =
1.155, clearly excluding the cubic pattern at the equiatomic
composition in the system Zn-Pd. Analysis of the chemical
bonding applying the electron localizability approach revealed
the charge transfer from zinc to palladium, thus justifying the
formula ZnPd instead of PdZn. In addition, direct Pd–Pd inter-
actions in the (001) plane were shown to be the main reason
for the tetragonal distortion of cubic ZnPd.
