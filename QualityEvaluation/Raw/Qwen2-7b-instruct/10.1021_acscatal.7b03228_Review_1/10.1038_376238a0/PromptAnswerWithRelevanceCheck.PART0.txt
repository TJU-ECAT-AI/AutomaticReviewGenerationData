If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
[3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Understanding the nobleness of gold involves studying its surface reactions and comparing them with those of other metals in the periodic table. Gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals due to the unique properties related to the filling of antibonding states and the degree of orbital overlap with adsorbates.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Gold is considered the noblest of all metals due to its exceptional inertness, which is primarily attributed to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. This unique property allows gold to form very stable alloys with numerous other metals.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The nobleness of gold is attributed to its ability to form stable alloys with other metals while maintaining a high degree of inertness. This property is associated with two key factors: the level of filling in the antibonding states during adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These factors collectively affect the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and metal surface, as well as the energy barrier for dissociation, leading to reduced reactivity on gold.

The nobleness of gold is due to its ability to form very stable alloys with other metals, which is related to the two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These factors influence both the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and metal, as well as the energy barrier for dissociation, leading to a maximum detriment of adsorbate binding and reactivity on gold's surface.
