         [1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
         [2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
         [3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."

         Understanding the nobleness of gold involves studying its surface reactions and comparing them with those of other metals in the periodic table. Gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals due to the unique properties related to the filling of antibonding states and the degree of orbital overlap with adsorbates.

         [3] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

         Gold is considered the noblest of all metals due to its exceptional inertness, which is primarily attributed to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. This unique property allows gold to form very stable alloys with numerous other metals.

         黄金之所以被认为是所有金属中最贵重的，主要是因为其非凡的惰性。这种特性主要归因于两个因素：吸附时反键状态的填充程度和与吸附物的轨道重叠程度。这种独特的性质使得黄金能够与众多其他金属形成非常稳定的合金。
