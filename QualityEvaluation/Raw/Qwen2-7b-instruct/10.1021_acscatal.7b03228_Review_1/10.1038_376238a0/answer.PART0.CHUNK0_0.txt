[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
[3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."

Understanding the nobleness of gold involves studying its surface reactions and comparing them with those of other metals in the periodic table. Gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals due to the unique properties related to the filling of antibonding states and the degree of orbital overlap with adsorbates.
