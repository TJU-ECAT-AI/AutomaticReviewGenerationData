[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
[3] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

The nobleness of gold is due to its ability to form very stable alloys with other metals, which is related to the two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These factors influence both the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and metal, as well as the energy barrier for dissociation, leading to a maximum detriment of adsorbate binding and reactivity on gold's surface.

黄金的尊贵性在于它能够与其它金属形成非常稳定的合金，这与两个因素有关：吸附时价电子轨道的填充程度和吸附物与轨道的重叠程度。这些因素影响吸附物与金属之间的相互作用强度以及脱附能垒，导致吸附物在金表面的结合和后续反应的最大不利影响。
