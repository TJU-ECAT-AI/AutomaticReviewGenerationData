[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
[3] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

The nobleness of gold is attributed to its ability to form stable alloys with other metals while maintaining a high degree of inertness. This property is associated with two key factors: the level of filling in the antibonding states during adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These factors collectively affect the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and metal surface, as well as the energy barrier for dissociation, leading to reduced reactivity on gold.

黄金的高贵性归因于它与其他金属形成稳定合金的能力，同时保持高度的惰性。这一特性与两个关键因素有关：吸附过程中的价带填充水平和吸附物的轨道重叠程度。这些因素共同影响吸附剂与金属表面之间的相互作用强度以及解离能垒，导致在黄金上降低反应活性。
