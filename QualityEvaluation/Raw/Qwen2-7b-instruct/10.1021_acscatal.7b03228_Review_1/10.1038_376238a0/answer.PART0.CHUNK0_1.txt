[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."

Gold is considered the noblest of all metals due to its exceptional inertness, which is primarily attributed to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. This unique property allows gold to form very stable alloys with numerous other metals.

黄金之所以被认为是所有金属中最贵重的，主要是因为其非凡的惰性。这种特性主要归因于两个因素：吸附时反键状态的填充程度和与吸附物的轨道重叠程度。这种独特的性质使得黄金能够与众多其他金属形成非常稳定的合金。
