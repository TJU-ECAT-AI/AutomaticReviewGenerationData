The document discusses how single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. Successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalyst design relies on factors such as understanding reaction conditions, metal properties, and the distinct benefits over conventional catalysts. These catalysts are capable of breaking scaling rules and enhancing selectivity across different catalyst systems.
