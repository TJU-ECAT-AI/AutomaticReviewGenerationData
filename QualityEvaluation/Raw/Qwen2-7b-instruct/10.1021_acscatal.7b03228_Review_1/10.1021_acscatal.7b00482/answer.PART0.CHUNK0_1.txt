1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions due to the formation of a Pd-rich environment. This unique atomic structure leads to improved selectivity and efficiency. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts involve precise control over metal properties and reaction conditions. These catalysts break scaling rules by achieving superior selectivity compared to traditional catalysts, thanks to the precise tuning of metal interactions and the unique electronic properties of SAA structures.
