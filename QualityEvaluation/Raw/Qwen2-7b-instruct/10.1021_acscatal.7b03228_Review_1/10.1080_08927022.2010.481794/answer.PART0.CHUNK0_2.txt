The document outlines a method for estimating the d-band characteristics of transition metal atoms. This estimation is based on a tight-binding model parameterized by a database of density functional theory calculations. The model incorporates both electronic and geometric contributions to estimate d-band characteristics for bulk systems and surface structures. It introduces a d-band width formalism that relates surface reactivity to the surface electronic structure. The proposed model can be utilized to estimate surface electronic structure and explain trends in catalytic properties of metal and alloy surfaces based on surface and adsorbate orbital properties.

Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects. This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately.

The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]. If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface,including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations. This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties.

D-band characteristics modifications can be approximated by correlating the surface d-band width of transition metals with the interatomic matrix element (Vdd), which characterizes bonding interactions between an atom and its surroundings [6,11,12]. If this relationship is understood, it becomes feasible to compute d-band properties of any surface, accounting for structural and alloying effects, with significantly fewer DFT calculations. This would introduce a novel, efficient method for screening promising alloy surfaces, potentially applicable to various surface configurations aimed at identifying surfaces with desired chemical attributes.
