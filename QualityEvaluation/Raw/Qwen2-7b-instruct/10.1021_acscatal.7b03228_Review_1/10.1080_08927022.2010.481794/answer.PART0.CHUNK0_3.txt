[1] "The reactivity of surfaces is related to their ability to make chemical bonds. These bonds consist of a distribution of electrons over bonding and anti- bonding adsorbatesurface states involving the surface metal sp and d orbitals."
[2] "Adsorption is then considered in two steps. First, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the surface sp states to form a stabilised adsorbate species."
[3] "Second, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the d-orbitals in the transition metal surface."
[4] "The strength of the bond depends on the occupation of these orbitals. If the anti-bonding states are above the Fermi level, they are unoccupied and the bond is strong. If the anti-bonding states are below the Fermi Level, they are occupied, and the bond is weak."
[5] "Thus, features of the d-states are the primary factors for the altering interactions between adsorbates for different metal surfaces."
[6] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals."
[7] "The variation in coupling is due to the difference in the average energy (d-band centre) of the d-bands, which is sensitive to many factors including strain and ligand effects."
[8] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
[9] "This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."
[10] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment [6,11,12]."
[11] "If such an understanding can be established, then it would be possible to calculate d-band characteristics of any surface, including the effects of structure, alloying, etc., with dramatically reduced need for DFT calculations."
[12] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."
[13] "In this paper, we utilise the proportionality between the d-band widths and the interatomic matrix elements [11] describing the bonding between an atom and its nearest neighbours to develop a simple model for estimating the electronic structures of transition metal surfaces."
[14] "In this paper, we first discuss the details of the computational parameters used in the DFT calculations and the details of the computational methods."
[15] "Correlations between Vdd and Wd are used to propose a d-band width model for transition metal atoms utilising a characteristic length for each transition metal d-orbital that are parameterised from DFT calculations."
[16] "These parameters are incorporated in a new solid-state table and presented in Section 3."
[17] "With the use of the model, we predict d-band widths of bulk and surface atoms at different low Miller index facets of transition metals and compare the results of the simple model to detailed DFT calculations."
[18] "The model is then used to estimate the electronic structure of many different overlayer/host as well as surface impurity/host combinations and compared to the literature data."
[19] "Given the simplicity and the accuracy of the proposed d-band width formalism, we believe that the model presented here will be used as a first step towards predicting the reactivity of different surfaces and will serve as a main tool in many different applications involving transition metals."

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through several key mechanisms. Firstly, the d-band characteristics of Pd atoms play a crucial role in determining the catalytic reactivity. By modifying the d-band characteristics through alloying, the electronic structure of the surface is altered, influencing the bond formation and breaking capabilities of the metal surface. Specifically, the Pd atoms in the Cu matrix can create a more favorable environment for hydrogen adsorption and activation, leading to enhanced selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

Designing successful single-atom alloys (SAAs) for hydrogenation reactions requires careful consideration of multiple factors:

1. **Reaction Conditions**: SAAs often benefit from optimized operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and hydrogen concentration, which can maximize the catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. **Metal Properties**: The choice of metals in SAAs is critical. Pd, due to its unique d-band characteristics, is known to be highly effective in hydrogenation reactions. The combination of Pd with Cu creates an alloy with improved catalytic properties compared to pure metals, due to the synergistic effects between the metals' electronic structures.

3. **Specific Advantages over Traditional Catalysts**: SAAs offer several advantages over traditional catalysts, including:
   - **Breaking Scaling Rules**: SAAs can exhibit superior performance at smaller catalyst loads, potentially reducing the amount of material required for a given reaction rate.
   - **Improved Selectivity**: By tuning the electronic structure of the surface, SAAs can selectively catalyze certain reactions over others, enhancing product purity and yield.
   - **Enhanced Stability**: The alloy structure can lead to increased stability against deactivation and poisoning, maintaining high activity over multiple reaction cycles.

The ability of SAAs to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems is attributed to the precise control of electronic properties at the atomic level. This allows for the optimization of surface reactivity, leading to enhanced catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions.
