The paper discusses the development of a tight-binding model that parameterizes d-band characteristics for transition metal atoms. The model uses a database of density functional theory calculations to estimate the d-band characteristics of bulk systems, mono- and bimetallic surface structures, incorporating both electronic and geometric contributions. The model is designed to help understand and predict surface reactivity based on electronic structure modifications.
