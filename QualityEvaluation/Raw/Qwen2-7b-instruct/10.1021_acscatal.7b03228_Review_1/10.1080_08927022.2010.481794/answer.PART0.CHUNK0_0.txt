[1] "The reactivity of surfaces is related to their ability to make chemical bonds. These bonds consist of a distribution of electrons over bonding and anti-bonding adsorbate-surface states involving the surface metal sp and d orbitals."
[2] "The strength of the bond depends on the occupation of these orbitals. If the anti-bonding states are above the Fermi level, they are unoccupied and the bond is strong. If the anti-bonding states are below the Fermi Level, they are occupied, and the bond is weak."
[3] "The d-band model assumes that the variations between adsorbates and surface metal atoms are largely due to the variations in coupling of the metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals."
[4] "Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects."
[5] "In this paper, we utilise the proportionality between the d-band widths and the interatomic matrix elements [11] describing the bonding between an atom and its environment to develop a simple model for estimating the electronic structures of transition metal surfaces."
[6] "Given the simplicity and the accuracy of the proposed d-band width formalism, we believe that the model presented here will be used as a first step towards predicting the reactivity of different surfaces and will serve as a main tool in many different applications involving transition metals."

The d-band model elucidates how the electronic structure of transition metal surfaces influences their reactivity. It posits that the variations in coupling between metal d-states and adsorbate orbitals result in significant differences in the electronic properties of metal surfaces. The model leverages the proportionality between d-band widths and interatomic matrix elements to develop a straightforward approach for estimating the electronic structures of these surfaces. This method promises to facilitate predictions of surface reactivity and to serve as a pivotal tool in various applications involving transition metals, thereby advancing our understanding of surface science.
