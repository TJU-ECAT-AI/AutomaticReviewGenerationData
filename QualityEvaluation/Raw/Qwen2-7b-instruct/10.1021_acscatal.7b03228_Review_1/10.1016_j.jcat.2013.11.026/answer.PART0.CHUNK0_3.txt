[1] "Early studies recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces."
[2] "On surfaces saturated with chemisorbed H-atoms (H), theory and experiments indicate that CC cleavage occurs predominantly via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane."
[3] "Measured activation energies (213 kJ mol−1) and free energies (130 kJ mol−1) reflect the combined values for quasi-equilibrated steps that desorb H, adsorb C2H6, form C2-intermediates by dehydrogenation, and form the transition state from CHCH species."
[4] "Theory and experiments combine here to provide mechanistic insights inaccessible to direct observation and provide compelling evidence for reaction pathways long considered to be plausible for hydrogenolysis on noble metals."

The study elucidates the mechanism of ethane hydrogenolysis on metal surfaces saturated with chemisorbed hydrogen. It demonstrates that CC bond cleavage primarily happens through the formation of a specific reactive intermediate, CHCH, which results from the sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane. The activation energies and free energies measured align with the energy required for the quasi-equilibrated steps involved in the process, providing a comprehensive understanding of the reaction pathway. This mechanistic insight is crucial for predicting the behavior of hydrogenolysis reactions on noble metals and optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications.
