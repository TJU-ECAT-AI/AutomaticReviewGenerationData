[1] "Early studies recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces."
[2] "On surfaces saturated with chemisorbed H-atoms (H), theory and experiments indicate that CC cleavage occurs predominantly via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane; all other intermediates cleave CC bonds at much lower rates (>107-fold)."
[3] "The removal of four H-atoms in forming the kinetically-relevant CHCH intermediates, taken together with measured effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates, show that 23 H must be removed to bind this intermediate and the transition state, as expected from the structure of the proposed adsorbed species and H adsorption stoichiometries on Ir surface atoms that vary slightly with surface coordination on the non-uniform surfaces of metal clusters."

1. Hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces. The CC cleavage predominantly occurs via an a,b-bound CHCH species formed via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane, which is more efficient than other intermediates.

2. The structure of the proposed adsorbed species and H adsorption stoichiometries on Ir surface atoms that vary slightly with surface coordination on the non-uniform surfaces of metal clusters indicate that 23 H must be removed to bind the intermediate and the transition state. This finding aligns with the observed effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates.

1. 氢解离需要通过形成不饱和中间体来逐步削弱CC键，这些中间体在表面上取代了CH键与金属键。CC裂解主要发生在通过逐次脱氢形成的a,b-结合的CHCH物种上，这比其他中间体更有效率。

2. 预期从表面吸附物种和H吸附量在非均匀金属簇表面不同协调状态下的Ir表面原子上的结构以及所观察到的氢解离速率变化，表明必须去除23个H才能绑定此中间体和过渡态。这一发现与所观测到的H2压力对氢解离速率的影响相一致。
