[1] "Early studies recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces."
[2] "Our recent studies have addressed the enthalpic and entropic barriers that govern reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenolysis of C2C10 n-alkanes [49] and isoalkanes [50] on supported Ir clusters."
[3] "These findings and the DFT-derived activation barriers agree well with measured turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters."
[4] "The removal of four H-atoms in forming the kinetically-relevant CHCH intermediates, taken together with measured effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates, show that 23 H must be removed to bind this intermediate and the transition state."

The research combines hydrogenolysis turnover rates and kinetic interpretation on Ir clusters saturated with chemisorbed hydrogen (H) with density functional theory (DFT) treatments on the Ir(111) surface to infer mechanistic details for the hydrogenolysis of ethane. It identifies that CC bond cleavage occurs via a specific reactive intermediate (CHCH) formed by the loss of four H-atoms through the sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane molecules. The DFT-derived activation barriers align well with measured turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters. The study confirms the role of unsaturation in CC bond rupture in ethane and similar reactions involving larger n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and cycloalkanes.

研究结合氢解离在饱和化学吸附氢（H）的Ir簇上的转速率和动力学解释与Ir(111)表面的密度泛函理论（DFT）处理，推断乙烷氢解的机制细节。它确定CC键断裂通过特定反应中间体（CHCH）发生，该中间体由吸附乙烷分子的顺序脱氢形成，释放四个H原子。DFT计算得到的活化能壁垒与在Ir簇上测量的周转率和活化能很好地吻合。这项研究确认了在乙烷以及涉及更大烷烃、异烷烃和环烷烃的类似反应中CC键断裂的作用。
