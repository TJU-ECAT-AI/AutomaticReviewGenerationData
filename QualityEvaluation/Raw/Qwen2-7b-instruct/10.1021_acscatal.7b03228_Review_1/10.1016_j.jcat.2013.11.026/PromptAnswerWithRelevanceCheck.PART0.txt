[1] "Early studies recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces."
[2] "On surfaces saturated with chemisorbed H-atoms (H), theory and experiments indicate that CC cleavage occurs predominantly via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane; all other intermediates cleave CC bonds at much lower rates (>107-fold)."
[3] "The removal of four H-atoms in forming the kinetically-relevant CHCH intermediates, taken together with measured effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates, show that 23 H must be removed to bind this intermediate and the transition state, as expected from the structure of the proposed adsorbed species and H adsorption stoichiometries on Ir surface atoms that vary slightly with surface coordination on the non-uniform surfaces of metal clusters."

1. Hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces. The CC cleavage predominantly occurs via an a,b-bound CHCH species formed via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane, which is more efficient than other intermediates.

2. The structure of the proposed adsorbed species and H adsorption stoichiometries on Ir surface atoms that vary slightly with surface coordination on the non-uniform surfaces of metal clusters indicate that 23 H must be removed to bind the intermediate and the transition state. This finding aligns with the observed effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates.

1. 氢解离需要通过形成不饱和中间体来逐步削弱CC键，这些中间体在表面上取代了CH键与金属键。CC裂解主要发生在通过逐次脱氢形成的a,b-结合的CHCH物种上，这比其他中间体更有效率。

2. 预期从表面吸附物种和H吸附量在非均匀金属簇表面不同协调状态下的Ir表面原子上的结构以及所观察到的氢解离速率变化，表明必须去除23个H才能绑定此中间体和过渡态。这一发现与所观测到的H2压力对氢解离速率的影响相一致。

The study combines hydrogenolysis turnover rates and their kinetic interpretation on Ir clusters saturated with chemisorbed hydrogen (H) with density functional theory (DFT) treatments on the Ir(111) surface to infer mechanistic details for the hydrogenolysis of ethane. It reveals that CC bond cleavage occurs via a specific reactive intermediate (CHCH) that forms by the loss of four H-atoms (as H2) through the sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane molecules. The DFT-derived activation barriers align well with measured turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters, confirming the essential role of unsaturation in the cleavage of CC bonds in ethane.

研究将氢解离转速率及其动力学解释与饱和化学吸附氢(H)的Ir簇上的氢动力学理论与Ir(111)表面的密度泛函理论(DFT)处理相结合，以推断乙烷的氢解离机制。它表明，CC键断裂主要通过形成一个a,b绑定的CHCH物种进行，该物种由吸附在表面上的乙烷分子的逐次脱氢形成；所有其他中间体在断裂CC键时的速率远低于此过程的数百万倍。形成这种关键中间体和过渡态所需的四个H原子的去除，与氢气压力对氢解离速率的影响测量结果一致，表明需要去除23个H原子来结合这个中间体和过渡态。这些发现与使用DFT计算得到的活化能很好地匹配了在Ir簇上测量到的转速率和活化能，这证实了在Ir表面上，通过形成含有四个H原子的CHCH中间体，实现CC键断裂的关键作用。这些中间体的浓度依赖于H2压力和温度，这可以指导选择反应条件和催化剂以故意或无意地涉及氢解离反应的过程。

The study elucidates the mechanism of ethane hydrogenolysis on metal surfaces saturated with chemisorbed hydrogen. It demonstrates that CC bond cleavage primarily happens through the formation of a specific reactive intermediate, CHCH, which results from the sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane. The activation energies and free energies measured align with the energy required for the quasi-equilibrated steps involved in the process, providing a comprehensive understanding of the reaction pathway. This mechanistic insight is crucial for predicting the behavior of hydrogenolysis reactions on noble metals and optimizing catalyst design for industrial applications.

This study investigates the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metal surfaces, specifically focusing on the role of unsaturated species in the reaction process. It reveals that CC bond cleavage primarily occurs through the formation of a CHCH species, which is a result of sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane. The activation energies and free energies measured for this process align with the theoretical expectations for the quasi-equilibrated steps involved in desorbing hydrogen, adsorbing C2H6, forming C2 intermediates by dehydrogenation, and creating the transition state from the CHCH species. The study suggests that while the level of unsaturation and CC cleavage rates might vary depending on the metal used, the fundamental steps and their kinetic significance seem to be consistent features in metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis.

这项研究探讨了金属表面的乙烷氢解，特别关注反应过程中不饱和物种的作用。它揭示了CC键断裂主要通过形成CHCH物种进行，这是吸附乙烷顺序脱氢的结果。测量的活化能和自由能与涉及脱氢、吸附C2H6、形成C2中间体以及从CHCH物种形成过渡状态的理论预期步骤值相符。研究表明，在金属氢解中，虽然不饱和度水平和CC断裂速率可能因使用的金属而异，但基本步骤及其动力学相关性似乎是金属催化氢解的普遍特征。
