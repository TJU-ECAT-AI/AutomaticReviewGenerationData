[1] "Early studies recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces."
[2] "Theory and experiments indicate that CC cleavage occurs predominantly via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane; all other intermediates cleave CC bonds at much lower rates (>107-fold)."
[3] "The removal of four H-atoms in forming the kinetically-relevant CHCH intermediates, taken together with measured effects of H2 pressure on hydrogenolysis rates, show that 23 H must be removed to bind this intermediate and the transition state."
[4] "These findings and the DFT-derived activation barriers agree well with measured turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters."

The study combines hydrogenolysis turnover rates and their kinetic interpretation on Ir clusters saturated with chemisorbed hydrogen (H) with density functional theory (DFT) treatments on the Ir(111) surface to infer mechanistic details for the hydrogenolysis of ethane. It reveals that CC bond cleavage occurs via a specific reactive intermediate (CHCH) that forms by the loss of four H-atoms (as H2) through the sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane molecules. The DFT-derived activation barriers align well with measured turnover rates and activation energies on Ir clusters, confirming the essential role of unsaturation in the cleavage of CC bonds in ethane.

研究将氢解离转速率及其动力学解释与饱和化学吸附氢(H)的Ir簇上的氢动力学理论与Ir(111)表面的密度泛函理论(DFT)处理相结合，以推断乙烷的氢解离机制。它表明，CC键断裂主要通过形成一个a,b绑定的CHCH物种进行，该物种由吸附在表面上的乙烷分子的逐次脱氢形成；所有其他中间体在断裂CC键时的速率远低于此过程的数百万倍。形成这种关键中间体和过渡态所需的四个H原子的去除，与氢气压力对氢解离速率的影响测量结果一致，表明需要去除23个H原子来结合这个中间体和过渡态。这些发现与使用DFT计算得到的活化能很好地匹配了在Ir簇上测量到的转速率和活化能，这证实了在Ir表面上，通过形成含有四个H原子的CHCH中间体，实现CC键断裂的关键作用。这些中间体的浓度依赖于H2压力和温度，这可以指导选择反应条件和催化剂以故意或无意地涉及氢解离反应的过程。
