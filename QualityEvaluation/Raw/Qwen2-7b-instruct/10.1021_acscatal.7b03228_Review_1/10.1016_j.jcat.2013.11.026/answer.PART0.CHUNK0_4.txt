[1] "Early studies recognized that hydrogenolysis requires the progressive weakening of CC bonds through the formation of unsaturated intermediates that replace CH bonds with C-metal bonds on surfaces."
[2] "Theory and experiments indicate that CC cleavage occurs predominantly via an a,b-bound CHCH species that forms via sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane."
[3] "Measured activation energies (213 kJ mol−1) and free energies (130 kJ mol−1) reflect the combined values for quasi-equilibrated steps that desorb H, adsorb C2H6, form C2-intermediates by dehydrogenation, and form the transition state from CHCH species."
[4] "The extent of unsaturation in the single relevant intermediate and its CC cleavage rates will depend on the identity of the metal, but the elementary steps and their kinetic relevance appear to be a general feature of metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis."

This study investigates the hydrogenolysis of ethane on metal surfaces, specifically focusing on the role of unsaturated species in the reaction process. It reveals that CC bond cleavage primarily occurs through the formation of a CHCH species, which is a result of sequential dehydrogenation of adsorbed ethane. The activation energies and free energies measured for this process align with the theoretical expectations for the quasi-equilibrated steps involved in desorbing hydrogen, adsorbing C2H6, forming C2 intermediates by dehydrogenation, and creating the transition state from the CHCH species. The study suggests that while the level of unsaturation and CC cleavage rates might vary depending on the metal used, the fundamental steps and their kinetic significance seem to be consistent features in metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis.

这项研究探讨了金属表面的乙烷氢解，特别关注反应过程中不饱和物种的作用。它揭示了CC键断裂主要通过形成CHCH物种进行，这是吸附乙烷顺序脱氢的结果。测量的活化能和自由能与涉及脱氢、吸附C2H6、形成C2中间体以及从CHCH物种形成过渡状态的理论预期步骤值相符。研究表明，在金属氢解中，虽然不饱和度水平和CC断裂速率可能因使用的金属而异，但基本步骤及其动力学相关性似乎是金属催化氢解的普遍特征。
