[1] "Throughout the course of our work we have employed a form of catalysis known as heterogeneous catalysis, in which the reacting molecules are present in a phase separate from that of the catalyst."
[2] "In a typical situation in heterogeneous catalysis a fluid phase (often a gas) flows through a bed of catalyst particles."
[3] "Depending on the application, the particles could range in size from a couple of tenths of a millimeter to several millimeters."
[4] "The material constituting the bulk of the particles is often an oxide such as alumina (Al2O3) or silica (SiO2) containing a network of pores."
[5] "The pores have an average diameter of about 100 angstroms. The metal clusters reside on the walls of the pores and therefore must be smaller than the pores."
[6] "As the gas flows through the catalyst bed, reactant molecules diffuse into the pores of the particles and are adsorbed onto the surfaces of the metal clusters."
[7] "In the chemisorption, or chemical adsorption, of a reactant molecule on a metal cluster, a chemical bond forms between the molecule and a surface site."
[8] "The surface compound then undergoes chemical transformations on the clusters to yield molecules of a different chemical species, which are subsequently desorbed."
[9] "The product molecules then diffuse out through the network of pores into the gas stream flowing through the empty space between the particles."
[10] "The desorption of a product molecule from the metal cluster releases a site for further participation in the reaction."
[11] "The composition of the gas stream changes in its passage through the catalyst bed as the gas is depleted of molecules of reactant and enriched in molecules of product."
[12] "The performance of a catalyst in facilitating this chemical change has been customarily referred to as its activity."
[13] "In developing an understanding of the general factors that influence catalytic activities of metals, one can gain insight by studying a given reaction over a series of metals."
[14] "The periodic table of elements provided a framework for our studies."
[15] "Elements in the periodic table are arranged in vertical columns called groups and in horizontal rows called periods."
[16] "Elements in a given group tend to show similar chemical behavior whereas those in a given period exhibit a systematic variation of properties across the period."
[17] "We measured the activities of metals in three periods that include the first, second and third transition series, focusing our attention on the metals in group VIA through group VIII to group lB."
[18] "We obtained the most complete set of data on hydrogenolytic activities for metals of the third transition series."
[19] "In the second transition series we found a similar variation in activity ranging from ruthenium through palladium (group VIII members) to silver (a group lB member)."
[20] "The pattern of variation in the first transition series, however, differs from the pattern of the second and third series."
[21] "We observed that the activity of nickel, a member of subgroup VIII3, is higher than that of iron, a member of subgroup VIII1'."
[22] "This result is in agreement with the pattern of the other two series."
[23] "A qualitative understanding of the pattern of variation follows from a principle that relates catalytic activity to both the ease with which a molecule of reactant binds to a catalyst (chemisorption) and the strength of the chemisorption bond."
[24] "Metals exhibiting these qualities include most of the members of groups VIA and VIlA (such as manganese, chromium and tungsten), which immediately precede the group VIII metals in the periodic table."
[25] "Chemisorption may also take place too slowly."
[26] "Since the metals in group VIII rapidly adsorb molecules and allow reaction to occur, they are particularly important in catalysis."
[27] "After completing our investigation of ethane hydrogenolysis on metals, we began examining the selectivity of bimetallic catalysts."
[28] "We studied the hydrogenolytic activities of bimetallic catalysts consisting of a highly active group VIII metal in combination with an inactive group IB metal."
[29] "To determine whether the effect of a group IB metal on the catalytic activity of a group VIII metal depends on the type of reaction, we included a second reaction in the investigation, the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons."
[30] "We found another example of a selectivity effect with ruthenium-copper catalysts."
[31] "On pure ruthenium, cyclohexane dehydrogenates to form benzene, but it also undergoes extensive hydrogenolysis to yield small alkane molecules such as methane."
[32] "The incorporation of copper with ruthenium inhibits the hydrogenolysis reaction while allowing the dehydrogenation reaction."
[33] "The selectivity of the conversion of cyclohexane into benzene therefore improves markedly."
[34] "The presence of copper can therefore influence the selectivity of a group VIII metal whether or not the copper mixes with the metal."
[35] "My colleagues and I also observed selective inhibition of the hydrogenolysis activity of group VIII metals when we substituted gold or silver for copper."

The document discusses the use of heterogeneous catalysis, where the reacting molecules are present in a phase separate from the catalyst. It explains that the catalyst particles can vary in size, with oxide materials such as alumina or silica containing a network of pores. Reactant molecules diffuse into these pores and adsorb onto the surfaces of metal clusters, forming a chemical bond. These clusters undergo chemical transformations, yielding different chemical species that diffuse out through the pores. The performance of a catalyst, defined as its ability to facilitate chemical changes, is referred to as its activity. By studying a series of metals, one can gain insights into the factors influencing catalytic activities. The periodic table provides a framework for understanding the systematic variation of properties across elements. The document also explores the selectivity of bimetallic catalysts, focusing on the hydrogenolysis and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. It highlights the importance of group VIII metals and the influence of group IB metals on catalyst selectivity. Through the study of bimetallic clusters, the researchers have developed catalysts that can selectively inhibit or promote specific reactions, enhancing the efficiency of chemical processes.
