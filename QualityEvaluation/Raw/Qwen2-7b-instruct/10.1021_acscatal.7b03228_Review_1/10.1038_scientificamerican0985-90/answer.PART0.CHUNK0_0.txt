[1] "Our bimetallic catalyst, both by itself and in combination with other catalysts, has consequently been a key factor in making "low lead" and "lead free" gasolines feasible."
[2] "We found that a catalyst containing platinum-iridium clusters leads to a higher rate of formation of high octane-number gasoline components (aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylenes) than do earlier catalysts containing pure platinum clusters."
[3] "We measured the activities of metals in three periods that include the first, second and third transition series, focusing our attention on the metals in group VIA through group VIII to group lB."
[4] "The presence of copper can therefore influence-the selectivity of a group VIII metal whether or not the copper mixes with the metal."
[5] "We found significant evidence for interaction not only between ruthenium and copper but also between other group VIII and group IB metals."
[6] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy is useful in the characterization of clusters. A beam of X rays is directed at the catalyst being probed."
[7] "The periodic table of elements provided a framework for our studies. The elements in the periodic table are arranged in vertical columns called groups and in horizontal rows called periods."

The document discusses the use of bimetallic catalysts in improving gasoline production, specifically in enhancing the formation of high-octane gasoline components like aromatic hydrocarbons. Platinum-iridium clusters are found to be more effective catalysts than pure platinum clusters. The study also explores the influence of group IB metals on the selectivity of group VIII metal catalysts. The periodic table is utilized to understand variations in catalytic activities among different metals. X-ray absorption spectroscopy is highlighted as a tool for characterizing the structures of bimetallic clusters.
