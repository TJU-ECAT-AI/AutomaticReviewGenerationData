[1] "Throughout the course of our work we have employed a form of catalysis known as heterogeneous catalysis, in which the reacting molecules are present in a phase separate from that of the catalyst."
[2] "In a typical situation in heterogeneous catalysis a fluid phase (often a gas) flows through a bed of catalyst particles."
[3] "The composition of the gas stream changes in its passage through the catalyst bed as the gas is depleted of molecules of reactant and enriched in molecules of product."
[4] "Our investigation of the hydrogenolysis activities of metal catalysts affords a good background for selectivity studies of bimetallic catalysts."
[5] "In the second transition series we found a similar variation in activity ranging from ruthenium through palladium (group VIII members) to silver (a group IB member)."
[6] "We measured the activities of metals in three periods that include the first, second and third transition series, focusing our attention on the metals in group VIIA through group VIII to group IB."
[7] "Precise data on the activity of gold, the group IB metal immediately following platinum in this series, are not available."
[8] "In contrast to hydrogenolysis, this reaction consists in rupturing the carbon-hydrogen bonds of hydrocarbons and removing hydrogen, a process that leads to the formation of other hydrocarbons."
[9] "The first bimetallic system we investigated was nickel-copper. Nickel and copper mix with each other to form alloys."
[10] "The effect of copper on the activity of nickel for ethane hydrogenolysis differs greatly from its effect on the activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."
[11] "We found another example of a selectivity effect with ruthenium-copper catalysts. On pure ruthenium, cyclohexane dehydrogenates to form benzene, but it also undergoes extensive hydrogenolysis to yield small alkane molecules such as methane."
[12] "Clusters typically range in size from 10 to 50 angstroms. Sometimes they are so small that virtually every atom in a cluster is a surface atom."
[13] "Absorption occurs when an X ray excites an electron of an absorbing atom from a low energy state to a high energy state. If the X ray energy is high enough, it will eject the electron (known as a photoelectron) from the atom."
