Since the provided literature does not contain specific details about single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhancing catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions, nor the essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts, it is not possible to provide a direct answer based on the content. The literature focuses on the bond strengths of adsorption on transition metal surfaces rather than the specific aspects asked about in the questions.
