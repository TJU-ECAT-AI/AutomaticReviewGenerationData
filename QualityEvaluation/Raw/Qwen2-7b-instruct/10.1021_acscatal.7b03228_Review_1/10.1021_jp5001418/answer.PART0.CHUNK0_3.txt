The article titled "Predicting and Comparing CM and OM Bond Strengths for Adsorption on Transition Metal Surfaces" by Matthew M. Montemore and J. Will Medlin discusses the enhancement of catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through the use of single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces. Essential criteria for designing successful Single Atom Alloy (SAA) catalysts include understanding the reaction conditions, properties of metals, and the unique advantages these catalysts offer compared to traditional catalysts. These advantages include breaking scaling rules and improving selectivity across different catalyst systems.
