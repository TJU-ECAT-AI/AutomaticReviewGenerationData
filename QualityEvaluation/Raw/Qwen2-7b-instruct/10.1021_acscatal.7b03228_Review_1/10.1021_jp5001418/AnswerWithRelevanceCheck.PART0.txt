          Single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Designing successful SAA catalysts requires optimizing reaction conditions, leveraging the specific attributes of metals, and capitalizing on the unique benefits of SAA over traditional catalysts, including increased selectivity and efficiency. SAA catalysts often defy scaling rules, achieving higher activity and selectivity than expected based on bulk material properties.
