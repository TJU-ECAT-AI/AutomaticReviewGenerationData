Answer: Single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions because of their unique electronic and structural properties. To design successful SAA catalysts, it is crucial to optimize reaction conditions, choose suitable metals, and leverage the specific advantages of SAA over traditional catalysts, including improved selectivity and efficiency. SAA catalysts often defy scaling rules, achieving higher activity and selectivity than predicted by bulk material properties.
