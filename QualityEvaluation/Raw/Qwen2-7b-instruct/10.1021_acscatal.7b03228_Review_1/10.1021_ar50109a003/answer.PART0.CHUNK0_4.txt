[1] "In terms of the electron-band theory, a group 8 metal such as nickel is characterized as having an incom- pletely filled d band, whereas a group 1B metal such as copper has a filled d band."
[2] "By varying the composition of the alloy, one can alter the degree of filling of the d band with electrons and observe the effect on catalytic activity."
[3] "The selectivity features of bimetallic catalysts have only recently received any attention."
[4] "Early studies of the electronic factor emphasized the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydro- genation reactions in which selectivity was not a con- sideration."
[5] "The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal decreases (1)"
[6] "While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity."
[7] "In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface."
[8] "However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface."
[9] "For supported bimetallic combinations of a group 8 and a group 1B metal, the hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane is a very useful reaction for this purpose."
[10] "In applying ethane hydrogenolysis as a probe to establish interaction between copper and either ruthenium or osmium on a carrier, one simply looks for a marked suppression of hydrogenolysis activity of the group 8 metal when copper is present."
[11] "Clearly, the highly dispersed ruthenium-copper clusters require a much higher atomic ratio of copper to ru- thenium than the large ruthenium-copper aggregates to achieve a given inhibiting effect."
[12] "From this simple consid- eration, it is readily seen how a highly dispersed bi- metallic cluster may have compositions far outside the range of those possible in a bulk solid solution of the two metals."
[13] "As a result of their low hydrogenolysis activities,bimetallic clusters of a group 8 and a group 1B metal are more selective than the pure group 8 metal for a reaction such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to ar0matis."
[14] "Others include combi- nations of two group 8 metals, e.g., platinum-palladium,platinum-rhodium, and platinm-iridium."
[15] "Our present knowledge of bimetallic clusters is derived largely from studies of their chemisorption and catalytic properties."

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions through altering the degree of filling of the d band in the alloy, affecting both activity and selectivity. This is achieved by tuning the composition of the alloy. Early studies focused on the relation between alloy composition and catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions without considering selectivity. The addition of a group 1B metal to a group 8 metal generally decreases activity but can influence selectivity. Geometric factors at the surface play a crucial role in determining selectivity, especially in bimetallic systems. The component with the lower heat of sublimation tends to accumulate in the surface, affecting selectivity. In the presence of a selectively interacting gas, the group 1B metal's role in the surface changes. Hydrogenolysis of ethane to methane serves as a useful probe for studying interactions between metals on a carrier. Highly dispersed bimetallic clusters can have compositions far outside the range of those possible in bulk solid solutions of the metals, leading to enhanced selectivity. Bimetallic clusters of group 8 and group 1B metals are more selective than pure group 8 metals for certain reactions, such as the conversion of cyclohexanes to aromatics. Other interesting combinations include those of two group 8 metals, like platinum-palladium, platinum-rhodium, and platinum-iridium.

1. 单原子合金，尤其是钯原子嵌入铜表面，通过调整合金中d带的填充程度来增强选择性氢化反应的催化性能，从而影响活性和选择性。这通过调整合金组成实现。早期研究主要关注合金组成与无选择性考虑的氢化反应活性之间的关系。向组8金属添加组1B金属通常会降低活性，但可以影响选择性。表面几何因素在确定选择性方面起着关键作用，尤其是在二元合金系统中。具有较低升华热的成分倾向于积累在表面上，影响选择性。在与金属选择性相互作用的气体存在下，组1B金属在表面的角色发生变化。乙烷氢解为甲烷是一个有用的探针，用于研究载体上金属之间的相互作用。高度分散的二元合金簇可能具有金属在常规固态溶液中无法达到的组成，导致增强的选择性。组8和组1B金属的二元簇对于某些反应（如环己烷转化为芳烃）比纯组8金属更具有选择性。其他有趣组合包括两个组8金属的组合，如铂-钯、铂-铑和铂-铱。
