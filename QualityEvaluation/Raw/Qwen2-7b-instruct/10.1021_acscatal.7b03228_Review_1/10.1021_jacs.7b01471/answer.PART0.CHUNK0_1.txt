1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing isolated single-atom sites that exhibit high activity and selectivity. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include reaction conditions optimized for atom site exposure, metal properties favoring stability and reactivity, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts such as improved selectivity and efficiency in various catalyst systems.
