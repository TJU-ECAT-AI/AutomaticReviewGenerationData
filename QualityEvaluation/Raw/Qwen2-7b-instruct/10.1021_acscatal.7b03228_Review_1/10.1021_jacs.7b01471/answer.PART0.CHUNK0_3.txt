Isolated single-atom Pd sites in intermetallic nanostructures enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by achieving high catalytic selectivity for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The design of successful SAA catalysts requires consideration of proper reaction conditions, unique metal properties, and specific advantages over traditional catalysts, including the ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems.
