This document presents a simple method for estimating the oxygen binding energies on binary transition metal surface alloys. The method relies on the surface d-band center as a key parameter, which accounts for variations in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects. The authors compare their results with detailed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on hundreds of alloys, finding remarkable agreement in the majority of cases. This suggests the method provides a fast and effective way to estimate oxygen binding energies for a wide variety of alloys, potentially saving resources compared to experimental evaluations.
