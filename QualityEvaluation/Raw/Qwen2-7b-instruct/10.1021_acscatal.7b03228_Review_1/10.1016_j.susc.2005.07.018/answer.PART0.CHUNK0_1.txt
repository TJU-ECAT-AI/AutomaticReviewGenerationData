[1] "Although computational screening of impor- tant catalytic parameters might generally be ex- pected to be more efficient than experimental screening of such parameters, the expense associ- ated with such calculations is still not negligible, and it is thus desirable to have even simpler tech- niques for evaluating the parameters."
[2] "Several physical factors affect these d-band centers, including strain, ligand, and ensemble ef- fects."
[3] "In the simplest version of that theory, binding energies and transition state energies can be estimated from a single clean-surface parameter, the surface d-band center."
[4] "The agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on hundreds of binary surface alloys is remarkable."
[5] "Given the simplicity and relatively high accuracy of the approach, we expect that it will find application in a large number of problems in which oxygen chemistry is important, including oxygen reduction, NO reduction, CO oxidation, SO2 oxidation, and other reactions."

The document highlights the development of a simple yet effective method for estimating oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys. This approach relies on the surface d-band center model, which incorporates the effects of chemical composition, strain, and ligand interactions into the analysis of binding energies. The method is shown to agree remarkably well with full density functional theory (DFT) calculations on numerous binary surface alloys. Its simplicity and accuracy make it suitable for applications in various oxygen-related chemical processes, such as oxygen reduction, NO reduction, CO oxidation, and SO2 oxidation. The computational efficiency of this technique makes it a valuable tool for screening transition metal alloys for catalytic properties without the high costs associated with experimental methods.
