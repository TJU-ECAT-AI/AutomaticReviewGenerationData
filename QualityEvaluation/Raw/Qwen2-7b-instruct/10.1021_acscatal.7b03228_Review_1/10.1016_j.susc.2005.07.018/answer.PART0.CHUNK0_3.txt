[1] "The majority of the data points show deviations of less than 0.2 eV from the parity line;given the very simple techniques used for the estimation, this agreement is remarkably good (we also note that, given that DFT calculations often have errors on the order of 0.2 eV [19], it is not clear that further increases in the accuracy of the model would have significant practical benefits)."

[2] "The parity plot in Fig. 3 demonstrates that the oxygen binding energy estimation scheme presented above reproduces the full DFT calculations quite well."

[3] "The good agreement is strong evidence that the clean surface d-band center is a parameter of considerable descriptive power for the analysis of adsorption on surface alloys."

[4] "The simple binding energy estimation procedure performs very well for the large majority of the alloys investigated, there are clearly some systems for which the model fails."

[5] "In the cases involving pure overlayers on Cu or Ag, the deviations can be traced to the data in Table 1."

[6] "These exceptions point to the fact that ed is only the simplest parameter characterizing the electronic structure of the metal."

[7] "Finally, the scatter associated with the Fe overlayers (Fig. 3) may be due, in part, to the neglect of magnetic effects in our analyses."

[8] "Additional scatter in the parity plot may result from the approximate scheme used to estimate the ed shifts for the atoms on the alloy surfaces."

The document presents a simple scheme for estimating the oxygen binding energy on transition metal surface alloys. This scheme utilizes the surface d-band center as a key parameter, incorporating the effects of chemical composition, strain, and ligand effects. The agreement between the simple model's results and full DFT calculations on numerous binary alloys is remarkable, suggesting the d-band center's significant descriptive power for a wide range of alloy systems. The method offers a fast, reliable way to estimate oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys, potentially useful in screening catalysts for desired properties. However, some alloys exhibit deviations from the model, especially those involving noble metals or Fe layers, possibly due to the complexity of their electronic structures or the neglect of magnetic effects. The deviations highlight the limitations of using the d-band center alone in characterizing the electronic structure of metals and suggest the need for more sophisticated models to account for additional factors influencing binding energies.

文档提出了一个用于估算过渡金属表面合金氧结合能的简单方案。该方案利用表面d带中心作为关键参数，整合了组成变化、应变和配体效应的影响。大量二元合金的简单模型结果与全面的第一原理计算之间的良好一致性表明，表面d带中心在广泛合金体系中描述吸附性质的能力显著。该方法提供了一种快速可靠的方法来估算过渡金属表面合金上的氧结合能，可能对筛选具有所需特性的催化剂有用。然而，一些合金模型结果与实际数据存在偏差，尤其是那些涉及贵金属或Fe层的情况，这可能是由于它们电子结构的复杂性或磁性效应未被考虑。这些偏差强调了仅使用d带中心来表征金属电子结构的局限性，并暗示需要更复杂的模型来考虑影响结合能的其他因素。
