1. Pd2Ga offers a significantly altered electronic structure compared to elemental Pd, with its d-band center shifted away from the Fermi level. The reversibility of this effect is contingent upon the level of decomposition and the history of the sample.

2. Intermetallic compounds like Pd2Ga typically exhibit a stronger modification of the electronic structure than substitutional alloys or non-stoichiometric surface phases.

3. The covalent bonding within intermetallic compounds such as Pd2Ga contributes to enhanced structural stability, preventing dynamic subsurface chemistry.

4. The similarity in structure between Pd2Ga and other materials makes it difficult to distinguish them using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).

5. Observations of structural alterations on the surface of Pd2Ga nanoparticles were reported in HR-TEM studies.

6. The electronic structure of the surface is greatly influenced by the pre-treatment and chemical environment of the material.

7. The stability of Pd2Ga's bulk was assessed through in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) in various atmospheres.

8. The pre-reduced Pd2Ga sample contained 20% Ga oxide before undergoing in situ reduction, leading to a depletion of metallic Pd near the surface.

9. Cooling the pre-reduced Pd2Ga sample in an argon atmosphere without hydrogen resulted in a greater oxidation of approximately 75% of Ga, alongside a slightly asymmetric Pd 3d5/2 peak at 335.5 eV.

1. Pd2Ga相对于纯钯提供了显著修改的电子结构，其d带中心远离费米能级。该动态效果的可逆性取决于分解程度和样品历史。

2. 与置换合金或非等摩尔表面相相比，钯和镍的互金属化合物通常表现出更强的电子结构修改能力。

3. Pd2Ga等互金属化合物中的共价键导致了增强的结构稳定性，抑制了动态亚表面化学反应。

4. 使用高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HR-TEM）很难区分Pd2Ga与其他材料之间的相似结构。

5. Pd2Ga纳米颗粒的表面结构变化在HR-TEM研究中被观察到。

6. Pd2Ga的表面电子结构受到预处理和化学环境的强烈影响。

7. Pd2Ga的块体稳定性通过在不同气氛下的原位X射线衍射（XRD）进行了评估。

8. 预还原的Pd2Ga样品中存在20%的Ga氧化物，在进行原位还原之前，这导致了近表面Pd的流失。

9. 在无氢的氩气气氛下冷却预还原的Pd2Ga样品后，大约75%的Ga被进一步氧化，并且观察到了一个略显不对称的Pd 3d5/2峰，位于335.5 eV。
