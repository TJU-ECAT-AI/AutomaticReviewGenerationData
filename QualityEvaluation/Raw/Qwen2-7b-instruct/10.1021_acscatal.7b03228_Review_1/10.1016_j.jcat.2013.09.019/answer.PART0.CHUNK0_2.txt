1. The selective phase in hydrogenation of CC triple bonds is often not pure Pd, but an in situ formed subsurface palladiumcarbon phase, resulting from substrate decomposition. Its reversibility depends on the degree of decomposition and sample history. Achieving an almost pure intermetallic surface requires highly reducing atmospheres.

2. Different modifiers and additives in catalysts are still controversial, and their stability under reaction conditions is uncertain, as seen in PdAg alloys and CO.

3. Intermetallic compounds such as Pd3Pb and NiZn have well-ordered crystal structures and modified electronic structures, making them alternatives for acetylene hydrogenation.

4. Theoretical calculations support the superior catalytic properties of PdGa systems.

5. Pd2Ga shows a significant d-band shift, but unlike PdGa, it does not exhibit perfect site isolation.

6. Pd2Ga can be obtained in a highly active nanostructured form through co-reduction in Ga oxide-supported Pd.

7. The homogeneity range of Pd2Ga enables it to balance the loss of metallic Ga through segregation from the subsurface or bulk, resulting in a Ga oxide passivation layer.

8. Oxidation of Ga from the outermost Pd2Ga layers leaves behind minute Pd accumulations.

1. 在氢化CC三键时，选择性相通常不是纯Pd本身，而是由基质快速分解形成的内表面钯碳相，作为反应的第一步。其可逆性取决于分解的程度和样品历史。仅在高度还原的气氛中才能实现近乎纯净的互金属表面。

2. 不同的修饰剂和添加剂在催化剂中的作用仍然存在争议，并且它们在反应条件下的稳定性并不总是确定的，如通过SI中描述的PdAg合金和CO。

3. Pd3Pb和NiZn等互金属化合物具有有序的晶体结构和修改的电子结构，因此它们是乙炔氢化的替代催化剂。

4. 理论计算支持PdGa体系的优越催化性能。

5. Pd2Ga显示出显著的d能带偏移，但与PdGa不同，它不表现出完美的位点隔离。

6. 通过在Ga氧化物支持的Pd中进行协同还原，Pd2Ga可以以高度活性的纳米结构形式获得。

7. Pd2Ga具有一定的同质范围，形成的Ga氧化物钝化层可能来源于从亚表面或内部的分离，从而使IMC平衡金属Ga的损失。

8. 外部最厚的Pd2Ga层的氧化将留下微小的Pd积聚。
