[1] "The structural and electronic properties of unsupported Pd2Ga were investigated after different pre-treatments. Pd2Ga provides with respect to elemental Pd a significantly modified electronic structure with its d-band center being shifted away from the Fermi level."
[2] "The reversibility of this dynamic effect depends on the degree of decomposition and on the sample history."
[3] "The d-band center of Pd2Ga, heated to 400 C, is significantly shifted away from the Fermi level towards higher binding energies resulting in a lower density of states at the Fermi edge, which is the consequence of intermetallic compound formation and the associ- ated filling of the 4d states of Pd."
[4] "In contrast to the metallographic sample, for milled powder the reducing potential in the XPS chamber or the amount of reducing carbonaceous deposits is not sufficient for a complete reduction in the thick surface oxide layer to reform the intermetallic Pd2Ga."
[5] "The presence of 20% Ga oxide before in situ reduction must involve a Ga-depletion of the remaining Pd near-surface species."

1. Pd2Ga provides a significantly modified electronic structure compared to elemental Pd, with its d-band center shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a lower density of states at the Fermi edge. This dynamic effect's reversibility depends on the degree of decomposition and sample history.
2. The d-band center of Pd2Ga is shifted towards higher binding energies, indicating a lower density of states at the Fermi edge, due to intermetallic compound formation and filling of the 4d states of Pd.
3. The reversibility of the electronic structure modifications in Pd2Ga depends on the degree of decomposition and the sample's history. The d-band center's shift towards higher energies is a result of intermetallic compound formation and the filling of Pd's 4d states.
4. For milled Pd2Ga powder, the reducing potential in the XPS chamber or carbonaceous deposits is insufficient to fully reduce the thick surface oxide layer, preventing the reforming of the intermetallic Pd2Ga structure.
5. Before in situ reduction, about 20% of the Ga is in an oxidized state, leading to a depletion of the remaining Pd near-surface species. This depletion likely occurs due to the oxidation of the outermost Pd2Ga layers, leaving behind small accumulations of elemental Pd.

1. Pd2Ga与纯Pd相比，提供了显著修改的电子结构，其d带中心远离费米能级，导致费米边沿状态密度降低。动态效应的可逆性取决于分解的程度和样本的历史。
2. Pd2Ga的d带中心向更高的结合能方向移动，表明费米边沿状态密度降低，这是由于形成互金属化合物并填充Pd的4d状态的结果。
3. Pd2Ga的电子结构变化的可逆性取决于分解的程度和样本的历史。d带中心向更高能级的移动是互金属化合物形成和填充Pd的4d状态的结果。
4. 对于磨碎的Pd2Ga粉末，XPS室中的还原潜力或碳沉积物不足以完全还原厚表面氧化层，阻止重新形成互金属Pd2Ga结构。
5. 在原位还原之前，大约20%的Ga处于氧化状态，导致剩余Pd近表面物种的耗竭。这可能是因为外层Pd2Ga层的氧化，留下了少量的纯Pd积累。
