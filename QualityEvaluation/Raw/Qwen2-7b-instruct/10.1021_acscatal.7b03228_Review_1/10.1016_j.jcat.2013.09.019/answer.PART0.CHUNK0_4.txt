1. The structural and electronic properties of unsupported Pd2Ga were studied after various treatments. Pd2Ga offers a significantly altered electronic structure compared to elemental Pd, with its d-band center shifted away from the Fermi level. The reversibility of these changes depends on the degree of decomposition and the sample's history. Pure intermetallic surfaces can only be achieved in highly reducing atmospheres. Pd2Ga maintains chemical resistance against hydrogen or oxygen atmospheres and mechanical loads in its bulk form. 

2. Millions of unsupported Pd2Ga nanoparticles ranging from 5 to 20 nm were synthesized through a wet chemical method. 

3. The Pd 3d core-level XPS spectra of the as-prepared metallographic specimen of Pd2Ga were recorded under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and ambient conditions, as well as after heating to 400 degrees Celsius. 

4. The valence bands, characterized by the main contribution of the Pd 4d states, and the Ga 3d core-level spectra were compared for different samples at an excitation energy of 710 eV.

5. HR-TEM images provided insights into the local structure and morphology of the Pd2Ga particle surface.

6. The maximum hydrogen pressure in the XPS chamber is capped at 1 mbar, preventing a full reduction of a thick oxide layer under such conditions.

1. 在不同的预处理后，对无支撑态Pd2Ga的结构和电子性质进行了研究。与纯Pd相比，Pd2Ga提供了显著修改的电子结构，其d带中心远离费米能级。这些变化的可逆性取决于分解的程度和样本的历史。只有在高度还原的大气中才能实现近乎纯净的互金属表面。Pd2Ga的本体部分对氢气或氧气大气以及机械负载具有化学抵抗力。

2. 通过湿化学方法合成了数百万个大小从5到20纳米的无支撑Pd2Ga纳米颗粒。

3. 在UHV和室温条件下，以及加热至400摄氏度后，记录了作为制备金属lographic样品的Pd2Ga的Pd 3d核心级XPS光谱。

4. 在710 eV的激发能量下，不同样品的价带（主要由Pd 4d状态贡献）和Ga 3d核心级光谱进行了比较。

5. HR-TEM图像提供了对Pd2Ga粒子表面的局部结构和形态的深入观察。

6. XPS室内的最大氢压力限制为1 mbar，这使得在这样的条件下完全减少厚氧化层成为不可能。
