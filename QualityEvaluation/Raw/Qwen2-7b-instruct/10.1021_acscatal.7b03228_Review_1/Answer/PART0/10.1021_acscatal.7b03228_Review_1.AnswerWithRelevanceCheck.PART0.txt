          [1] "Such changes in adsorbate configuration can have profound effects on what reactions may occur."
          [2] "First, as shown in Figure 2, by a change in the electronic structure, the binding energy of propene to the surface is weakened, resulting in desorption before further dehydrogenation can occur."
          [3] "Second, the activation barrier for CC bond cleavage is higher due to the lack of the appropriate 3-fold hollow sites on the PdZn surface."
          [4] "It is interesting to ponder what the critical ensemble size would be for a given adsorption or reaction event."
          [5] "In their combined temperature-programmed desorption/scanning tunneling microscopy study, Kyriakou et al. deposited 0.01 ML (monolayer) and 0.1 ML of Pd on a Cu(111) surface to form structures where individual Pd atoms were alloyed into a Cu (111) surface."
          [6] "This prediction indicates a break from BrnstedEvansPolanyi scaling rules which would dictate that the reaction enthalpy and reaction barrier are correlated."
          [7] "First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild."
          [8] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
          [9] "For oxidation reactions, for instance, the host metal probably should be gold, since gold will not form a bulk oxide."
          [10] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy."
          [11] "In many cases, the presence of the modifier can change the adsorption configuration of the reactant."
          [12] "The modifiers must be thermally stable well above the reaction temperature of interest and preferably stable in the presence of air/water so that they are sufficiently robust."

          Single-atom alloys, particularly when Pd atoms are embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by modifying the electronic structure to weaken the binding energy of adsorbates, thereby promoting desorption before further dehydrogenation. This breaks from conventional scaling rules and allows for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include maintaining mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion, avoiding reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can exploit the unique geometric sites created by the SAA. Modifiers must be thermally stable and robust to air/water to ensure optimal performance. This approach often leads to increased selectivity and improved performance across various catalyst systems.

          特别是当钯原子嵌入铜表面时，单原子合金在选择性氢化反应中通过修改电子结构来减弱吸附剂的结合能，从而促进在进一步脱氢前的脱附，增强了催化性能。这打破了传统的缩放规则，允许从纯电子结构描述催化作用的偏离。设计成功的单原子合金(SAA)催化剂的关键标准包括维持温和的反应温度以防止金属-金属扩散，避免可能导致金属分离的活性环境，并选择能够利用SAA所创建的独特几何位点的反应。修饰剂必须具有良好的热稳定性和耐空气/水性，以确保最佳性能。这种方法往往导致提高选择性和改善各种催化剂系统的表现。

          [8] "It should be mentioned that another pathway toward steering both geometry and electronic structure has emerged through coadsorbates that act as structural modifiers."

          [10] "In the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over coated Pt/Al2O3, the use of 3-phenyl-1-propanethiol was found to give over 90% selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, whereas the analogous phenylbutanethiol and phenylethanethiol modifiers gave less than 80% selectivity."

          Single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering the electronic structure, which weakens the binding energy of adsorbates, leading to their desorption before further dehydrogenation can occur. This disruption of conventional scaling rules allows for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Essential criteria for designing effective SAA catalysts include maintaining mild reaction temperatures to prevent significant metal-metal diffusion, avoiding reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can benefit from the unique geometric sites created by the SAA. This typically implies using structure-sensitive reactions. The presence of modifiers can alter the adsorption configuration of reactants, enhancing selectivity. For example, in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over a coated Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the use of 3-phenyl-1-propanethiol as a modifier resulted in over 90% selectivity for cinnamyl alcohol, compared to less than 80% selectivity with analogous phenylbutanethiol and phenylethanethiol modifiers.

          特别是当钯原子嵌入铜表面时，单原子合金在选择性氢化反应中通过改变电子结构来削弱吸附剂的结合能，导致在进一步脱氢前的脱附，从而增强了催化性能。这打破了传统的缩放规则，允许从纯电子结构描述催化作用的偏离。设计有效的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括维持温和的反应温度以防止显著的金属-金属扩散，避免可能导致金属分离的活性环境，并选择能够利用SAA所创建的独特几何位点的反应。这通常意味着使用结构敏感的反应。修饰剂的存在可以改变反应物的吸附配置，提高选择性。例如，在使用涂层Pt/Al2O3催化剂进行肉桂醛选择性氢化时，使用3-苯基-1-丙硫醇作为修饰剂的结果显示超过90%的选择性转化为肉桂醇，而类似苯基丁硫醇和苯基乙硫醇修饰剂的选择性则低于80%。
