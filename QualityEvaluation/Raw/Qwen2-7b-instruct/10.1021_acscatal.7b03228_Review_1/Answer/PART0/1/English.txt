Single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, improve catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. Successful SAA catalyst design requires understanding reaction conditions, metal properties, and advantages over traditional catalysts. These catalysts break scaling rules and enhance selectivity across different systems.

Understanding the nobleness of gold involves studying its surface reactions and comparing them with those of other metals in the periodic table. Gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals due to the unique properties related to the filling of antibonding states and the degree of orbital overlap with adsorbates.

Single-atom alloys, particularly when Pd atoms are embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by modifying the electronic structure to weaken the binding energy of adsorbates, thereby promoting desorption before further dehydrogenation. This breaks from conventional scaling rules and allows for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include maintaining mild reaction temperatures to prevent metal-metal diffusion, avoiding reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can exploit the unique geometric sites created by the SAA. Modifiers must be thermally stable and robust to air/water to ensure optimal performance. This approach often leads to increased selectivity and improved performance across various catalyst systems.
