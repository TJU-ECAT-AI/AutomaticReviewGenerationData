[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
         [2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
         [3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."

[1] "Such changes in adsorbate configuration can have profound effects on what reactions may occur."
          [2] "First, as shown in Figure 2, by a change in the electronic structure, the binding energy of propene to the surface is weakened, resulting in desorption before further dehydrogenation can occur."
          [3] "Second, the activation barrier for CC bond cleavage is higher due to the lack of the appropriate 3-fold hollow sites on the PdZn surface."

          [7] "First, the reaction temperature must be rather mild."
          [8] "Second, one must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
          [9] "For oxidation reactions, for instance, the host metal probably should be gold, since gold will not form a bulk oxide."
          [10] "Finally the reaction chosen must be able to take advantage of the geometric site created by the single-atom alloy."

          [12] "The modifiers must be thermally stable well above the reaction temperature of interest and preferably stable in the presence of air/water so that they are sufficiently robust."

[1] "In the context of the study, we have explored the role of single-atom alloys (SAA) in enhancing the catalytic performance of PtSn catalysts."
