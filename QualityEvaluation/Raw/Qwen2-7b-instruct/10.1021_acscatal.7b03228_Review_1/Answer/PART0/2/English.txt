Single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, significantly enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Successful SAA catalyst design relies on understanding reaction conditions, metal properties, and the specific advantages they offer over traditional catalysts, which include breaking scaling rules and improving selectivity across different systems.

Gold is considered the noblest of all metals due to its exceptional inertness, which is primarily attributed to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. This unique property allows gold to form very stable alloys with numerous other metals.

Single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering the electronic structure, which weakens the binding energy of adsorbates, leading to their desorption before further dehydrogenation can occur. This disruption of conventional scaling rules allows for a departure from a purely electronic structure description of catalysis. Essential criteria for designing effective SAA catalysts include maintaining mild reaction temperatures to prevent significant metal-metal diffusion, avoiding reactive environments that could lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that can benefit from the unique geometric sites created by the SAA. This typically implies using structure-sensitive reactions. The presence of modifiers can alter the adsorption configuration of reactants, enhancing selectivity. For example, in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over a coated Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the use of 3-phenyl-1-propanethiol as a modifier resulted in over 90% selectivity for cinnamyl alcohol, compared to less than 80% selectivity with analogous phenylbutanethiol and phenylethanethiol modifiers.
