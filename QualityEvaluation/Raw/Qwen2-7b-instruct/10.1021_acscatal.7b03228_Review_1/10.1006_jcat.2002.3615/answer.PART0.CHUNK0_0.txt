Based on the extensive set of density functional theory calculations, it is shown that for a class of catalytic reactions, there is a universal, reactant-independent relation between the reaction activation energy and the stability of reaction intermediates. This leads to a universal relationship between adsorption energies and catalytic activity, which can be used to pinpoint the best catalyst for a given reaction.

The universal relation between activation energy and binding energy directly suggests a general approach to optimizing the catalyst by searching for new materials with adsorbate-surface interaction strengths in the right range. This principle has already been used to find a new ammonia catalyst, where the adsorption properties of N2 on CoMo alloys turn out to be intermediate between those of Co and Mo, which bind nitrogen either too weakly or too strongly. The alloy has adsorption properties close to optimal and has been found experimentally to be a much better ammonia catalyst than either constituent.

这一普遍关系直接表明，通过寻找具有正确吸附剂-表面相互作用强度的新材料来优化催化剂的方法。这个原理已经被用来找到一个新的氨催化剂，在这里，氮气在CoMo合金上的吸附性质介于Co和Mo之间，它们分别将氮气吸附得太弱或太强。合金的吸附性质接近最优，并且实验上发现它比任何组成成分都更适合作为氨催化剂。
