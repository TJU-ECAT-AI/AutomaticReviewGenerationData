[1] "The existence of a universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi curve for the class of molecules considered here has an interesting consequence. If we assume that the overall kinetics of these reactions follows the same pattern—dissociation is rate-limiting when the barrier is high and blocking of the surface is limiting the reactivity when the adsorbates bind strongly to the surface—then the universality in Fig. 2 translates into universality in terms of the volcano curves."
[2] "For ammonia synthesis (N2 activation) both Ru and Fe lie within this range; see Table 1. For CO activation (Fischer Tropsch synthesis) the same is true for Rh, Co, Ni, and Ru, and for NO activation it is Pd and Pt. For O2 activation none of the metals we have considered are in the optimum range, but the closest are Ag (0.65eV), Pd (1.56 eV), and Pt (2.2 eV)."
[3] "The important parameter characterizing the reactivity of a given metal is the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This parameter has its optimum value for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants, and the variation in optimum catalyst from one reaction to the next follows directly from this principle."

1. The universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi curve indicates that the overall kinetics of reactions involving dissociation and surface blocking are governed by the activation energy and the stability of the reaction intermediates. This universality implies that the volcano curves describing catalytic activity are also universal for reactions within the same class. 

2. Metals like Ru, Fe, Rh, Co, Ni, Pd, and Pt are identified as being within the optimum range for their respective reactions based on the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E. For instance, Ru and Fe are optimal for ammonia synthesis, Rh, Co, Ni, and Ru are suitable for CO activation, Pd and Pt are ideal for NO activation, whereas none of the metals tested are optimal for O2 activation, but Ag, Pd, and Pt come closest.

3. The reactivity of a metal catalyst is fundamentally determined by the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This energy varies optimally for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants, leading to a variation in the best catalyst for each reaction class.

1. 对于涉及解离和表面阻塞的反应，存在一个普遍的BrnstedEvansPolanyi曲线表明整体动力学遵循相同的模式。当障碍高时，解离是限制步骤，而当吸附物强烈结合到表面上时，表面阻塞限制活性。这意味着图2中的普遍性在火山曲线中转化为普遍性。

2. 根据吸附剂表面相互作用能E的范围，Ru、Fe、Rh、Co、Ni、Pd和Pt被确定为各自反应的理想金属。例如，Ru和Fe适用于氨合成，Rh、Co、Ni、和Ru适用于CO激活，Pd和Pt适用于NO激活，而没有测试的金属适用于O2激活，但银、Pd和Pt最接近理想。

3. 金属催化剂的活性根本上由吸附剂表面相互作用能在解离过程的最终状态的能量决定，即E。这种能量对不同金属来说因反应物性质的不同而有不同的最优值，导致每种反应类别的最佳催化剂发生变化。
