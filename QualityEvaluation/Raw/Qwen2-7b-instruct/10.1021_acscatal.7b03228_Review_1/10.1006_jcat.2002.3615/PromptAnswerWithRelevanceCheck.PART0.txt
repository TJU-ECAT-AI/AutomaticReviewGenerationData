Based on the extensive set of density functional theory calculations, it is shown that for a class of catalytic reactions, there is a universal, reactant-independent relation between the reaction activation energy and the stability of reaction intermediates. This leads to a universal relationship between adsorption energies and catalytic activity, which can be used to pinpoint the best catalyst for a given reaction.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The universal relation between activation energy and binding energy directly suggests a general approach to optimizing the catalyst by searching for new materials with adsorbate-surface interaction strengths in the right range. This principle has already been used to find a new ammonia catalyst, where the adsorption properties of N2 on CoMo alloys turn out to be intermediate between those of Co and Mo, which bind nitrogen either too weakly or too strongly. The alloy has adsorption properties close to optimal and has been found experimentally to be a much better ammonia catalyst than either constituent.

这一普遍关系直接表明，通过寻找具有正确吸附剂-表面相互作用强度的新材料来优化催化剂的方法。这个原理已经被用来找到一个新的氨催化剂，在这里，氮气在CoMo合金上的吸附性质介于Co和Mo之间，它们分别将氮气吸附得太弱或太强。合金的吸附性质接近最优，并且实验上发现它比任何组成成分都更适合作为氨催化剂。

The document elucidates how the concept of universality in heterogeneous catalysis applies to a particular class of reactions, demonstrating a consistent relationship between the activation energy and the stability of reaction intermediates. This universal relationship enables the prediction of adsorption energies and catalytic activity, leading to insights into optimizing catalysts and understanding their performance across various reactions. The document further explains that the optimal catalyst for a given reaction is characterized by a low activation energy and weakly bound intermediates. It also highlights that the universality principle aligns with known facts about catalysts and opens avenues for enhancing catalyst design. The document further discusses the role of transition state structures and adsorbate surface interaction energies in determining the reactivity of catalysts. The universality of the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi curve is attributed to the similarity of transition state geometries across different reactants, indicating that the relationship between activation energy and adsorption energy is independent of the specific reactants involved. This principle facilitates the identification of catalysts with optimal surface interaction energies, leading to improved catalytic performance and selectivity. The document acknowledges the importance of DFT calculations in establishing and testing this principle, providing a robust foundation for the development of novel catalysts and materials.

[1] "The existence of a universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi curve for the class of molecules considered here has an interesting consequence. If we assume that the overall kinetics of these reactions follows the same pattern—dissociation is rate-limiting when the barrier is high and blocking of the surface is limiting the reactivity when the adsorbates bind strongly to the surface—then the universality in Fig. 2 translates into universality in terms of the volcano curves."
[2] "For ammonia synthesis (N2 activation) both Ru and Fe lie within this range; see Table 1. For CO activation (Fischer Tropsch synthesis) the same is true for Rh, Co, Ni, and Ru, and for NO activation it is Pd and Pt. For O2 activation none of the metals we have considered are in the optimum range, but the closest are Ag (0.65eV), Pd (1.56 eV), and Pt (2.2 eV)."
[3] "The important parameter characterizing the reactivity of a given metal is the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This parameter has its optimum value for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants, and the variation in optimum catalyst from one reaction to the next follows directly from this principle."

1. The universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi curve indicates that the overall kinetics of reactions involving dissociation and surface blocking are governed by the activation energy and the stability of the reaction intermediates. This universality implies that the volcano curves describing catalytic activity are also universal for reactions within the same class. 

2. Metals like Ru, Fe, Rh, Co, Ni, Pd, and Pt are identified as being within the optimum range for their respective reactions based on the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E. For instance, Ru and Fe are optimal for ammonia synthesis, Rh, Co, Ni, and Ru are suitable for CO activation, Pd and Pt are ideal for NO activation, whereas none of the metals tested are optimal for O2 activation, but Ag, Pd, and Pt come closest.

3. The reactivity of a metal catalyst is fundamentally determined by the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This energy varies optimally for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants, leading to a variation in the best catalyst for each reaction class.

1. 对于涉及解离和表面阻塞的反应，存在一个普遍的BrnstedEvansPolanyi曲线表明整体动力学遵循相同的模式。当障碍高时，解离是限制步骤，而当吸附物强烈结合到表面上时，表面阻塞限制活性。这意味着图2中的普遍性在火山曲线中转化为普遍性。

2. 根据吸附剂表面相互作用能E的范围，Ru、Fe、Rh、Co、Ni、Pd和Pt被确定为各自反应的理想金属。例如，Ru和Fe适用于氨合成，Rh、Co、Ni、和Ru适用于CO激活，Pd和Pt适用于NO激活，而没有测试的金属适用于O2激活，但银、Pd和Pt最接近理想。

3. 金属催化剂的活性根本上由吸附剂表面相互作用能在解离过程的最终状态的能量决定，即E。这种能量对不同金属来说因反应物性质的不同而有不同的最优值，导致每种反应类别的最佳催化剂发生变化。

Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing surfaces with adsorbate-surface interaction strengths that are optimally tuned for the reactions they catalyze. The essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include:

1. **Reaction Conditions**: Selecting conditions that allow for the formation of the desired SAA structure, such as Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, which can offer unique electronic and geometric properties not available in bulk materials. These conditions might involve specific temperatures, pressures, or the presence of activating agents that facilitate the formation of the alloy.

2. **Metal Properties**: Choosing metals that form stable SAA structures with the right balance of electronic and atomic properties. In the context of hydrogenation reactions, metals that can effectively adsorb and activate hydrogen molecules while maintaining strong interaction with the support material (like Cu) are crucial.

3. **Specific Advantages**: SAAs offer enhanced selectivity and efficiency due to the precise control over the number of active sites, which can lead to improved reaction rates and product purity. They can break scaling rules by achieving high activity at lower temperatures or pressures compared to conventional catalysts, potentially reducing energy consumption and cost.

4. **Ability to Break Scaling Rules**: SAAs demonstrate the ability to operate under conditions that traditional catalysts cannot achieve, such as higher temperatures or pressures, without sacrificing selectivity or activity. This opens up new possibilities for industrial processes that require high efficiency at challenging operating conditions.

5. **Improving Selectivity**: By carefully tuning the adsorption properties of the active metal on the support, SAAs can selectively catalyze desired reactions over undesired ones, leading to higher yields of the target product and reduced waste.

In summary, the design of successful SAAs for selective hydrogenation involves a deep understanding of the interplay between metal properties, support materials, and reaction conditions, with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal catalytic performance tailored to specific applications.
