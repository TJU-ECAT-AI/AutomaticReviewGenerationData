[1] "The important parameter characterizing the reactivity of a given metal is the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This parameter has its optimum value for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants."
[2] "For ammonia synthesis (N2 activation) both Ru and Fe lie within this range; see Table 1. For CO activation (Fischer Tropsch synthesis) the same is true for Rh, Co, Ni, and Ru, and for NO activation it is Pd and Pt. For O2 activation none of the metals we have considered are in the optimum range, but the closest are Ag (0.65eV), Pd (1.56 eV), and Pt (2.2 eV)."

1. The reactivity of a metal in heterogeneous catalysis is characterized by the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This energy has an optimum value for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants. Metals that lie within this optimum range exhibit enhanced catalytic activity.

2. For ammonia synthesis, both ruthenium (Ru) and iron (Fe) are within the optimum range for adsorbate surface interaction energy, which is between 1.40 and 0.8 eV. For carbon monoxide (CO) activation, rhodium (Rh), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and ruthenium (Ru) are within the optimum range. For nitric oxide (NO) reduction, palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) are within the optimum range. However, for oxygen (O2) activation, none of the metals considered in the study fall within the optimum range, with silver (Ag) being the closest at 0.65 eV, palladium (Pd) at 1.56 eV, and platinum (Pt) at 2.2 eV.

1. 催化剂活性由吸附物与表面的相互作用能E决定，这是在主要反应分子解离过程的最终状态。这个能量对于不同金属和反应物性质有不同的最优值。

2. 对于氨合成（N2激活），钌（Ru）和铁（Fe）处于最优吸附作用能范围内，范围为1.40到0.8 eV。对于CO激活（费希尔-特罗普斯合成），铑（Rh）、钴（Co）、镍（Ni）和钌（Ru）处于最优范围内。对于NO还原，钯（Pd）和铂（Pt）处于最优范围内。然而，在氧气（O2）激活中，研究中考虑的所有金属均未落在最优范围内，银（Ag）最接近，为0.65 eV，钯（Pd）为1.56 eV，铂（Pt）为2.2 eV。
