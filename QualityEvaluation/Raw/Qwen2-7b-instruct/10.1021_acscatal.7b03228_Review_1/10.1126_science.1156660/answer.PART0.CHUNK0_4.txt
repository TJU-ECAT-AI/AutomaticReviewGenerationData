[1] "Felix Studt Hydrogenation of Acetylene Identification of Non-Precious Metal Alloy Catalysts for Selective"
[2] "The detection of a jet in a DN with similar disc/jet coupling as that seen in XRBs suggests that there may be a common jet-launching mechanism in CVs and XRBs."
[3] "With the exception of source classes similar to soft-state XRBs, all accretion-powered jet-emitting sources from YSOs (26), via AGN (27) to gamma-ray bursts (28), seem to have a jet-launching efficiency (that is, the ratio of the jet power to the power liberated in the accretion flow) of 10%."

The study by Felix Studt focuses on identifying non-precious metal alloy catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of acetylene. It also explores the common jet-launching mechanism between cataclysmic variables (CVs) and X-ray binaries (XRBs), suggesting a potential connection in disc/jet coupling. Additionally, it is noted that most accretion-powered jet-emitting sources, ranging from young stellar objects (YSOs) to gamma-ray bursts, exhibit a jet-launching efficiency of around 10%.

Felix Studt的研究专注于识别用于选择性乙炔氢化的非贵金属合金催化剂。它还探讨了恒星变体（CV）和X射线双星（XRB）之间的共同喷流发射机制，暗示了盘/喷流耦合的潜在联系。此外，注意到大多数吸积动力喷流发射源，从年轻的恒星物体（YSO）到伽马射线暴（GRB），其喷流发射效率约为10%。
