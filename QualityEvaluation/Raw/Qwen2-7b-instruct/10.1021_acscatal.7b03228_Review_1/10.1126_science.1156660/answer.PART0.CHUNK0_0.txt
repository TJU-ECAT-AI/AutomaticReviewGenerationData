[2] "A smaller distance of 80 pc would be required to bring SS Cyg's peak accretion rate in line with typical values for DNe (25)."
[3] "Using this distance and an accretion rate of 5 × 109 Myear1 during the rise, we obtain a flux of 0.7 mJy, in agreement with the observations."
[4] "However, if the HST distance is correct and the accretion rate is indeed as high as 107 Myear1, we have to assume an accretion rate during the rise of 5 × 108 M yr1."
[5] "The detection of a jet in a DN with similar disc/jet coupling as that seen in XRBs suggests that there may be a common jet-launching mechanism in CVs and XRBs."
[6] "With the exception of source classes similar to soft-state XRBs, all accretion-powered jet-emitting sources from YSOs (26), via AGN (27) to gamma-ray bursts (28), seem to have a jet-launching efficiency (that is, the ratio of the jet power to the power liberated in the accretion flow) of 10%."

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing highly active sites for the reaction. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include optimizing reaction conditions, selecting appropriate metals based on their chemical properties, and ensuring efficient electron transfer for enhanced reactivity. These catalysts often break scaling rules due to their unique structure, leading to improved selectivity and activity compared to traditional catalysts.

2. The study suggests that non-magnetic DNe (Dwarf Nova) with similar disc/jet coupling as observed in X-ray Binaries (XRBs) might exhibit a common jet-launching mechanism shared between CVs (Cataclysmic Variables) and XRBs. This implies a potential universality in the jet production process across different accreting systems, including CVs and XRBs, which could be attributed to similar disc/jet coupling mechanisms.

1. 单原子合金，特别是钯原子嵌入铜表面，通过提供高度活性位点来增强选择性氢化反应的催化性能。设计成功的单原子合金催化剂的关键因素包括优化反应条件、选择具有适当化学性质的金属以及确保高效电子转移以提高反应活性。这些催化剂往往能够打破传统的规模规则，导致更高的选择性和活性，与传统催化剂相比。

2. 研究表明，具有类似X射线双星(XRB)中观测到的盘/喷流耦合的非磁性矮新星(DNe)可能具有CV(类双星)和XRB之间共享的共同喷流发射机制。这暗示了不同吸积系统（包括CV和XRB）中喷流产生的潜在普遍性，可以归因于相似的盘/喷流耦合机制。
