Answer: The literature does not provide direct information on how single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. However, it suggests that these alloys might exhibit improved selectivity and efficiency in reactions due to their unique properties compared to traditional catalysts. Essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy catalysts could include the precise control of metal dispersion, surface chemistry, and interaction with substrates. The literature also implies that these catalysts might break scaling rules and offer superior performance across various systems due to their optimized activity and selectivity.
