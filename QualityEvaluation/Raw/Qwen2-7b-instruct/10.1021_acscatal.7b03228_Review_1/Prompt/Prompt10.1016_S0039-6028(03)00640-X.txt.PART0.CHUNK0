Keywords: Gold; Plasma processing; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Oxygen Gold is the most noble of all metals due to the lack of reactivity [1]. Golds unique properties make it useful for fabricating some electronic components used in semiconductor technology.
For example, it is used in first- or second-level metalization, and as a plating metal during the backside processing of GaAs devices [2]. Gold is also a highly active catalyst of the hydrogenation of CO2 on supported metal oxides [3]. In semi- conductor processing, O2-plasma and UV/ozone are involved in methods by which a clean, hydro- philic gold surface is produced [4]. Recently,several reports have shown that oxidation easily occurs when a gold film is exposed in highly re- active chemical environments, such as during O2- plasma discharge or in UV/ozone, [410] typically altering the electrical characteristics of the mate- rial. The chemical shift of the Au-4f and O-1s levels obtained from X-ray photoelectron spec- troscopy, XPS, has been conclusively elucidated the oxidation of gold and revealed that the oxide is Au2O3 [5,6,9,11]. Thermodynamically, the heat of formation (DHf) of Au2O3 is estimated to be +19.3 kJ/mol, implying that the oxide is unstable [3]. As reported in the literature, the Au2O3 or the oxygen atoms can be removed or dissolved by thermal desorption spectroscopy, TDS, at above 100 C [5,7,9,10]. However, the relationship between the nobility of gold and the instability of its oxide * Corresponding author. Tel.: +886-356-38686; fax: +886- 356-38432.

This work investigated the time dependence of the dissociation process of Au2O3 at temperatures 22100 C, by monitoring surface resistance. The kinetics of Au2O3 dissociation were thus eluci- dated. Au films were deposited on 6 in. Si sub- strates by physical vapor deposition to a thickness of 100 nm. The Au films were then oxidized by exposure to O2-plasma for 1 min, and the thick- ness of the oxide was estimated to exceed 4 nm by XPS [9]. The gas pressure and the forward power of the microwave were maintained at 1200 mTorr and 600 W, respectively. The surface resistances of the Au films and the Au oxides were measured using a typical four-point probe system, and the average resistance was calculated across 52 differ- ent points on the wafer. The Au oxide was ther- mally treated on a hot plate at a temperature of 22100 C, to control the dissociation of the Au oxide, which were examined in air and the mois- ture content was maintained at 45%. Furthermore, XPS experiments were conducted during the dis- sociation of the Au oxide to determine the binding of Au and O, for comparison as the surface re- sistance changes.
Fig. 1 presents the average surface resistance of Au2O3 films formed by the O2-plasma treatment of Au films at various temperatures (22, 50, 75 and 100 C). The surface resistances are also measured at various times and normalized to Rt  Rmin= Rmax  Rmin (indicated by arrows),where Rt, Rmin and Rmax are the instantaneous,minimal and maximal surface resistances, respec- tively. The resistances clearly fall in time, before eventually returning to their initial values. The processes at higher temperatures proceed faster because less time is required for the resistances to return to their initial values. Fig. 2 and the inset show XPS spectra that indicate that the Au-4f and O-1s peaks were obtained from untreated (NON-sample) and O2-plasma-treated Au films (D0-, D2- and D4-samples) at 22 C, where D0 is the as-treated sample, D2 is the sample held in air for 2 days and D4 is the sample held in air for 4 days. Each peak is fitted to a Lorentzian equa- tion. An Au reference sample was used to define the origin of the binding energy for calibration.
Table 1 details the chemical shift of Au-4f and O- 1s levels and the related intensities. As shown in Fig. 2, the O2-plasma as-treated Au film (D0- sample) has two extra peaks (AuO1 and AuO2,dashed lines) at energies of 85.5 and 89.4 eV,unlike the untreated Au film (NON-sample), in which the Au is bonded to O in an Au2O3 structure, as confirmed in the literature [5,6,9]. 1 10 100

The intensities of these two AuO peaks gradually decay when the D0-sample is held in air for 2 days (D2-sample) following O2-plasma treatment,and the AuO peaks completely disappear after about 4 days (D4-sample) at 22 C, as indicated in Table 1. For gold elements, moreover, the in- tensities of the AuAu1 and AuAu2 peaks in the D0-sample (the O2-plasma as-treated sample) de- clined considerably, compared with the untreated Au film (NON-sample), due to the oxidation of gold; but, after the as-treated sample was held in air for 4 days (D4-sample), the intensities of Au Au peaks could be gradually and fully restored, as also indicated in Table 1. These results indicate that an Au oxide can be formed by O2-plasma treatment of Au film and then spontaneously and completely dissociated in air at 22 C; and as shown in Fig. 1 (which depicts the surface resis- tances of the D2- and D4-samples), the dissocia- tion process is accordingly correlated to the decline in surface resistance. However, the ener- gies of the AuAu peaks of the D0-sample (83.9 eV) were also shifted from those of the NON- sample (84.05 eV), before gradually returning to
84.05 eV as the dissociation proceeded. The shift
of the AuAu peaks in the case of the D0-sample is probably caused by the stress in the lattice due to the production of the oxide [9]. The chemical shift in the O-1s level was also determined for NON-, D0-, D2- and D4-samples, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2 and Table 1. The O-1s peak of the D0-sample can be assigned to the O atom bonded to Au in Au2O3 (530.4  0.2 eV) and the O-1s peaks of NON- and D4-samples (531.8  0.2 eV) are attributable to O in hydroxyl groups [6,9].
However, the O-1s peak of the D4-sample is higher than that of the NON-sample, indicating that, after Au oxide was completely dissociated,the O atoms translated from Au2O3 remained in the Au films at 22 C, and were associated with bulk oxygen, diffusing out of the surface at high temperature, as has been determined by TDS [10].
The time dependence of a reaction is generally described by a first-order rate equation, dc=dt Kc, where c is the concentration of the reactive species and K is the rate constant. Integration yields c  c0 expKt, where c0 is the concentra- tion at time t  0. The surface resistances of Au2O3 films can be analyzed by applying the first- order rate equation: Rt  Rmin=Rmax  Rmin c0 expKt, where c0 is already normalized to be unity. The data of surface resistance against time in Fig. 1 at various temperatures, are consistent with the first-order rate equation (solid lines). At 22 C, the rate constant K is 0.00052 min1. The half-life, t1=2  ln 2=K, is 22 h at 22 C and 166 h (around 7 days) at 0 C. The activation energy for the dissociation Ea can be determined from a plot of lnK vs. 1=T (Arrhenius equation, ln K Ea=kT  ln A, where k is the Boltzmann constant; T is the temperature, and A is a factor). As shown in the inset of Fig. 1, the activation energy Ea was calculated from the slope to be 57 kJ/mol (0.6 eV), which is of the same as the AuO bond dissociation energy [7].
In summary, the kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were elucidated by monitoring the surface resistances that correspond to changes in the chemical bonding in films. Au2O3 has a short half- life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol,indicating instability even at low temperatures.
The results of electrical resistance also revealed that the electrical properties are not degraded after Table 1 The chemical shift of Au-4f and O-1s levels (BE) and the related intensities [I, normalized by maximum intensities of AuAu1 (NON- sample), AuO1 (D0-sample) and O-1s (D0-sample) for AuAu1, AuO1 and O-1s peaks, respectively] of the samples in Fig. 2 O2-plasma process Au-4f (AuAu1) Au-4f (AuO1) O-1s BE (eV)
