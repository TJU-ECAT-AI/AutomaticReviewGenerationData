1. The selectivity of modified catalysts is largely determined by the arrangement of sulfur atoms, not the specific type of tail group attached to the thiol.

2. The high epoxybutane selectivity across different alkyl thiols, despite variations in activity, suggests that the mechanism involves factors beyond simple site blocking.

3. Increasing the concentration of carbon monoxide in the feed did not significantly alter the selectivity for epoxybutane, indicating that ensemble effects do not fully explain the enhanced selectivity.

4. Removing surface sulfur through exposure to hydrogen sulfide reduced selectivity for epoxybutane, highlighting the importance of sulfur in the catalytic process.

5. Depositing alkylidyne species onto the palladium surface did not lead to the desired selectivity, suggesting that SAMs have unique properties.

6. Surface sulfur can significantly alter the geometric and electronic structure of platinum group metals, affecting catalytic activity.

7. Geometric changes due to sulfur can reduce the activity of catalysts in reactions requiring multiple metal atoms and tightly bound intermediates.

8. Electronic effects from sulfur, similar to those seen in the synthesis of vinyl acetate on palladium, can destabilize adsorbates, favoring bond-making reactions.

9. The mechanism behind the enhanced selectivity of SAM-coated catalysts involves the destabilization of adsorbates, promoting bond-making over bond-breaking.

10. Catalysts exposed to dilute hydrogen sulfide or sulfur-containing molecules like thiophene do not achieve the same level of selectivity as those with alkanethiol SAM coatings.

1. 改性催化剂的选择性主要由硫原子的排列决定，而不是连接到巯基的尾基的特定类型。

2. 不同的烷基硫醇表现出高环氧乙烷选择性，尽管活性有所变化，这表明机制可能涉及单纯的位点阻塞之外的因素。

3. 增加二氧化碳浓度在气相中并未显著改变环氧乙烷的产率，表明群体效应并不能完全解释增强的选择性。

4. 通过暴露于氢化硫来移除表面硫降低了环氧乙烷的选择性，强调了硫在催化过程中的重要性。

5. 将烷基二烯体沉积到钯表面并未导致预期的选择性，暗示SAM具有独特的性质。

6. 硫酸盐可以显著改变铂族金属的几何和电子结构，影响催化活性。

7. 由于硫引起的几何变化可以降低需要多个金属原子和紧密结合中间体的催化剂的活性。

8. 硫在钯上合成醋酸乙烯酯时观察到的电子效应，可以破坏吸附剂，促进形成键的反应而不是断开键的反应。

9. SAM涂层催化剂的机制涉及吸附剂的破坏，促进形成键而非断裂键。

10. 靠近氢硫化物或容易裂解的硫化合物如噻吩的催化剂并未达到与含烷基硫醇SAM涂层催化剂相同的选择性水平。
