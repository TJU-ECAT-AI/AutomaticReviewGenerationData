<p>These results suggest that although the identity of the moiety attached to the thiol group (that is, the so-called tail group) is a major determinant of the activity of the modified catalyst, the selectivity is essentially independent of the tail group identity, and is therefore likely to be due to the arrangement of the sulphur atoms.</p>
<p>The contrast between the uniformly high epoxybutane selectivity for all of the alkanethiol coatings and the activity varying with tail length suggests differing mechanisms for the effect of the SAMs on selectivity and activity.</p>
<p>To investigate the effect of the head group, we exposed the uncoated catalyst to 1,000 ppm H2S in nitrogen for periods between 5 s and 2 h at room temperature and then purged the residual H2S in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.</p>
<p>The impact of the alkyl tail without surface sulphur was evaluated by exposing the palladium catalyst to alkenes to produce a metal surface containing substantial coverages of alkylidyne (C(CH2)nCH3) species.</p>

<p>Although the sulphur head group of alkanethiol SAMs seems to control selectivity modification, the tail groups have a strong influence on activity.</p>

The research demonstrates that the arrangement of sulfur atoms within the alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is crucial for the high selectivity of hydrogenation reactions towards epoxybutane. The sulfur head group is responsible for controlling the selectivity, while the tail group affects the activity of the catalyst. Exposure to sulfur through hydrogen sulfide provides similar enhancements in selectivity as SAM coatings, but the SAM method offers advantages over traditional sulfur exposure methods in terms of controlling sulfur coverage and preventing deleterious effects on catalyst performance. The results also indicate that the thiol SAMs can maintain high selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, such as the selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to butyraldehyde, even under varying conversion and residence time conditions.

研究表明，烷基硫醇自组装单层（SAM）中硫原子的排列对于氢化反应向环氧乙烷的高选择性至关重要。硫头部是控制选择性的关键，而尾巴部分影响催化剂的活性。通过氢化物暴露于硫提供了与SAM涂层相似的选择性增强，但SAM方法在控制硫覆盖和防止对催化剂性能的不利影响方面具有传统硫暴露方法的优势。结果还表明，硫醇SAM可以在各种转化率和停留时间条件下保持高选择性的氢化反应，如选择性氢化顺丁烯醛到丁醛。
