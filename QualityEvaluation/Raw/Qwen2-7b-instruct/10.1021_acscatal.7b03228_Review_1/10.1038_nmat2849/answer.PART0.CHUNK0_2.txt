<p>Experiments were also conducted varying the amount of catalyst (up to 200 mg) and the total feed flow rate to evaluate selectivity as a function of EpB conversion for the uncoated and octadecanethiol- coated catalysts at 313 K. Whereas selectivity on the uncoated catalyst exhibited a maximum of 31  3% at less than 1% EpB conversion and decreased to 8  2% at between 99 and 100% EpB conversion, selectivity on the C18-coated catalyst was greater than 99% at less than 1% conversion, and 532% at between 99 and 100% conversion.</p>
<p>The most active SAM-coated catalyst, C18,exhibited epoxybutane formation rates that were approximately 40% of the rate for the uncoated catalyst.</p>
<p>In addition, the data in Fig. 3 suggest that although the identity of the moiety attached to the thiol group (that is, the so-called tail group) is a major determinant of the activity of the modified catalyst, the selectivity is essentially independent of the tail group identity, and is therefore likely to be due to the arrangement of the sulphur atoms.</p>
<p>Vibrational spectroscopy has been used extensively to determine the degree of molecular organization with SAMs deposited on Pd (ref. 14), Ag (ref. 15), Cu (ref. 15) and Au (refs 1518).</p>
<p>The contrast between the uniformly high epoxybutane selectivity for all of the alkanethiol coatings and the activity varying with tail length suggests differing mechanisms for the effect of the SAMs on selectivity and activity.</p>
<p>Previous studies show that the effect of surface sulphur can change both the geometric and electronic structure of platinum group metals33.</p>

1. The selectivity of the octadecanethiol-coated catalyst was significantly higher than that of the uncoated catalyst, reaching over 99% at low EpB conversion and maintaining a high selectivity even at high conversions.

2. The most active SAM-coated catalyst, which was octadecanethiol-coated, exhibited epoxybutane formation rates that were approximately 40% of the rate for the uncoated catalyst.

3. The selectivity of the modified catalysts was largely unaffected by the type of tail group, indicating that the arrangement of sulfur atoms was the primary factor influencing selectivity.

4. Vibrational spectroscopy was used to assess the molecular organization of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on various metals, including palladium.

5. The selectivity enhancement observed with SAM-coated catalysts was attributed to the arrangement of sulfur atoms, rather than the specific function of the thiols as site-blocking agents.

6. The selectivity enhancement provided by SAM coatings was distinct from that achieved by surface sulfiding, suggesting that the SAMs had unique properties.

7. The supported palladium catalyst in the study presented a complex surface with multiple facets, not just the (111) crystal plane.

1. 八碳醇涂层催化剂的高选择性远高于未涂层催化剂，低乙氧基丁烯转化率下可达99%以上，即使在高转化率下仍保持高选择性。

2. 最活跃的SAM涂层催化剂，即八碳醇涂层，其环氧丁烷形成速率约为未涂层催化剂的40%。

3. 修改后的催化剂的选择性主要不受尾基团类型的影响，表明硫原子排列是影响选择性的主要因素。

4. 振动光谱被用来评估沉积在钯等不同金属上的自组装单层（SAM）的分子组织。

5. SAM涂层催化剂的选择性增强归因于硫原子的排列，而不是硫醇作为位点阻断剂的特定功能。

6. SAM涂层提供的选择性增强与通过暴露于稀释的H2S或易裂解的含硫分子（如噻吩）实现的选择性增强不同，表明SAM具有独特性质。

7. 研究中使用的支持钯催化剂表面复杂，不仅包括（111）晶面。
