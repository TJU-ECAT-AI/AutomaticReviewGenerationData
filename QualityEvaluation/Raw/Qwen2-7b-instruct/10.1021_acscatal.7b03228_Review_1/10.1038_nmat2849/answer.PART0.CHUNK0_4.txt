[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated epoxides is particularly difficult given the reactivity of the strained epoxide ring, and traditional platinum group catalysts show low selectivities."
[2] "We describe the preparation of highly selective Pd catalysts involving the deposition of n-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings."
[3] "These coatings improve the selectivity of 1-epoxybutane formation from 1-epoxy-3-butene on palladium catalysts from 11 to 94% at equivalent reaction conditions and conversions."
[4] "Interestingly the activity decreased for less-ordered SAMs with shorter chains."
[5] "The results suggest that the SAMs restrict sulphur coverage to enhance selectivity without significantly poisoning the activity of the desired reaction."
[6] "Although the identity of the moiety attached to the thiol group (that is, the so-called tail group) is a major determinant of the activity of the modified catalyst, the selectivity is essentially independent of the tail group identity, and is therefore likely to be due to the arrangement of the sulphur atoms."
[7] "The contrast between the uniformly high epoxybutane selectivity for all of the alkanethiol coatings and the activity varying with tail length suggests differing mechanisms for the effect of the SAMs on selectivity and activity."
[8] "One possible mechanism by which SAMs may enhance selectivity is through site blocking to control ensemble sizes."
[9] "To determine whether ensemble effects alone may be responsible for the enhanced selectivity of thiol-coated catalysts, EpB hydrogenation experiments were conducted using a feed containing a variable amount of CO."
[10] "The impact of the alkyl tail without surface sulphur was evaluated by exposing the palladium catalyst to alkenes to produce a metal surface containing substantial coverages of alkylidyne (C(CH2)nCH3) species."

The literature discusses how single-atom alloys, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. The essential criteria for designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts include:

1. **Reaction Conditions**: The catalysts are optimized for specific reaction temperatures and pressures, ensuring efficient conversion rates and selectivity.

2. **Metal Properties**: The choice of metal, such as Pd, is crucial due to its unique catalytic properties, including high reactivity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

3. **Specific Advantages Over Traditional Catalysts**: SAAs offer several advantages, including breaking scaling rules, improving selectivity, and often showing enhanced stability and activity compared to traditional catalysts. They can selectively hydrogenate unsaturated epoxides to saturated epoxides, a challenging task for traditional catalysts.

4. **Designing Successful SAA Catalysts**: The design involves controlling the metal dispersion, surface area, and the arrangement of atoms to maximize the number of active sites while maintaining the desired selectivity. The literature highlights the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkanethiols to enhance selectivity by controlling sulfur coverage and arrangement on the surface.

5. **Effect of SAM Tail Length**: The literature notes that the length of the alkyl tail in the SAM affects both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Longer, more-ordered tails tend to have higher activity, but the selectivity remains largely independent of the tail group identity, suggesting a role of the sulfur atom arrangement in the observed selectivity.

6. **Controlling Selectivity and Activity**: The literature proposes that the selectivity enhancement by SAMs might involve site blocking to control ensemble sizes, affecting the number of active sites available for reactions. Additionally, varying the concentration of CO in the feed was used to probe the impact of ensemble sizes and adsorbate mobility on selectivity.

7. **Tail Group Impact**: The impact of the alkyl tail without surface sulfur was evaluated by exposing the palladium catalyst to alkenes, producing a metal surface containing alkylidyne species. This experiment helped understand the role of the alkyl tail in the selectivity enhancement process.

In summary, the literature outlines the importance of carefully controlling the metal properties, reaction conditions, and surface chemistry in designing single-atom alloy catalysts that can selectively hydrogenate unsaturated epoxides, demonstrating significant improvements in catalytic performance compared to traditional catalysts.

文献讨论了单原子合金（SAA），特别是钯原子嵌入铜表面，如何在选择性氢化反应中增强催化性能。设计成功SAA催化剂的关键标准包括：

1. **反应条件**：催化剂优化用于特定的反应温度和压力，确保高效的转化率和选择性。

2. **金属属性**：选择金属，如钯，是关键，因为它具有高反应性和选择性，在氢化反应中的独特催化特性。

3. **相对于传统催化剂的优势**：SAAs提供了一系列优势，包括打破缩放规则，提高选择性，并且通常比传统催化剂显示出更高的稳定性和活性。它们可以选择性地氢化不饱和环氧基到饱和环氧基，这是传统催化剂难以完成的任务。

4. **设计成功的SAA催化剂**：设计涉及控制金属分散、表面积以及原子排列，以最大化活性位点的数量，同时保持所需的高选择性。文献强调使用n-烷硫醇自组装层（SAM）来通过控制表面硫覆盖和排列来增强选择性。

5. **SAM尾长的影响**：文献指出，SAM中烷基链的长度影响催化剂的活性和选择性。更长、更有序的尾巴往往有更高的活性，但选择性在尾部组分的身份上基本独立，这表明硫原子排列在观察到的选择性中起着关键作用。

6. **控制选择性和活性**：文献提出，SAM的选择性增强可能涉及通过控制集合大小来实现位点阻塞，从而影响可用于反应的活性位点数量。此外，通过改变CO在流体中的浓度，利用吸附剂的大小和流动性来探索单一原子合金催化剂的选择性。

7. **尾部组分的影响**：通过将钯催化剂暴露于烯烃，产生包含烷基炔类（C(CH2)nCH3）物种的金属表面，对无表面硫的烷基尾部进行了评估。这一实验有助于理解烷基尾部在选择性增强过程中的作用。

综上所述，文献概述了精心控制金属属性、反应条件和表面化学对于设计能够选择性氢化不饱和环氧基的单原子合金催化剂的重要性，这些催化剂与传统催化剂相比表现出显著的催化性能改进。
