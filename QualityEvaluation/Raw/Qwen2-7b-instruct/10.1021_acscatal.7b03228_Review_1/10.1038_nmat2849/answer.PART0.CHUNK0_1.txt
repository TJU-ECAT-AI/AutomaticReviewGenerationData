1. Palladium, unlike silver (Ag), causes irreversible ring opening of the epoxide ring.
2. The reaction of 1-epoxybutane (EpB) with hydrogen on supported palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) catalysts results in the formation of epoxybutane, which is a valuable chemical used in the production of polyethers, surfactants, glycols, polyesters, epoxy resins, and fuel additives.
3. The octadecanethiol (C18)-coated catalyst demonstrated an epoxybutane formation rate that was approximately 40% of the rate for the uncoated catalyst.
4. There are differing mechanisms for how the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) impact selectivity and activity, as evidenced by the contrast in selectivity and activity for all alkanethiol coatings despite uniform high selectivity.
5. Catalysts that are sulfurized through exposure to dilute hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or sulfur-containing molecules that easily decompose, such as thiophene, are not equivalent to those with alkanethiol SAM coatings in terms of enhanced selectivity.

1. 银（Ag）与其他金属不同，它会导致环氧环的不可逆开环。
2. 在支持的钯（Pd）和铂（Pt）催化剂上，通过氢气反应1-环氧丁烷（EpB）会形成环氧丁烷，这是一种在生产聚醚、表面活性剂、甘油、聚酯、环氧树脂和燃料添加剂中使用的宝贵化学物质。
3. 八十八碳硫醇（C18）涂层催化剂的环氧丁烷形成速率约为未涂层催化剂速率的40%。
4. 尽管所有烷基硫醇涂层均表现出均匀的高选择性，但选择性和活性之间的对比表明SAMs对选择性和活性作用的不同机制。
5. 通过暴露于稀释的氢硫酸（H2S）或容易分解的含硫分子（如噻吩）进行硫化得到的催化剂与具有烷基硫醇SAM涂层的催化剂在增强选择性方面并不等同。
