[1] "We demonstrate that thiolate SAMs can be applied as promoters on the supported palladium catalysts in the liquid-phase HOL oxidation."
[2] "The poisoning species formed from HAL can be attributed to formation of dimers or oligomers and to decarbonylation to CO and carbonaceous residue."
[3] "On the AT-coated surface, decarbonylation was the major side reaction of HAL, forming smaller carbonaceous fragments that blocked fewer active sites and were more easily removed from the surface."
[4] "The C18-coated surface hindered decarbonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison attributed to a surfaces dimer, and exhibited the highest activity."

1. Thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can act as promoters on supported palladium catalysts during the liquid-phase oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL). The presence of these SAMs limits the formation of surface residues derived from the reaction product 2-hexenal (HAL), which poison the catalyst. 
2. The surface residues formed from HAL are thought to arise from the formation of dimers or oligomers and decarbonylation to carbon compounds. 
3. On the AT-coated surface, the major side reaction of HAL is decarbonylation, producing smaller carbonaceous fragments that block fewer active sites and are more easily removed from the surface. 
4. The C18-coated surface impedes decarbonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison attributed to a surface dimer, thereby exhibiting the highest activity.

1. 硫醇自组装单层（SAM）可以在支持的钯催化剂上用作促进剂，在液体相HOL氧化中。这些SAM有助于限制反应产物2-己烯醛（HAL）产生的表面残留物，这些残留物会毒害催化剂。
2. HAL表面残留物的形成可归因于二聚体或寡聚体的形成和脱羰化产生碳化合物。
3. 在AT涂层表面上，HAL的主要副反应是脱羰化，产生较小的碳残渣，这些残渣阻塞较少的活性位点，并且更容易从表面上除去。
4. C18涂层表面阻碍脱羰化并阻止产生HAL衍生的表面毒害物，归因于表面二聚体，从而表现出最高活性。
