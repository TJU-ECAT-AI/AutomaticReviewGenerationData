[1] "Here, we demonstrate that thiolate SAMs can be applied as pro- moters on the supported palladium catalysts in the liquid-phase HOL oxidation. The reaction product HAL formed surface residues on native Pd/Al2O3 that poison the catalyst."
[2] "By thiolate modifica- tion, HAL poisoning was limited, hypothetically due to isolation of active sites."
[3] "On the AT-coated surface, decarbonylation was the major side reaction of HAL, forming smaller carbonaceous frag- ments that blocked fewer active sites and were more easily removed from the surface."
[4] "The C18-coated surface hindered decar- bonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison attributed to a surfaces dimer, and exhibited the highest activity."

This study demonstrates that thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can serve as promoters in the selective oxidation of alcohols, specifically trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL), over supported palladium catalysts. The reaction product, trans-2-hexenal (HAL), forms surface residues that poison the catalyst. Thiolate modification limits this poisoning, presumably by isolating active sites. On the AT-coated surface, HAL's main side reaction is decarbonylation, creating smaller carbonaceous fragments that block fewer active sites and are more easily removed. The C18-coated surface, on the other hand, hinders decarbonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison, attributed to a surface dimer, resulting in the highest activity.

本研究证明，硫醇自组装单分子层（SAM）可以在支持的钯催化剂上用作促进剂，在液体相的HOL氧化中。反应产物，trans-2-己烯醛（HAL），在原始Pd/Al2O3表面形成表面残留物，毒害催化剂。硫醇修饰限制了这种中毒，理论上是通过隔离活性位点实现的。在AT涂层表面上，HAL的主要副反应是脱羰基化，产生较小的碳化物碎片，这些碎片阻塞更少的活性位点，并且更容易从表面上移除。相比之下，C18涂层表面阻碍了脱羰基化和由表面二聚体产生的HAL衍生表面毒物的生产，表现出最高活性。
