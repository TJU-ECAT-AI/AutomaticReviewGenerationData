1. Thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are used as promoters in the liquid-phase oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL) under low air pressure. The oxidation rate is significantly improved, especially at high conversion, compared to the common decrease in activity observed in hydrogenation reactions due to SAM modification.

2. In the process, trans-2-hexenal (HAL) forms surface residues on palladium that poison the catalyst, supposedly through decarbonylation and dimerization reactions.

3. The SAM modifiers can suppress this poisoning, in a controllable manner by adjusting the thiolate surface coverage using either 1-adamantanethiol (AT) or 1-octadecanethiol (C18).

4. Thiolate SAMs have been shown to control the reactivity of noble metal catalysts in several hydrogenation reactions.

5. The thiolate modifiers limit deactivation by blocking active sites and preventing side reactions that lead to the formation of strongly bound species, similar to how metallic promoters like bismuth operate.

1. 在低空气压力下，通过使用硫醇自组装单层（SAM）作为促进剂，液体相中trans-2-己烯-1-醇（HOL）的氧化速率得到了显著提高，尤其是在高转化率时。与氢化反应中常见到的由于SAM修饰导致的活性下降形成对比。

2. 在此过程中，trans-2-己烯醛（HAL）在钯表面生成残留物，这些残留物毒害催化剂，理论上是通过脱羰基化和二聚化反应。

3. 这种中毒可以通过调整使用1-亚环烷基硫醇（AT）或1-十八烷基硫醇（C18）的SAM覆盖度来抑制，这种抑制是可控的。

4. 硫醇自组装单层已经在几种氢化反应中显示出控制贵金属催化剂的活性。

5. 硫醇修饰剂通过阻止活性位点并防止形成强烈结合物种的副反应来限制失活，类似于如何金属促进剂如铋运作的方式。
