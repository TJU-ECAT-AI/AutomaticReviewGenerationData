[1] "The application of thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as activity promoters in the liquid-phase oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL) under low air pressure; the oxidation rate was significantly improved, particularly at high conversion, in contrast to the frequently observed activity decrease induced by SAM modification in hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "Infrared spectroscopy revealed that HAL produced surface residues on Pd that poisoned the catalyst, hypothetically through decarbonylation and dimerization."
[3] "This poisoning can be suppressed by the SAM modifiers, in a manner that was control- lable by varying thiolate surface coverage through use of either 1-adamantanethiol (AT) or 1-octadecanethiol (C18) SAMs."
[4] "Recent work has indicated that thiolate SAMs can be used as catalyst modifiers to control the reac- tivity of noble metal catalysts in a number of hydrogenation reactions [1518]."
[5] "The thiolate modifiers are proposed to limit deactivation in a similar manner to metallic promoters such as Bi, i.e., by blocking active sites to prevent side reactions that form strongly bound species."

1. Thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are used as promoters in the liquid-phase oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL) under low air pressure. The oxidation rate is significantly improved, especially at high conversion, compared to the common decrease in activity observed in hydrogenation reactions due to SAM modification.

2. In the process, trans-2-hexenal (HAL) forms surface residues on palladium that poison the catalyst, supposedly through decarbonylation and dimerization reactions.

3. The SAM modifiers can suppress this poisoning, in a controllable manner by adjusting the thiolate surface coverage using either 1-adamantanethiol (AT) or 1-octadecanethiol (C18).

4. Thiolate SAMs have been shown to control the reactivity of noble metal catalysts in several hydrogenation reactions.

5. The thiolate modifiers limit deactivation by blocking active sites and preventing side reactions that lead to the formation of strongly bound species, similar to how metallic promoters like bismuth operate.

This study demonstrates that thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can serve as promoters in the selective oxidation of alcohols, specifically trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL), over supported palladium catalysts. The reaction product, trans-2-hexenal (HAL), forms surface residues that poison the catalyst. Thiolate modification limits this poisoning, presumably by isolating active sites. On the AT-coated surface, HAL's main side reaction is decarbonylation, creating smaller carbonaceous fragments that block fewer active sites and are more easily removed. The C18-coated surface, on the other hand, hinders decarbonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison, attributed to a surface dimer, resulting in the highest activity.

本研究证明，硫醇自组装单分子层（SAM）可以在支持的钯催化剂上用作促进剂，在液体相的HOL氧化中。反应产物，trans-2-己烯醛（HAL），在原始Pd/Al2O3表面形成表面残留物，毒害催化剂。硫醇修饰限制了这种中毒，理论上是通过隔离活性位点实现的。在AT涂层表面上，HAL的主要副反应是脱羰基化，产生较小的碳化物碎片，这些碎片阻塞更少的活性位点，并且更容易从表面上移除。相比之下，C18涂层表面阻碍了脱羰基化和由表面二聚体产生的HAL衍生表面毒物的生产，表现出最高活性。

1. Thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can act as promoters on supported palladium catalysts during the liquid-phase oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL). The presence of these SAMs limits the formation of surface residues derived from the reaction product 2-hexenal (HAL), which poison the catalyst. 
2. The surface residues formed from HAL are thought to arise from the formation of dimers or oligomers and decarbonylation to carbon compounds. 
3. On the AT-coated surface, the major side reaction of HAL is decarbonylation, producing smaller carbonaceous fragments that block fewer active sites and are more easily removed from the surface.

The oxidation of HOL (Scheme 1) was performed in a semi- batch liquid phase reactor at 50 C under a constant air pressure of 40 psi. The maximum rates obtained over each catalyst are reported in Table 1. A high selectivity to HAL of approximately 90% (Table 1) was obtained on the uncoated catalyst, consistent with previous reports for similar reactions [3]. Modification of the catalyst by AT did not appreciably affect selectivity, whereas the C18 modifier lowered the selectivity to 80%.

Fig. 1 summarizes the conversion profile over the uncoated and modified Pd/Al2O3 catalysts over the course of a 2-h reaction. The kinetic features were strongly influenced by thiolate modification of the surface. On the uncoated surface, a high initial rate was observed, followed by a rapid deactivation. In fact, almost half of the HOL consumed during the 2-h reaction reacted within the first 5 min. While the AT-coated catalyst exhibited a lower initial rate, presumably due to site blocking by the thiolate ligand, deactivation was not as pronounced, resulting in a higher total conversion after 2 h. Similarly, the C18-coated catalyst also effectively suppressed the deactivation and increased the reaction rate over the native catalyst. 

Previous studies suggested that the deactivation of the Pd catalyst may be due to strongly adsorbed species generated by unsaturated aldehydes.

The research demonstrates that thiolate SAMs can promote the selective alcohol oxidation of trans-2-hexen-1-ol (HOL) on supported palladium catalysts. The oxidation product, trans-2-hexenal (HAL), forms surface residues on the native Pd/Al2O3 catalyst that poison the catalyst. Thiolate modification limits HAL poisoning, presumably by isolating active sites. On the AT-coated surface, decarbonylation is the major side reaction of HAL, forming smaller carbonaceous fragments that block fewer active sites and are more easily removed from the surface. The C18-coated surface hinders decarbonylation and the production of a HAL-derived surface poison attributed to a surface dimer, exhibiting the highest activity. Therefore, the thiolate modifier improves catalytic activity and helps prevent deactivation by suppressing side reactions of HAL and thus the formation of poisoning species. Compared to conventional metallic promoters, the thiolate modifiers offer a more straightforward platform for controlling the near-surface environment, making them an attractive potential modifier for Pt-group catalysts in low-temperature aerobic alcohol oxidation.

研究表明，硫醇自组装单层可以在支持的钯催化剂上促进选择性醇氧化。氧化产物反式-2-己烯醛（HAL）在原始Pd/Al2O3催化剂上形成表面残留物，从而毒害催化剂。硫醇修饰限制了HAL中毒，可能通过隔离活性位点实现。在AT涂层表面上，HAL的主要副反应是脱羰基化，形成更小的碳氢化合物碎片，这些碎片阻塞较少的活性位点，并且更容易从表面移除。C18涂层表面阻碍了脱羰基化和由不同前体产生的HAL衍生表面毒剂的产生，表现为最高的活性。因此，硫醇修饰可以提高催化活性并帮助防止由于抑制HAL侧反应以及由此形成的中毒物种而造成的失活。与传统的金属催化剂相比，硫醇修饰提供了一个更直接的平台来控制表面附近环境，使其成为低温度下氧气气氛中醇氧化Pt族催化剂的有效修饰剂。

[1] "Previous studies suggested that the deactivation of the Pd catalyst may be due to strongly adsorbed species generated by unsaturated aldehydes."
[2] "We therefore hypothesized that the generation of HAL-derived adsorbates was responsible for the deactivation of the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, which could be hindered by thiol modification, more effectively by denser SAMs."
[3] "With HAL in the feed, significantly lower activities were observed for all catalysts, but the rate on the uncoated catalyst decreased most dramatically."
[4] "In the presence of either AT or C18 SAMs, however, the peaks at 1593 and 1566 cm1 were not observed, suggesting that the sur- face coatings suppressed the adsorption of adjacent HAL molecules and/or large dimer species during dimerization."
[5] "While decarbonylation was hindered at low temperature on both uncoated and C18-coated surfaces, it could be activated at higher temperatures, as indicated by the detection of CO in temperature-programmed desorption experiments."
[6] "On the contrary, elemental and spectroscopic analysis suggested that the thiolate modifier remained stable, showing no significant desorption nor disordering after exposure to reaction conditions."

The deactivation of the palladium catalyst in the alcohol oxidation process was attributed to the strong adsorption of unsaturated aldehyde derivatives. The hypothesis was that the HAL-derived adsorbates caused the deactivation, and this could be mitigated by thiolate modification, especially with denser self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The presence of HAL in the feed led to a dramatic decrease in activity on the uncoated catalyst, but the activity on the thiolate-modified catalysts was maintained. The thiolate SAMs suppressed the adsorption of HAL molecules and the formation of large dimer species, which prevented decarbonylation reactions. At higher temperatures, decarbonylation could still occur, producing CO. Despite being exposed to reaction conditions, the thiolate modifier remained stable, showing no significant desorption or disordering.

酒精氧化过程中钯催化剂的失活归因于不饱和醛衍生物的强烈吸附。假设是HAL衍生的吸附剂导致了催化剂失活，并且可以通过硫醇改性，尤其是更密集的自组装层来缓解这种情况。在HAL存在的条件下，未涂层催化剂的活性显著下降，但硫醇修饰的催化剂活性得以保持。硫醇自组装层抑制了HAL分子的吸附和大二聚体物种的形成，从而阻止了脱羰基化反应。在较高温度下，脱羰基化仍然可能发生，产生CO。尽管暴露于反应条件，硫醇修饰层保持稳定，没有明显的脱附或混乱。
