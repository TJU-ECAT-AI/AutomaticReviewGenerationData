[1] "Previous studies suggested that the deactivation of the Pd catalyst may be due to strongly adsorbed species generated by unsaturated aldehydes."
[2] "We therefore hypothesized that the generation of HAL-derived adsorbates was responsible for the deactivation of the Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, which could be hindered by thiol modification, more effectively by denser SAMs."
[3] "With HAL in the feed, significantly lower activities were observed for all catalysts, but the rate on the uncoated catalyst decreased most dramatically."
[4] "In the presence of either AT or C18 SAMs, however, the peaks at 1593 and 1566 cm1 were not observed, suggesting that the sur- face coatings suppressed the adsorption of adjacent HAL molecules and/or large dimer species during dimerization."
[5] "While decarbonylation was hindered at low temperature on both uncoated and C18-coated surfaces, it could be activated at higher temperatures, as indicated by the detection of CO in temperature-programmed desorption experiments."
[6] "On the contrary, elemental and spectroscopic analysis suggested that the thiolate modifier remained stable, showing no significant desorption nor disordering after exposure to reaction conditions."

The deactivation of the palladium catalyst in the alcohol oxidation process was attributed to the strong adsorption of unsaturated aldehyde derivatives. The hypothesis was that the HAL-derived adsorbates caused the deactivation, and this could be mitigated by thiolate modification, especially with denser self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The presence of HAL in the feed led to a dramatic decrease in activity on the uncoated catalyst, but the activity on the thiolate-modified catalysts was maintained. The thiolate SAMs suppressed the adsorption of HAL molecules and the formation of large dimer species, which prevented decarbonylation reactions. At higher temperatures, decarbonylation could still occur, producing CO. Despite being exposed to reaction conditions, the thiolate modifier remained stable, showing no significant desorption or disordering.

酒精氧化过程中钯催化剂的失活归因于不饱和醛衍生物的强烈吸附。假设是HAL衍生的吸附剂导致了催化剂失活，并且可以通过硫醇改性，尤其是更密集的自组装层来缓解这种情况。在HAL存在的条件下，未涂层催化剂的活性显著下降，但硫醇修饰的催化剂活性得以保持。硫醇自组装层抑制了HAL分子的吸附和大二聚体物种的形成，从而阻止了脱羰基化反应。在较高温度下，脱羰基化仍然可能发生，产生CO。尽管暴露于反应条件，硫醇修饰层保持稳定，没有明显的脱附或混乱。
