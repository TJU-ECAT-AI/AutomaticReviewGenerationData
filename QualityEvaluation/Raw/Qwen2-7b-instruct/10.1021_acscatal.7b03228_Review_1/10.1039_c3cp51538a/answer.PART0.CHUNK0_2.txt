Boucher,a Branko Zugic,a George Cladaras,a James Kammert,a Matthew D. Marcinkowski,b Timothy J. Lawton,b E. Charles H. Sykes*b and Maria Flytzani-Stephanopoulos*a We report a novel synthesis of nanoparticle PdCu catalysts, containing only trace amounts of Pd, for selective hydrogenation reactions. PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation,and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. PdCu nanoparticles were prepared by addition of trace amounts of Pd (0.18 atomic (at)%) to Cu nanoparticles supported on Al2O3 by galvanic replacement (GR). The catalytic performance of the resulting materials for the partial hydrogenation of phenyl- acetylene was investigated at ambient temperature in a batch reactor under a head pressure of hydro- gen (6.9 bar). The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion. Greater than 94% selectivity to styrene is observed at all times, which is a marked improvement when compared to monometallic Pd catalysts with the same Pd loading, at the same total conversion. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy measurements confirm the complete uptake and alloying of Pd with Cu by GR. Scanning tun- neling microscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy of model SAA surfaces confirmed the feasibility of hydrogen spillover onto an otherwise inert Cu surface. These model studies addressed a wide range of Pd concentrations related to the bimetallic nanoparticles.

The document highlights the utilization of single-atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, specifically Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, to enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions. This enhancement is achieved through the unique ability of Pd atoms to act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface. This mechanism allows for improved selectivity and activity compared to traditional catalysts. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include the selection of appropriate reaction conditions, properties of the metals involved, and the ability to disperse the active metal on the surface. The document also mentions the cooperative use of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis techniques to bridge the gap between these fields. The cooperative use of SAA surfaces, such as Pd embedded in Cu, enables the activation of otherwise inactive Cu nanoparticles for selective hydrogenations, breaking scaling rules and improving selectivity across various catalyst systems.

文献报道了一种新型纳米颗粒钯铜催化剂的合成，仅含微量钯，适用于选择性氢化反应。钯铜纳米颗粒基于模型单原子合金（SAA）表面设计，其中孤立的钯原子作为氢吸附、离解和向周围铜表面溢出的站点。通过电镀替代（GR）将微量钯（0.18原子%）添加到铝氧化物支持的铜纳米颗粒中，制备了钯铜纳米颗粒。在室温下，使用批式反应器对这些材料进行苯乙烯部分氢化研究，在6.9巴氢气头压下。双金属钯铜纳米颗粒在苯乙烯氢化时的活性比其单一金属铜对应物高出一个数量级，同时在高转化率下保持高苯乙烯选择性长达数小时。观察到所有时间内的苯乙烯选择性超过94%，这与具有相同钯负载量的单一金属钯催化剂相比是一个显著改进。X射线光电子能谱和紫外可见光谱测量证实了钯与铜通过GR完全吸收和合金化。扫描隧道显微镜和热脱附光谱证实了氢溢出到原本惰性的铜表面的可能性。这些模型研究涉及与双金属纳米颗粒相关的广泛钯浓度。
