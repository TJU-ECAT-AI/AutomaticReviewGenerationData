[1] "PdCu nanoparticles were designed based on model single atom alloy (SAA) surfaces, in which individual, isolated Pd atoms act as sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the surrounding Cu surface."
[2] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."
[3] "Scanning tunnelling microscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy of model SAA surfaces confirmed the feasibility of hydrogen spillover onto an otherwise inert Cu surface."
[4] "In the present work a range of Pd coverages (0.01 ML) alloyed into/on the surface layer of Cu(111) were studied. It was determined that in the single atom alloy regime (o0.1 ML Pd) a single desorption peak is seen that shifts to progressively lower temperature as the Pd coverage increases, due to surface strain."
[5] "Fig. 2 shows a plot of hydrogen uptake as a function of Pd coverage calculated from the H2-TPD data presented in Fig. 1. The main plot in Fig. 2 shows that H saturation is not reached until >2 ML of Pd is deposited on Cu(111)."
[6] "Based on a combination of surface science studies and heterogeneous catalyst performance measured at near ambient conditions, we propose that the high selectivity of Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 is due to hydrogen spillover on the Cu surface."
[7] "The cooperative use of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis techniques in this study has broader impacts for bridging the gap between these fields."

To address selective hydrogenation reactions, single-atom alloys (SAA), particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance through hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the Cu surface. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts involve understanding the conditions for hydrogen spillover, optimizing the Pd concentration to balance between hydrogen activation and selectivity, and ensuring that the Cu surface remains active for hydrogenation reactions. The key advantage over traditional catalysts lies in their ability to break scaling rules by improving selectivity and efficiency, even with trace amounts of Pd, which contrasts with typical practices of adding Cu as a promoter. The synergistic use of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis techniques enables a deeper understanding of structure-function relationships and the cooperative behavior of metals in catalytic systems.

为了处理选择性氢化反应，单原子合金（SAA），特别是嵌入在Cu表面的Pd原子，通过氢的吸附、离解和向Cu表面的溢流提高了催化性能。设计成功SAA催化剂的关键指标包括理解氢溢流的条件、优化Pd浓度以平衡激活氢和选择性之间的关系，并确保Cu表面在氢化反应中保持活性。与传统催化剂相比，它们能够打破规模法则，通过提高选择性和效率改进性能，即使是在微量Pd的情况下，这与通常将Cu作为促进剂添加的做法形成对比。表面科学和异质催化技术的协同使用使我们更深入地理解结构-功能关系以及金属在催化系统中的协同行为。
