[1] "The bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles have over an order of magnitude higher activity for phenylacetylene hydrogenation when compared to their monometallic Cu counterpart, while maintaining a high selectivity to styrene over many hours at high conversion."
[2] "The objective is to prepare a catalyst with an optimum loading of the active metal for hydrogen activation while maximizing the total Cu surface area on which selective hydrogenation reactions can take place."
[3] "Based on UV-vis measurments presented in Fig. 5A, which confirm the complete uptake of Pd, the atomic ratio of Cu : Pd in each nanoparticle (based on total metal loading) is 83 : 1."
[4] "Hence, a very high selectivity of the Pd0.18Cu15/Al2O3 catalyst, containing only trace amounts of Pd, is demonstrated."
[5] "While XPS spectroscopy is a surface technique, the signal can be representative of several atomic layers beneath the surface."

The single-atom alloy, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhances catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by providing sites for hydrogen uptake, dissociation, and spillover onto the Cu surface. This leads to improved selectivity and activity, especially when compared to traditional catalysts. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include optimizing the loading of active metal, ensuring that the catalyst maximizes the Cu surface area available for reactions, and maintaining a low loading of the precious metal to improve selectivity. The ability of Cu to serve as a catalyst for selective hydrogenations with the addition of trace amounts of a precious metal with a low barrier for hydrogen dissociation is a key advantage. This cooperative use of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis techniques bridges the gap between these fields and improves catalyst efficiency.

单原子合金，尤其是钯原子嵌入铜表面，通过提供氢吸附、离解和向铜表面溢出的位点，在选择性氢化反应中增强了催化剂性能。这导致了改进的选择性和活性，尤其是在与传统催化剂相比时。设计成功SAA催化剂的关键标准包括优化活性金属的负载量，确保催化剂最大化铜表面区域以供反应，同时保持少量贵重金属的负载量来提高选择性。铜作为添加少量具有氢解离低壁垒的贵金属作为催化剂的能力是一个关键优势。这种表面科学和异质催化技术的协同使用在这些领域之间建立了桥梁，并提高了催化剂的效率。
