[1] "The DFT results indicate that, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is no longer thermodynamically stable. The stable surface structure is the one with 3d metals on the topmost surface, 3dPtPt, leading to a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."
[2] "The DFT results suggest that desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts should have weaker metalO binding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure in the presence of oxygen."
[3] "The segregation of subsurface Co and Ni to the surfaces of the Pt3dPt structure has been confirmed experimentally using AES and HREELS. The apparent activation energy for the segregation is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni."

1. 在吸附氧的存在下，Pt3dPt亚表面结构不再具有热力学稳定性。稳定的表面结构是顶部表面的3d金属，3dPtPt，导致亚表面3d原子分离的热力学驱动力。

2. 合适的PtMPt双金属ORR催化剂应具有较弱的金属O结合能，同时在氧存在下保持PtMPt亚表面结构。

3. 已经通过AES和HREELS实验证明了亚表面Co和Ni向Pt3dPt结构表面的分离。Co和Ni的分离显热能分别为7±1 kcal/mol和15±2 kcal/mol。
