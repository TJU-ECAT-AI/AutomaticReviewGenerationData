The stability of the Pt3dPt bimetallic surface structures in the presence of adsorbed oxygen has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT). It was found that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are no longer thermodynamically stable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. Desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts should have weaker metalO binding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure in the presence of oxygen. The segregation of subsurface Co and Ni to the surfaces of the Pt3dPt structure has been confirmed experimentally using AES and HREELS.

在吸附氧的存在下，对Pt3dPt双金属表面结构的稳定性进行了密度泛函理论（DFT）的研究。结果表明，在吸附氧存在下，Pt3dPt亚表面结构不再具有热力学稳定性。理想的PtMPt双金属ORR催化剂应具有较弱的金属O结合能，同时在氧存在下保持PtMPt亚表面结构。已通过AES和HREELS实验证明了亚表面Co和Ni向Pt3dPt结构表面的分离。
