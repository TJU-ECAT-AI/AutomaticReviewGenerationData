Answer: 
1. In the reactivity studies, it was determined that the unique surface activity on the bimetallic systems was observed only when annealed to 600 K. This indicates that annealing to 600 K is crucial for achieving the desired surface activity.
2. Stamenkovi and co-workers reported that Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, and this was further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, attributing the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level.
3. The surface d-band of all Pt3dPt systems was broadened and lowered in energy compared to Pt, resulting in weaker oxygen adsorption energies. This finding implies that modifying Pt electrodes with a layer of subsurface 3d metal can significantly improve ORR activity, but the stability of these bimetallic systems remains unclear.
4. Deposition of a monolayer coverage of Ni and Co on Pt(111) at 300 K produced reactivity similar to those on Ni and Co surfaces. However, heating the surfaces to 600 K produced surface activity unlike those on Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces. This difference was attributed to diffusion of monolayer Ni or Co into the subsurface region of Pt(111) at 600 K, producing the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures.

1. 在反应性研究中，确定只有在退火到600 K时才能观察到双金属系统的独特表面活性。这表明将温度退火至600 K对于实现所需表面活性至关重要。
2. Stamenkovi及其同事报道，Pt3Co和Pt3Ni电极在ORR中的性能优于纯Pt，并且由Mavrikakis小组进行的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算进一步支持这一发现，归因于Pt皮肤系统中表面d带中心远离费米能级的偏移对减轻氧中毒的贡献，从而提高了ORR活性。
3. 所有Pt3dPt系统的表面d带相比于Pt而言被扩展并降低了能量，导致了较弱的氧吸附能。这表明通过用下层3d金属层修饰Pt电极可以显著提高ORR活性，但这些双金属合金体系的稳定性仍然存在疑问。
4. 在300 K下沉积一层Ni和Co覆盖在Pt(111)上产生了与Ni和Co表面相似的活性。然而，将表面加热至600 K则产生了与Ni、Co或Pt(111)表面不同的表面活性。这种差异归因于在600 K时Ni或Co单层向Pt(111)的下层区域扩散，形成PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构。
