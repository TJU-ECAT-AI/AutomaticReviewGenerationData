(1) "Our research group has previously examined the surface reactivity of Ni/Pt(111) 26 and Co/Pt(111) 27 surfaces, using a combination of surface science techniques and DFT modeling.13-15 In the reactivity studies, it was determined that the unique surface activity on the bimetallic systems was observed only when annealed to 600 K.26,27"
(2) "In the current study, however, our results indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are not thermodynamically stable in the presence of adsorbed atomic oxygen."
(3) "For example, Stamenkovi and co-workers reported that, while Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, alternative Pt-skin electrodes produced by sputtering and annealing possessed the maximum catalytic enhancement.5-8 These experimental results were further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, where the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system was partially attributed to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level. 11,12"
(4) "The DFT results suggest that desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts should have weaker metalO binding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure in the presence of oxygen. The latter can be achieved by identifying PtMPt systems with either higher thermodynamic stability or higher apparent activation barrier for the segregation of the subsurface metal atoms."
(5) "The segregation of subsurface Co and Ni to the surfaces of the Pt3dPt structure has been confirmed experimentally using AES and HREELS. The apparent activation energy for the segregation is 7  1 kcal/mol for Co and 15  2 kcal/mol for Ni. AES results also suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment."

1. Previous studies have shown that the unique surface activity on Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) systems was only observed when annealed to 600 K.
2. Our findings indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are not thermodynamically stable when exposed to adsorbed atomic oxygen.
3. Stamenkovi and colleagues reported that Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed better performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. DFT calculations supported these findings by attributing the enhanced activity to the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, thus alleviating oxygen poisoning.
4. The research suggests that desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts should have weaker metal-oxygen bonding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure in the presence of oxygen. This can be achieved by identifying systems with higher thermodynamic stability or a higher activation barrier for the segregation of the subsurface metal atoms.
5. The AES and HREELS experiments confirmed the experimental segregation of subsurface Co and Ni to the surfaces of Pt3dPt structures. The activation energy for this segregation is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni. The AES results also indicate that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are concurrent in Co/Pt surfaces, potentially preserving some PtCoPt subsurface structures that exhibit enhanced ORR activity compared to pure Pt in oxygen-containing environments.

1. 我们之前的研究表明，Ni/Pt(111)和Co/Pt(111)系统的独特表面活性只在退火至600 K时出现。
2. 我们的发现显示，在吸附原子氧的情况下，Pt3dPt亚表面结构不再具有热力学稳定性。
3. Stamenkovi及其同事报告称，与纯Pt相比，Pt3Co和Pt3Ni电极在ORR中的性能更好。从DFT计算的角度来看，这一增强的活性部分归因于表面d带中心远离费米能级的移动，从而减轻了氧中毒的影响。
4. 研究建议，理想的PtMPt双金属ORR催化剂应具有较弱的金属氧结合能，同时在氧环境中保持PtMPt亚表面结构的稳定性。这可以通过识别具有更高热力学稳定性和更高的亚表面金属原子分离活化能壁垒的系统来实现。
5. AES和HREELS实验证实了在吸附氧存在下，亚表面Co和Ni向Pt3dPt结构表面的分离。Co的分离活化能为7±1 kcal/mol，Ni为15±2 kcal/mol。AES结果还表明，在Co/Pt表面中，Co的外分离和内扩散同时存在，这可能保留了一些PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在含氧环境下的ORR活性高于纯Pt。
