1. Previous studies have shown that the unique surface activity on Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) systems was only observed when annealed to 600 K.
2. Our findings indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are not thermodynamically stable when exposed to adsorbed atomic oxygen.
3. Stamenkovi and colleagues reported that Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed better performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pure Pt. DFT calculations supported these findings by attributing the enhanced activity to the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level, thus alleviating oxygen poisoning.
4. The research suggests that desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts should have weaker metal-oxygen bonding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure in the presence of oxygen. This can be achieved by identifying systems with higher thermodynamic stability or a higher activation barrier for the segregation of the subsurface metal atoms.
5. The AES and HREELS experiments confirmed the experimental segregation of subsurface Co and Ni to the surfaces of Pt3dPt structures. The activation energy for this segregation is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni. The AES results also indicate that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are concurrent in Co/Pt surfaces, potentially preserving some PtCoPt subsurface structures that exhibit enhanced ORR activity compared to pure Pt in oxygen-containing environments.

1. 我们之前的研究表明，Ni/Pt(111)和Co/Pt(111)系统的独特表面活性只在退火至600 K时出现。
2. 我们的发现显示，在吸附原子氧的情况下，Pt3dPt亚表面结构不再具有热力学稳定性。
3. Stamenkovi及其同事报告称，与纯Pt相比，Pt3Co和Pt3Ni电极在ORR中的性能更好。从DFT计算的角度来看，这一增强的活性部分归因于表面d带中心远离费米能级的移动，从而减轻了氧中毒的影响。
4. 研究建议，理想的PtMPt双金属ORR催化剂应具有较弱的金属氧结合能，同时在氧环境中保持PtMPt亚表面结构的稳定性。这可以通过识别具有更高热力学稳定性和更高的亚表面金属原子分离活化能壁垒的系统来实现。
5. AES和HREELS实验证实了在吸附氧存在下，亚表面Co和Ni向Pt3dPt结构表面的分离。Co的分离活化能为7±1 kcal/mol，Ni为15±2 kcal/mol。AES结果还表明，在Co/Pt表面中，Co的外分离和内扩散同时存在，这可能保留了一些PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在含氧环境下的ORR活性高于纯Pt。

Answer: 
1. In the reactivity studies, it was determined that the unique surface activity on the bimetallic systems was observed only when annealed to 600 K. This indicates that annealing to 600 K is crucial for achieving the desired surface activity.
2. Stamenkovi and co-workers reported that Pt3Co and Pt3Ni electrodes showed improvements over pure Pt for the ORR, and this was further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the Mavrikakis group, attributing the enhanced ORR activity on the Pt-skin system to the alleviation of oxygen poisoning by the shift of the surface d-band center away from the Fermi level.
3. The surface d-band of all Pt3dPt systems was broadened and lowered in energy compared to Pt, resulting in weaker oxygen adsorption energies. This finding implies that modifying Pt electrodes with a layer of subsurface 3d metal can significantly improve ORR activity, but the stability of these bimetallic systems remains unclear.
4. Deposition of a monolayer coverage of Ni and Co on Pt(111) at 300 K produced reactivity similar to those on Ni and Co surfaces. However, heating the surfaces to 600 K produced surface activity unlike those on Ni, Co, or Pt(111) surfaces. This difference was attributed to diffusion of monolayer Ni or Co into the subsurface region of Pt(111) at 600 K, producing the PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) surface structures.

1. 在反应性研究中，确定只有在退火到600 K时才能观察到双金属系统的独特表面活性。这表明将温度退火至600 K对于实现所需表面活性至关重要。
2. Stamenkovi及其同事报道，Pt3Co和Pt3Ni电极在ORR中的性能优于纯Pt，并且由Mavrikakis小组进行的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算进一步支持这一发现，归因于Pt皮肤系统中表面d带中心远离费米能级的偏移对减轻氧中毒的贡献，从而提高了ORR活性。
3. 所有Pt3dPt系统的表面d带相比于Pt而言被扩展并降低了能量，导致了较弱的氧吸附能。这表明通过用下层3d金属层修饰Pt电极可以显著提高ORR活性，但这些双金属合金体系的稳定性仍然存在疑问。
4. 在300 K下沉积一层Ni和Co覆盖在Pt(111)上产生了与Ni和Co表面相似的活性。然而，将表面加热至600 K则产生了与Ni、Co或Pt(111)表面不同的表面活性。这种差异归因于在600 K时Ni或Co单层向Pt(111)的下层区域扩散，形成PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)表面结构。

The stability of Pt3d alloy surfaces in the presence of oxygen is influenced by their thermodynamic stability. When oxygen is present, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure becomes thermodynamically unstable, leading to a driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface. This is due to the fact that the 3dPtPt surface structure is more stable in the presence of oxygen. To design desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts, they should have weaker metal-oxygen binding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure, which can be achieved by identifying systems with higher thermodynamic stability or a higher apparent activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface metal atoms. The segregation of subsurface Co and Ni atoms to the surface of the Pt3dPt structure has been confirmed experimentally. The apparent activation energy for this segregation is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni. AES results suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms coexist in Co/Pt surfaces, which maintains some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than pure Pt for ORR in an oxygen-containing cathode environment.

氧存在时，Pt3d合金表面的稳定性受到其热力学稳定性的影响。当氧气存在时，Pt3dPt亚表面结构的热力学稳定性不再稳定，导致亚表面3d原子向表面的分离动力学。这是由于在氧气存在的条件下，3dPtPt表面结构更稳定。为了设计理想的PtMPt双金属ORR催化剂，它们应具有较弱的金属-氧结合能，同时保持PtMPt亚表面结构，这可以通过识别具有更高热力学稳定性和更高的亚表面金属原子分离显性活化能的系统来实现。亚表面Co和Ni原子向Pt3dPt结构表面的分离已被实验证实。Co和Ni的显性激活能量分别为7±1 kcal/mol和15±2 kcal/mol。AES结果表明，在Co/Pt表面中，Co原子的外分离和内扩散同时存在，这维持了一些PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在含氧阴极环境中的ORR活性高于纯Pt。
