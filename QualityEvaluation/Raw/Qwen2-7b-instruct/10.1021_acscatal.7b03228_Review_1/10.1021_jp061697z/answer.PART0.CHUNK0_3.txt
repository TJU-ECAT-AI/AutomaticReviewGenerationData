[1] "The DFT results indicate that, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure is no longer thermodynamically stable. The stable surface structure is the one with 3d metals on the topmost surface, 3dPtPt, leading to a thermodynamic driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms."
[2] "The DFT results suggest that desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts should have weaker metalO binding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure in the presence of oxygen. The latter can be achieved by identifying PtMPt systems with either higher thermodynamic stability or higher apparent activation barrier for the segregation of the subsurface metal atoms."
[3] "The segregation of subsurface Co and Ni to the surfaces of the Pt3dPt structure has been confirmed experimentally using AES and HREELS. The apparent activation energy for the segregation is 7  1 kcal/mol for Co and 15  2 kcal/mol for Ni. AES results also suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment."

The stability of Pt3d alloy surfaces in the presence of oxygen is influenced by their thermodynamic stability. When oxygen is present, the Pt3dPt subsurface structure becomes thermodynamically unstable, leading to a driving force for the segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface. This is due to the fact that the 3dPtPt surface structure is more stable in the presence of oxygen. To design desirable PtMPt bimetallic ORR catalysts, they should have weaker metal-oxygen binding energy while maintaining the PtMPt subsurface structure, which can be achieved by identifying systems with higher thermodynamic stability or a higher apparent activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface metal atoms. The segregation of subsurface Co and Ni atoms to the surface of the Pt3dPt structure has been confirmed experimentally. The apparent activation energy for this segregation is 7 ± 1 kcal/mol for Co and 15 ± 2 kcal/mol for Ni. AES results suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms coexist in Co/Pt surfaces, which maintains some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than pure Pt for ORR in an oxygen-containing cathode environment.

氧存在时，Pt3d合金表面的稳定性受到其热力学稳定性的影响。当氧气存在时，Pt3dPt亚表面结构的热力学稳定性不再稳定，导致亚表面3d原子向表面的分离动力学。这是由于在氧气存在的条件下，3dPtPt表面结构更稳定。为了设计理想的PtMPt双金属ORR催化剂，它们应具有较弱的金属-氧结合能，同时保持PtMPt亚表面结构，这可以通过识别具有更高热力学稳定性和更高的亚表面金属原子分离显性活化能的系统来实现。亚表面Co和Ni原子向Pt3dPt结构表面的分离已被实验证实。Co和Ni的显性激活能量分别为7±1 kcal/mol和15±2 kcal/mol。AES结果表明，在Co/Pt表面中，Co原子的外分离和内扩散同时存在，这维持了一些PtCoPt亚表面结构，这些结构在含氧阴极环境中的ORR活性高于纯Pt。
