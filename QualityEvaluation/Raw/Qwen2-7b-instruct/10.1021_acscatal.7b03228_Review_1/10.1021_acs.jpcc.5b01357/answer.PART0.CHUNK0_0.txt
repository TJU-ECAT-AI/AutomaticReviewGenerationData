Answer: The development of single-atom alloys, especially Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, has led to improved catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions due to their unique electronic structure and precise atom distribution. When designing successful single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, it is crucial to optimize reaction conditions, choose suitable metal properties, and ensure that these catalysts offer specific advantages over traditional catalysts. This includes their capability to surpass conventional scaling rules and enhance selectivity in a wide range of catalyst systems.
