[1] "Gold is the most noble of all metals due to the lack of reactivity [1]."
[2] "Au films were then oxidized by exposure to O2-plasma for 1 min, and the thick-ness of the oxide was estimated to exceed 4 nm by XPS [9]."
[3] "An Au reference sample was used to define the origin of the binding energy for calibration."
[4] "As shown in Fig. 2, the O2-plasma as-treated Au film (D0- sample) has two extra peaks (AuO1 and AuO2,dashed lines) at energies of 85.5 and 89.4 eV, unlike the untreated Au film (NON-sample), in which the Au is bonded to O in an Au2O3 structure, as confirmed in the literature [5,6,9]."
[5] "However, the intensities of these two AuO peaks gradually decay when the D0-sample is held in air for 2 days (D2-sample) following O2-plasma treatment, and the AuO peaks completely disappear after about 4 days (D4-sample) at 22 C, as indicated in Table 1."
[6] "The activation energy Ea was calculated from the slope to be 57 kJ/mol (0.6 eV), which is of the same as the AuO bond dissociation energy [7]."
[7] "Au2O3 has a short half-life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol,indicating instability even at low temperatures."

The document discusses the instability of gold oxide, Au2O3, which forms when an Au film is treated with O2-plasma. The key findings are that Au2O3 can be formed through O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociates into gold elements. The time dependence of the dissociation process was analyzed, revealing an activation energy of 57 kJ/mol for the dissociation of Au2O3. The half-life of Au2O3 at 22°C is 22 hours, and at 0°C, it is 166 hours, indicating instability even at low temperatures.

文档讨论了在Au薄膜通过O2等离子体处理形成时，Au2O3的不稳定性。关键发现是，Au2O3可以通过O2等离子体处理形成，并自发地分解为金元素。分析了分解过程的时间依赖性，揭示了Au2O3分解的活化能为57 kJ/mol。在22°C下，Au2O3的半衰期为22小时，在0°C下，该值为166小时，这表明即使在低温下Au2O3也表现出不稳定性。
