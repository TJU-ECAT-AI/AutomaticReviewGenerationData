Gold is the most noble of all metals due to the lack of reactivity [1].
Recently, several reports have shown that oxidation easily occurs when a gold film is exposed in highly reactive chemical environments, such as during O2-plasma discharge or in UV/ozone, [4] typically altering the electrical characteristics of the material.
The kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were elucidated by monitoring the surface resistances that correspond to changes in the chemical bonding in films. Au2O3 has a short half-life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol, indicating instability even at low temperatures.
The intensities of these two AuO peaks gradually decay when the D0-sample is held in air for 2 days (D2-sample) following O2-plasma treatment, and the AuO peaks completely disappear after about 4 days (D4-sample) at 22 C, as indicated in Table 1.
For gold elements, moreover, the intensities of the AuAu1 and AuAu2 peaks in the D0-sample (the O2-plasma as-treated sample) declined considerably, compared with the untreated Au film (NON-sample), due to the oxidation of gold.
The results of electrical resistance also revealed that the electrical properties are not degraded after O2-plasma cleaning of the surface of gold due to the restoration of elemental gold.

The instability of gold oxide Au2O3 under certain reactive environments, such as O2-plasma discharge or UV/ozone, leads to the alteration of the material's electrical characteristics. The dissociation kinetics of Au2O3, characterized by changes in surface resistance, were found to have a short half-life of 22 hours at 22°C and 166 hours at 0°C, with an activation energy of 57 kJ/mol, indicating its inherent instability at low temperatures. This study also observed the gradual decay of AuO peaks in the sample held in air for 2 days, leading to the complete disappearance of these peaks after 4 days, confirming the spontaneous and complete dissociation of the oxide in air at 22°C. Moreover, the electrical properties of the gold surface remained unaffected after O2-plasma cleaning, suggesting the restoration of elemental gold upon oxide dissociation.

在某些活性化学环境中，如O2等离子放电或UV/ozone，金氧化物Au2O3的不稳定性会导致材料电气特性发生改变。Au2O3的解离动力学通过表面电阻的变化进行研究，发现其在22°C时半衰期为22小时，在0°C时为166小时，解离活化能为57 kJ/mol，这表明即使在低温下Au2O3也具有内在不稳定性。研究表明，样品在空气中放置2天后，AuO峰的强度逐渐衰减，并在4天后完全消失，证实了在22°C时Au2O3的自发和完全分解。此外，实验还观察到金表面的电气性质在经过O2等离子清洗后未受影响，暗示在氧化物分解后实现了元素金的恢复。
