The kinetics of the dissociation of gold oxide, Au2O3, were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and by taking electrical resistance measurements. The surface resistance of the gold film was markedly increased by O2-plasma treatment and then gradually returned to the initial value in air at room temperature (22 C).

Au2O3 can be formed by O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociated to gold elements.

The activation energy for the dissociation Ea was calculated from the slope to be 57 kJ/mol (0.6 eV), which is of the same as the AuO bond dissociation energy.

Au2O3 has a short half-life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol, indicating instability even at low temperatures.

The kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were studied using XPS and electrical resistance measurements. After O2-plasma treatment, the gold film's surface resistance increased significantly, then gradually returned to its initial value in room temperature air. Au2O3 forms upon O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociates into gold elements. The activation energy for this dissociation process is 57 kJ/mol (0.6 eV), and Au2O3 exhibits instability at both room and lower temperatures with a half-life of 22 hours at 22°C and 166 hours at 0°C.

The study examined the kinetics of the dissociation of gold oxide, Au2O3, created by O2-plasma treatment of an Au film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrical resistance measurements were utilized to assess the surface resistance of the Au film, which significantly increased after O2-plasma treatment and gradually returned to its initial value in air at room temperature. XPS results indicated that Au2O3 can form through O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociate into gold elements. The time dependence of the dissociation process was analyzed using a first-order rate equation at temperatures ranging from 22 to 100°C, with an activation energy calculated to be 57 kJ/mol. Electrical resistance measurements showed that the electrical properties of the gold surface remained unaffected after O2-plasma cleaning, likely due to the restoration of elemental gold.

The stability of Au2O3 was found to be unstable, with a short half-life of 22 hours at 22°C and 166 hours at 0°C. This indicates that Au2O3 is even unstable at low temperatures. The activation energy for the dissociation of Au2O3 was determined to be 57 kJ/mol, which matches the AuO bond dissociation energy. The electrical properties of the gold surface were not degraded after O2-plasma cleaning, as elemental gold was restored.

In summary, the study elucidated the kinetics of Au2O3 dissociation through monitoring surface resistance changes. The electrical properties of the Au surface remained unchanged after O2-plasma cleaning, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method in restoring the original properties of the gold surface. The instability of Au2O3 was confirmed, with a calculated activation energy for dissociation matching that of the AuO bond. The restoration of elemental gold after O2-plasma cleaning suggests that this technique can effectively remove Au2O3 without damaging the underlying gold surface.

该研究考察了通过O2等离子体处理Au薄膜后形成的Au2O3的分解动力学。利用X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和电阻测量评估了Au薄膜的表面电阻，该电阻在O2等离子体处理后显著增加，并在室温下的空气中逐渐恢复到初始值。XPS结果表明，Au2O3可以通过O2等离子体处理形成，并且可以自发且完全地在22°C的空气中分解为金元素。通过在22°C至100°C的温度范围内使用一级速率方程分析了分解过程的时间依赖性，计算出的活化能为57 kJ/mol。电阻测量结果显示，在O2等离子体清洗后，Au表面的电性能并未退化，这可能是因为还原了金元素。

Au2O3的稳定性被证实不稳定，其半衰期在22°C时为22小时，在0°C时为166小时。这表明Au2O3即使在低温下也具有不稳定性。Au2O3分解的活化能被确定为57 kJ/mol，与AuO键的分解能量相同。Au2O3的分解动力学研究揭示了通过监测表面电阻变化来了解过程。在O2等离子体清洗后，Au表面的电性能未退化，证明了此方法有效恢复了金表面的原始性质。Au2O3的不稳定性得到了确认，计算得到的分解活化能与AuO键相匹配。O2等离子体清洗后还原的金元素表明，这种技术可以在不损害底层金表面的情况下有效去除Au2O3。

The kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were studied by examining the changes in surface resistance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) readings. The surface resistance of the gold film significantly increased after O2-plasma treatment and then gradually returned to its initial value when left in air at room temperature. XPS confirmed that Au2O3 can form via O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociate into gold elements. The time dependence of the dissociation process was analyzed by monitoring the surface resistance and applying a first-order rate equation at temperatures ranging from 22 to 100°C, calculating an activation energy of 57 kJ/mol for the dissociation of Au2O3. This indicates that Au2O3 is unstable, even at low temperatures.

Gold is the most noble of all metals due to the lack of reactivity [1].
Recently, several reports have shown that oxidation easily occurs when a gold film is exposed in highly reactive chemical environments, such as during O2-plasma discharge or in UV/ozone, [4] typically altering the electrical characteristics of the material.
The kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were elucidated by monitoring the surface resistances that correspond to changes in the chemical bonding in films. Au2O3 has a short half-life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol, indicating instability even at low temperatures.
The intensities of these two AuO peaks gradually decay when the D0-sample is held in air for 2 days (D2-sample) following O2-plasma treatment, and the AuO peaks completely disappear after about 4 days (D4-sample) at 22 C, as indicated in Table 1.
For gold elements, moreover, the intensities of the AuAu1 and AuAu2 peaks in the D0-sample (the O2-plasma as-treated sample) declined considerably, compared with the untreated Au film (NON-sample), due to the oxidation of gold.
The results of electrical resistance also revealed that the electrical properties are not degraded after O2-plasma cleaning of the surface of gold due to the restoration of elemental gold.

The instability of gold oxide Au2O3 under certain reactive environments, such as O2-plasma discharge or UV/ozone, leads to the alteration of the material's electrical characteristics. The dissociation kinetics of Au2O3, characterized by changes in surface resistance, were found to have a short half-life of 22 hours at 22°C and 166 hours at 0°C, with an activation energy of 57 kJ/mol, indicating its inherent instability at low temperatures. This study also observed the gradual decay of AuO peaks in the sample held in air for 2 days, leading to the complete disappearance of these peaks after 4 days, confirming the spontaneous and complete dissociation of the oxide in air at 22°C. Moreover, the electrical properties of the gold surface remained unaffected after O2-plasma cleaning, suggesting the restoration of elemental gold upon oxide dissociation.
