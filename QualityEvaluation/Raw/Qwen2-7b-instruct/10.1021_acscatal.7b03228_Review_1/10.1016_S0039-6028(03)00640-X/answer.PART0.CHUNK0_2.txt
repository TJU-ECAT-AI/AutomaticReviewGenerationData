Surface Science Letters Instability of gold oxide Au2O3 Hungchun Tsai a,b, Emily Hu a, Kuoguang Perng a,*, Minkar Chen a, Jung-Chun Wu a, Yee-Shyi Chang b a Global Communication Technology Corporation, 4F, No. 10, Prosperity Road 1, Hsin-Chu 30077, Taiwan, ROC b Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National Tsing-Hua University, Hsin-Chu 30013, Taiwan, ROC Received 27 February 2003; accepted for publication 3 May 2003

Au films were deposited on 6 in. Si substrates by physical vapor deposition to a thickness of 100 nm. The Au films were then oxidized by exposure to O2-plasma for 1 min, and the thick-ness of the oxide was estimated to exceed 4 nm by XPS [9].

The surface resistances of the Au films and the Au oxides were measured using a typical four-point probe system, and the average resistance was calculated across 52 different points on the wafer.

Au2O3 has a short half-life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol, indicating instability even at low temperatures.

The results of electrical resistance also revealed that the electrical properties are not degraded after O2-plasma cleaning of the surface of gold due to the restoration of elemental gold.

The kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were studied by examining the changes in surface resistance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) readings. The surface resistance of the gold film significantly increased after O2-plasma treatment and then gradually returned to its initial value when left in air at room temperature. XPS confirmed that Au2O3 can form via O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociate into gold elements. The time dependence of the dissociation process was analyzed by monitoring the surface resistance and applying a first-order rate equation at temperatures ranging from 22 to 100°C, calculating an activation energy of 57 kJ/mol for the dissociation of Au2O3. This indicates that Au2O3 is unstable, even at low temperatures.

对Au2O3的解离动力学进行了研究，通过观察表面电阻和X射线光电子能谱(XPS)读数的变化。在O2等离子体处理后，金膜的表面电阻显著增加，并在室温下的空气中逐渐恢复到初始值。XPS证实，Au2O3可以通过O2等离子体处理形成，并自发地分解为金元素。通过监测表面电阻并应用温度为22至100°C范围内的第一级速率方程，分析了解离过程的时间依赖性，计算出Au2O3解离的活化能为57 kJ/mol。这表明Au2O3即使在低温下也具有不稳定性。
