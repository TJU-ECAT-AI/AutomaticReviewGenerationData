The kinetics of the dissociation of gold oxide, Au2O3, were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and by taking electrical resistance measurements. The surface resistance of the gold film was markedly increased by O2-plasma treatment and then gradually returned to the initial value in air at room temperature (22 C).

Au2O3 can be formed by O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociated to gold elements.

The activation energy for the dissociation Ea was calculated from the slope to be 57 kJ/mol (0.6 eV), which is of the same as the AuO bond dissociation energy.

Au2O3 has a short half-life of 22 h at 22 C and 166 h at 0 C, with an activation energy of dissociation of 57 kJ/mol, indicating instability even at low temperatures.

The kinetics of the dissociation of Au2O3 were studied using XPS and electrical resistance measurements. After O2-plasma treatment, the gold film's surface resistance increased significantly, then gradually returned to its initial value in room temperature air. Au2O3 forms upon O2-plasma treatment and spontaneously dissociates into gold elements. The activation energy for this dissociation process is 57 kJ/mol (0.6 eV), and Au2O3 exhibits instability at both room and lower temperatures with a half-life of 22 hours at 22°C and 166 hours at 0°C.

对Au2O3的解离动力学进行了研究，使用了XPS和电导率测量方法。在O2等离子体处理后，金膜的表面电阻显著增加，然后在室温空气条件下逐渐恢复到初始值。Au2O3通过O2等离子体处理形成，并自发分解为金元素。该分解过程的活化能为57 kJ/mol（0.6 eV），即使在低温下Au2O3也表现出不稳定性，其半衰期分别为22小时（22°C）和166小时（0°C）。
