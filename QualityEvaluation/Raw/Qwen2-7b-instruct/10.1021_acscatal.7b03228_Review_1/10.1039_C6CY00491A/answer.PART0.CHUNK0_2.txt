The study investigates the synthesis, characterization, and testing of Pd and PdIn intermetallic alloy nanoparticles for ethane dehydrogenation. Addition of In to Pd increases the olefin selectivity to near 100% and the initial turnover rate (TOR, per surface Pd site) to 0.26 s−1. The introduction of In to Pd nanoparticles leads to the formation of a PdIn intermetallic compound (IMC) structure, which geometrically isolates the Pd catalytic sites by non-catalytic, metallic In neighbors. This is responsible for the high olefin selectivity. Concomitant electronic effect due to PdIn bond formation likely leads to the increase in TOR.

这项研究探讨了钯和钯因际金属合金纳米粒子在乙烷裂解中的合成、表征和测试。向钯中添加铟可以将乙烯选择性提高到接近100%，初始周转率（每表面钯位点）达到0.26秒−1。向钯纳米颗粒引入铟导致形成钯因际金属化合物（IMC）结构，这几何上隔离了钯催化位点，由非催化、金属铟邻居组成。这是高乙烯选择性的原因。伴随电子效应由于钯因形成可能导致周转率增加。

向钯纳米颗粒引入铟会导致形成钯因际金属化合物（IMC）结构，这通过非催化、金属铟邻近几何上隔离了钯催化位点。这是高烯烃选择性的原因。伴随电子效应由于钯因形成可能导致周转率增加。
