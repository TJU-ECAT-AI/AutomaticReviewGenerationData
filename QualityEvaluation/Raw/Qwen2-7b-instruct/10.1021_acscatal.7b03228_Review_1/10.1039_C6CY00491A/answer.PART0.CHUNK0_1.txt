The demand for light olefins has steadily grown over the past decades, making them crucial chemical building blocks. Today, numerous new light alkane dehydrogenation (LAD) installations are either being constructed or planned. Controlling selectivity is paramount for catalytic light alkane dehydrogenation processes. Noble metal catalysts, such as platinum, typically produce methane with high yield, which along with coke formation, leads to rapid catalyst deactivation. Promoters like tin (Sn) in bimetallic platinum-silver (PtAg) catalysts help reduce side reactions and coke formation by modifying the electronic structure of platinum, transferring electrons to its valence band. Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in selective catalytic processes, such as propane dehydrogenation. Indium (In) has been reported to enhance the performance of Pt-based bimetallic LAD catalysts. As In loading increases, the structure of palladium-indium (PdIn) nanoparticles evolves, as illustrated schematically in Figure 8. This evolution towards more selective catalysts demonstrates the role of In in promoting both geometric and electronic effects in enhancing catalyst performance.

过去几十年，轻烯烃的需求持续增长，使其成为重要的化学基础材料。目前，许多新的轻烷烃脱氢（LAD）装置正在建设或规划中。选择性控制对于催化轻烷烃脱氢过程至关重要。在典型反应条件下，贵金属催化剂通常产生高产量的甲烷和伴随的焦炭生成，导致催化剂快速失活。在铂（Pt）基双金属催化剂中，促进剂如锡（Sn）通过转移电子到其价带来修改铂的电子结构，从而减少副反应和焦炭形成。最近的研究强调了在选择性催化过程中使用互金属化合物（IMCs）的有效性，例如丙烷脱氢。据报道，铟（In）可以增强基于铂的双金属轻烷烃脱氢催化剂的性能。随着In负载的增加，PdIn纳米颗粒的结构演变，如图8所示的示意图所显示。这种结构演变向更选择性的催化剂表明了In在促进几何和电子效应以增强催化剂性能中的作用。
