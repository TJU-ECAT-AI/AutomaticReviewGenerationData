[1] "It has been reported that in PdZn catalysts, the only IMC phase that form is a 1 : 1 β1-PdZn intermetallic compound with the CuTi type structure (tetragonal, shortened in c axis compared to the CsCl type)."
[2] "Concomitant PdIn bond formation also modifies the electronic properties of Pd atoms, leading to an increase in the TOR by almost 10 times compared with monometallic Pd."

1. In PdZn catalysts, the only intermetallic compound (IMC) phase that forms is a 1 : 1 β1-PdZn intermetallic compound with a CuTi type structure, which is tetragonal with a shortened c-axis compared to the CsCl type.
2. The formation of PdIn bonds modifies the electronic properties of Pd atoms, resulting in a nearly tenfold increase in the turnover rate (TOR) compared to monometallic Pd.

1. 在PdZn催化剂中，形成的唯一互金属化合物（IMC）相是1 : 1 β1-PdZn互金属化合物，具有CuTi类型结构，该结构为四面体，c轴缩短与CsCl类型相比。
2. 形成PdIn键改变了Pd原子的电子性质，导致与单金属Pd相比，转化率（TOR）增加了近十倍。
