[1] "The only alloy phase observed is the 1 : 1 cubic PdIn intermetallic compound with CsCl structure, suggesting preferential formation of this intermetallic phase."
[2] "The PdIn 1 : 1 IMC is the struc- ture with the lowest kinetic barrier for intermetallic alloy formation and requires the least rearrangement of atoms in the initially formed FCC Pd nanoparticle."
[3] "In the cubic PdIn IMC structure, the first nearest neighbors of Pd atoms are In at 2.81 Å with the nearest PdPd distance of 3.25 Å, ensuring isolation of the catalytically active Pd atoms."
[4] "For catalysts with a PdIn IMC surface, the ethane dehydrogenation selectivity is near 100%; while that of Pd nano-particles of similar size is approximately 50%."
[5] "The geometric isolation of the active sites allows for catalytic reaction of structure insensitive reactions, i.e., dehydrogenation, while elimination of hydrogenolysis, a structure sensitive reaction."
[6] "Concomitant PdIn bond formation also modifies the electronic properties of Pd atoms, leading to an increase in the TOR by almost 10 times compared with monometallic Pd."

1. The single-atom alloy PdIn with a cubic structure and CsCl type prefers to form under certain conditions, offering advantages in catalytic performance.
2. The PdIn alloy with a 1:1 ratio and CsCl structure forms with minimal atom rearrangement, minimizing energy barriers for alloy formation.
3. In the PdIn cubic structure, Pd atoms are isolated by In atoms at a precise distance, facilitating efficient catalytic activity.
4. Catalysts featuring PdIn surface exhibit significantly higher ethane dehydrogenation selectivity compared to Pd nanoparticles of equivalent size.
5. The geometric isolation of active sites in PdIn surface catalysts enables the efficient catalysis of structure-insensitive reactions, such as dehydrogenation, without promoting unwanted hydrogenolysis.
6. The formation of PdIn bonds alters the electronic properties of Pd atoms, leading to an enhancement in the turnover rate (TOR) by nearly tenfold relative to monometallic Pd.
