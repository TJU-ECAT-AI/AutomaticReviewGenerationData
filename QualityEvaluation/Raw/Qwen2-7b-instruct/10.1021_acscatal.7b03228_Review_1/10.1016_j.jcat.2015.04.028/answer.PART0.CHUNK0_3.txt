[1] "The restructuring of the surface into many small terraces in the poisoned state is surprising. It contrasts with the unchanged flat morphology in experiments in which sulfur-free hydrogen had been used [23]."
[2] "The most likely explanation for the sulfur-induced roughening observed in our experiments is the formation of a surface phase with a different density of cobalt atoms than the original metal surface, as would be the case if, e.g., a cobalt sulfide layer had formed."
[3] "A reconstruction may also account for the relatively high maximum sulfur coverage of 41% of a ML observed after the syngas experiments."
[4] "Using high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmosphere, first direct insight into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur was obtained."

1. The surface morphology changed dramatically under sulfur poisoning conditions, transitioning from a flat surface to numerous small terraces, contrasting with the unchanged flat surface observed under sulfur-free hydrogen experiments.

2. The most probable explanation for the sulfur-induced surface roughening in the experiments is the formation of a surface phase with a different cobalt atom density compared to the original metal surface, potentially involving the formation of a cobalt sulfide layer.

3. Surface reconstruction is another plausible explanation for the observed high sulfur coverage, suggesting that the sulfur-covered state involves not just a simple layer of sulfur atoms but includes a rearrangement of the cobalt atoms on the surface.

4. High-pressure high-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy in a syngas environment provided the first direct understanding of how sulfur poisons a Co(0001) model catalyst.

1. 在硫中毒状态下，表面形态经历了从平坦表面到众多小型台阶的转变，这与在无硫氢气实验中观察到的不变平坦表面形成鲜明对比。

2. 实验中观察到的硫诱导表面粗糙化最可能的解释是形成了一个与原始金属表面具有不同钴原子密度的表面相，这可能是由于形成了钴硫化物层。

3. 表面重构也是观察到的较高硫覆盖率的一个合理解释，表明硫覆盖状态不仅涉及简单的硫原子层，还包括表面原子的重新排列。

4. 在高压高温扫描隧道显微镜的气体环境中，首次直接理解了硫如何毒害Co(0001)模型催化剂。
