[1] "In the methanation limit of the FischerTropsch reaction [T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1], and using hydrogen containing <0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds, the sample was poisoned under conditions under which methanation had been observed before with sulfur-free hydrogen."
[2] "STM data showed that in the poisoned state the originally flat surface had restructured into many small terraces with diameters of only several 10 Å. This roughening contrasts with a widespread model of the FischerTropsch reaction according to which a surface roughening is related to the formation of the active state of the Co catalyst."
[3] "Together with STM experiments, in which H2 and CO were introduced sequentially, this indicated a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state, rather than a simple overlayer of adsorbed S atoms."
[4] "The roughening suggested that, in addition, a surface reconstruction was involved in the poisoned state."

The poisoning of the Co(0001) Fischer-Tropsch model catalyst by sulfur under methanation conditions led to a restructuring of the surface into numerous small terraces. This was unexpected as it contradicts the common model that surface roughening is associated with the catalyst's active state. The surface phase observed after the poisoning was identified as a mixed sulfur and carbon layer, suggesting a non-selective poisoning mechanism. Additionally, the study indicates that a surface reconstruction took place, further contributing to the observed changes in the catalyst's surface structure.

在甲烷化条件下，对Co(0001)费托模型催化剂进行硫污染导致表面重新结构为许多小台阶。这与常见模型相矛盾，该模型认为表面粗糙化与催化剂活性状态有关。观察到的表面相被识别为硫和碳的混合层，表明存在非选择性中毒机制。此外，研究还表明表面重构发生了，进一步解释了催化剂表面结构的变化。
