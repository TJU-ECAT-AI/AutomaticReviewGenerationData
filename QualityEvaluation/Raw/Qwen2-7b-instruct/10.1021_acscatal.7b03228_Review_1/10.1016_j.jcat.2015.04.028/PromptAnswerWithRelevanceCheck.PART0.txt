[1] "In the methanation limit of the FischerTropsch reaction [T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1], and using hydrogen containing <0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds, the sample was poisoned under conditions under which methanation had been observed before with sulfur-free hydrogen."
[2] "STM data showed that in the poisoned state the originally flat surface had restructured into many small terraces with diameters of only several 10 Å. This roughening contrasts with a widespread model of the FischerTropsch reaction according to which a surface roughening is related to the formation of the active state of the Co catalyst."
[3] "Together with STM experiments, in which H2 and CO were introduced sequentially, this indicated a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state, rather than a simple overlayer of adsorbed S atoms."
[4] "The roughening suggested that, in addition, a surface reconstruction was involved in the poisoned state."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The poisoning of the Co(0001) Fischer-Tropsch model catalyst by sulfur under methanation conditions led to a restructuring of the surface into numerous small terraces. This was unexpected as it contradicts the common model that surface roughening is associated with the catalyst's active state. The surface phase observed after the poisoning was identified as a mixed sulfur and carbon layer, suggesting a non-selective poisoning mechanism. Additionally, the study indicates that a surface reconstruction took place, further contributing to the observed changes in the catalyst's surface structure.

[1] "Using high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmosphere, first direct insight into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur was obtained."
[2] "The poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst for the FischerTropsch reaction by sulfur was investigated by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."
[3] "After the reac- tion experiments, the surface was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
[4] "The observations contrast with the flat terraces covered by a mobile adsorption layer when sulfur-free hydrogen was used."
[5] "The poisoned surface state is interpreted as a mixed sulfur/carbon layer that additionally involves a reconstruction of the Co(0001) surface."
[6] "The sulfur coverage responsible for this deactivation was estimated from the amount of H2S consumed and from Auger electron spectra (AES) of the catalyst taken out of the reactor."
[7] "With sulfur, we observed, in addi- tion, so far unknown surface structures that can be explained by a mixed sulfur/carbon layer on a reconstructed surface."
[8] "The data confirm the assumption that in the poisoned state the surface of the Co FischerTropsch catalyst is fully covered,corresponding to a nonselective poisoning mechanism, which so far was only based on indirect evidence."
[9] "The sulfur-induced roughening observed in our experiments is surprising. It contrasts with the unchanged flat morphology in experiments in which sulfur-free hydrogen had been used."
[10] "The restructuring of the surface into many small terraces in the poisoned state is surprising. It contrasts with the unchanged flat morphology in experiments in which sulfur-free hydrogen had been used."
[11] "A reconstruction may also account for the relatively high maxi- mum sulfur coverage of 41% of a ML observed after the syngas experiments."

The document provides insights into how sulfur poisoning affects a cobalt model catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch reactions. Under reaction conditions with sulfur-containing hydrogen, the catalyst's surface undergoes a restructuring into many small terraces, contrasting with the flat morphology observed with sulfur-free hydrogen. This roughening suggests a non-selective poisoning mechanism involving a mixed sulfur/carbon layer covering the surface. The maximum sulfur coverage reached 41% of a monolayer, which is higher than previously estimated for sulfur poisoning. The poisoning leads to a decrease in methanation activity, indicating a complex interaction between sulfur, carbon, and the cobalt surface, potentially involving surface reconstruction.

文档提供了有关硫中毒如何影响费托反应钴模型催化剂的见解。在含硫氢气的反应条件下，催化剂表面重新结构为许多小型台阶，与使用无硫氢气时观察到的平坦形态形成对比。这种粗糙化表明存在一种非选择性中毒机制，涉及覆盖表面的硫/碳混合层。达到的最大硫覆盖率为一个单分子层的41%，这高于之前对硫中毒估计的覆盖率。中毒导致甲烷化活性下降，表明硫、碳和钴表面之间存在复杂的相互作用，可能涉及表面重建。

1. The research team used high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmosphere to gain insights into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur.
2. The poisoning occurred under conditions where methanation had been observed before with sulfur-free hydrogen, specifically at T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1, using hydrogen containing less than 0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds.
3. The poisoned state of the catalyst led to the restructuring of the initially flat surface into numerous small terraces with diameters of just several tens of angstroms.
4. This roughening phenomenon contradicts the common belief that surface roughening is related to the active state formation in the Co catalyst during the FischerTropsch reaction.
5. Further experiments under higher syngas pressures and lower p(H2):p(CO) ratios are needed to confirm whether this discrepancy remains.
6. The STM experiments revealed that the poisoned state of the surface was fully covered by a stable structure, indicating a nonselective poisoning mechanism.
7. The observed structure comprised stripes showing a (2  2) pattern and small areas with an ordered (p19  p19)R23.4 structure.
8. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis after transferring the sample to UHV showed sulfur coverages up to 41% of a monolayer and substantial amounts of carbon.
9. The sequential introduction of H2 and CO in STM experiments suggested a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state, rather than a simple layer of adsorbed S atoms.
10. The roughening observed in the poisoned state of the catalyst also implied that a surface reconstruction was involved.

[1] "The restructuring of the surface into many small terraces in the poisoned state is surprising. It contrasts with the unchanged flat morphology in experiments in which sulfur-free hydrogen had been used [23]."
[2] "The most likely explanation for the sulfur-induced roughening observed in our experiments is the formation of a surface phase with a different density of cobalt atoms than the original metal surface, as would be the case if, e.g., a cobalt sulfide layer had formed."

1. The surface morphology changed dramatically under sulfur poisoning conditions, transitioning from a flat surface to numerous small terraces, contrasting with the unchanged flat surface observed under sulfur-free hydrogen experiments.

2. The most probable explanation for the sulfur-induced surface roughening in the experiments is the formation of a surface phase with a different cobalt atom density compared to the original metal surface, potentially involving the formation of a cobalt sulfide layer.

3. Surface reconstruction is another plausible explanation for the observed high sulfur coverage, suggesting that the sulfur-covered state involves not just a simple layer of sulfur atoms but includes a rearrangement of the cobalt atoms on the surface.

4. High-pressure high-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy in a syngas environment provided the first direct understanding of how sulfur poisons a Co(0001) model catalyst.

1. 在硫中毒状态下，表面形态经历了从平坦表面到众多小型台阶的转变，这与在无硫氢气实验中观察到的不变平坦表面形成鲜明对比。

2. 实验中观察到的硫诱导表面粗糙化最可能的解释是形成了一个与原始金属表面具有不同钴原子密度的表面相，这可能是由于形成了钴硫化物层。

3. 表面重构也是观察到的较高硫覆盖率的一个合理解释，表明硫覆盖状态不仅涉及简单的硫原子层，还包括表面原子的重新排列。

4. 在高压高温扫描隧道显微镜的气体环境中，首次直接理解了硫如何毒害Co(0001)模型催化剂。
