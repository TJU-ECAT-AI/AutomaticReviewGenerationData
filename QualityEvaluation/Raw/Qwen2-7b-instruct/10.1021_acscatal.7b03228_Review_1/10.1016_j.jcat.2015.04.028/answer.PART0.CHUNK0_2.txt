[1] "Using high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmosphere, first direct insight into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur was obtained."
[2] "In the methanation limit of the FischerTropsch reaction [T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1], and using hydrogen containing <0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds, the sample was poisoned under conditions under which methanation had been observed before with sulfur-free hydrogen."
[3] "The STM data showed that in the poisoned state the originally flat surface had restructured into many small terraces with diameters of only several 10 Å."
[4] "This roughening contrasts with a widespread model of the FischerTropsch reaction according to which a surface roughening is related to the formation of the active state of the Co catalyst."
[5] "If this discrepancy persists under more realistic FischerTropsch conditions has to be shown in experiments under higher syngas pressures and at lower p(H2):p(CO) ratios."
[6] "A second finding of the in situ STM experiments was that the terraces were fully covered by a stable structure, suggesting a nonselective poisoning mechanism."
[7] "The structure displayed stripes partially showing a (2  2) structure and small areas with an ordered (p19  p19)R23.4 structure."
[8] "XP spectra, taken after transfer of the sample to UHV, showed sulfur coverages up to 41% of a ML and significant amounts of carbon."
[9] "Together with STM experiments, in which H2 and CO were introduced sequentially, this indicated a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state, rather than a simple overlayer of adsorbed S atoms."
[10] "The roughening suggested that, in addition, a surface reconstruction was involved in the poisoned state."

1. The research team used high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmosphere to gain insights into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur.
2. The poisoning occurred under conditions where methanation had been observed before with sulfur-free hydrogen, specifically at T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1, using hydrogen containing less than 0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds.
3. The poisoned state of the catalyst led to the restructuring of the initially flat surface into numerous small terraces with diameters of just several tens of angstroms.
4. This roughening phenomenon contradicts the common belief that surface roughening is related to the active state formation in the Co catalyst during the FischerTropsch reaction.
5. Further experiments under higher syngas pressures and lower p(H2):p(CO) ratios are needed to confirm whether this discrepancy remains.
6. The STM experiments revealed that the poisoned state of the surface was fully covered by a stable structure, indicating a nonselective poisoning mechanism.
7. The observed structure comprised stripes showing a (2  2) pattern and small areas with an ordered (p19  p19)R23.4 structure.
8. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis after transferring the sample to UHV showed sulfur coverages up to 41% of a monolayer and substantial amounts of carbon.
9. The sequential introduction of H2 and CO in STM experiments suggested a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state, rather than a simple layer of adsorbed S atoms.
10. The roughening observed in the poisoned state of the catalyst also implied that a surface reconstruction was involved.

1. 研究团队使用高压力高温扫描隧道显微镜（STM）在合成气气氛中，首次获得了钴（0001）模型催化剂被硫中毒的直接洞察。
2. 在甲烷化条件下，使用氢气含量低于0.5ppm的硫化合物，在T=493K、ptotal=14.5mbar、p(H2):p(CO)=30:1下，观察到了催化剂被硫中毒的现象，这与使用无硫氢气时的甲烷化结果相同。
3. 中毒状态下的催化剂表面重新结构化为许多直径仅为几十个埃的微小台阶。
4. 这种粗糙化现象与普遍认为表面粗糙化与钴催化剂活性状态形成有关的观点相矛盾。
5. 需要在更高的合成气压力和更低的p(H2):p(CO)比条件下进一步实验，以确认这一差异是否持续存在。
6. STM实验表明，中毒状态下的表面完全被一个稳定的结构覆盖，暗示了一种非选择性的中毒机制。
7. 观察到的结构包括显示（2  2）模式的条纹以及一小部分具有（p19  p19）R23.4有序结构的区域。
8. 将样品转移到真空室后进行的X射线光电子能谱分析（XPS）显示，硫覆盖率达到41%的单层，并且含有大量碳。
9. 顺序引入氢气和二氧化碳的STM实验表明，失活状态下形成的是一种混合S/C相态，而不是简单的吸附硫原子层。
10. 有毒状态下观察到的粗糙化也意味着表面重建参与了中毒过程。
