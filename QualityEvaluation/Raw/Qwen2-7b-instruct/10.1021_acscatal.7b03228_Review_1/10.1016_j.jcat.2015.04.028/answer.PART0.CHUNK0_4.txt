[1] "Using high-pressure high-temperature STM in a syngas atmosphere, first direct insight into the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur was obtained."
[2] "In the methanation limit of the FischerTropsch reaction [T = 493 K, ptotal = 14.5 mbar, p(H2):p(CO) = 30:1], and using hydrogen containing <0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds, the sample was poisoned under conditions under which methanation had been observed before with sulfur-free hydrogen."
[3] "The STM data showed that in the poisoned state the originally flat surface had restructured into many small terraces with diameters of only several 10 Å."
[4] "This roughening contrasts with a widespread model of the FischerTropsch reaction according to which a surface roughening is related to the formation of the active state of the Co catalyst."
[5] "If this discrepancy persists under more realistic FischerTropsch conditions has to be shown in experiments under higher syngas pressures and at lower p(H2):p(CO) ratios."
[6] "A second finding of the in situ STM experiments was that the terraces were fully covered by a stable structure, suggesting a nonselective poisoning mechanism."
[7] "The structure displayed stripes partially showing a (2  2) structure and small areas with an ordered (p19  p19)R23.4 structure."
[8] "XP spectra, taken after transfer of the sample to UHV, showed sulfur coverages up to 41% of a ML and significant amounts of carbon."
[9] "Together with STM experiments, in which H2 and CO were introduced sequentially, this indicated a mixed S/C phase in the deactivated state, rather than a simple overlayer of adsorbed S atoms."

1. High-pressure high-temperature STM experiments were conducted in a syngas atmosphere to investigate the poisoning of a Co(0001) model catalyst by sulfur.
2. The poisoning occurred under methanation conditions with hydrogen containing less than 0.5 ppm of sulfur compounds.
3. The surface of the catalyst changed from a flat structure to a roughened one with small terraces upon poisoning.
4. Contrary to common understanding, surface roughening in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction is not necessarily indicative of the active state of the catalyst.
5. Further experiments under higher syngas pressures and lower hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratios are needed to clarify the discrepancy.
6. The poisoned state was characterized by a stable, fully covering structure on the catalyst surface.
7. The structure displayed features of both (2  2) and (p19  p19)R23.4 patterns.
8. XPS analysis revealed sulfur coverages up to 41% of a monolayer, along with substantial carbon content.
9. The mixed sulfur-carbon phase in the deactivated state suggests a non-selective poisoning mechanism rather than a simple adsorption of sulfur atoms.

1. 在一种特殊的高压力和高温扫描隧道显微镜（STM）实验中，研究者在合成气气氛下对钴(0001)模型催化剂硫中毒的情况进行了首次直接观察。
2. 硫中毒发生在甲烷化条件下，使用的氢气中硫化合物含量低于0.5ppm。
3. 催化剂表面从平坦结构转变为由许多直径仅为几个10Å的小台阶构成的粗糙结构。
4. 与普遍认为表面粗糙化是催化剂活性状态标志的观点相反，在费希尔-特罗普斯反应中表面粗糙化并不一定代表催化剂的活性状态。
5. 需要在更高合成气压力和更低氢气与一氧化碳比例的情况下进一步进行实验以澄清这一矛盾。
6. 毒化状态的特点是覆盖整个表面的稳定结构。
7. 这个结构显示了（2  2）和（p19  p19）R23.4模式的部分特征。
8. X射线光电子能谱分析显示硫的覆盖率达到41%的单分子层，同时含有大量碳元素。
9. 活性丧失状态中混合的硫-碳相表明中毒机制可能是非选择性的，而不是简单吸附硫原子的过程。
