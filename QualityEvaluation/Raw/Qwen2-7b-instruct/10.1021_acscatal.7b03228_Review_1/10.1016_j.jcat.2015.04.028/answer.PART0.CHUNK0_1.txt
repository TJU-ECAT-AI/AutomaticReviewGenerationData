The document provides insights into how sulfur poisoning affects a cobalt model catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch reactions. Under reaction conditions with sulfur-containing hydrogen, the catalyst's surface undergoes a restructuring into many small terraces, contrasting with the flat morphology observed with sulfur-free hydrogen. This roughening suggests a non-selective poisoning mechanism involving a mixed sulfur/carbon layer covering the surface. The maximum sulfur coverage reached 41% of a monolayer, which is higher than previously estimated for sulfur poisoning. The poisoning leads to a decrease in methanation activity, indicating a complex interaction between sulfur, carbon, and the cobalt surface, potentially involving surface reconstruction.

文档提供了有关硫中毒如何影响费托反应钴模型催化剂的见解。在含硫氢气的反应条件下，催化剂表面重新结构为许多小型台阶，与使用无硫氢气时观察到的平坦形态形成对比。这种粗糙化表明存在一种非选择性中毒机制，涉及覆盖表面的硫/碳混合层。达到的最大硫覆盖率为一个单分子层的41%，这高于之前对硫中毒估计的覆盖率。中毒导致甲烷化活性下降，表明硫、碳和钴表面之间存在复杂的相互作用，可能涉及表面重建。
