[1] "Understanding which factor is dominant for a particular reaction can be used to design improved catalysts."
[2] "These improvements were credited to both geometric changes caused by zinc altering the catalyst surface by expanding the palladium bond distance and electronic effects observed by the weakening of the PdCO bond."
[3] "We found that the CO heat of adsorption on a PdZn alloy was 67 kJ/mol lower than that of monometallic Pd."
[4] "The addition of zinc causes a dramatic shift in the CO adsorption resulting in greatly reduced concentration of bridge-bound CO."
[5] "The 2%Pd catalyst, with an average particle size of 2.5 nm, has one very prominent bridge-bound CO peak at 1936 cm−1, a shoulder centered around 1835 cm−1, and one linear CO peak at 2084 cm−1."

1. Understanding the dominance of electronic or geometric effects in controlling selectivity for a specific reaction can aid in the development of enhanced catalysts.
2. The introduction of zinc to the catalyst surface leads to both geometric modifications, such as expanding the palladium bond distance, and electronic effects, which weaken the PdCO bond.
3. The researchers discovered that the CO adsorption energy on a PdZn alloy was 67 kJ/mol less than that on pure Pd.
4. The incorporation of zinc results in a significant alteration of CO adsorption, leading to a substantial decrease in the concentration of bridge-bound CO.
5. The 2%Pd catalyst, with a mean particle size of 2.5 nm, exhibits a dominant bridge-bound CO peak at 1936 cm−1, a shoulder centered at 1835 cm−1, and a linear CO peak at 2084 cm−1.

1. 理解特定反应中电子或几何效应主导选择性的原理，可以用于设计改进催化剂。
2. 锌的引入导致催化剂表面的几何变化，如扩展钯原子间的键距，以及观察到的PdCO键强度减弱的电子效应。
3. 研究人员发现，PdZn合金的CO吸附能比纯Pd低67 kJ/mol。
4. 锌的加入导致CO吸附发生显著改变，导致桥接吸附CO的浓度大幅降低。
5. 2%Pd催化剂，平均粒径为2.5 nm，表现出一个主要的桥接吸附CO峰在1936 cm−1处，肩部位于1835 cm−1附近，线性CO峰在2084 cm−1处。
