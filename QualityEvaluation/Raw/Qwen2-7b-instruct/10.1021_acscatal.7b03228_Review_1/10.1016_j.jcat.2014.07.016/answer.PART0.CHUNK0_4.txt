<p>Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of a catalyst [8]. Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms. At the same time, the orbital extent or the size of the valence orbitals of the alloying elements is different, resulting in changes in the overlap between the bonding orbitals.</p>
<p>Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are important, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction.</p>
<p>PdZn alloys have been studied for a number of different reactions, including methanol steam reforming, watergas shift, alkene hydrogenation and auto-thermal reforming [11,1319]. Pd and Zn form a large number of bimetallic structures each with their own unique crystal structure and stoichiometry. At a 1:1 ratio of Pd:Zn,a face centered tetragonal structure forms, which is present for a wide range of Pd compositions (3070%) [13,17,18,20]. Improved selectivity and stability were the main benefits that PdZn catalysts exhibited for these various reactions. These improvements were credited to both geometric changes caused by zinc altering the catalyst surface by expanding the palladium bond distance and electronic effects observed by the weakening of the PdCO bond [12,18].</p>
<p>Chen et al. performed DFT studies on the surface structure of PdZn alloys and found that the (111) surface was the most energetically favorable [21]. Calculations also suggested that the Pd d-band valence width was significantly reduced compared to pure Pd which was linked to improvements in methanol steam reforming performance.</p>
<p>The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn,demonstrating that hydrogenolysis requires a particular reactive ensemble whereas propane dehydroge- nation does not.</p>
<p>Many of these studies used ZnO as a support or sup- ported ZnO, e.g., from a Zn(NO3)2 precursor, as a source of zinc for alloy formation. PdZn intermetallic structures are typically synthe- sized with excess zinc and not in nominal molar ratios close to 1:1.</p>
<p>Iwasa et al. were unable to form the PdZn intermetallic structure on silica at temperatures up to 700 C due to a lack of zinc reduction in ZnO [22]. Fottinger et al. performed methanol steam reforming over Pd/ZnO catalysts and found that reaction conditions caused PdZn intermetallic formation which resulted in improvements to selec- tivity [19]. Through in situ XAS it was also shown that the PdZn inter- metallic structure was also reversible upon exposure to oxygen.</p>
<p>Neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogen- olysis/dehydrogenation reactions were used to evaluate the influ- ence of Zn on the hydrogenolysis selectivity of Pd.</p>

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering electronic properties. This is achieved through charge transfer and changes in hybridization. The orbital extent and size of the valence orbitals of the alloying elements influence the overlap between bonding orbitals, affecting catalytic activity.

2. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include reaction conditions that optimize the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst. Metal properties such as valence width and bond distance play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's selectivity and stability. SAA catalysts can break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various systems by effectively controlling these properties.

3. The improvement in selectivity and stability in PdZn catalysts for reactions like methanol steam reforming, watergas shift, alkene hydrogenation, and auto-thermal reforming is attributed to both geometric changes (expansion of palladium bond distance) and electronic effects (weakening of the PdCO bond).

4. DFT studies on PdZn alloys reveal that the (111) surface is energetically favorable. The reduction of the Pd d-band valence width, linked to methanol steam reforming performance, is another key electronic effect.

5. The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity in PdZn catalysts is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, indicating that hydrogenolysis requires a specific reactive ensemble.

6. Studies using ZnO as a support or its precursor for alloy formation demonstrate that PdZn intermetallic structures are synthesized with excess zinc rather than in nominal molar ratios.

7. Challenges in forming the PdZn intermetallic structure on silica at high temperatures due to insufficient zinc reduction highlight the importance of reaction conditions in achieving optimal catalyst performance.

8. Neopentane hydrogenolysis and propane dehydrogenation reactions were utilized to assess the impact of zinc on the hydrogenolysis selectivity of Pd.
