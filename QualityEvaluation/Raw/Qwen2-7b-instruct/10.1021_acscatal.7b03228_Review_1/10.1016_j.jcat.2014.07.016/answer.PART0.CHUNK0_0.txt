1. Understanding the dominance of factors affecting catalyst performance can guide the design of improved catalysts.
2. Achieving high isomerization selectivity requires materials that adsorb CO less strongly than Pt terrace sites.
3. Alloy formation between Pd and Zn is expected to reduce the heat of adsorption and enhance neopentane isomerization selectivity.
4. Zinc addition leads to a significant decrease in the concentration of bridge-bound CO.
5. Higher reduction temperatures tend to lower the heat of adsorption.
6. Primary products are those with non-zero selectivity at 0% conversion, while secondary products have zero selectivity.
