The catalytic performance of metal nanoparticles can be enhanced through modifications in surface geometry, such as adjusting the particle size or incorporating alloy components like zinc. This is exemplified in the study where silica-supported Pd and PdZn nanoparticles of similar sizes were utilized for neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation reactions. The introduction of zinc in the PdZn bimetallic catalysts altered the surface composition and structure, leading to a notable reduction in the concentration of bridge-bound CO. Consequently, the catalysts demonstrated a preference for dehydrogenation reactions over hydrogenolysis, showcasing high selectivity for propylene formation. This selectivity shift can be attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by the inactive metallic Zn component, highlighting the distinct requirements for hydrogenolysis versus dehydrogenation reactions in terms of reactive ensembles.

The DRIFTS technique was applied to assess changes in the surface composition and structure of the catalysts. The analysis revealed a significant alteration in CO adsorption patterns, with a dramatic reduction in bridge-bound CO concentration following zinc addition. This shift was accompanied by an increase in linear-bound CO, indicating a transformation in the surface structure that influenced the catalytic activity. Moreover, the study indicated that the presence of an excess of methane in the product distribution suggested ongoing hydrogenolysis reactions beyond the initial conversion stages, emphasizing the complex interplay between reaction pathways and catalyst properties.

To design successful single-atom alloys (SAA) catalysts, several criteria must be considered. These include optimizing reaction conditions, leveraging the unique electronic properties of the metal components, and ensuring precise control over the surface structure and composition. The incorporation of zinc in PdZn alloys demonstrates how such adjustments can lead to the breaking of scaling rules and improvement in selectivity across various catalyst systems. The ability to tailor the catalytic performance through alloy formation not only enhances selectivity but also enables the design of catalysts that surpass traditional catalysts in efficiency and specificity. By carefully managing factors such as particle size, metal composition, and surface chemistry, it becomes possible to engineer catalysts that exhibit superior performance in selective hydrogenation reactions, thereby contributing to advancements in chemical synthesis and process optimization.

金属纳米粒子的催化性能可以通过调整表面几何形状来改进，例如通过改变颗粒大小或通过添加促进剂或合金形成电子性质。这在研究中得到了体现，其中使用了具有相似大小的二氧化硅支持的Pd和PdZn纳米粒子来进行正戊烷氢解异构化和丙烷氢解异构化反应。向PdZn双金属催化剂中添加锌改变了表面组成和结构，导致桥接吸附CO浓度显著降低。因此，催化剂表现出对丙烯形成的高选择性，这主要归因于活性Pd原子被不活泼的金属Zn隔离，表明氢解和脱氢化反应在活性簇的要求上存在差异。

使用DRIFTS技术评估了催化剂表面组成和结构的变化。分析显示，在锌添加后，CO吸附模式发生了显著变化，桥接吸附CO浓度大幅减少。这一转变伴随着线性吸附CO增加，表明表面结构的改变影响了催化活性。此外，研究指出，两种催化剂中均出现了过量甲烷的存在，这表明在初始转化阶段之后仍持续发生氢解反应，强调了反应途径和催化剂属性之间复杂的相互作用。

设计成功的单原子合金(SAA)催化剂需要考虑几个关键标准。这些包括优化反应条件、利用金属成分的独特电子性质以及确保精确控制表面结构和组成。将锌引入PdZn合金展示了如何通过这些调整来实现催化性能的改进，并且能够在各种催化剂系统中提高选择性。通过精细管理因素如颗粒大小、金属组成和表面化学，有可能工程设计出不仅在选择性上优于传统催化剂的催化剂，而且还能够超越现有规则、提高化学合成和过程优化效率的催化剂。

<p>Alloying with another metal can also affect the electronic properties of a catalyst [8]. Two effects appear simultaneously when metals are alloyed. First, charge transfer may occur between the alloying elements due to differences in the level of filling and relative energies of the valence orbitals. Second, changes in hybridization of the bonding between metals may result due to changes in the bond distances between metal atoms. At the same time, the orbital extent or the size of the valence orbitals of the alloying elements is different, resulting in changes in the overlap between the bonding orbitals.</p>
<p>Although it is well known that these two aspects of the catalyst are important, it is often unknown whether one factor contributes more than another with respect to selectivity control for a particular reaction.</p>
<p>PdZn alloys have been studied for a number of different reactions, including methanol steam reforming, watergas shift, alkene hydrogenation and auto-thermal reforming [11,1319]. Pd and Zn form a large number of bimetallic structures each with their own unique crystal structure and stoichiometry. At a 1:1 ratio of Pd:Zn,a face centered tetragonal structure forms, which is present for a wide range of Pd compositions (3070%) [13,17,18,20]. Improved selectivity and stability were the main benefits that PdZn catalysts exhibited for these various reactions. These improvements were credited to both geometric changes caused by zinc altering the catalyst surface by expanding the palladium bond distance and electronic effects observed by the weakening of the PdCO bond [12,18].</p>
<p>Chen et al. performed DFT studies on the surface structure of PdZn alloys and found that the (111) surface was the most energetically favorable [21]. Calculations also suggested that the Pd d-band valence width was significantly reduced compared to pure Pd which was linked to improvements in methanol steam reforming performance.</p>
<p>The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn,demonstrating that hydrogenolysis requires a particular reactive ensemble whereas propane dehydroge- nation does not.</p>
<p>Many of these studies used ZnO as a support or sup- ported ZnO, e.g., from a Zn(NO3)2 precursor, as a source of zinc for alloy formation. PdZn intermetallic structures are typically synthe- sized with excess zinc and not in nominal molar ratios close to 1:1.</p>
<p>Iwasa et al. were unable to form the PdZn intermetallic structure on silica at temperatures up to 700 C due to a lack of zinc reduction in ZnO [22]. Fottinger et al. performed methanol steam reforming over Pd/ZnO catalysts and found that reaction conditions caused PdZn intermetallic formation which resulted in improvements to selec- tivity [19]. Through in situ XAS it was also shown that the PdZn inter- metallic structure was also reversible upon exposure to oxygen.</p>
<p>Neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogen- olysis/dehydrogenation reactions were used to evaluate the influ- ence of Zn on the hydrogenolysis selectivity of Pd.</p>

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by altering electronic properties. This is achieved through charge transfer and changes in hybridization. The orbital extent and size of the valence orbitals of the alloying elements influence the overlap between bonding orbitals, affecting catalytic activity.

2. The essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include reaction conditions that optimize the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst. Metal properties such as valence width and bond distance play crucial roles in determining the catalyst's selectivity and stability. SAA catalysts can break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various systems by effectively controlling these properties.

3. The improvement in selectivity and stability in PdZn catalysts for reactions like methanol steam reforming, watergas shift, alkene hydrogenation, and auto-thermal reforming is attributed to both geometric changes (expansion of palladium bond distance) and electronic effects (weakening of the PdCO bond).

4. DFT studies on PdZn alloys reveal that the (111) surface is energetically favorable. The reduction of the Pd d-band valence width, linked to methanol steam reforming performance, is another key electronic effect.

5. The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity in PdZn catalysts is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, indicating that hydrogenolysis requires a specific reactive ensemble.

6. Studies using ZnO as a support or its precursor for alloy formation demonstrate that PdZn intermetallic structures are synthesized with excess zinc rather than in nominal molar ratios.

7. Challenges in forming the PdZn intermetallic structure on silica at high temperatures due to insufficient zinc reduction highlight the importance of reaction conditions in achieving optimal catalyst performance.

8. Neopentane hydrogenolysis and propane dehydrogenation reactions were utilized to assess the impact of zinc on the hydrogenolysis selectivity of Pd.

1. 单原子合金，特别是钯原子嵌入铜表面，通过改变电子性质提高了选择性氢化反应的催化性能。这通过电荷转移和杂化变化实现。合金元素的价带宽度和价轨道大小影响共价轨道之间的重叠，影响催化活性。

2. 设计成功的单原子催化剂（SAA）的关键标准包括优化催化剂的电子和几何特性所需的反应条件。金属属性如价带宽度和键长对确定催化剂的选择性和稳定性至关重要。SAA催化剂可以通过有效控制这些属性来打破缩放规则并提高各种系统的选择性。

3. 在甲醇蒸汽重整、水煤气变换、烯烃氢化和自热重整等反应中，钯锌合金催化剂的改善选择性和稳定性归因于几何变化（钯键距离的扩展）和电子效应（钯CO键强度减弱）。

4. 对钯锌合金的研究显示，（111）表面是能量最有利的。与纯钯相比，钯d带价宽的显著减少，与甲醇蒸汽重整性能的提升有关，这是另一个关键的电子效应。

5. 钯锌合金催化剂中氢解选择性的降低归因于活性钯原子被惰性金属锌隔离，表明氢解需要特定的反应簇。

6. 使用氧化锌作为支持物或其前体作为合金形成来源的研究表明，钯锌间金属结构在过量锌的情况下合成，而不是在接近1:1的摩尔比。

7. 在高温下在硅胶上形成钯锌间金属结构的挑战，由于氧化锌中锌的还原不足，强调了反应条件在实现最佳催化剂性能中的重要性。
