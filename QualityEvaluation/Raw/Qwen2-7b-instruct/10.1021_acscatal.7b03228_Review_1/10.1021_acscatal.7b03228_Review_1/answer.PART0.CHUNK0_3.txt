[1] "Such changes in adsorbate configuration can have profound effects on what reactions may occur."
[2] "By a change in the electronic structure, the binding energy of propene to the surface is weakened, resulting in desorption before further dehydrogenation can occur."
[3] "The activation barrier for CC bond cleavage is higher due to the lack of the appropriate 3-fold hollow sites on the PdZn surface."
[4] "This structural change results in a loss of selectivity from 92% to 21% C2H4 in acetylene semihydrogenation."
[5] "High-temperature reactions (e.g., above the Tamman temperature of the metal) may result in significant metal-metal diffusion leading to aggregation of the guest metal."
[6] "One must avoid reactive environments that can result in segregation of the metal."
[7] "For oxidation reactions, for instance, the host metal probably should be gold, since gold will not form a bulk oxide."
[8] "It should be mentioned that another pathway toward steering both geometry and electronic structure has emerged through coadsorbates that act as structural modifiers."
[9] "In many cases, the presence of the modifier can change the adsorption configuration of the reactant."
[10] "In the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over coated Pt/Al2O3, the use of 3-phenyl-1-propanethiol was found to give over 90% selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol, whereas the analogous phenylbutanethiol and phenylethanethiol modifiers gave less than 80% selectivity."

1. Single-atom alloys, particularly Pd atoms embedded in Cu surfaces, enhance catalytic performance in selective hydrogenation reactions by weakening the binding energy of adsorbates, thus promoting their desorption before further reactions. This perturbs reactivity positively, increasing selectivity. Essential criteria for designing successful SAA catalysts include mild reaction temperatures, avoiding reactive environments that lead to metal segregation, and selecting reactions that benefit from the geometric site created by the SAA. This typically implies using structure-sensitive reactions. The ability to break scaling rules and improve selectivity across various catalyst systems is a key advantage.

2. Criteria for successful SAA catalysts include mild reaction temperatures, avoiding reactive environments that can cause metal segregation, and ensuring the selected reaction can utilize the geometric site created by the SAA. Mild temperatures prevent metal-metal diffusion leading to aggregation, and avoiding reactive environments prevents the metal from migrating to the surface. Selecting structure-sensitive reactions ensures the catalyst's geometric configuration can influence the reaction pathway effectively.

1. 单原子合金，特别是钯原子嵌入铜表面，通过减弱吸附物的结合能，在选择性氢化反应中增强催化性能，促进吸附物在进一步反应前的脱附。这通过扰动反应性来积极地提高选择性。设计成功的SAA催化剂的关键标准包括温和的反应温度、避免可能导致金属分离的反应环境，并选择能够利用SAA所创建的几何位点的结构敏感反应。打破缩放规则并提高各种催化剂系统的选择性是其主要优势。

2. 成功SAA催化剂的标准包括温和的反应温度、避免可能导致金属迁移至表面的活性环境以及选择能够有效利用SAA所创造的几何位点的结构敏感反应。避免高温导致金属间扩散导致聚合，同时避免活性环境中的金属迁移至关重要。选择结构敏感反应确保催化剂的几何配置可以有效地影响反应途径。
